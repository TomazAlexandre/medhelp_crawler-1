            "answer": "Do you also have back issues? How about Diabetes? If you haven't been checked for Diabetes then I would suggest that you get checked because it sounds like that's what it is from. Diabetes will attack your feet if not treated properly and give you that same feeling. It needs to be addressed and not to scare you but you could lose your feet. My grandfather did so have it looked at. I personally have a lot of back problems and my sciatic nerve is damaged so i have pain all the way down my right leg and my foot goes numb sometimes which give that pain and weird tingling effect so could be that too if you have any back issues.",
