    "question": "Abount 2 weeks ago after playing tennis, both of my hands and feet(soles) swelled up and were painful to touch. A week latter, swelling went away but now 1/2 of each of my fingers are pilling and it feels like all of my skin underneath is dead (it's hard to the touch and I have very little to none feeling in them). What is going on with my body? Those are the only symptoms that I have. I went to a doctor but she didn't know. Blood work for diabities came back normal.Thanks, Troy",
