            "answer": "Hi,How are you? The term erectile dysfunction refers to the inability to obtain an adequate erection for satisfactory sexual activity. Erectile dysfunction (ED) has levels to understand the seriousness of this condition, and is referred to as mild, moderate or severe erectile problem. In your case you are able to achieve erection but not able to maintain it until ejaculation. It can be referred as mild form of erectile dysfunction.Erection is achieved by coordination of muscles, nerves, vessels and hormones. Erectile dysfunction can occur with increasing age and also due to diabetes, kidney disease, chronic alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, vascular disease, and neurologic disease. Smoking, being overweight, and avoiding exercise are possible causes of ED. Injury to the penis, spinal cord, prostate, bladder, and pelvis can lead to ED by harming nerves, smooth muscles, arteries, and fibrous tissues of the corpora cavernosa.I think in your case there could be a possibility of injury to the penis causing erectile dysfunction. Physical examination, psychosocial examination, obtaining the level of hormones, nocturnal penile tumescence tests can help in making the diagnosis.Consult your urologist and the discuss the possible options and follow his advise.All the best.",

    "question": "A little less then a week ago, I was with my girlfriend and we were fooling around. She went to the bathroom and i also noticed i really had to urinate and so i went after she finished, but i still had a full erection. I had to force my penis down pretty hard and my urine came out very slow and in spurts and i was still erect. Then my erection went away fairly quickly and when i left the bathroom i was no longer able to get an erection. Since then I have not been able to get a full erection. When i get aroused my penis will grow but will not get hard, and will very quickly go back down.I went to my general doctor yesterday and he said he didnt see anything visual on the outside that would be preventing erections. My question is if anyone could tell me if i did something kind of physical damage and what you would recommend me doing.",
