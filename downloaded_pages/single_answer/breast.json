            "answer": "Hi!Itchy localized rash can be due to allergic dermatitis, eczema, scabies, contact dermatitis, shingles, psoriasis, fungal infection like Tinea or candida. If your doctor has diagnosed fungus, then this needs a long treatment. Many treatment options are there like Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1%, ketoconazole, terfibnafine and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%. Many OTC products containing these salts are available, your pharmacist can help. Try a combination of two and apply until the round marks you see disappear. Continue application for 2 weeks after the marks disappear. The cause for persistence is that the treatment is often left in between. After the itch and dryness goes, you have to continue applying for at least another 2 weeks for the infection to be completely cured from the lower most layer of the skin. Wash your hands well and dry them properly both before and after the application. Meanwhile test for blood sugar level to see if it is high for diabetes too can prevent resolution of fungal infection. Take any anti-allergic tablet or antihistamine to overcome itching.If still the rash persists only a biopsy can really help diagnose the exact nature of the rash. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
