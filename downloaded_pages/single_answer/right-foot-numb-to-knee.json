Nerve involvement may be single (mono-neuropathy) or multiple (poly-neuropathy).Does she have color change at the site of pain on exposure to warm and cold sensations?This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae. You should be doing HbA1C, ESR, serum protein/immuno-electrophoresis, and vitamin B12, BUN, and creatinine levels.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",
