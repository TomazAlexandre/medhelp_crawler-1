    "question": "I had my 28 week dr appointment today! I also did my gestational diabetes test today too! I have a total weight gain of 18-20lbs... not bad for 7 months. I am just hoping not to gain anymore than another 20lbs to keep it as healthy as possible.Belly is measuring 28.5 which is good! I am currently 27 weeks and 5 days! Her heartrate was 150... lol and she was sleeping.I complained about my swollen feet and the doc looked at them, and sure enough they were swollen. Im supposed to stay off my feet and rest on my left side for an hour 3 times a day.I also complained about the pain I have been having in my hands in the middle of the night that is waking me up. They concluded that it is pregnancy induced carpel tunnel syndrome so they wrote me a perscription for hand guards to sleep with;.Other than that, I hurt everywhere... I can't wait to feel normal again.",
