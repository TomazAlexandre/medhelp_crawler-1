            "answer": "Hi,Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved appears to be originating from lower lumbar region.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.Nerve Root Pain - nerve root pinching / irritation / compression / trapping is always associated with signs of nerve dysfunction (not working properly) such as pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness.\u00a0\u00a0In your case it appears to me as compressive pathology or diabetes which is causing the symptoms.You can try a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator, which is an electronic device that produces electrical signals used to stimulate nerves through unbroken skin. The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. TENS works to decrease pain perception and may be used to control acute and chronic pain. It helps in regenerating nerve.Nerves regenerate, or heal, at a rate 1 millimeter/day. The only nerves that can regenerate are the nerves outside of the spinal cord, or peripheral nerves. The nerves in the spinal cord, once damaged, cannot regenerate. Spinal Nerve Root Pain (Radiculopathy) can arise when nerves become pinched or trapped within the bony spinal canal or vertebral column:-L4 to S1 nerves in the neck cause Sciatica in the hips and foot.However, if the peripheral nerve is severely damaged or stretched it may never heal.It will approximately 12 to 24 weeks to regain normal mobility. I think you should be started on with physiotherapy avoid any disuse atrophy.I think you need a complete physical examination from a neurologist to rule out any pathological state.MRI will help in coming closer to diagnosis.Hope this helps.Bye.",

    "question": "A few years ago while my husband and I were hiking I began to feel a weird \"twitching\" sensation just above my left knee.\u00a0\u00a0The feeling was internal and felt as though I had a rubberband inside of my leg and every time I took a step it snapped.\u00a0\u00a0This lasted for several weeks until one day I awoke and noticed that that area of my leg had gone numb to the touch.\u00a0\u00a0Being over 30, on the pill and, at that time a smoker, I immediately called my doctor fearing a blood clot.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't seem to be too concerned, but ordered me to have an ultrasound done on the arteries in my leg.\u00a0\u00a0When I went in I thought it strange because the areas being tested were nowhere near the area of numbness, but figured I wasn't going to question the experts.\u00a0\u00a0The test came back fine and my Dr. told me that I had nothing to worry about, it was probably just a nerve that had moved, and not to be concerned until the numbness reached my hip...I thought he was half-joking.Now the numbness has almost reached my hip.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally I cannot stand to have anything touch my leg even in the slightest.\u00a0\u00a0While it is numb on the surface, the pain and tenderness underneath is constant and excruciating.I have not yet discussed this with my Dr. ( I no longer have the same Dr. as I moved out of state) because I am presently undergoing tests for severe pain in my hip joints and am also in the midst of fertility testing so the amount of appointments I have are almost unmanageable.I have had x-rays of the hips and nothing, including arthritis was found.\u00a0\u00a0I then had a cortisone and lidocaine injection which did not help.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently scheduled for an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think the two are related, but am curious to hear your ideas.\u00a0\u00a0I have had the hip pain since I was 17 or so (about 20 years) and it has gotten progressively worse over the years.\u00a0\u00a0It is aggravated by any form of exercise, but it is most extreme during and after I vacuum or mop\u00a0\u00a0and after swimming the breaststroke.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is sometimes so severe that it wakes me up in the middle of the night.Please let me know your ideas.",
