            "answer": "First of all, congratulations! I also had slight spotting and cramps when I was pregnant. My Dr. said that its normal but unfortunately I misscarried at 12 weeks (the baby stopped growing at 8 wk and 6 days) and i\u00a0\u00a0just had a d and c. I wish I had been more careful. The slight spotting/cramps here and there lasted up to 8 weeks, at 8 week US the baby was fine, then after 6 days later the baby passed away and I had no idea, no s/s of miscarriage. I wished now that I was more careful, I danced, i worked which for me required 12 hour days on my feet sometimes skipping meals, work in a very high stress level position, i took medicine they asked me to-sythroid, I walked because they told me to be more physically active to prevent hight blood pressure and diabetes. I stopped walking usually after 1 mile when I got cramps, I wish i had not done any of these things. I wished I just rested and maybe my baby might still be here today.\u00a0\u00a0Please take care of yourself, don't physically or emotionally stress yourself out in any way. It's better to be safe than sorry.",
