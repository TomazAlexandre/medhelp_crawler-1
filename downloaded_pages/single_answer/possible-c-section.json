What I'm saying is that they can be spot on for some people, but more often than not they're off a pound or so either way. As for having him early, well...my son is still in the nicu and he's a week old.",

    "question": "So i had an appointment on Wednesday. I had a Sonogram done and my son is already 5lbs and is measuring at 34 weeks and i had just turned 32 weeks that day. The sonographer said some babies are just born big but if he keeps growing i would have to have a cesarean done (which ill be devasted about). She also asked me if i passed my glucose test and i told her that i did. So im back at the doctors today bc she wants me to redo my glucose testing to make sure i don't have gestational diabetes bc a sign is a larger baby. I really don't wasn't a c section, i feel like it takes away from the whole birthing experience. But at the same time i don't want a hugeee baby either. If hes weighing in 2 weeks ahead, i hope he comes a few weeks early *sigh*",
