            "answer": "Hi,Many of your symptoms are not very specific to diabetes--they could be from other causes including the weight gain itself, a thyroid problem or diabetes or pre-diabetes. I suggest speaking with your doctor and arranging for a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test, as well as thyroid function tests as a good start. Regardless of the results you should proceed with your plans for changes in your diet\u00a0\u00a0to help lose the weight.It will benefit you either way.Take care.",

    "question": "I am a mid-20s female.\u00a0\u00a0I have gained about 15+ lbs. over the past year and a half and am concerned that, as a result, I might be at risk for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I might be paranoid, and understand that any real concerns warrant a visit to the doctor's office, but any advice would be much appreciated.I am 5ft2in and usually weigh 130ish lbs, but am currently at about 150 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I am pretty active (I work out 3-5 times a week, cardio and weights, and I ran a marathon last summer).\u00a0\u00a0 Activity is clearly not my problem, but as I was working 2 jobs last year I got in a binge-eating habit and, hence, the weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0My diet is generally heathly (little meat intake, but sometimes too much sugar)...it's more the quantity of food that concerns me.\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to lose the weight, but based on research of diabetes symptoms, I have become concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Since I gained weight, I do notice more frequent urination, an ability to eat more without feeling sick, and generally I am more fatigued than I remember to have been previously.Should I be worried or will a committment to lose the weight alleviate these issues?Thank you!!!",
