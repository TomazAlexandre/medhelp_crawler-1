            "answer": "Dear MichelleT257,Without a complete eye examination it is difficult to assess.\u00a0\u00a0A large change in the prescription in the nearsighted direction may result from a real refractive error of the eye, straining after reading, or medical conditions such as diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend that you seek the care of an eyeMD for a second opinion to get your questions answered or communicate your concerns with your doctor.Dr. FeldmanSandy T.

    "question": "My son had to start wearing glasses on Saturday.\u00a0\u00a0We took him to the eye doctor because he said he couldn't read the board at all when he went back to school after the holidays, even though (he says) he did not have any problem at all reading them before the holiday break (from the same seats).\u00a0\u00a0And we had his eyes examined in August by the same doctor (we're fortunate to have insurance that covers such things, and I make sure to use the benefits), and he said my son's vision was \"great\" then.\u00a0\u00a0When I questioned how my sons vision could go from great to needing to wear glasses all the time (well, except for reading, etc.), he said, it happens sometimes, nothing to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0And since neither my husband or I wear glasses, what do we know to question him.\u00a0\u00a0But it just doesn't sound right to me, and, though my son said he could now see the board again (with his glasses) just like before the holidays, it bugs me - so I thought I'd ask some other people that might know if this sounds right to them.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
