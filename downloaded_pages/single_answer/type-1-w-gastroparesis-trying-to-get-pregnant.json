    "question": "My 30 year old daughter has had Type I Diabetes since she was 7.\u00a0\u00a0She has had so many health issues but until she got married and wanted to start a family, she was able to deal through most of it a day at a time.\u00a0\u00a0With the onset of gastroparesis, she has now been told she has to choose between the gastro issue and having a baby.\u00a0\u00a0As those of you with diabetic children can attest, you have already seen them have to deal with health issues and scenarios that would nobody should have to deal with.\u00a0\u00a0The diabetes is a terrible enough disease that causes so very many problems.\u00a0\u00a0But to have your dream of having children dashed is a pretty tough consequence to hear.\u00a0\u00a0Does anybody have anything similar that might give us some hope or have places online or medical sources that we can look into.\u00a0\u00a0When I talked to her just now after the doctor's appointment, she was just short of hysterical.\u00a0\u00a0As a mom, I'm not even sure what to say to her.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like there's knife in my heart too.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for reading my post.",
