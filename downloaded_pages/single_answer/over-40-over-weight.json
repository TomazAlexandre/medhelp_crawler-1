I have hypothyroidism, was pre-diabetic and had high cholesterol... I still have hypothyroidism that I take medication for, but I've reversed my pre-diabetes and brought my cholesterol levels back to normal and gotten off one of my blood pressure meds.Since you rarely eat bread, now, you have that battle won, already.",
