            "answer": "I am not a physician but the mom of a type one diabetic. I am not sure as to why ketones were present as they are a result of the body using fat instead of sugar. I would suggest talking to your OB about the possibility of you having gestational diabetes.This could also be the reason that the baby is big for his/ her development. I would also suggest drinking plenty of water to help flush the ketones.I would suggest eating a balanced lowed carb diet till you speak with your doctor,Hope this helps. Please check back and let us know how it goes",

    "question": "Dear all,I am 22 weeks pregnant and over the weekend I went to the hospital where I was diagnostic with kidney infecction, nothing to worry about really.The doctor mentioned the baby is quite big for his/her development stage but I have been told that previously at the scan where they find everything on order. I was 12 pounds when I born...The Dr. found keytones in my urine sample and enquired about my diet, that it is quite balanced, I think, even if maybe not eating as much as I should be?. She mentioned that the result may be link to the infection and told me not to worry but after reading some of the documents in your site I am extremelly worried and would liek to know if there is any explanation before seing my doctor later on this week.Your answers will be really apprecited.Kindest regards,Maz",
