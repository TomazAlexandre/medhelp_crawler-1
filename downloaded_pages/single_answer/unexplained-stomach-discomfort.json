            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well chronic constipation can cause pain in sides of abdomen and under the ribs and also could be a symptom of IBS.Chronic constipation can also be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber, dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
