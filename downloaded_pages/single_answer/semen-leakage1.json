            "answer": "Hi there!Ejaculatory and erectile dysfunction can develop due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in adolescents in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors with your partner. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, I would suggest seeing a urologist for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "every time I start to get erection I get leakage and loose my erection. After urinating semen will leak out. I do not know for sure if its semen or something else its clear, no odor, and slippery. Today i went to urinate and a few minutes after I started to have leakage and it came out for a short while. I have gone to family doctor and several urologists and they cannot explain. Since I was getting a weak erection and then loosing it because of this all I got was pills for erection. When that did not work they gave me a prescription for shots that did not help. Help is needed.",
