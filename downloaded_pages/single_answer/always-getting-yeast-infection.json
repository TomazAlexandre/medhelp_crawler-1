Many women get either a yeast infections or more commonly they get what\u2019s known as bacterial vaginosis, you should know which one you have first of all, just in case!What increases your risk for a vaginal yeast infection? First of all, vaginal yeast infections are not transmitted sexually, so you can safely rule that out, even though, to you that seems like the only major thing that has changed, it is most likely that there are other factors involved. It is possible that your husband has a yeast infection, but after having unprotected sex with your husband who has a yeast infection (he should find out for his own well being just in case), it is possible that you could have more than the normal amount of yeast in your vagina, but if after intercourse you start to get symptoms of a yeast infection, it is most likely there is something else going on with you.Do you use antibiotics? Antibiotic medicine will definitely compromise the healthy balance of yeast and bacteria in the vagina. Not only that, but antibiotics are not friendly to the good bacteria in your vagina, indeed allowing yeast to grow in the vagina, sometimes causing symptoms of a yeast infection.Assuming you don\u2019t have HIV or AIDS but have you been tested for diabetes? Poorly controlled diabetes can definitely cause problems down below. There is also a possibility you are pregnant. The hormonal flux that occurs during pregnancy can cause a temporary weakening of your immune system allowing vaginal yeast infections of occur.Of course it doesn\u2019t bode well for high fashion girls, but unfortunately, wearing they type of clothing that won\u2019t allow for body heat to dissipate can cause a yeast infection too.

It is also advisable to not use any product in the vaginal area that has perfumes in it, even talcum or baby powder could be a problem and maybe change your laundry detergent to something that is dye/chemical/perfume free. There are organic brands you can try at your local health food store.It seems obvious, but you should go to a doctor and figure out exactly what you have just in case. A visit to your gyno doc could solve all of the mystery for you instead of having to try and figure it out on your own. If you have been to a doctor and they have confirmed you indeed are experiencing a yeast infection there are several things you can do to remedy the problem, although not all of them are equally effective.First of all, it is also going to be important to figure out exactly what kind of yeast infection you have as treatment will vary. For instance, Azoles treat C. albicans, but antifungal treatments take care of Candida species of yeast.If you want to treat a yeast infection you will need to essentially kill the fungi with antifungal medications as discussed above, which can be purchased by prescription or over-the-counter (OTC). Vaginal yeast infections happen because there is an overgrowth of the fungus Candida albicans, and less frequently other Candidaspecies.Though people report positive results from home remedies, the majority of natural remedies for yeast infections have not undergone any clinical studies. Furthermore, the effectiveness of prescription and OTC medications for yeast infections, should convince most women to go with those, but some people still want to try their luck with natural remedies. For yeast infections, there are a handful of natural and home remedies:Boric acid: You can use boric acid suppository capsules as they are good at treating yeast infections, in particular those that have been caused by non-albicans species of yeast, but unfortunately boric acid can create an unsavory and painful vaginal burning, it should never be swallowed as it is highly toxic and therefore should not be used all the time and definitely should not be used if you are pregnant.Garlic: Since garlic has antifungal properties some women have found anecdotal luck with putting garlic cloves in their vaginas at night. There has not been any scientific studies on it, but there is at least no evidence to show this home remedy is harmful in anyway.Tea Tree Oil: In order to get rid of a yeast infection, women have had success in applying a watered down tea tree oil to their vagina using an applicator-type tampon. There has yet to be any trials on humans.I won\u2019t mention yogurt as you don\u2019t want to try it. You can find many home remedies for yeast infections online, some women have reported success using coconut oil, some like pomegranate gel, and there is talk that echinacea purpurea liquid is also effective. While natural remedies are great, it's best to check with your doctor to make sure nothing else is going on with you just in case. Also, you may want to try more than one type of remedy at various times. Whatever you do, do not douche! Douching can cause vaginal yeast infections to get worse and more frequent, especially bad is douching with vinegar b/c that kills all the helpful bacteria in your vagina and just lets the bad bacteria run rampant.",

    "question": "I had never had sex until a year ago with my now husband. Ever since then I've constantly had recurring yeast infections.
