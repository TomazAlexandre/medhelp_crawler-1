            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.There can be many reasons for your symptoms and exact cause can be identified only after clinical exam and tests.It is important to rule out allergies, peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes and Vitamin deficiencies, stress, anxiety, and fibromyalgia.I would suggest you to do some self relaxation exercises every day and take OTC B complex supplements. In the meantime schedule an appointment with your physician.",

    "question": "For the last 2 weeks I have been suffering from pin *****, itchy and burning sensations all over my body, including head, face, ears.. These sensations are non stop, but seem worse at night time. Other symptoms include feet and hands feeling hot and cold and belching more than normal. I would be lucky to sleep 1-2 hours per night and I am starting to feel very depressed.",
