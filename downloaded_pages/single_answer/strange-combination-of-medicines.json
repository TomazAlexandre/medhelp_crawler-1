            "answer": "Often times elderly people with heart problems are placed on what seems like a lot of similar heart medications at the same time. This is done regularly in clinical practice as each heart medication affects the heart and blood pressure in a different way. My concern is that your grandmother is not feeling ok. That is not the purpose of all these medications. Although all these medications have a general side effect of lowering blood pressure, sometimes too much, if they're making your grandmother not feel well something needs to be changed. If possible, I would talk to your grandmother and ask her questions about how exactly she is not feeling well and perhaps persuade her to go to the doctor-medication related or not. If she states that she is feeling fine, I suggest leaving it at that as unfortunately you are powerless over her, and as hard as it may be to see her not doing so well, it is her own decision and choice. I wish both you and your grandmother the best of luck.Sara RN",
