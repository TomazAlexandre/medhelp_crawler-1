    "question": "I have been having a lot of medical problems lately with an equal amount of testing to try to find the cause.\u00a0\u00a0They may have found the cause yesterday but it has left me with more questions then answers.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor ordered a three hour glucose test for me and called me with the results a few hours ago.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting sugar was 79 but I dropped to 50 after drinking the glucose.\u00a0\u00a0She said there is nothing that can really be done about it except to change my diet.\u00a0\u00a0I told her what I generally eat and she said that is eating right, but that I need to eat more often, which I really have been trying to do.\u00a0\u00a0However, if I am eating right and am eating more (a small meal/snack every 4 hours now) then how can there be nothing else to do?\u00a0\u00a0My line of thinking says this:\u00a0\u00a0there is obviously something not working right in my body, how do we fix it?\u00a0\u00a0If after I eat a meal, my body 'crashes' so to speak, doesn't that point to a problem?I have been monitoring my blood sugar levels leading up to the test, per her instructions.\u00a0\u00a0What would happen would be that my blood levels would be something like 87 before a meal, 92 an hour after the meal and 80 2 hours after the meal.\u00a0\u00a0REGARDLESS of what the meal was.\u00a0\u00a0I drop if I eat a baked potato and steak OR if I eat a chicken breast salad.....\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts?\u00a0\u00a0Because I can't imagine this is just something I have to live with\u00a0\u00a0:(",
