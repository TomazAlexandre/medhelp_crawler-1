    "question": "Hi, I am 37 and recently started a workout routine with a personal trainer, using weights and a variety of resistance machines. Over the past 2 weeks, I have been suffering headaches, usually lasting several hours in duration, post exercise. Recently (last 2 workouts), the headache has started abruptly DURING the workout. My last workout, during the leg extensions, I felt this monstrous, debilitating, pulsating pain bilaterally accompanied with lightheadedness and nausea. It took several minutes before it subsided enough to function. I managed to complete the workout, but I felt absolutely wretched the entire day and had a very poor sleep that night. I have reveiwed some of the advice online, and lowering the weight has helped, along with NSAIDs, however I wonder is this a permanent condition, or will it subside, and possibly disappear completely? Any advice is welcome, thank you.",
