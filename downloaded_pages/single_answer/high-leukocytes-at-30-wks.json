    "question": "Hello Ladies,I am now 30 wks and had my blood work done for gestational diabetes as well as regular check up. For some reason my leukocytes count was higher than normal. My OBGYN asked me if I feel sick or have any other symptoms. I feel totally Ok. Any advice or suggestions on my case. May be I am developing some internal infection or inflammation or can anything be wrong with the baby?Thank you to all of you and good luck with your pregnancies. Lilia",
