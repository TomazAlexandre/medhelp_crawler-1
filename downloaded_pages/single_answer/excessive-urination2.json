    "question": "2 kitty litter boxes for one cat - completely cleaned and filled both boxes with fresh litter 4 days ago - they are now completely saturated with liquid - the entire box is wet and looks like someone poured a gallon of water into it.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't smell like urine - stinks more and no amonia smell.\u00a0\u00a0This started about 2 weeks ago and the amount of liquid is unbelievable. I have used the same kitty litter for years and I have been able to clean weekly by just removing a small portion of the litter.\u00a0\u00a0Now I have to dump the entire box and wash and fill with fresh litter about every 4 days. The cat is acting normal, eating normally and doesn't appear to be in any distress of pain. What could cause such a drastic increase in liquid output?",
