            "answer": "Hi,Your father does \"feel\" the heat however, the usually physiologic response to heat exposure (sweating) often does not occur in elderly individuals as it does in younger individuals. Sweating allows our bodies to release heat and cool ourselves. So, your father may not be able to adapt to a hot environment as well as you or your husband.It is important to have your father stay hydrated.Does your father have chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart failure, etc? Does he take medications such as diuretics?Hydration and fluid intake recommendations will depend on your answers to the above questions?~\u2022~ Dr. ParksThis answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice.

    "question": "My spouse and I have recently moved in with my elderly father in his late eighties. The summer heat has been reaching 100 degrees these days with the indoor temperature reaching the high eighties to 90 degrees at times. The heat is unbearable at times but my elderly father actually says he doesn't feel it. I have heard of the elderly dying in high heat areas but I thought it was because they didn't have air conditioning. My father has air conditioning but doesn't understand our discomfort. QUESTION(S);Could he be not actually feeling the heat?Is this something that is common in the elderly?andIs there a danger here?",
