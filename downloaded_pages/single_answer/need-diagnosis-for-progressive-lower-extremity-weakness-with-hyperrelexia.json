    "question": "I am a healthy 58 y/o female, G0, no significant injuries, no surgeries, no chronic illness. FH of diabetes. BMI 21 with active lifestyle (work 50 hrs a week as NP, have an MR client living with me at home, have horses, dogs, farm and garden. Meds: Wellbutrin XL300 mg daily, flexeril 10 mg q HS, naproxyn or ibuprofen sporadically. Vitamins and supplements sporadically. Non meat eater. Moderate exercise and work entire life. Never smoked, ETOH 1-2 glasses of wine a week.For the past 5 months I have noticed increasing lower extremity weakness (Right greater than Left) with knees buckling with no warning and falls. Gait has now deteriorated and I have foot drop and hip flexor weakness. I cannot run or perform RAM. I have been seen by neurology and rheumatology as well as primary care and PT. All labs have been normal: CBC, CMP, Mag, TSH, ESR, CPK, Lyme ELISA and WESTERN BLOT both negative. LDH, aldolase, ACE level, ANCA, ENA panel, Profile 3 WNL. Several anti acetylcholine antibody and MusK tests all negative.Muscle biopsy from quadriceps showed \"only abnormal finding is type 2 atrophy. This is seen in patients who are immobile, treated with chronic steroids and certain CT disorders. Nerve conduction and EMG \u201cunremarkable study with normal proximal conduction velocity of peroneal nerve - no evidence of significant myopathic discharges on needle exam.\u201d I could walk normally until the last 2 months. I have no UE or bulbar symptoms.I am seeking the next step in attempting diagnosis. I am, of course, incredibly anxious to learn what is wrong to potentially improve my condition. The weakness has gotten much worse in two months, so I fear I don't have much time to pursue this. Any suggestion of further investigation would be welcome.",
