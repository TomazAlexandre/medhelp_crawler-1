            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Well, your doctor could be right. Get a bone density analysis to see if the low vitamin D has caused bone weakness or not. Severe anemia too cam cause such widespread bone pain.The symptoms can also be due to pinched nerves caused by bulging discs, fibromyalgia, electrolyte imbalance, hormonal imbalance, Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. Autoimmune disease is another possibility.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Vitamin D/Calcium deficiency 2 months ago and after taking supplements both are within normal range now. However i continue to have a back pain, especially near the neck and in my lower spine. This pain is followed by pain/tingling sensations/twitching of the muscles in arm/legs/foot. My GP says this could be related to osteomalacia, where the bones got thinned due to earlier Vitamin D deficiency.But what is worse, i also feel pain in my jaws, eyes and sometimes even in my nose. This makes me think there is something more fundamentally wrong (MS or Rheumatoid Arthritis). I am a 35 year old male, lean build, no smoking/no alcohol.Could someone advise if there is a statistically significant chance that a back pain / radiculopathy (cervical/lumbar) could anyway cause pain in the nerves related to eye/jaw/nose? If not, then i would have to digest the (bad) news that i am going through some autoimmune disease.",
