            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You will be surprised to know that stomach ulcers and severe acidity can result in hunger pangs. Even GERD presents with similar symptoms. At times the hunger pangs due to acidity wakes up a person in the wee hours of night. Omeprazole is a good drug to combat this. Along with it you can try over the counter antacids. However I would recommend you see a doctor and take medication under a doctor\u2019s supervision. Avoid heavy meals and take frequent small ones. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Avoid lying down for least 2 hours after food. Take a late night snack and keep lozenges or crackers beside to bed to be eaten when the\u00a0\u00a0pain starts.If you are on contraceptive depot shot or pills then this can cause acidity and make you feel as though you are hungry due to lot of acid. The other possibility is diabetes (ruled out), hyperthyroid states and worms in the gut. All can keep you hungry 24x7. Though a rare disorder, pancreatic insulinomas should also be thought of in your case and have someone check your blood sugar while you have an anxiety *** hunger attack. The hypoglycemia in this is transient and there is a quick increase in blood glucose once you eat.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello, I'm a 22 year old female (about 5'7, 129 pounds) who is having trouble getting diagnosed. I'm practically bedridden with shakyness/shortness of breath/fast heart rate/ weakness, as well as a constant appetite and must eat every 2 hours otherwise the above symptoms intensify. Even though I've been eating so frequently (and not able to move around much), I still feel unbearably hungry and I have been losing weight. Since this illness has started I was about 146 pounds (almost two months ago) and now I'm at 129. I'm also always thirsty and have had episodes of what seems to be kidney/lower back pain. This pain reduced when I switched to eating a lower carb/high protein diet, which I only did when I found that eating breads, sugary fruits intensified my shortness of breath/shakyness. Finally I have also had episodes of numbness and tingling in my arms and legs that come and go in various intensity.My family thought diabetes seemed possible and I was taken to an endocrinologist, who checked my fasting blood glucose and my H1AC (glycated hemoglobin). The results were 82, and 5.5 respectively. She stated these figures were perfectly normal and had no further questions. This left me and my family confused as to where to go from here. She also checked my thyroid function (complete panel) and my adrenal function (ACTH stim test) and stated those figures were normal too.I've also had my blood sugar checked randomly at home with a blood glucose meter and it's always been in the 80's, taken at random intervals.Does anyone have any suggestions as to what it could be? Could my diet be skewing results? Are there other diseases or disorders that have similar symptoms?Thanks in advance for any advice",
