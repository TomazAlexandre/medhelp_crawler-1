            "answer": "This is a question for your Dr.\u00a0\u00a0Or can you ask a pharmacist?IF you do take it tonight after taking it this morning, you may be stacking the dose, as Lantus is active for 20 - 24 hours.An alternative, may be to not take it tonight, as your current dose lasts until tomorrow morning anyway, but to use your fast acting insulin during the day tomorrow for corrections if you are higher than normal (I assume you are familiar with using your Humalog for correction of high blood sugars), and then start taking the night time dose tomorrow night following your Drs instruction.Please do check with your Dr, a pharmacist, or your diabetes educator on this question.",
