            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Sperms in urine can be due to retrograde ejaculation. If the cause of retrograde ejaculation is any medicine, then stopping the medicine will cure it. If the cause is neuropathy due to diabetes affecting the bladder neck muscles then also it can be cured by certain medications and by keeping diabetes under control.The most common cause of blood in urine is UTI. The next possible diagnosis is stone. The stone can be anywhere in the urinary system from kidney to urethra. Cancers of urinary system or some drugs too cause blood in urine. Bladder infections and cysts too can cause similar symptoms. Your urologist will run a couple of tests including urine examination, a CT/ultrasound of abdomen to rule out stones and other causes.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
