            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Actually a subcutaneous skin nodule\u2014the size of a pea and firm, is usually due to a neurofibroma (connective ad nerve tissue), a ganglion cyst or a lymph node. Tick bite is one possibility and if you live in an area prone for tick bites, then Lyme's disease should be ruled out by appropriate tests. Pseudolymphoma is another possibility which causes persistent inflammatory nodules. The good thing is that they are usually without symptoms and disappear on their own by 8-9 months. These can be due to calcinosis or calcium deposits you have received calcium supplements in the past. An autoimmune condition called granuloma annulare is another possibility and hence immunoglobulins and other tests for autoimmune disorders of which rheumatoid arthritis too is one should be looked into. Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, pseudorheumatoid disease, foreign body granulomas, leprosies, leishmaniasis (parasitic disease caused by bite of sand fly), lupus, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and deep fungal infections should also be looked into.You may not be having any of these and it could just be a neurofibroma or a cyst or lymphnode. However, please confirm with a doctor who can examine you. Take care!",
