            "answer": "Hi!Rash on the outer side of vagina can be due to fungal infection, dermatitis, reaction to tampons or pads or any items of personal care. It is difficult to comment for sure without examination. You can consult a gynecologist and get this examined. Check and see if you can identify any personal care items that could be causing the rash. If yes, stop using them. If you have a family history of diabetes, get this investigated. Since you have a history of sexual contact, get a STD panel done. Herpes can cause a rash to appear after a few days.Take care!",
