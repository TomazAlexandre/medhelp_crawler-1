            "answer": "Yes, you could have PCOS.Here is some general information from my website:PCOS can affect 5% of all women and common symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, increased growth of hair on the body, loss of hair on the head, acne, and weight gain. Based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM sponsored Consensus Workshop Group, PCOS is diagnosed in women who meet two of the three following criteria: ovarian dysfunction (not ovulating regularly), hyperandrogenism (increased male type hormones on lab testing or clinically increased hair growth), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries which show multiple small cysts on ultrasound). PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose tolerance test.Even when you lose weight the period still could continue to be abnormal, if you are not ovulating regularly. To determine if you have an ovarian cyst or fibroid, an ulttrasound of your uterus and ovaries can be done.I think seeing a specialist called a Reproductive Endocrinologist is the best doctor to go to but if you can find a gynecologist who is understanding and willing to do a work up, that would be fine.You will need to see me to get herbal advice. I do not give herbal advice by internet because you will need a complete work up, history, and examination first. I do not suggest just taking herbs by yourself as you can do more harm than good.",

    "question": "Hello, I'm 24 years old for some years my cycle has been completely irregular since I got my first period.I used to be very over weight and was never diagnosed with a thyroid problem but I've had to deal with excess hair on my face and chest. I thought maybe my weight was causing my hormones to be outta wack and therefore causing my menses to be irregular. I have since lost the weight but the irregularity didn't really stop.My cycles started to be pretty stable at the beginning of this year up until the beginning of this month. It came a week early lasted 5 days, stopped for about a 2 days then came back, but it was very thin and bright red and somewhat heavy, I had to change my tampon every 1-2 hours (never ever happened before). This lasted for 2 weeks and has finally stopped. Should I be concerned even though it has ended? Am I showing symptoms of a possible cyst, fibroid, or PCOS? If so, what should I do, I have no insurance, and I have NEVER been to a gynecologist.(don't know if it matters but, I am still a virgin) Sorry for the long email but I really wanted to be thorough and clear on my history and symptoms.Thanks so much,Nikkips, I've also noticed and increase in my monthly symptoms that I didn't have early on. Back aches, extreme almost unbearable cramps, diarrhea, head aches, bloating, now nausea and light headed. Herbal advice would also be greatly appreciated.",
