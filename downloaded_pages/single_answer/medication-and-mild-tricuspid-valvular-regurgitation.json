            "answer": "Is your AFib permanent, or rare/intermittent?\u00a0\u00a0If the latter a simple aspirin may be an alternative to coumadin - but if the AFib is there all or frequently a blood anticoagulant such as coumadin may be necessary.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had a problem with taking coumadin, of course while running some risk of bleeding. I was able to jog for exercise up to age 67 and was on coumadin for years by that time (I take the generic warfarin).I'm not sue what the Carvedilol is, but assume it is a beta blocker.\u00a0\u00a0Some of us are lucky and are converted out of AFib by taking a BB.\u00a0\u00a0It is worth a try in my \"book\".Many, maybe most of us over 60, have some heart valve regurgitation (leakage) but if it doesn't cause heart artium enlargement and we are not short of breath, then we can just live with it I think.I could be worth you time and money to discuss you goals with your current doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He may agree on taking an aspirin rather than coumadin.",
