            "answer": "You don't have to worry about any STDs, (coldsores/HSV is not transmitted through blood)Although HIV may be a risk, chances are very slim... if there was blood on the needle it was prob. dry and HIV doesn't survive well outside the body. IF you have any concern then a 3 month test would be conclusive.For better advise you should ask those in the HIV forum.",

    "question": "Hi, all,This is quite an unusual question; the basic gist is that I stepped on my roommate's diabetes testing needle last night, and although he quickly reassured me that he's been tested and has nothing, I do know that he gets cold sores around his mouth regularly.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I'm not too certain about his sexual activity and just how promiscuous he might be.\u00a0\u00a0I'd like to find out if it's at all possible to contract any sort of disease in this manner (needle was about 1cm long and the entire thing did pierce and draw blood from my foot).\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping, truly hoping that if he does have any such disease, that it will have died off since it is on the needle itself.Any thoughts on this would be most appreciated.Thank you in advance!",
