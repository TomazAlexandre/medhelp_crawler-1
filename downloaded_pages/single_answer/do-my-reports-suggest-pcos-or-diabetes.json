            "answer": "the lack of your period is simply amenorrhea which could be caused by being overweight, PCOS, diabetes, or a number of other things that I know little of. PCOS would likely be accompanied with hair in places you wouldn't expect a woman to have hair (face, chest, back, stomach), male pattern balding, acne, mood swings, lower sex drive, and a bunch of other symptoms you can find at soulcyster.com or other PCOS websites. Diabetes and obesity can also cause hormonal imbalances that can lead to absence of menstruation. I would recommend asking your Dr. for Metformin in either case as it treats PCOS and diabetes with great success in my experience.",
