            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The redness and soreness in the crease of buttocks above the tailbone could be a pilonidal sinus. It is necessary to keep the area free of hair and infection. If you are a smoker, you need to stop smoking to facilitate healing. Also check if you have diabetes. This could be the cause for low grade infection resulting in recurrence.Alternatively this could be eczema, dermatitis, infection due to stool, or sweat dermatitis. If the loose stools are persisting then the undigested food could be causing the problem. It is difficult to comment without examining the lesion. Please consult your PCP to start with and you may need to consult a skin specialist too.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
