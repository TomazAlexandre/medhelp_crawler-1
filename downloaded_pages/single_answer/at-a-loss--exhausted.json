            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!You could be suffering from migraine. Anemia, thyroid problems and diabetes all cause extreme fatigue. Get investigated for PUO or pyrexia (fever) of unknown origin. This is a complete panel of tests most labs have to look into the various causes of persisting fever.Recurrent or chronic fever is seen in tuberculosis, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and other auto immune disorders, UTI, drug fever, glandular fever, HIV, STDs, endocarditis, parasitic infestations, fungal infections, lymphomas and other cancers etc.If you belong to the fairer sex, then even polycystic ovary, menopause, PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) should be investigated for.Ofcourse, a number of times no diagnosis can be reached and the fever subsides after some time.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I run a low grade fever (about 101*) throughout the day, especially after eating.\u00a0\u00a0This has been going on for a couple of years - back to October 2005.\u00a0\u00a0At one point I was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr Virus and was off work for 6 weeks.I am constantly tired, especially at work.\u00a0\u00a0Any time I get on a phone conversation, I am constantly yawning.\u00a0\u00a0I *think* I'm sleeping well.\u00a0\u00a0I had a sleep study done in 2006 and they found nothing wrong with my sleep patterns / habits.I get the most horrific headaches imaginable.\u00a0\u00a0They're across the back of my head, the base of my skull, and they're like I have iron rods jammed through my skull back there.\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally the pain becomes sharp-shooting in my eye area, alternating eyes.\u00a0\u00a0No medication touches the headaches; I've tried Imitrex, Maxalt and one other.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried anti-inflammatories thinking it was tension related.\u00a0\u00a0No luck.\u00a0\u00a0These headaches are so common that it's surprising when I have a day WITHOUT a headache.I can't seem to find anything in any of the symptom checkers online that covers this specific group of symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0I'm meeting with a new doctor (general practice) next Thursday.",
