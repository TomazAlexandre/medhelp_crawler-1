            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Exercise is a good way of lowering the blood sugar, provided the blood sugar or diabetes is under control and you are exercising properly.\u00a0\u00a0If you have diabetes you should start your exercise program under supervision. Blood glucose can rise most commonly if it is too high when you start exercising or if you exercise very strenuously. In both cases the body is not able to provide enough insulin to metabolize the glucose. When you exercise too much or more than what your body is accustomed to, your body recognizes this as a stress condition. The brain signals the body to increase the blood glucose to supply energy to muscles. However the body is unable to produce enough insulin to combat this.It\u2019s a good thing that you are thinking of exercising. However do this under the supervision of your diabetes specialist and physical trainer.Please discuss this with your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
