    "question": "My son who is 6 1/2 still has this ketonic hypoglycemia. Has since 18mos. His episodes, fortunately, haven't been life threatening. We've been misdiagnosed with GSD but then re-diagnosed with KH. A lot of the specialists we've seen have mentioned a possible link between having this and gestational diabetes. Now, I was found not to have GD when pregnant with my son, but they believe that because of his size at birth, 9lbs 4oz., that I may have developed it after the standard 7mon check. So think back on your pregnancies with your children and is there any possible link for you?",
