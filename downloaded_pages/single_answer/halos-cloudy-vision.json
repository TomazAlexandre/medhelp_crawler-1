    "question": "Hi everyone.Approximately 3-4 weeks ago my eye felt itchy and looked red, the next morning it was a little sticky so I went to the chemist and they gave me antibiotic drops.\u00a0\u00a0I used those briefly and found them hard to put in due to my vision in my left eye being quite poor (has been that way most of my life),Anyhow, it was within 48 hours I think that I noticed when I shut my right eye my vision in my left was cloudy and halos around lights.\u00a0\u00a0The next day and the days that have followed that it has been cloudy/foggy in a morning and usually clears at somepoint.I went and had a full eye examination with the optician the other day and she said my eyes look fine but has referred me back to my doctor as she would like to know what this is.\u00a0\u00a0I recently had a blood test with him (my hair is thinning and he wanted to find out why) and my cholesterol is low, thyroid is fine, blood count fine, sugar - fine, no diabetes and whatever else he checked was fine.I have no pain, I felt a little tackyness sometimes which may be dry eye.\u00a0\u00a0She said that an eye infection or dry eye would not cause cloudyness.The one thing that bothered me a hell of a lot and im sure she was just thinking out loud and said it probably isnt but she said the words BLOCKED ARTERY in back of eye or something and that has just been whirling around in my head but like I said, I think she was just thinking out loud and im sure if she throught that she would have sent me straight to hospital, although im panicking anyway.I told her that im on hols nxt wk and she said if I couldnt see the doctor that if my vision changes even more to just go to the nearest hospital :(Just to add im 29 years old, have a lazy left eye (the one with the probs), very bad vision in it to which when both eyes are open my brain shuts that one off and i use the right (thats the way the optician told me).",
