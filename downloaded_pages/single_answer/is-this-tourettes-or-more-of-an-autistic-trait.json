            "answer": "Missy, Autism is a social disorder so if the child has a normal social friendships I would say that it is not autism.\u00a0\u00a0I don't really have any experience with tourettes but it does seem like she may have something similar.\u00a0\u00a0I think that it is important to tell your daughter that this friend may have some type of disability and it is something that she cannot help.\u00a0\u00a0She needs understanding, not fear.\u00a0\u00a0This may be how this child deals with stress and processes information.\u00a0\u00a0Since I have a severely autistic child I applaud parents who teach their children that people who are different need understanding and acceptance.\u00a0\u00a0They did not choose to be different, it is no different than someone who has cancer or diabetes but for some reason mental issues are considered scarier than other problems.Thanks for caring enough to ask.\u00a0\u00a0Dawn - Paul's Mom",

    "question": "My daughter has a friend who is constantly twirling her hair and carrying on a conversation with herself with a very rapid speech. You can't understand what she is saying but her hands are constantly twirling around her face and the top of her head.\u00a0\u00a0I guess in the public school system, you tend to see a lot of issues.\u00a0\u00a0When reading a poem outloud, her voice changes and her rate of speed does as well.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is asking me what it is, b/c they are at an age where they notice the behavior of this child and I have no clue what to tell her.\u00a0\u00a0It is a behavior that she can't control and that is obvious.\u00a0\u00a0She has normal social friendships and appears very bright.",
