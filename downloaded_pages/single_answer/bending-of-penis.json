            "answer": "Hi,You\u2019re suffering from erectile dysfunction and for the same you need an evaluation to look for an underlying cause of the same and thus will suggest you to consult a physician. Some common diseases which can cause the same are diabetes, hypertension & neurological problems. But one of the commonest is the psychological erectile dysfunction. There are drugs like Viagra which can help in improving the chances of having an erection & sustaining it but it should be taken after medical consultation only. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
