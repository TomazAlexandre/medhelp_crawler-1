            "answer": "What medication was she on and did you look up possible side effects?If not having been done, your Vet should be doing blood work to check kudney and liver function, especially on a dog of that age.\u00a0\u00a0Might not be a bad idea to check Thyroid T3 and T4.\u00a0\u00a0Possible kidney problems could be causing these issues. Drinking a lot coukd be a symptom of kidney problems. Is she on other meds?Yes, she could be experiencing some canine dementia issues.Can you tell if she is having any vision issues?Sorry, not sure what is going on for sure but I would get those tests done.\u00a0\u00a0I would feed a low sodium diet.\u00a0\u00a0Are you supplementing for the hip dysplasia?Hope you can get some answers.Please come back and update.",

    "question": "I was wondering if you could help me I have a female 10 year old German Shepherd called Shellie. About a month ago she had an infection & was on tablets to clear it up, during this time she started to develop behavioural changes like being scared of some people she knows & not going near then, urinating in the house (she never did this before), sleeping more, eating & drinking a lot. Even though the infection has gone these behavioural changes are still there & the vet can't explain it. She is really not herself & I was wondering if she could be developing signs of dementia & if there is any way I can test if she has it. She already has a lot of health problem, kidney failure, hip displaysia, back problems, she frequently gets ear infections. She has regular urine tests but these have all come back as normal as can be with her kidney problems. She has been tested for diabetes but has come back negative.Do you have any ideas as to what is wrong with her? Thank you.",
