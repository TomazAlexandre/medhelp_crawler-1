            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since you pass urine a lot and feeling very tired, diabetes and subclinical urinary tract infection should be ruled out. Other possibilities are hypothyroidism, anemia, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, poor sleep patterns, inadequate sleep, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been feeling constantly tired for the last month or so. I can't seem to feel energized!! I've changed my diet to eat better, with no luck. I take multi-vitamins, but it hasn't helped. I get enough sleep most nights, too. I also have to pee a lot, which has been going on for a number of months, but the tiredness is more of a new symptom. Any ideas as to what may be wrong with me???",
