            "answer": "Personally i would just be very cautious with this until you are converted.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously when indulging in this activity your heart rate can and usually will go up and as you have an issue with atrial fibrillation you really don't want to irritate the situation any more than it is until you get a handle on this.\u00a0\u00a0I am just wondering...have you spoken to your heart doctor to see if you are a candidate for an ablation?\u00a0\u00a0I had a super severe case of it myself and actually today is my 4 year anniversary after having it done.\u00a0\u00a0In this day and age there is no reason for people to have to stay on meds or get converted with ablations out there.\u00a0\u00a0They were actually developed years ago just for this purpose and trust me they are no brainers and not invasive.\u00a0\u00a0I got my life handed back to me on a golden platter after having it done.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to log onto the Medhelp Heart Rhythm community with any questions that you may have because that forum deals w. atrial fib and is super active...you are so young and to have been going thru this since your early 30's to me is amazing that the heart doc hasn't sent you in for an EP Study or ablation...just a thought",

    "question": "I am a 40 yr old male who has stopped smoking but has diabetes and am about to have a Cardioversion. I have had Atrial Fibulation for about 8 years now; my recent Cardiologist has suggested i have a Cardioversion. He has told me that my heart is beating fast and therefore is not pumping blood properly. I am also taking meds to prevent strokes, and other heart issues; do i have to restrain from having sex at anytime during any of this?",
