            "answer": "Hi,This could be folliculitis. In most individuals there are outbreaks of folliculitis from time to time.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Patients with chronic unresponsive folliculitis may require investigation into the source of the infection. S. aureus bacteria can live in the patient's nostrils, periodically triggering a folliculitis outbreak.Individuals who are predisposed to folliculitis should be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months.Let us know if you need any other information and consult a skin specialist if the lesion is persistent.Regards.",

    "question": "Hello,My husband frequently has a rash with small pimples flare up on the left side of his lower cheek. It seems it may be worse when he shaves as he has very sensitive skin, but it also flares up when he doesn't shave. He has tried everything from shaving with aloe to using creams. He does not have peffectly pimple free skin but this area is always worse than the rest of his face. We both use good products on our face but this pimple rash won't seem to dissapate. Is there anything you can suggest to help clear it up?Thanks so much",
