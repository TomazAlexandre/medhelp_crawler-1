            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!In all probability it is a skin infection called cellulitis. Often it is caused by staphylococcal infection. It usually responds to cleaning and antibiotic cream application. However, it can also be an allergic reaction or a fungal infection, in which case the treatment will differ.Those who have diabetes are especially prone to these infection, though it can happen to anyone. Hence it is important to get your blood sugar tested. Take care!",
