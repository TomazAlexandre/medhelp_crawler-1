            "answer": "I thought I'd post a follow-up to this, as I've received a few emails from people asking about my experience...I asked my OB about it prior to getting pregnant. She didn't think it'd be a problem at all. To ease my mind, I also called the office of the gastroenterologist who had \"loosely\" diagnosed me with NASH, who also indicated that he didn't think it would cause a problem.With them on board, we took the plunge and started trying to conceive. Three months later, we were pregnant!At my first visit with the OB (at 8 weeks pregnant), they did bloodwork. MIRACULOUSLY, my liver enzyme levels were now, suddenly, well within normal.Pregnancy does amazing things to you body. I've heard it over and over. It's the only thing that can explain why my levels suddenly went to normal.Unfortunately, at the same visit, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, which my doctor assumed was Type 2 undiagnosed (which I'm told can go hand-in-hand with NASH).I had to go on a super-strict diet, exercise throughout my entire pregnancy (not fun in Indiana, in winter!), and give myself insulin shots. I ended up losing about 30 pounds during the beginning-middle of my pregnancy, then gained most of it back in the last couple of months of pregnancy.When I went in to have my baby, I weighed exactly what I did when I conceived her. Within a few days, I was down to about 30 pounds less than what I started at. I've been able to keep most of it off... loosely following the diet and keeping up with exercise.I had my daughter in April 2009, and had bloodwork done in November 2009. My liver enzyme levels still showed normal... not sure if the pregnancy just shocked my liver into suddenly dropping the excess fat and it stayed healthy, or if the weight loss helped keep it healthy... I really have no idea.So, that's my story. I have a wonderful, perfectly healthy 15 month old daughter now and my liver, at last check, is healthy.I hope anyone reading this has the same experience!! :)~Brenda",

    "question": "Wondering if anyone can help...About two years ago, I had some blood work that came back with elevated liver enzyme levels. I went to a gastroenterologist who ordered an ultrasound and between the ultrasound and my levels, determined that I probably have NASH. The levels were low enough that he didn't think a liver biopsy was needed, and told me to have my enzyme levels monitored by my doctor. If the levels change drastically, he would order the biopsy.My husband and I would like to start a family. I can find TONS of information out there about pregnant women developing fatty liver during their pregnancy (a very serious condition), but nothing about women with pre-existing fatty liver/NASH becoming pregnant. I am terrified that my gyno is going to tell me that I am not healthy enough.Anyone have any experience on this? I have an appointment with my gyno next week, but thought I'd check and see if I can find any others' experiences.Thanks!Brenda",
