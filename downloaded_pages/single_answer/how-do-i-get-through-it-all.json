            "answer": "My mother died in my arms July 19, of Congestive Heart Failure, diabetes, and so many other ailments that I can go on and on.\u00a0\u00a0Right now, it's very difficult watching your mother deteriorate. You need to be strong for her and yourself. Make sure she is comforable with all the necessary equipment at home that she will need (oxigen tank will eventually be needed) and medcare can help supply nurses to come to the house and monitor her pressure, heart, medication, etc. Contact your insurance and they can provide assistance during this time. They will make her comfortable and she will feel secure knowing she has help 3 x's a day with her condition.Do not take this on all by yourself. Do you have brother's and sister..family. It's time to have other people help you out and she should not stay alone in the house. Reassure her that she is not alone and you will do everything you can for her. This will help her and one day you will say as I did. \"I did everything for you\".\u00a0\u00a0For support, you can contact your church (Pastor, Rev. Elders) and he can give you suggestions on how to handle the inevitable and you can contact your hospital of choice, ask for the Chaplan and tell him/her that you need support and you will be guided to organizations within your area. It's going to be ok. It might seem a little overwhelming, but you can do this, one step at a time, get her help and support for both of you and she will be comfortable and you will be more at ease.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know if you have any other questions.

The doctors have told us that she doesn't have much longer although she thinks that in time she will be fine.\u00a0\u00a0I am doing my best to help her as she lives alone.\u00a0\u00a0My father died when I was 19 years old (he was 55-sudden heart attack).Right now, I feel so cheated.\u00a0\u00a0I am 31 years old and facing losing my mother as well as already losing my father.\u00a0\u00a0I can't cope anymore. My life is in a shambles.\u00a0\u00a0I try to take things one day at a time but every day I wake up feeling anxious and scared of what the day will hold. I live in Cleveland, Ohio.
