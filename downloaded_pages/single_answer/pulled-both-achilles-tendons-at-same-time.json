            "answer": "Hi there!Tendon pull tends to have an increased tendency with a few conditions such as arthritis, tendonitis, diabetes, steroid use, a few antibiotics like quinolones, sudden forceful stretch without adequate warm-up exercises etc. A high arch also tends to favour muscle stretch, while shoes with high arch supports or no arch supports would make the condition worse. You may like to get yourself evaluated for a few of these possibilities by an orthopedician, while it is always a good idea to indulge in passive warm-up stretch exercises before indulging in active exercises.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "I pulled both my achilles tendons in one evening playing soccer. I didn't know they were pulled until the next morning. I work cleats soccer shoes for 5 hours with some of that time walking on cement and other surfaces.I had this same issue 6 years ago of pulling both tendons at the same time. Someone told me the reason was my foot arches were falling which puts pressure on the Achilles. I wore high arch supports at that time and it took a year to heal.I'm wondering if this is what is happening. Also, I don't stretch before excersizing because I pull something every time I do.",
