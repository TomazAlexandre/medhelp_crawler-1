            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Blisters can develop on hand and in between fingers due to diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition. Blisters can be caused by intense rubbing or friction. They can also be seen in moist skin as one always covered with sweat or water. Blisters can also be a part of contact dermatitis like contact with soap, detergents, powder etc. Pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid are the other conditions that should be ruled out.There are other causes of blisters too but probably they do not apply in your case. These are Dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic bullous dermatosis, cutaneous radiation syndrome (following a radiation--maybe for cancers or X-rays or CT scans), and Epidermolysis Bullosa.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage without examining the blisters. Do consult your doctor and get a referral for a skin specialist. Take care!",

    "question": "About two weeks ago I noticed an abnormally shaped tan colored bruise in between my finger. The same day, it began to swell up and blister. A few days later, the blister (not filled with liquid) peeled off, leaving me with raw pink skin surrounded by the tan bruise skin. Ever since then, differently sized and shaped bruises have been popping up all over my hands and forearms. Aside from these skin problems, I feel completely fine. What could they be?",
