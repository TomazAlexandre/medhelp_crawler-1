Constant tingling and numbness in my feet hard to walk, my calves feel like they are tight and cant stretch them out. My hamstrings are so tight and my legs dont support me anymore. My knees give out cant walk faster then a slow walk. My lower back is always throbbing pain. My doctor thought I had diabetes before all this happen to me.So before I had all these symptoms, he gave me Glucotrol. After taking this for week and half. That is when all of the above things started happening to me. Place tell me what you think I have been doing a lot of reading and looks like to me it may be ALS. I have 7mo old little girl and I want to be around for her. Tell me what I should do?",
