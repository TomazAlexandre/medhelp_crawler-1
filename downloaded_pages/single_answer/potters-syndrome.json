    "question": "How is it passed down? What are the chances of occurring twice in the same family? Can it be confused with defects caused by other problems such as uncontrolled maternal diabetes and HTN or with cocaine abuse? Can these other conditions cause a malformation of one kidney and the absence of another and a collapse of the existing ureter along with absence of amniotic fluid? What is the occurrence of misdiagnoses via ultrasound? Is there any hope?",
