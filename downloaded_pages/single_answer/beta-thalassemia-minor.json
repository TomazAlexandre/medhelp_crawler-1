            "answer": "Hi!If you have severe anemia as a result of thalassemia minor then yes, you can have leg pain due to over-activity of bone marrow in long bones. However, leg cramps only at night can be due to restless leg syndrome. Usually cause of RLS is not known but few medications such as lithium, antidepressants and beta-blockers (such as bisoprolol) can trigger the symptoms. Other reasons of RLS could be rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, diabetes or any underlying heart disorder. In addition restless syndrome has been found to be associated with stress, fatigue, magnesium deficiency, vitamin B-12 deficiency, anemia and other systemic diseases.Though there is no permanent cure of RLS, regular & sound sleep helps get relief from symptoms. Supplements of iron/vitamin also help some. Sometimes medications such as levodopa, bromocriptine, oxycodone may be tried to provide some relief from the symptoms. Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may partly relieve your symptoms. Other useful measures are stretching, alternate hot and cold packs or baths, massage and applying vibrators on the feet and legs before bedtime. Relaxation and meditation can also help. Bone structure like long fingers, thin bones may not be due to BTM but maybe there due to vit D deficiency. Varicose veins are not due to BTM. The cause is usually faulty valves, or plaque deposits or prolonged standing. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
