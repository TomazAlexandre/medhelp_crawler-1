            "answer": "Hi,This may be an indication of an underlying deficiency, infection or discoloration due to injury.Many vitamin deficiencies cause ridges on fingernails, as the body's production of the materials in the nail is interrupted. Eating a healthier diet and supplementing with vitamins can help clear up the ridges. If improvements to your diet do not resolve the ridges on your fingernails, you may have a disorder which interrupts the absorption of nutrients by your body, and you should see a doctor.If your nails are ridged or cracked, massaging the nails or cuticles with a moisturizing cream or oil can be very beneficial, as can increasing the amount of water you drink.Changes in the nail can also be caused by disease. Some skin conditions like psoriasis are also linked with changes like ridges on fingernails, and pitting of the nail.Infection which has no pain may indicate fungal infection or onychomycosis. The condition causes the nail to take on a yellow color and the nail may look like it is opaque instead of clear. One factor that encourages growth of these special fungi that attack the nails, called dermatophytes, is a warm and wet environment. If you have constantly sweaty feet and wear heavy shoes, you might encourage growth of dermatophytes, to the point where they create onychomycosis.Treatment involves taking oral anti-fungal medications that are prescribed by your physician. If you suspect you have onychomycosis, you shouldn\u2019t delay seeing a doctor. This condition isn\u2019t like other fungal infections that can usually be treated with over the counter anti-fungal ointments. Unless contraindicated, prescription antifungal medications are the best method for treatment and most likely to result in cure.It is especially important to see a doctor right away if you have diabetes and notice onychomycosis on the feet. Also, if you seem prone to developing fungal infections on feet, it can help to use moisture wicking socks, to keep the nails trimmed and clean, and to make sure to dry between the fingers and toes after baths and showers. In particular, make sure your feet are fully dry before putting on socks and shoes.Hope this helped.best regards",
