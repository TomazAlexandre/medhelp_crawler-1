            "answer": "HI,There are many possible causes of both the swelling and the sleepiness so it is tough to narrow it down just based in this forum.People with diabetes can have some foot/led swelling as a results of changes in their blood vessels, and this is troublesome but not dangerous. Other more concerning causes include gout(especially given his joint pains), infections and heart problems.The sleepiness can be from a variety of factors, including too low or too high blood sugars, poor nighttime sleep, sleep apnea, medication side effects and heart problems.You should arrange for a follow up appt with your husband's doctor soon because\u00a0\u00a0it will take\u00a0\u00a0full in-person visit to figure out the causes.Take care.",
