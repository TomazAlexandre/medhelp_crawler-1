            "answer": "Hi. Considering that she is already diabetic, this is a recipe for an early and very painful death. Sadly there may be little you can do for her, if she doesn't want to stop, aside from expressing your concern and the negative effects her drinking has on all involved. As far as yourself, I highly reccomend alanon, which will help you to deal with the situation more effectively. Take care-GM",

    "question": "Hi,I have recently moved my family ( I have a 5 and 3 year old) with my Mother to a new home which has an annex for her. My Father died last year and was an alcoholic. Mum stopped eating and nearly fell into a diabetic coma afterwards. Because of this I wanted to look after her, she is 73. I knew Mum drank but I didn't realise how much until she moved next door. I see her swigging out of a vodka bottle and hear the clink of bottles when she goes out at night to re-stock. She is aggressive especially when she runs out of cigarettes, and the only time she eats is if I feed her. I am concerned about her diabetes, and the effect of all this alcohol on her system. I don't know whether to talk to her Doctor. Feeling lost and confused at the moment. I wondered if anyone had a similar experience.Thanks.",
