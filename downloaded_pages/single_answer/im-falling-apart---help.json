I live a very active life.because of your worsening condition, it is time to start to seek a diagnosis and then treatment options.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you start with the primary care who can do routine test.\u00a0\u00a0Get copies of thes results and then take them with you.\u00a0\u00a0A neurologist would be a good second step because of the pain, stiffness and other strange feelings in your body parts.\u00a0\u00a0A good neuologist will them run more specific tests.\u00a0\u00a0That will rule out a lot of stuff.\u00a0\u00a0And if you are lucky, may actually figure oput your real diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0If it is anything under the neurologist's domain, they can do alot of first line pain management treatments. Depending on wwhat you have and how you do, at some point you may need to see a pain manangement specialist.\u00a0\u00a0THe right one can do miracles for you. I know.\u00a0\u00a0Foloowing his directions makes the pain bearable and I CAN FUNCTION most of the time.\u00a0\u00a0It gives me much more life than a life of laying in bed screaming in pain and stiffness.This is what and in what order I suggest.\u00a0\u00a0By all means, get more input, add in your own personal goals and needs and then\u00a0\u00a0implement your plan.\u00a0\u00a0This process takes time and this suggested order is the fastest way I have found to get to the end goals of feeling better and living and doing more.Good luck.",
