            "answer": "Hi,Is your hypoglycemia a confirmed diagnosis by blood sugar testing, or is based on symptoms?In either case, there is some data to show that people who suffer from what is called \"reactive hypoglycemia,\" which is low blood sugars after eating, are at higher risk for diabetes in future.Aside from that, eating sweets in and of itself will not make you diabetic BUT weight gain caused by that habit can put you at risk for diabetes in future.In regard to the heel pain, it can be a number of things and unfortunately I cannot narrow them down well enough based on what you said(and my inability to examine you). If is is very troublesome or worsening, you should see your doctor to have it examined and possibly x-rayed.Take care.",
