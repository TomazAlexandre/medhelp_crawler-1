            "answer": "Dear zosma, Liver enzymes can be elevated for a great variety of reasons.\u00a0\u00a0The results of the tests need to be put into context with your overall clinical picture to begin to determine what the reason for the elevation is.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to direct you without knowing the whole picture.\u00a0\u00a0My suggestion would be to ask the doctor ordering all the tests your specific questions,\u00a0\u00a0to see if they can help to clarify the situation for you before you dart off in another direction starting from scratch.",

    "question": "My mother underwent lumpectomy of the right breast in 2000 and was had type 2 diabetes in 2001. Since then she has been on medication including Tamoxifen, Novonorm and Glucophage. Her last annual checkup showed she has fatty liver and raised SGOT and SGPT. Her diabetes according to the specialist is in control maintaining at an average 6-7%. She was referred to a liver specialist and under his advise, she was off Tamoxifen and Novonorm for one month. We are confused by the numerous blood tests she has to take and it does not show signs of improvement despite her stopping Novonorm and Tamoxifen, we are seriously thinking of getting a second opinion on her diabetes control as this has been ruled out as the caused for her fatty liver and raised SGOT and SGPT readings. Our other concern has been the stress that our mother is going through with the blood tests and uncertainty concerning her medical conditions.",
