            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Pus in urine can be mistaken for semen. Hence a urine analysis is must after ejaculation to check for the presence of sperm. This is called retrograde ejaculation. Diabetes and prostate enlargement are two common causes for this. Since you have premature ejaculation there is a chance it is sperm in urine. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor (preferably an urologist).Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
