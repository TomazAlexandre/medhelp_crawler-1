    "question": "I have degenerative disk disease (L5, narrowing of nerve channel), functional heart murmur, mild asthma, allergies, migraines, and restless legs... I am in the military (3 Iraq deployments) and get annual physicals and still run. I also had a form of anemia (Idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia) when I was 3yrs old where my white blood cells were attacking my red blood cells and I was urinating blood (had a transfusion, no issues sense). So anyways that is my history and here are my questions. Sometimes when I eat late or not enough it feels like I am \"bonking\" or extremely weak.\u00a0\u00a0I also get extremely irritable when I haven\u2019t eaten, however sometimes I don\u2019t know I'm hungry until I get to that point.\u00a0\u00a0A few years ago after a blood test I was told I have a very high count of triglycerides, also sometimes when I stand I get darkening vision like its closing from the outside and sounds get muffled, this happens with extreme pain also. Also sometimes my mind feels \"foggy\" and it is \"sometimes\" hard to concentrate or remember things. I am scheduled to see a doctor for my annual physical. Any ideas or suggestions?!BTW - my blood pressure is consistantly 130-110/80-65 (110/70 as of last Thurs)",
