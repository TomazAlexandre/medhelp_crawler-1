            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Microvascular ischemic changes in the brain are small areas in the brain where tiny blood vessels have ruptured or clotted off and may be associated with chronic health problems like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. It is best that you discuss the results of your MRI with your doctor for proper evaluation. Your medical history, symptoms and results of other diagnostic tests are important considerations also. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I just got an MRI back after a terrible bout of vertigo and odd illness and nausea and eye changes. Turned out to be an acute lacunar infarct. I just had a second MRI done to be sure. It was an acute lacunar infarct, but also said it was an evolving microvascular ischemic change. What does the evolving part mean? Any one know? Thanks so much.",
