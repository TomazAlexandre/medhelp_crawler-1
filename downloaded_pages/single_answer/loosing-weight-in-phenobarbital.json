            "answer": "Hi there!You have been taking Phenobarbital since 10 years. If you had been losing weight due to it then it would have become obvious within 6 months of starting phenobarbital.Weight loss may/may not be related to it. If there is a significant weight loss then you need to keep other possibilities in mind like stress, depression, Crohn\u2019s disease, hookworm infestation, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, any cancer or malignancy. Losing weight without diet or calorie reduction can indicate some serious illness. You need to take it seriously. Consult your doctor ASAP.Take care and good luck!",
