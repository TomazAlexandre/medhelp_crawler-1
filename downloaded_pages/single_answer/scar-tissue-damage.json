    "question": "Years ago when I was pregnant with my son I went blind. It was also due to me being a very bad diabetic. I had several eye laser surgeries they really helped clear my vision. I went to the eye doctor and the vision on my sides is horrible due to the scar tissue left from the laser surgery. Is there anything that can be done to get rid of the scar tissue? Thanks for helping.",
