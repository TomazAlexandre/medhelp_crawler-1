    "question": "My mother of 79 years with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes was refered for a nuclear stress test for eval. of ischemia.\u00a0\u00a0Risk factors: Avandia, Insulin, Prandin, Lipidor, Torsemide, Asa, & Cosar.The results included...MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION SCAN: Small inferior defect of mild intensity post excersise with normal perfusion images at rest.\u00a0\u00a0The left ventricle was of normal size.\u00a0\u00a0There was no transient ischemic dilation.GATED WALL MOTION-\u00a0\u00a0Normal left ventricular wall motion.EJECTION FRACTION: 83%CONCLUSION:\u00a0\u00a0Abnormal exercise myocardial perfusion imaging with evidence of inferior ischemia.\u00a0\u00a0EKG response was ischemic.\u00a0\u00a0Blood pressure was appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise tolerance was fair.\u00a0\u00a0Gated wall motion analysis of the left ventricle reveals Normal left ventricular wall motion and ejection fraction of 83%.QUESTION: How concerned should she be and what exactly does this report mean?\u00a0\u00a0She is sleepless while awaiting an appointment to discuss these findings with the cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0Chest pain upon mild exercise was the impetus for the test.",
