            "answer": "Hello,You may be having recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC). RVVC is more common in women with diabetes or weak immune systems. Doctors most often treat this problem with antifungal medicine for up to 6 months. You can get it prescribed from your doctor. Also, For yeast infection, take some precautionary measures like avoid wearing tight fitting clothing like jeans and pantyhose and underwear made from synthetic fibres. Remove wet or damp bathing suits immediately after swimming, avoid douching, perfumed soaps, bubble baths and toiletries, change underwear daily, wash underwear in hot water (to destroy fungi) and double rinse (to remove any irritating detergent) and take adequate nutrition and sleep.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Ok so here's the run down on my girly situation. Last September I had my very first yeast infection so my longtime boyfriend and I opted for planned parenthood since we are both full time students. I got the treatment and while I was there I decided to get on microgestin fe 1/20 to ensure we were safe.Since then I've had what feels like repeat yeast infections, but never actually full blown. Just a few of the most annoying symptoms ever off and on, worst of all that uncomfortable feeling in my vagina. Ive done two doses of the monistat 7 day treatment but no relief. I should probably mention that every time we have sex, even with a condom, I feel so uncomfortable for about a week or so after.I am at my wits end about what more to do.To top it all off last month I got my first uti and was treated for that as well.Bottom line, is it possible that my birth control could be the cause of all my recent health problems? I keep returning to this conclusion because in the 22 years prior to starting my bc I have never had a problem. Please HELP!!",
