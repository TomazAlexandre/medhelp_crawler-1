    "question": "Hi there! I have a question about my mother-in-law.I suspect that she may have Type 2 diabetes. Her breath is sweet smelling (almost carrion-sweet). I understand that this is one of the symptoms of untreated diabetes. I imagine her blood must also be fairly sugary, as she is typically surrounded by clouds of biting/bloodsucking insects when she goes outside. I suspect that there is some concomitant neuropathy, since she appears to not to even notice. She is also enormously overweight, probably by an easy 200 lbs. She has not been diagnosed as diabetic, however -- I don't think she's been to a doctor since my husband was born. So my guess at Type 2 diabetes is only a guess. Oh, and she also drinks regular Coke by the gallon (not kidding, that's what she and my father-in-law both say she drinks every day).She is left-handed, and a few years ago her left hand developed a slight tremble. Recently it has taken over her entire left arm, and it shakes so badly that I can hear it thumping on the armrest from across the room.She swears that this is from the family history of Parkinson's, but I don't think so. She has no trouble initiating voluntary movement, and no postural tilts, which are both hallmarks of Parkinson's.I know that diabetics get the shakes when their glucose levels go wonky (I'm hypoglycemic and have that problem whenever I skip a meal). However, her shakes are only on one side instead of both. This suggests some sort of neurologic right-hemisphere problem to me. *IS* there any relationship between diabetes and localized neurodegeneration?Unfortunately, she is a really stubborn (generally nice) woman who turns mean at the suggestion of going to the doctor. I'm afraid we're going to have to declare her incompetent and force her to go, since she won't do it on her own. I'm hoping that I can turn up some info here that will scare her into going. I'd rather bully her than turn to the legal system, ya know?Thanks (and sorry for the long post!)-nodnol",
