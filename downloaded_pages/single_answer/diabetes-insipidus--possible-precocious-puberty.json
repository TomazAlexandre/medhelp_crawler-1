    "question": "My son was diagnosed with DI in 2008.\u00a0\u00a0He takes DDAVP twice a day and with the exception of the days a pill gets forgotten, he is symptom free and thriving.\u00a0\u00a0For a while after diagnosis, he wasn't growing very much or gaining much weight.\u00a0\u00a0Just after he turned 9 in July 2009, we noticed the early signs of puberty.\u00a0\u00a0At the present time, it seems to be progressing kind of rapidly.\u00a0\u00a0His voice has deepened considerably in the past few months, he has quite a bit of pubic hair and leg hair but not underarm hair.\u00a0\u00a0He has a fuzzy upper lip, also.\u00a0\u00a0He actually has grown 1.5 inches in the past six months and gained five pounds, but he is still on the small side.\u00a0\u00a0(51 inches and 57 pounds).\u00a0\u00a0He has an appointment with his Endo on April 6th, but I like to be armed with info when I go.\u00a0\u00a0I know 9 isn't crazy early for puberty to start but considering the Central DI, I'm wondering if the two are related.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts?",
