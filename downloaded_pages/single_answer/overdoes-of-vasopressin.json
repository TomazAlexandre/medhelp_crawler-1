    "question": "I have diabetes insipidus and was overdosed in the hospital with my vasopressin when they put in and removed an experimental gastric pacemaker. I am now having problems walking, speaking, and understanding things. I also dehydrate as my diabetes went misdiagnosed for 30 years. Where do I go for help being on medicaid. I live in Washington State out in the country and traveling to big cities is not an option. There is obviously some kind of damage, and I also was very combative after the surgeries and still have trouble with controling emotions. Is there help for me out there?",
