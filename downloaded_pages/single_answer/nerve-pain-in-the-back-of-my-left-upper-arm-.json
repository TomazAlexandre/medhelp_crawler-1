            "answer": "Hi,How are you?It is very difficult to tell without examination if these two are related.The arm pain can be due to nerve compression in the neck and may not be related to the knee replacement surgery at all.Other causes can be peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes and B12 deficiency and peripheral arterial diseases.Please discuss this with your treating doctor.",

    "question": "I recently had a total left knee replacement (2 weeks ago). I use crutches and I now have a pain in the back of my left arm just above the elbow. It shoots through my arm and becomes numb immediately. I lay on the couch and when I get up, I push off with that arm. I now use my other arm but no pain so far. I ice it and the pain goes away. I don't know if the surgery and the arm are related. Any suggestions?
