    "question": "Can anyone help? My body seems to overheat and sweat too much during exercise. I look like I've come out of the shower. Even something as simple as carrying a bag of shopping for 5 minutes causes my body to overheat and sweat. I have had loads of blood tests and ruled out diabetes, high blood pressure and an overactive thyroid. I have also been to a dermatology clinic and they can't find anything wrong. My GP has run out of ideas. I drink lots of water and don't drink caffeine. Also I am healthy and not overweight and exercise on a regular basis. Does anyone know what could be wrong with me? Could it be diet? Don't say there is nothing wrong cause I know there is something wrong and I'll just get annoyed?",
