    "question": "Is there some condition know that makes the eyes stay dilated 100% of the time. They have already checked diabetes, STD test, performed eye exams & everything is coming up negative. I do have adult asthma & they had origionally thought maybe the medication had caused the condition but even changing RX didn't make a difference. They have now been dilated over a year & stay like that all the time & I have to wear sunglasses even in doors & can't spend a lot of time outside because I can't find glasses dark enough or that cover the entire eye area. Any ideas or additional test that should be considered.",
