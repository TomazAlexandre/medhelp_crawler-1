            "answer": "Hi,I am sorry your brother is so ill at this time. Pancreatitis indeed is a very serious condition because when severe it can involve other organs of the body, such as causing fluid overload and respiratory failure.\u00a0\u00a0The most common triggers for acute pancreatitis are gallbladder disease and alcohol intake, but other causes are possible such as medication side effects. His doctors will be working on getting the pancreas to calm down and possibly take care of any infections.Hope this information is useful. Take care and all the best to your brother.I hope he has a speedy recovery.",
