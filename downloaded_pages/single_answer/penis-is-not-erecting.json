            "answer": "Hi,Majority of the patients who have this problem erectile dysfunction at a young age is due to anxiety neurosis only in which there\u2019s anxiety to perform which can make the penis go limp. However, it\u2019s always important to rule out other pathologies like diabetes mellitus, hypertension etc. I\u2019ll suggest you to consult a physician to rule out these ailments by getting the relevant tests done apart from ruling out any neurological illness being the cause of the underlying problem of erectile dysfunction. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
