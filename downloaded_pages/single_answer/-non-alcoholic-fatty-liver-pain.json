            "answer": "My Dr said that the best non medical management for pain from a inflamed liver is to control the diabetes.The pain comes from the liver being inflamed . The liver itself doesn't have pain nerves but, the lining is full of them.As the liver enlarges it presses against the lining causing it to press against other internal structures (ribs and organs) This causes the pain.Controlling the diabetes helps reduce the inflammation. Thus reducing the pain.Be careful of pain meds damaged livers sometimes have problems handling them.Gail",
