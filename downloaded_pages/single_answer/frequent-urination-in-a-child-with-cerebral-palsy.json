            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, yes, anxiety some children face while being 'potty-trained' can result in too frequent use of toilet. However 20-30 times a day is on a very high side.If you live in a cold climate, see if the child is properly clothed or not\u2014feeling cold can also be the cause. Similarly taking a lot of fluids could be the cause.Possibility of diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus as the cause have to be ruled out.It can also be due to neurogenic or hypotonic bladder often associated with cerebral palsy. Apart from his neurologist, please consult an urologist. Get his urine examined to rule out UTI, which can also present as just increased frequency. Take care!",
