    "question": "Hello I am 18 years old and I've had a faintly grey-coloured lump on the end tip of my penis for as long as I can remember. If I think hard enough I think it been around 5-6 years ago since I started noticing this, but only till relatively recently did it click in my head that it is highly unusual.It has always been painless, doesn't obstruct urinating, is somewhat squishy and soft, and I've noticed it minutely fluctuating in size throughout the day, not sure why. When squeezing it deliberately, it is still painful, as with any other sensitive part of my body. (i.e. it's not anymore painful than what you would expect, like no extremely sharp stinging sensations).There are no other signs of abnormalities on the rest of my penis, as far as I know of. I can provide images of this problem if it would help, in reply.Thanks",
