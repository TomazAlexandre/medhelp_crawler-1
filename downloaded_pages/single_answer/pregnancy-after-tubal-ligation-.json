            "answer": "Hi!After six years of tubal ligation chances of pregnancy though not impossible are very less. So, if in doubt please take a pregnancy test and see. Movement can be due to excess gas. Conditions which cause excess gas in the gut like foods rich in sulfites, IBS, liver disorders, food intolerance, celiac disease, acidity or Crohn\u2019s disease need to be ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Tiredness can also be due to anemia, hypothyroidism and diabetes and the latter two can also cause slowing of gut. Tiredness and bloating can also be seen in polycystic ovary. Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please discuss these possibilities with your PCP and if need be get a referral for a gastroenterologist and a gynecologist.Take care!",
