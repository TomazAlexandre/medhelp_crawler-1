    "question": "I'm a 25 year old female. In about the past two weeks I've been having left lower quad pain. I had an ultrasound and it was neg, showing everything was fine. The pain started out as really sharp as I was trying to sit up for the first few days, and then just turned to sharp pain that came at random times. I have also become rather tired and run down lately, feeling like I can never get enough sleep. I have also lost about 15lbs in the last month. I'm not sure if this is anything that I should worry about or anything.",
