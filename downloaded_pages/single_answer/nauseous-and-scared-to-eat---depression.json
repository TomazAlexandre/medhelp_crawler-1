            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Yes, if you suffer from depression or from eating disorders then you can feel nausea.So, this aspect needs to be looked into.Commonest cause of chronic nausea is acidity. So, eating less could also be compounding problems. Take some antacid gel along with omeprazole. Eat frequently at two hours intervals\u2014fruit, crackers, salad, soup, cold milk, etc. If symptoms persist then other causes will need to be looked into.Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism which have been ruled out. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Chronic hepatitis or chronic infection of the gall bladder are the other possibilities. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done.Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Everything makes me feel sick. I only eat 700-800 calories a day and most of that is fruit or saltines because that's all I can eat without feeling sick. But I rarely feel hungry despite not eating enough, usually just more nausea. I've tried cutting out meat and dairy and all junk foods, but nothing's helped. I've been to the doctor, she prescribed omeprazole which didn't do anything. She also tested for pregnancy/hypothyroidism/anemia/bloodbile/some other stuff but everything was negative. I have no idea what's causing the nausea.I'm scared to eat because I hate feeling nauseous all the time! Everything makes me feel sick and I'm too scared to eat even healthy foods. I'm also extremely tired all the time, and I'm always cold, and I get headaches. I've lost 15 pounds so far from being too scared to eat.I have depression - can depression cause nausea? I am anxious and very sad all the time, and I feel sick all the time, so... Could the two be related?",
