            "answer": "Hello,Ketonuria can occur in pregnancy but your diabetic status and stress caused by wisdom tooth may also be causing ketonuria. During pregnancy, early detection of ketonuria is important because of the risks that are associated with intrauterine death of the fetus. Hence ketone levels which can rise even in early pregnancy should be thought of and your pregnancy status checked.Most home pregnancy tests that check urine beta-HCG are sensitive to 20-25 mIU/ml of HCG. The test can be positive anywhere from about 2-3 days prior to a missed menses to 4-5 days after, but usually it should be done 7-10 days past your missed period. It is not uncommon for women to have negative pregnancy tests when they are pregnant.Hence it is better to get serum HCG levels done.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
