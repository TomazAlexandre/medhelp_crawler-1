Some background on why this is so important: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108538/?report=printableEurope has strict nickel regulations (banned nickel use in many items) b/c they know that frequent exposure can lead to serious nickel allergies. No such thing here in the USA.\u00a0\u00a0Would appreciate a European list of medical suppliers.",
