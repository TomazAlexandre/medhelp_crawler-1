    "question": "I was diagnosed with polyhydrominos today. It is excess amniotic fluid. I\u00a0\u00a0passed all of my tests like the diabetes, down syndrome, and rh. I am 39 and I can't help but be scared. They say that he is 7.2 lbs...I am 36 weeks and 3 days. I am just curious if anyone has had this and how things turned out. I have googled it and most of the women had to have emergency c sections. If I had not stayed on them to do another ultrasound they would have never known!!!\u00a0\u00a0Please help ease my mind.",
