            "answer": "How are you? Where do the abscesses occur, under the nipple or\u00a0\u00a0in any part of the breast? Was there any biopsy done during the drainage of the abscess?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Mastitis is the inflammation of the parenchyma of the mammary gland. The term nonpuerperal mastitis describes inflammatory lesions of the breast occurring unrelated to pregnancy and breastfeeding. Factors that were found to cause nonpuerperal mastitis are: secretory activity or galactorrhea, changes in permeability of lactiferous ducts, blockage of lactiferous ducts, hormonal contraceptives, trauma, injury, mechanical irritation caused by fibrocystic condition or infection.In granulomatous mastitis, the abscesses can occur in any part of the breast and they\u00a0\u00a0tend to recur. Granulomatous mastitis can be diagnosed through biopsy. It is postulated to be an autoimmune condition with no definite triggering factor, and treatment is prolonged, using immunosuppresants.I hope this helps. Take care and keep us posted.",
