            "answer": "Hello,Various reasons for recurrent or persistent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Treatment resistance can be overcome by applying a cream with a combination of antifungals (Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1% and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%). Get her blood sugar tested, fasting, 2 hours after food and if these are high then glycosylated hemoglobin to see overall sugar status in last 3 months.Hope this helps and take care.",

    "question": "Okay.\u00a0\u00a0So about six months ago some veins in the front and back of my penis began to get really ugly and purple, and it eventually hurt to have sex or masturbate.I went to the doctor but he didn't know what it was.After about a month the area around the urethra got a little red, and eventually redder and redder and a white puss was coming out of it.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the doctor again and he told me it was balanoposthitis.\u00a0\u00a0He gave me a steroid cream and told me to put in on twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0He said that I could keep having sex, and not to worry about it too much.Thanks to the cream, the swelling went down, there was no more pain, and no white stuff.\u00a0\u00a0But it never went away completely, and I had to keep putting on the cream every day.\u00a0\u00a0So I go back to my doctor and he says that I shouldn't get oral sex, because it could make it work.About a month goes by, and it's still not gone, so I go back and he tells me that I shouldn't masturbate or have sex until it's gone.\u00a0\u00a0Now it's been almost a month.\u00a0\u00a0I've masturbated about twice during the month, and it's still a little red and swollen.Could something else be going on here?",
