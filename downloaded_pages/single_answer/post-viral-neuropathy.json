    "question": "I am a 21 year old female trying to understand a recent diagnosis. This is my story - I woke up one morning at the beginning of October with numb little and ring fingers on my left hand (I am right handed), quite suddenly, having had no symptoms prior to that. Over the following days this spread across the entire of my hand and within a week my right hand was also numb most of the time, with intermittent tingling. My GP diagnosed me with carpal tunnel syndrome and I was sent for physiotherapy (accupuncture).I found this treatment very painful and a range of new symptoms were developing over this time - the numbness had mainly gone and was replaced by painful tingling, sometimes spreading up to the top of my arms, and general aching pain in my hands and forearms. I also developed quite bad memory loss and difficulty with spacial awareness. My thumb on my left hand became very swollen and painful, with the tip going purple. This went down over time and with alot of ibuprofen, only for the same thing to happen to my index finger a couple of weeks later, and then my middle finger. Also in this period I had several bouts of vommiting and dizziness and blacked out on one occasion (although I realise these things may be unrelated). About once a week I experience visual disturbances in the form of white flashing stars all over my field of vision, and cannot find any pattern in the appearance of these.Eventually, this January, I was referred to a neurologist. She concluded that these symptoms were the result of a post-viral neuropathy, the result of a flu-type virus I had picked up roughly 3 weeks before symptoms were first displayed. She said that I had been suffering from a very mild sub-type of Guillain-Barre syndrome. I have tried to find out more about this diagnosis and don't really understand what it means or whether it is accurate? Any information you might be able to give would be great.",
