    "question": "my daughter is turning 4years old now. i experienced a 10 pound weight gain after decrease in milk supply. this is accompanied by occasional headache, increased thirst, skin dryness and occasional abdominal pain with alternating soft stools and constipation. I also occasionally have leg cramps ( which is probably due to my thalassemia?). is this diabetes? i do have two paternal aunts with diabetes.",
