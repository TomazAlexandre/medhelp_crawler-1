            "answer": "Not a doc and I have no ideas on this.\u00a0\u00a0HOWEVER, I just became aware I have a vitamin D difficiency as I have had less milk due to recent diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I found that certain vitamin difficiancies can really do a job on someone. Maybe start him on a vitamin every other day may boost his system and see how it goes for a few weeks. Check with you child's doctor to see which vitamins he/she would suggest. I have had pains and other symptoms from denying myself milk! I also use to teach and kids can have stomach upset from situations at school or such. They are good at keeping some things from mom as they do not know how to handle it.One final note...When I was a teen I had severe stomach ache and was misdiagnosed, sent back to school and then taken by my mom to a specialist where I found out I had an impacted bowel. Basically a bowel blockage. Definately causes a tummy ache. If you can hear stomach juices/noises from the child's tummy that probably isn't it. Yet if no sounds are coming from bowel...it could indicate a blockage. Did the doc listen to tummy sounds?Also log into a note book what he eats for a week and see if any correlations between eating and getting at tummy pain are\u00a0\u00a0noticed....like any patterns.Hope this was a help. Hope child is better.",
