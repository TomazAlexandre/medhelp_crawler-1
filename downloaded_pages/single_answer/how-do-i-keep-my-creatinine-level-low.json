            "answer": "Go to your primary and get this checked out. Anti-inflamation drugs, advil, ibuprofen, aleve, naproxen, (and NSAID) can cause kidney damage. Don't take any of these until you get checked out. Tylenol, although in my experience far less effective, is safest. I use tylenol arthritis for my pain and it helps - somewhat. I also find taking omega 3 oil helps.Controlling kidney disease is mainly through diet, and if you have high blood pressure or diabetes with medications to control those. The diet means limiting things high in protein, potassium, salt, and phosporous. So things like oranges, tomotoes, potatoes, green leafy veggies. And limiting your intake processed foods. How much you limit is a decision the nephrologist usually makes.The primary will probably repeat the blood test and add a urine test. Perhaps a 24 hour urine collection. With all this information they will come up with a number called your GFR. Which is the estimated rate in which your kidneys filter waste products. There are 5 stages of kidney disease. With the first 3 stages you can function just fine and won't notice any symptoms. Since you don't have any other symptoms it is likely you are in this category. It is important to get diagnosed though because if it gets worse than you start to head into trouble. Stage 4 you have to start limiting your diet and may have high blood pressure and swelling of the limbs. Stage 5 and they prepare you for a kidney transplant and/or dialysis.The diet is what will keep you at stage 3 or higher. The diet is a bit harsh, but it is doable. I really miss tomatoes and spinach. I was eating spagetti with tomatoes and spinach at least once a week. I was even using Sun Dried tomatoes which are so high in potassium.They caught it before it caused symptoms which is lucky. Many people, most, don't realise they have kidney disease until it is too late to do anything about it.",
