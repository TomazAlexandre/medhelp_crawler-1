            "answer": "Hi.The feeling of arousal which entails sexual response should be present first. In your case, is sexual arousal present at least 25% of the time?Psychogenic issue sand anatomical problems may lead to problems with sexual response. In your case, you are still young and I do not think underlying disease conditions like diabetes and hypertension may be present to contribute to your condition.Psychogenic or psychological factors have to be considered here. Give yourself time to get to know the person that you are with. For how long have you been with this girl? Are you in any way attracted to her? Are there any feelings of being self conscious when you are with her? Does she impose certain ways on how to do things? Or is she supportive and understanding?These are things we have to consider. I suggest you discuss this with a therapist if the condition persists. Proper referral to a urologist or internist may be done to rule out other conditions like hormonal disorders for instance.",
