            "answer": "Hi and welcome,Your question has landed in the Multiple Sclerosis community which may not of been where you intended for your question to go....to be honest i find it mind boggling that you haven't been given an official medical explanation, if you have been left to search for answers your doctors need a kick up the backside!!What i can tell you is that MS has a strong association with both heat exposure and visual issues.Demyelination slows the ability of the nerves to function, and heat exposure further slows down the nerve function in the effected locations. It actually only needs to be a very slight increase, as little as one degree rise in core temperature is enough to cause the MS symptoms to appear or re-appear. In MS this typically causes whats called a pseudo-exacerbation and the symptoms typically resolve once they've cooled down, heat exposure in MS doesn't typically cause permanent symptoms.The visual condition Optic Neuritis (ON) would be the closest visual issue associated with MS, ON is often described as a sudden episode of unilateral blindness, first appearance and reappearance with heat exposure is common but whilst the optic nerve is damaged ON doesn't typically cause permanent blindness.By mentioning Diabetes Mellitus (DM), and end-stage kidney or renal disease (ESRD) i'm assuming you have been diagnosed and these are your preexisting medical conditions, i don't know much about either sorry but Diabetes from what i understand is the number one cause of blindness in the United States so IF you do have Diabetes it is likely to be connected to what has happened to your vision.Sorry i couldn't be more helpful......JJ",
