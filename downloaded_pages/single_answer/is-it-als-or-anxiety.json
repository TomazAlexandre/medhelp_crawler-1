            "answer": "Hi!Anxiety, stress, and depression can all cause twitches and tingling. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, muscle fatigue, pinched nerve due to wrong posture could be the cause. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes, Lyme's, lupus or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",

    "question": "For the past few days, I have been having twitching all over my body. The twitching would range from the top of my head to the bottom of my foot. There is no weakness in any of my limbs; they just twitch. Sometimes, I tingle in my right arm as well.I also have had a burning/tight sensation in my neck randomly. I thought it was due to me possibly developing allergies (I am seeing an ENT and getting tested soon), but I had an episode of this today, and now I feel numb under my tongue. I am taking antihistamines to possibly counteract this.I have been referred to a neurologist - and I am not trying to jump to the conclusion of ALS since I am 23 years old - but are there other issues that I could be overlooking. I tend to be really anxious and stressed, and I have been diagnosed with major depression as well.",
