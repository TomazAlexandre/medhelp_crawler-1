            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Erection is caused by hormones, nerves, muscles and blood vessels. Any disorder affecting these can cause erectile dysfunction. It is influenced by many factors like hypertension, diabetes, alcohol, smoking, obesity, radiation, prostrate removal etc.Decrease in penis size could be due to hormonal imbalance, developmental abnormalities, chromosomal abnormalities etc. What is your age? And do you have any history of infections or trauma? As these could also effect the size of penis.I think that you might have a blocked ejaculatory duct or an enlarged lymphnode which is compressing the base of penis. Get a check of the level of testosterone and take a specialist's opinion.Supplementation of testosterone if necessary and corrective surgeries might help.Get well soon.",
