    "question": "Type one diabetes runs in our family. My mom has it. A day ago my son and I were outside and he said mom my stomach hurts, I dont feel good and then passed out. His eyes never closed all the way but he couldn't see or hear me. Then later that day he blacked out again while sitting. At track practice the next day he said he blacked out again but only for a few seconds. He didn't even fall. I'm taking him to the doctor. I've had his blood sugar checked before and it was normal. He's had no head injury, he is having normal bowel movements. He's active and not over weight. Does anyone have any idea what is causing the black outs? He complains afterwards with heavy arms,legs and head. What does this sound like?",
