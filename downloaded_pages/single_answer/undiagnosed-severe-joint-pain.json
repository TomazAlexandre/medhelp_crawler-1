    "question": "Hi, my boyfriend of seven years has an undiagnosed chronic joint pain condition.\u00a0\u00a0He is 25 years old.\u00a0\u00a0To start off with a little bit of history, he has had this as long as he can remember.\u00a0\u00a0When he was young, people just told him it was \u201cgrowing pains\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0I can\u2019t go into too much detail about other symptoms, but should say he was infected with meningitis around the age of 11-12 and was hospitalized for a while.\u00a0\u00a0His mom\u2019s side is relatively healthy.\u00a0\u00a0His dad was diagnosed with breast and testicular cancer in his 20s and was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer a couple of years ago.\u00a0\u00a0His paternal uncle has Crohn\u2019s disease and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0His nephew (3 years old) has some sort of undiagnosed condition.When I first met him, his joint pain was only related to weather (changes in pressure/cold weather) and did not affect his life too much.\u00a0\u00a0It was isolated to his knee joints.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past few years, there have been various other health issues that have come up, and have become increasingly worse and more alarming as times goes by.\u00a0\u00a0A few years ago he was diagnosed with an anal fissure which has since healed.\u00a0\u00a0Following this, he lost about 40lbs in the matter of months and started to look more sickly and pale.\u00a0\u00a0He sweats excessively at night to the point where he wakes up and the sheets are soaked.\u00a0\u00a0He has frequent headaches and bouts of nausea and vomiting more than a person should.\u00a0\u00a0His lungs are also phlegm and wheezy.\u00a0\u00a0His joint pain is getting so bad that he is almost debilitated and is getting to the point where almost every day is a bad day.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is also spreading to his wrists and elbows.\u00a0\u00a0The joints are not warm and do not swell or turn red.He has seen a rheumatologist and had blood tests and x-rays which came out clean.\u00a0\u00a0His blood tests showed \u201cmarkers\u201d for arthritis but nothing conclusive.\u00a0\u00a0They did not look into it further and assumed he was lying or was looking for painkillers.\u00a0\u00a0He is starting to think he is crazy because no one believes him and is really depressed because this is basically ruining his life.\u00a0\u00a0He can barely do day to day activities.\u00a0\u00a0Please, does anyone know what this could be?",
