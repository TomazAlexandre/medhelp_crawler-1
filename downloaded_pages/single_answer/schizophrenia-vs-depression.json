            "answer": "As a person who has recovered from schizoaffective disorder (with glycine a Phase II antipsychotic in FDA that is a glutamate antagonist, a new form of antipsychotic in studythat will not cause tardive dyskinesia or diabetes and promotes a fuller recovery) I can state that things are more complex. Schizoaffective disorder is schizophrenia with a co-existing mood disorder. If the person is only psychotic during mood changes then it is classified as bipolar or depression (depending if mania exists) with psychotic features. For myself, the schizoaffective had the bipolar aspect. For your son it would probably have the depressive aspect. He would be prescribed an antipsychotic and a mood stabilizer. For more information on the specific antipsychotic agent I am on google \"Dr. Javitt, glycine\" and when the specific case study on me is published in a psychiatric journal I will make the results available. However, as for now with a standard antipsychotic and anti-depressent your son would do well as regards recovery. Schizoaffective disorder is actually more common than schizophrenia and has a better recovery rate overall.",
