            "answer": "There are no doctors on this forum, quietkat, only other people with diabetes. Snacking can be a habit that is hard, but not impossible to break. If you are on insulin then you should be bolusing for anything over 15 carbs, but it is really better to not eat at night if you can get out of the habit. Going out for a walk would help you break that habit. If you do feel the need to snack, snack on non-carb items such as nuts or cheese.",
