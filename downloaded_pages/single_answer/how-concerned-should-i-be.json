            "answer": "Based on the part of the echocardiogram report that you have documented here, the pumping action of your heart is good. You have some impairment in your heart\u2019s relaxation function. During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle (diastole), the heart chambers fill with blood that is squeezed out during the pumping phase of the cardiac cycle (systole). There are many diagnoses that may be associated with a diastolic impairment- these include hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes mellitus for example. Diastolic impairment can also be seen in elderly patients. Talk with your cardiologist and see what he/she thinks your cause is. The usual treatment is directed at the cause of the diastolic impairment.You also have some degree of backflow through 2 of your heart valves which have been described as mild to moderate. Your cardiologist will be able to see the images of these and will decide on how often this needs to be monitored, in the context of any symptoms you may have.",
