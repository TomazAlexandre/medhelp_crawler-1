She may well have a fracture, nerve issues, or it may be caused by her diabetes, a genetic disorder called osteochondroma\u00a0\u00a0(bone tumor), and even bursitus.

And also,her utres was removed 7 yrs back due to fibroid problem,but now she is ok with that.she has been afraid becoz,she thought that it may lead to heart problem,so we went to heart specialist,after ECG ,they told that,everything is normal,it is not a cause of hand pain.[I dont know exactly the term, what to use, they told that one of the valve is little bit contracted,like lookink little bit small,but it wont lead to any terrible cause].will u plz suggest something to her to get relief from her pain.",
