            "answer": "Hi Avpark,I feel for your niece. My diabetic daughter is 16, and her cramps/menstrual problems can get pretty bad. We've also noticed her blood sugar sometimes (but not always) rising during her period, and that's on the list to talk about with her doc at the next appointment.As a non-medical professional, I don't think it's a good idea to change any dosages without first talking with her doctor. For one thing, if she's just getting her period for the first time, you have no way to plan when the future onsets will be-- it can be erratic and unstable for young girls. She may not get another one for a few months. To increase her dosage by guessing something might come could make her drop too low.But it's good to track how her sugars respond to hormonal events, and then ask her doctor for dosage guidance.You're a kind auntie to help her out so thoughtfully!",

Being a woman I know how miserable your hormones can make you without diabetes, aare her hormones the cause of the elevation. I have ruled out any other illnesses at this point.
