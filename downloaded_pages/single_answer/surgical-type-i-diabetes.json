    "question": "I saw another post similar to what I've been experiencing yet it was different in that it explained that the pancreas will produce antibodies to some types of insulin which produces an allergic-like reaction.\u00a0\u00a0In this person's situation, itchiness was the body's response to the insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Something to that effect anyway...In my case, in September 2008, I had a total pancreatectomy with islet cell transplant (from harvested islet cells from my pancreas to the liver), splenectomy, 70% colectomy (unexpected but found during tp surgery - necrotic colon) & an appendectomy for good measure.The ict seemed to be at least partially successful as at first, I didn't require much insulin & often would get hypoglycemia if more than 3 units of fast acting/mealtime insulin (Novolog) was used.\u00a0\u00a0I also would begin getting hypoglycemic symptoms when my glucose levels went under 100 (usual is <80 I believe.)\u00a0\u00a0I was told that though uncomfortable while occurring, it was actually a good sign my ict was at least partially successful.Since that time, and particularly during the last few months, my glucose levels have been off the charts literally - averaging between 400 to 500+.\u00a0\u00a0I will be seeing my family doctor today in response to a blood panel obtained during my routine office visit last week where it was found that my glucose level was 460 & I had not eaten that morning but admittedly, had yogurt & sherbet the day before.\u00a0\u00a0I have not yet been seen by an endocrinologist & though I know I should have by now, I felt that my pcp could manage it since my glucose levels post-surgery were, if anything, low.Obviously, that is no longer the case.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry for the long explanation but felt a background was necessary as I am hoping to get some recommendations while waiting for an endocrinologist appointment.\u00a0\u00a0This may be delayed as well as there are no endocrinologists in my immediate area and the nearest ones are about 20-30 mins. from my home.\u00a0\u00a0Ok, here are my questions/symptoms:Extreme itchiness all over my body including my face & scalp that is so bad that Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and an RX for hydrocortisone valerate 0.2% cream provides only minimal relief.\u00a0\u00a0We had a minor problem w/fleas from our cat several months ago and though my husband & 14 yr old son got only very minor itching, I thought perhaps I was having a reaction to them.So, can diabetes type I (surgically induced) and/or Novolog (6-7 units at meals etc) and/or Lantus (long acting 25 units at bedtime) be causing such extreme itchiness to the point that it often feels like my skin is crawling?\u00a0\u00a0I can feel tiny bumps on my arms, etc., but they're not visible & seem to come & go.I am also still on several meds under the management of my pain management doctor as prior to the tp/ict surgery, I had severe chronic pancreatitis for 5-6 yrs. & though the surgery was about 95% successful in terms of alleviating the extreme, most severe attacks - I still get attacks periodically & still have many intestinal issues.\u00a0\u00a0Can methadone, fentanyl patches, phenergan for nausea, ativan for anxiety, cause itching even though I've been taking them for quite a long time now with no allergy-like issues.\u00a0\u00a0It should probably be noted that in just the past 5-6 yrs. I have had allergic reactions to penicillin, compazine & morphine.\u00a0\u00a0The penicillin caused a very similar reaction - extreme itching.Could this itching be caused by my liver w/the possibility that it's somehow rejecting the islet cells that were transplanted as \"foreign\" & this is the immune response?\u00a0\u00a0However, without a spleen, how does the body react or elicit an immune response since as I understand it, the spleen IS the immune system?Thank you for reading this long post - I DO appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0Please provide some help & recommendations until I can get in to see an endocrinologist - it's driving me bananas!",
