            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you, obtain a history, and review your testing, it is very difficult for me to know why your doctor ordered the GTT. GTT could stand for different things and I can not know for sure what test that is, GTT could stand for several things!However, one possibility is that GTT ordered is \"glucose tolerance test\". If that is the case, this test basically entails you going to the lab, being given a sugary solution, and then your blood sugar is checked at intervals (usually 2 hours later). The goal of this test is to see how your body handles sugar; usually, it is ordered when diabetes is suspected. If you have diabetes or a pre-diabetic state, in which your body does not handle sugar well due to insulin resistance or deficiency, your GTT will be abnormal.Diabetes can cause peripheral nerve injury, leading to neuropathy, or a problem with the nerves to the arms, legs, and other areas. Symptoms could include tingling, burning, loss of sensation, weakness, blood pressure problems, and several other symptoms depending on which nerves are involved. If you are found to have diabetes, treatment could help prevent further damage to the nerves.Thank you for using the forum, I hope you find this information useful, good luck.",
