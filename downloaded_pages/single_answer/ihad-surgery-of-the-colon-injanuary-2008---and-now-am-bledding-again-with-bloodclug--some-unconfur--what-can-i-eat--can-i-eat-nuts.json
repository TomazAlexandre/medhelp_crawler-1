            "answer": "HiThanks the post. However it is too brief for us to give any kind of advice. Please tell us what kind of surgery was it, for what problem, any immediate post operative complication, your general health, weight and any diet restrictions advised by the doctors. Also we need to know if you have any problem like diabetes, liver or kidney problem etc which can affect the type of diet you should eat.Please send the details to enable us to help you better. Please consult your doctor immediately since bleeding that too clots after surgery or even without surgery is not good.",
