            "answer": "Hi!Since this is your fourth blood and pus filled blister, it would be worthwhile to get a culture sensitivity report done. This will help identify the organism and the antibiotic that will be effective against it.The other thing to do is to get your diabetes status checked. High blood sugar often causes recurrent skin infection/boils/blisters etc. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
