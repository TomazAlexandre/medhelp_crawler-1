            "answer": "KathChasMommy,I'm not a physician and I also believe a LOT in the \"gut feelings\" of attentive parents.\u00a0\u00a0I'd encourage you to call you son's doctor and to begin jotting down your observations about his behavior, moods, drinking, peeing, activity levels between now & when you get to see your doc.Whether his increased drinking is a marker of diabetes or of one of the other things you mentioned, it will be helpful to you all to know what's what.\u00a0\u00a0If it is diabetes, the earlier it's caught the better the experience can be.\u00a0\u00a0And, if it's not, you can put away that worry.Diabetes treatments now are so much more advanced than even when I was diagnosed (about 35 years ago as a teen).\u00a0\u00a0It is no less frightening for parents to get such a diagnosis, but I can assure you that treatment options are much more \"user friendly\" and much more effective than ever before in human history.\u00a0\u00a0I also firmly believe that research toward cures will bear good fruit soon.Will you let us know what you find out for your son?\u00a0\u00a0 Wishing you all the best.",

    "question": "My 2 yo son is demonstrating an increased desire to drink lately, but I'm not sure whether it's because he is truly excessively thirsty or because he is learning to use a cup and it's a new skill he's practicing. I'm worried, because in addition, he has had three infected/ingrown toenails to date, one of which required treatment with an oral antibiotic. (This has never happened with my three and a half year old.) Also, my father-in-law passed away at age 49 from complications of diabetes (Type 1) and my mother-in-law has type 2. Being adopted, I have no known family history. Not sure what to think. Can you help?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
