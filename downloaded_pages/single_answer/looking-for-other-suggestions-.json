            "answer": "I am so sorry for your loss. It sounds to me like you are doing everything possible to help yourself.\u00a0\u00a0This may not have been the best time to come of medication, you're still depressed. None of us like to take the medications, but for some of us it's the only way we can have a happy and productive life.\u00a0\u00a0Depression when not helped by therapy is usually here to stay and it's just like any other medical condition.\u00a0\u00a0If you were diagnosed with diabetes, you wouldn't think twice about taking the needed medication, and this is no different.\u00a0\u00a0You've done everything I would have suggested, and I applaude your efforts, but you don't mention any type of therapy.\u00a0\u00a0This is very beneficial after losing a loved one, they can give us new perspectives on things and teach us how to truly let go and move on.\u00a0\u00a0I would go this route at this point, between all you do and therapy, I think you can get past this depression.\u00a0\u00a0I've been where you are, and therapy helped me immensely.\u00a0\u00a0You've done everything else, I think it's a win-win situation.\u00a0\u00a0I do wish you all the best, I know how difficult this is, and you're trying so hard. Do take care.",

    "question": "I have been on prozac then effexor and over the last 2yrs switched to celexa for depression. Have recently as 2/2009 lost my husband of 19yrs and in April 2010 decided to try and get off meds... Working out/exercising 4-5days a week, tanning, church/praying and reading good books for grieving and letting go. But I have been very weepy/cry easily and snappy bit*hy and donot like it, trying to change on my own, with the help of weekly therapist sessions. I would love to not take the meds, feel like it may be my only way to maintain. Need other ways to help during this transition time... any and all suggestions accepted. thanks",
