            "answer": "Sorry to hear about your dad, it's not the 20% ejection fraction but the other issues you mentioned that led the Doctors to their decision. Your Doctors could give you a ball park but no one can say for sure. My dad died of lung cancer and my prayers are with you and your dad, the hospice setting is much better than a hospital room.",

    "question": "my dad collapsed 3 1/2 weweks ago (hx of lung CA,COPD,diabetes)- he ended up on the vetilator for 7days after being \"revived\". we were told that he had a \"small\" heart attack and ejection fraction of 20% with left ventrical damage. we were told that he is a very sick man, on top of all of this he has bilateral pulmonary emboli. we were told that he will be released after they get the GI infection under control ( we were told that he would be released to hospice) my question is- how long is the \"normal life expectancy with heart disease and all of the other problems\". he has been asymptomatic as far as cardiac- he did not have chest pain prior to collapsing.",
