When this all began, I felt it mostly in my joints and fatigue finally showing the pain in thighs starting with one thigh and ending in both and now the back.\u00a0\u00a0These do not feel structural, like bone problems.I have had no test done, just office exam with endo.My hyperthyroid meds caused they tyroid to go to the other extreme Hypothyroid and so I stoped taking the med and it went back to hyper again and now I am taking 1/2 dose.I also have Hyperprolactinemia on top of it all and ostoarthritis, unknown whether I have rh.

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Diabetic Amyotrophy about 1 yesr ago with symptoms of severe thigh pain,numb front of one thigh (from groin to knee), shooting pain with twitching,off balance, couldn't quite locate the ground sensorily, severe weakness in thigh and 40 pound weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0I went through a period of a few weeks where I couldn't stand completely straight at the hips so my hips swiveled to walk (upper front thigh, groin muscles wouldn't stretch all the way to a straight position, though it felt I had).I went on seizure meds which slightly reduced pain and off balance.\u00a0\u00a0I acquired a new pain in the lower back that was not structural.I was diagnosed soon after with hyperthyroid(Graves Desease) and gain back much strength and weight with thyroid meds.Now I am a year into this and no longer on seizure meds (took myself off) and feeling a new feeling of muscles in groin, butt and front and back thighs hurt like I exercised way to much (I did not)\u00a0\u00a0Could something else beside this be going on with related symptomology.\u00a0\u00a0Seems as soon as you say diabetes, that is the cause for everything.\u00a0\u00a0What do I do now?\u00a0\u00a0My sugar is under control and I have only had diabetes diagnosed for 6 years.\u00a0\u00a0I am on symlin and so blood glycose levels are balanced.\u00a0\u00a0Why am I not getting better?Thanks",
