At page top under Forums is another\u00a0\u00a0diabetes forum, Ask a Doctor, although no doctor is present since the departure of Dr Ramsetty in April of this year. Posted questions appear to be answered by patients not by any medical personnel.I can say this, nobody can give a prognosis w/o first reviewing the patients medical records, then discussing the current issues with the patient. What you're asking for is like asking, \"How long will I live?\".",
