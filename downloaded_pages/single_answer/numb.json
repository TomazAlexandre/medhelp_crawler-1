            "answer": "Hi there. The causes of lip numbness are raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, hyperventilation, hypocalcemia, trigeminal neuralgia and as a part of migraines. These could be vitamin deficiencies like B1, B5, B12 etc, diabetes, hypothyroidism and multiple sclerosis if there are other associated symptoms. Consult a neurologist for a detailed systemic examination and addressing of symptoms. Take care.",
