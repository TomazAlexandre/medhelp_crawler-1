            "answer": "Hello.Tingling is a neurological symptom. If the nerve is compressed or is affected by any disease, like the demyelinating disease, diabetes, etc, it produces symptoms of paresthesia (tingling, numbness, burning sensation).Did you have any injury to the neck recently ? A nerve root compression at the spine can produce such symptoms.Regards",
