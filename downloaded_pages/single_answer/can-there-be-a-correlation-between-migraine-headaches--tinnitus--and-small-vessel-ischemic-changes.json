            "answer": "Hi,Migraine headaches with aura may present with tinnitus but this is not a common presentation. Small vessel ischemic changes may cause tinnitus especially if this involves structures and blood supply to the inner ear. Auditory or hearing function is processed in the temporal lobe so temporal lobe involvement may manifest with hearing symptoms. A more peripheral (that is not involving the brain) component should also be ruled out. Your ENT tests appeared to be normal , is this correct?You previous migraines and the current tinnitus may not be related. Migraines may be brought about by a variety of factors. Tinnitus is usually a manifestation of a localized symptom such as an inner ear problem, a vascular and a nerve related problem.",

    "question": "I am a typically healthy 50 yr. old female who has had recent problems with tinnitus.\u00a0\u00a0After a routine hearing test, it was suggested I follow up with an ENT.\u00a0\u00a0After a thorough exam, I had an audiogram and then a recommended MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I received results this a.m. and one of the comments states it would be unusual for small vessel ischemic change since I have no history of hypertension or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0However, I used to get frequent migraine headaches.\u00a0\u00a0It also states that a low-grade glioma cannot be excluded.I am wondering if there could be a correlation between the migraine headaches I used to get and the tinnitus.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know how long I have had the tinnitus.\u00a0\u00a0After looking back, it could be anywhere from one month to over one year.\u00a0\u00a0Though, I rarely get migraines any more, I saw information that spoke to the small vessel ischemic change in some of these cases.",
