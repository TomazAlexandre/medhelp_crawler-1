            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Swelling of the foot and ankles with breathlessness, could indicate a cardiac disorder. Due to this the heart is not able to pump adequate blood to different organs in the body. In this process the kidneys too receive inadequate blood and to compensate for this start retaining sodium. When the sodium content in the blood increases it causes fluid to seep out and cause edema.Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. So please consult your primary care physician who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test to rule out a cardiac cause for the symptoms. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
