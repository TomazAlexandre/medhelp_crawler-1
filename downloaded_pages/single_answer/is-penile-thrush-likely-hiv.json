    "question": "I have been traveling in SE asia for about 3 years ...Three years ago I had sex with a girl with a condom.\u00a0\u00a0After sex I noticed some white goo from her on my pubes as I took the condom off (yeast I assume now).\u00a0\u00a0I did not wash right away.\u00a0\u00a0Within a week I developed a rash but did not treat immediately and it became a bad fungal infection of my penis/groin area all over.\u00a0\u00a0It cleared up after treating for a few weeks with canestan.\u00a0\u00a0I had no risk factors for HIV at that time (all protected sex).\u00a0\u00a0Since then I have had a few unprotected encounters with girls (past 2 years) (no sex workers, girls dated from online).\u00a0\u00a03 months ago after having vaginal exposure during sex with a new girl I noticed my penis was itchy the following week.\u00a0\u00a0I did see a faint reddish area in the groin and belly button where itched ..\u00a0\u00a0because of my prior experience I applied canestan cream and it cleared within a week.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly I took some antibiotics about a month ago and after completing noticed irritation at the tip of the penis and penis head sensitivity .. walking my penis would rub the inside of my pants and I could feel it get irritated.\u00a0\u00a0so I am applying canestan cream again.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have any other symptoms and otherwise feel healthy.\u00a0\u00a0My question is .. are these symptoms consistent with early HIV?\u00a0\u00a0Reading online makes it sound like Diabetes and HIV are the only likely causes of penile thrush.\u00a0\u00a0Very concerned",
