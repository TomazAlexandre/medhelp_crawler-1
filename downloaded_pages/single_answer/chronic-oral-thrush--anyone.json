    "question": "I suffer from Chronic Oral Thrush. I don't have HIV as I've never had an exposure. I would assume I don't have Diabetes because I'm thin, eat a good diet, and I'm it overall good health.I've went to the doctor for this twice. He told me it was thrush and told me it was because of my terrible anxiety.I do suffer from horrible anxiety. Mostly health anxiety. It go so bad a few months ago I convinced myself I had so many types of cancer, etc. I eventually had a panic attack. During all this I developed the thrush, I noticed when I had my panic attack it got worse.Now, my thrush doesn't look like the typical oral thrush I read about on the internet. It doesn't look like cottage cheese. It more flat creamy lesions that are white around the outside with maybe a little red on the inside. These never hurt, and it always stays contained inside my bottom lip and on the sides of my tongue. Symptoms are never that bad at all. Only get a 3-5 lesions at a time. Soon after I get them they begin to go away and my immune system fights them off completely in about a week. Then the cycle continues.Now the reason why I'm concerned is because for the past month I've done pretty good with my anxiety. Just the normal stress stuff from work and stuff, but nothing major at all like before. I noticed I still get the sores sometimes. I don't think it's as bad as it was maybe. But I noticed I was worried about it last night and today I have another one.So my question is. Does ANYONE out there have this too? I feel like I'm the only one. Do I just live with this the rest of my life? I'm scared it' going to take a huge tole on my immune system.Any advice?",
