    "question": "I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism last may of 2015. The doc prescribed me levothyroxine 25 mg. I've been taking it for the last six months. Last mon during sept I had a tingly sensation in my right arm and a dull ache on the left side of my chest.At the er they took a blood test,\u00a0\u00a0echocardiogram, chest x-ray, checked my vitals and urine. They told me to stay overnight for observation and placed an iv tube on my left arm. They also told me they take two more blood tests. One in the morning and one in the afternoon.They hooked a monitor to my body to constantly check my heart rate, blood pressure during the night. The next day after the tests. They told me the results. My cardiac enzyme levels were fine. I had no high blood pressure, no diabetes ,no high cholesterol. The echocardiogram test results wouldn't be answered until mon oct the fifth. :(Finally, they want to give me a stress test on mon the fifth with a radioactive dye.After leaveing the hospital on tues. I now have two new symptoms that I never had before.I have muscle weakness and tiredness. I would rate them both at 20% or 30%. It comes and goes during the day.The feeling on my left side of my chest is almost gone. However it is still there only more subtle.When I first took my medication. I had slight tremors to my eye, arm, leg . After that went away I had neck pain even though I didn't hurt my neck. When that went away I had coughing, nausea in the morning or when I would eat something 50% of the time. Now im dealing with this muscle weakness, tiredness., shortness of breathe.I exercise, changed my diet etc. Is the medication doing this to me?",
