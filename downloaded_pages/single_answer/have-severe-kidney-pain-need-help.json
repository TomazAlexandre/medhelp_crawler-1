            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Since you have kidney pain and had a recent episode of UTI, kidney problems could be the cause of the swelling of the feet. Please refer to an urologist and get a complete panel of kidney function tests done.The swelling of feet could also be due to water retention as in low protein in blood, heart problems, pressure on the dorsal aorta, severe anemia, deep vein thrombosis, liver diseases etc. It could be due to hypothyroidism too. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You can refer to this link for a complete list of possible causes for ankle, leg and feet swelling: http://en.diagnosispro.com/differential_diagnosis-for/bilateral-leg-edema-swelling/39352-154.html",
