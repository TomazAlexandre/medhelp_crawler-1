    "question": "Hi all, Im new here. Im 31+5, and I can no longer stand my bf anymore. This past week, ive gotten into it with his sister who got mad at me for not driving her somewhere and when I tried to tell him what had happened, he said why am I talking about it? thats his sister, and it doesnt concern him. That last comment pissed me off to where I havent been speaking to him!! We are acting as if each other isnt there. Now his bff visting 24/7!! I mean, if I wanted to talk or spend time, I cant because hes either always at the house or my bf is always leaving with him. We have 1 child together and one on the way. Am I overreacting?? I have been crying to myself and eventually I will go OFF on everyone. I also have gest diabetes and I know the stress isn't good but I've been pissed for days now. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks girls.",
