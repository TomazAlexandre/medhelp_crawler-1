            "answer": "Hello,I cannot confirm anything without a complete medical history and clinical examination. It may be possible that sexual arousal is causing an urge to urinate but at the same time you need to rule out other possible causes of this increased frequency of urination. Urinary tract infection, cystitis, diabetes, prostate enlargement all can lead to increased urinary frequency. It is best to consult a urologist and get your doubts clarified. Do keep us posted.Take care and regards!",
