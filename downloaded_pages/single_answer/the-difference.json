            "answer": "Hi,Fibromyalgia and neuropathy are entirely different entities. Fibromyalgia is described as inflammation of the fibrous or connective tissue of the body. Widespread muscle pain, fatigue, and multiple tender points characterize this condition. The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown. Sometimes it occurs in several members of a family, suggesting that it may be an inherited disorder. People with fibromyalgia mostly complain of three primary symptoms: muscle and joint pain, stiffness, and fatigue.Neuropathy signifies any and all diseases or malfunction of the nerves. Causes of neuropathy are- Diabetes, Nutritional deficiencies (B-12 and folate), chemical exposures, pressure on nerves, or medications (such as some of those used for chemotherapy or to treat AIDS), herpes zoster infection, chronic or acute trauma (including surgery) and various neurotoxins. Neuropathic pain is common in cancer as a direct result of the cancer on peripheral nerves (e.g., compression by a tumor) and as a side effect of many chemotherapy drugs. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",
