            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Even if the MRI does not show any compression, often a person suffers from pains similar to radiculopathy. This can be diagnosed via EMG/NCV.The treatment is conservative with pain killer, physiotherapy, traction, spinal manipulation etc.Other than this the pain could be due to arthritis (osteo or rheumatoid) or due to peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes, hypothyroidism etc.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I've been having all kinds of pain down my left leg, including buttocks, for 6 months or more now. A lumbar MRI ruled out the nerve being compressed at the spine. My neurologist was not interested in diagnosing further and just prescribed me neurontin and left it at that. However, I am convinced I have piriformis syndrome.I still get sharp pain in my buttocks, hip pain, thigh pain in varying locations, intensity, and radius, knee pain (and crunching noises. I assume not related), calf and shin pain, and ankle pain. Currently, I have a stabbing in my buttocks and my outer thigh has an ache/pressure feeling made worse by pressing on it. None of my other pains, as far as I've noticed, have been exacerbated by pressure. Is this part of sciatic nerve compression or possibly a different pathology?",
