            "answer": "Hi there!Temporary erectile dysfunction can develop in young adults due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, or you have difficulty controlling anxiety; I would suggest seeing your primary care physician or a urologist for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",
