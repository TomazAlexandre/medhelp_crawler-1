    "question": "I have had relatively high cholesterol (about 200). I have been taking statins for a couple years and my levels have lowered greatly. Now my doctor has recommended that I have an ultrasound test to determine if I have blockages. I guess I will have it done since he has recommended it, but it has me worried. Does the recommendation mean that I probably have blockages? I'm slightly overweight (6'4\" 225 lbs though I have lost about 30 lbs in the past year), I have never smoked, I don't have diabetes, my blood pressure is normal. I have been doing the 10,000 step walking program for several years now and I do 5K walks frequently. I never have experienced any chest pains, numbness, etc. I am 52 years old and a male so that is a risk factor. If I do have blockages what are the prognosis for a healthy life going forward?",
