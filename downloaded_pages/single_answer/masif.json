            "answer": "Hello.May I know the reason why she was admitted ? Is it possible for you to describe the events that lead to her unconscious state.I understand that she has diabetes, hypertension and epilepsy. I can only guess that she may have had either an episode of increased blood pressure leading to a stroke. But I would really appreciate if you can narrate the EEG report here.Since her breathing is supported, you have to keep a regular watch on the brain activity with the EEG.Hope to hear from you soon .Regards",
