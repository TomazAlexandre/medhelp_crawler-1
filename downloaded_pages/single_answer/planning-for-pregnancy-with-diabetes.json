            "answer": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0My advice is to make sure you are eating well, drinking plenty of water and exercising.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diabetic since I was 10 and have two healthy children.\u00a0\u00a0You sound like you are doing a good job already since your Hba1c is normal.\u00a0\u00a0You will want to keep very tight control now and continue all through your pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I kept my numbers very low and was rewarded with healthy normal weight children.\u00a0\u00a0If your blood sugars aren't in good control there is the danger of having a large baby.\u00a0\u00a0Also another suggestion would be to take extra special care of your teeth.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you are getting enough calcium.\u00a0\u00a0I say this because you mentioned periodontal disease.\u00a0\u00a0I know with both of my children I got cavities. I guess that is pretty common and not just with diabetic women, something about the babies take what they need from your body.\u00a0\u00a0And try not to be anxious, stress isn't the greatest when you are trying to get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Try to relax--easier said than done--but try not to think about it all day--keep your mind and body busy!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!\u00a0\u00a0Being pregnant isn't easy and being diabetic makes pregnancy harder--but worth every minute when I see my smiling children!",
