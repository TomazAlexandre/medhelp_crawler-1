            "answer": "Hi!Well, ALS is a mixed motor neuron disease with lower motor neuron symptoms predominating. It is very difficult to comment whether your have ALS or not. To confirm that a doctor has to find signs of both upper (muscle weakness, decreased motor control, inability to perform fine movements, increased spinal reflexes, and positive Babinski sign\u2014great toe going up) and lower motor (muscle weakness, abnormal EMG etc) neuron signs in one limb.Symptoms of many of these diseases do mimic ALS. ALS like symptoms can be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, spinal nerve compression high up in the cervical spine, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, electrolyte disturbance, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or due to bad posture. Lyme and lupus are the other possibilities. These other possibilities need to be looked at.Electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction velocity (NCV), muscle biopsy, etc are done to confirm diagnosis or rule out ALS. The most common causes of predominant lower motor neuron disease are polio, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, C. botulism, and cauda equina syndrome. Since you also have a limp and foot drop, polio and and cauda equina syndrome should be ruled out first.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. If ALS is the diagnosis, then it is a slow progressive disease, and not curable. Life expectancy can vary from 3-4 years to 10 years post diagnosis. Take care!",

    "question": "I was diagnosed 1/31/12 the doctor said was more active in lower neurons than upper, though there was some upper activity.He said i could live another 15 years. Is he being overly generous in that information? I've had symptoms for more than 18 months I'm on 2 feet,but have right foot drop,limp alot. My arm movements are limited and arm strength going still have good handshake but have hard time lifting things. The prospect of dying in the next three years or so does'nt seem real. My sister hopes I have late stage Lyme disease. If it's primarily in lower neurons is life expextancy longer? Input would be appreciated",
