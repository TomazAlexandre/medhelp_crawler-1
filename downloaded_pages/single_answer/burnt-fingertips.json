            "answer": "Hello,For such symptoms dermatitis skin and parasthesia should be ruled out. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the burning\u00a0\u00a0is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then get it evaluated from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi There,My husband is an IT consultant. He once used a laptop for at least 3 weeks having some kind of over-heating issues, that resulted in burning sensation in his fingertips (left hand only, as he is left-handed). The burning sensation is exactly at the point of contact with the keyboard. Burning was also there at the part of his wrist that touched the keyboard. The problem was gone when he changed the laptop, but after that even a small contact with heat results in burning of the tips. I just want to know, how this problem can be fixed? And usually how long do these internal burns take to heal completely. He hasn't seen the physician yet.",
