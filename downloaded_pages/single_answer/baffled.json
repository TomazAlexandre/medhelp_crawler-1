            "answer": "Dear Lori:Sorry about your problem.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to diagnose over the internet without the chance to physically exam and see all the lab results.\u00a0\u00a0Bell's palsy is usually from things we can't assay for, meaning idiopathic (the idiot doctors don't know).\u00a0\u00a0However, it can be associated with evil things such as lymphoma, scaroid, varicella, congenital disorders (likely your too old for these), lyme and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Likely, your physician ruled these things out.\u00a0\u00a0He/She used steriods and herpes antiviral medications thinking that it might be herpes varicella or a post-viral process.\u00a0\u00a0Since your symptoms have been going on for about a year, it is likely that you don't have a progessive life ending process occurring (I bet you already new this).\u00a0\u00a0There is no muscle weakness in your posting so that is very good and ALS is not in the picture.I think that for your peace of mind a return visit to the neurologist would help.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is that most of what your having is a post-viral induced syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Your twitching is likely benign fasciculations and not to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0They do no physical harm but psychologically they can be a devil.\u00a0\u00a0I know because I have them also.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "I have had this ongoing saga for over a year now of twitching, persistent tingling in my hands and feet, a one week episode of no bladder pressure, a weird tremor or shock sensation that goes down my back but sometimes up into my head and a two week bout w/Bell's Palsy.\u00a0\u00a0All testing took place one year ago anf=d the only abnormalities were low Urea Creatinine and Nitrogen on my CBC and a slowed Distal Latency on my left foot for the NCV.\u00a0\u00a0No EMG,but spinal and MRI of head.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, when I has Bell's Palsy my regualr docotr gave me FAMVIR and Prednisone and this helped relieve some of the other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Does this suggest an autoimmune cause and in light of my NVC, should I have an EMG?\u00a0\u00a0Also, I know you will say no, but have you any ideas of what is afflicting me?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
