    "question": "I just received lab results that showed elevated creatinine (1.11; lab says 0.5-1.1 is normal), normal BUN (10.00; lab says 10-25 normal), GFR normal (87.54; 60-999 normal). I'm concerned because of my elevated creatinine and while GFR is normal, it's below 90, which I read is used a cutoff for diagnosing chronic kidney disease (along with other criteria). I'm 36, healthy weight, female, otherwise healthy. I am concerned because I don't have high blood pressure or diabetes, which are the two most common factors for CKD. What else could this be? I'm afraid of something like a kidney tumor.",
