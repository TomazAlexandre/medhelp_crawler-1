Just did treadmill and felt the dull tummy pain on R side again. I also feel a little heartburn and like food isn't going below my waist.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas? I've had regular colonoscopy, have gall bladder removed, a lot of loose stools after eating something fatty, have diabetes, 61 years old. Thanks so much.",
