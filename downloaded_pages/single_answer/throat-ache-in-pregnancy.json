    "question": "I am 30 weeks pregnant, last whole month I suffered from sore throat and cough, I couldnt take any medicine except ginger honey tea and sugary losenzes. Coughing stopped but throat ache is still persisting, the worst part is that all my regular lifestyle was badly affected which resulted in gestational diabetes. I am highly depressed because of both. Now I cant take honey as it shoots my sugar level and also avoiding the walk and other outdoor activities because of dreadful weather. Dont know how to cope with throat ache and sweetness.",
