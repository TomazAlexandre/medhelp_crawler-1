            "answer": "All hospitals have nutritionists that can talk to patients.\u00a0\u00a0You didn't say how obese you mother is or if she has any other health problems. I gather that the doctor isn't as worried about you mother's weight as you are. People do gain as they age and that is a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0Fat cells produce a number of their own hormones and may \"take over\" for the ovaries as they begin to stop hormone production.\u00a0\u00a0Fat cells in the aged also give them a \"food source\" against illness, whereby that storage of fat may \"feed\" the body when she becomes very ill and can't eat for herself for a few days.\u00a0\u00a0People usually begin gaining about one pound per year after the age of 40 to accomodate these mentioned functions. Gall baldder disease isn't uncommon in this age group no matter the weight of the woman, nor is acquiring diabetes, especially if it \"runs\" in the family.\u00a0\u00a0Unless your mother is more than 30 pounds overweight, try relaxing the worry cells.\u00a0\u00a0Check with the nutritionist and make sure her diet is a healthy one and don't worry so much about what the bath scales are saying.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck",

    "question": "My mother is 62 years old and obese.\u00a0\u00a0She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few years ago and is now admitted to a local hospital with an inflamed gall bladder.\u00a0\u00a0She is to receive IV antibiotics until surgery can be performed.\u00a0\u00a0I do not believe that her physician is being frank with her regarding her eating habits and how it is affecting her health.\u00a0\u00a0Is there someone in the hospital that can talk to her and make her understand that she is killing herself with food?",
