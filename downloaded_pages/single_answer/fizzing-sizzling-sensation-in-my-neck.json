            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Tinnitus (ringing in ear) and certain neurological disorders such as paresthesia (caused by diabetes, pinched nerves, Lyme\u2019s, lupus, thyroid disorders etc) and central neuropathic pain are similar in many ways. So, yes, you can suffer from tinnitus and pain and/or numbness at the same time or one may precede the other. This is because the same part of central nervous system controls the impulses from the auditory nervous system and somatosensory systems. Changes in the brain or these systems can cause a cross-connection (just a term used to simplify the system) between the two seemingly unrelated systems of the body.To treat this tinnitus, the nerve compression will need to be treated with physiotherapy, pain killers, spinal manipulation, traction etc. Please discuss this with your specialist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "The above occurs on a non stop basis travelling upwards to my skull. I think that a breakdown has been imminent when the deafening noise overrides the television, headphones or anything really. Therefore there is no escape. I have a pinched nerve, and arthritis between C5/C6 and C6/C7 and then also in the gap linking and including T1/T2. It appears to be worse in bed when the whole of my head feels as if it is an inflated item that needs to release air. Even when I put pressure against my back while sitting it sends the aural ante skywards.I think I am losing it as nobody knows what the hell I am talking about.I have a busy lifestyle helping young kids develop skills and confidence-but my skills and confidence have been seriously unhinged by everything apart from the Sound of Silence!",
