            "answer": "Dear madam, welcome to the neurology forum of medhelp. Thanks for writing in. causes of burning pain in foot canbe due to mechanical overload or prolonged standing and overweight. Other causes of neuropathy like diabetes, chronic alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies(mostly B) and heavy metal poisonings. Thrombocytopenia and pernicious anemia can cause burning feet. Nerve entrapment syndromes like tarsal tunnel syndrome and reflex sympathetic dystrophy or complex regional pain syndrome( following trauma/surgery) can cause burning sensation in the foot. Arthritis and sciatic mononeuropathy can also be responsible. Treatment would involve wearing good fitting shoes, cotton socks, shock absorbing insoles to make prolonged standing bearable. An orthopaedician\u2019s consultation to correct effects of nerve entrapments and arthritis ,correction of vitamin deficiencies, alcohol abstinence, diabetes evaluation. Pain physician would deal with if complex regional pain syndrome is suspected to be the cause. Pain relief with over the counter analgesics like volterol\u00a0\u00a0would help till definitive treatment is possible. I hope this information helps. Please feel free to ask me for any further clarification.",
