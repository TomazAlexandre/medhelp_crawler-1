            "answer": "Hi,The CT scan rule out any acute and active bleeding such as a hemorrhage which requires immediate attention.It also ruled out any tumors or mass at the moment.This should allay your fears.Small infarcts that may have occured in the past and yet left no neurological residues clinically have been noted and these may contribute to the present symptoms .Has she been ok prior to her present condition? Or has she presented with the headaches,dizziness and ear fullness\u00a0\u00a0for a long time already?Just note any sudden change in the character of the pain,numbness of extremities, vomiting, loss of balance,slurring of speech, or confusion as this may suggest a more acute problem.Ear fullness and dizziness may also point to a peripheral problem that does not involve the brain ( eg nerves, ear infection).Does she have any diabetes, cardiovascular problems ( like a previous heart attack, thyroid problems, nutritional problems?Is she taking any meds like aspirin? Does her gum bleed easily?Stay calm .The CT Scan has showed no acute changes and at this point appears to be clear. Just continue to reassure your mother and get her to exercise everyday. Talking to her everyday will help you document her condtion.I hope this helps.Good luck.",

    "question": "My 80 yr. old mother in law is presenting wiyh dizziness, full sensation right ear and right sided head pain. Her Cat scan \"demonstrated a prominent fluid density in the posterior fossa both sides of the midline. It does not show a mass like effect. This appearance suggests a giant cisternae magna.In the right cerebral hemishere close to the midline, there is a small oval lucency measuring 15mm in diameter. This may represent partial volume averaging, however a small subacute infarct could not be excluded. There are also multiple small hypodensities, one in the left caudate nucleus, one in the head of the right caudate nucleus, one in the anterior limb of the right internal capsule. These suggest small ischemic changes or small old infarctions.No intracranial hemorrage or mass demonstrated.\"Her eye, ear, nose and throat doctor has recently been diagnosed with cancer and won't be returning to practice. The waiting list for the other local specialist is 1 1/2 years! Should I pursue immediate help in another locality? Please help me understand the situation here.",
