            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. A nerve conduction study and EMG may be helpful in differentiating whether your symptoms are due to neuropathy or myopathy. Also, the symptoms could be due to infection (pelvic inflammatory disease), displaced coccyx bone, or due to peripheral neuropathy secondary to autoimmune disorders, diabetes, B12 deficiency etc. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have a multitude of symptoms. About a year ago I was at the dr for a regular female exam. The dr was just starting a pap smear and it was without a doubt the most painful one I had ever been through. The dr asked me if I had suffered any major trauma and I asked why then she replied well your coxyx bone is abnormally low. Which would explain why it was so painful. The clamp apparently hit my coxyx bone. Sinse then I have had emense (chronic) pain in my lower back and tailbone and I also recently discovered I no longer have reflexes in either of my legs and they constantly hurt. There's no budging or herniated disc in my lower back and my dr cant figure out what the heck is going on. I wondered if anybody out there can give me any clue as to what is wrong with me.",
