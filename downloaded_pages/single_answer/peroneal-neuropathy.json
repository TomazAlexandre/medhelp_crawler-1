            "answer": "Hi, possibly it is related with peroneal neuropathy and do consult neurologist. Some of the common symptoms with peroneal neuropathy are:\u2022\u201cIf the lesion is severe, a complete foot drop that spares plantar flexion and foot inversion is noted.\u2022The gait will be high-stepping with \"foot slapping.\"\u2022In milder cases, weakness of foot eversion and dorsiflexion may be noted only by asking the patient to walk on his or her heels.\u2022Tapping of the nerve at the fibular head may produce pain and tingling in the peroneal sensory nerve distribution.\u2022Distribution of peroneal sensory disturbance assists in localizing the lesion. Numbness in the lower part of the lateral distal leg suggests superficial peroneal sensory involvement, while numbness of the upper part of the lateral distal leg suggests deep peroneal sensory distribution. With common peroneal lesions, sensory loss is noted over the lateral calf and dorsum of the foot but spares the fifth toe\u201d.Taken from website http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/topic588.htm",

    "question": "I have a friend who fell on his knees, hard, about 5 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0He had a lot of swelling for about 3 weeks that eventually went away.\u00a0\u00a0He started having problems with his feet after he fell and they have gotten progressively worse.\u00a0\u00a0 He has numbness and tingling in his legs and feet.\u00a0\u00a0When he sits down with his legs out his toes point down and kind of get stuck in that position and he can't straighten them out.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't really have any problems walking, all seems to be ok when he is standing or walking.\u00a0\u00a0He says that the numbness and tingling is still there though. He can't stand on his heels but he can stand on his toes.\u00a0\u00a0He had an emg / nerve conduction study that indicated severe peroneal neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0He is seeing an orthopedic foot doctor who doesn't think that the results of the emg/ nerve conduction study and problem with the feet is related and doesn't think that the fall had anything to do with either problem.\u00a0\u00a0the doctor has gone so far to say that its all in his head and doesn't seem interested in finding out about the peroneal neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0His family doctor had blood work done because he thought it was due to diabetes or thyroid or other problems.\u00a0\u00a0All the blood work was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have been trying to get him to see another doctor and have been encouraging him to see a neurologist instead of orthopedic.\u00a0\u00a0I found this web site and decided to write to ask if its possible that all of the symptoms are intertwined with peroneal neuropathy and if so, could he have done this when he fell?\u00a0\u00a0Am I right in trying to get him to see a neurologist instead of the foot doctor?",
