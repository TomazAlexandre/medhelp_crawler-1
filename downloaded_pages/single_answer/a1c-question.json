    "question": "I have major anxiety problems, and am worrying about diabetes. I'm 5\"6 1/2 and 126lbs (female). Had my doc do an A1c, and it came back at 5.6%. Would that be considered prediabetic?The lab norm said 4.8%-6.0%, but I posted on another board and said that an A1c in a non-diabetic should be less then 5%.Just wondering if this means I have prediabetes. Thanks!",
