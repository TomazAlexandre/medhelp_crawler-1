            "answer": "If it gets really really bad, and\u00a0\u00a0I know this has been ten hours now...then you might need to seek out urgent care because of your heart and kidneys. I cannot advise what to do on this, but do they have you on anything for water retention at all? If you are having any trouble breathing or your BP is up you really need to get into the doctor if you continue having this. Easier said than done for some of us I know. Maybe elevating your legs might help, I am not sure. Please just take care and get better soon. Peace",
