            "answer": "Okey dokey...You have out-of-the-textbook symptoms of an insulin utilization syndrome. As in diabetes.Don't run to your doctor. Instead, saddle up the pony and head to town and ask your local surgeon-barber to schedule you for a test called an Hba1c. A fasting-glucose test or insulin clamp procedure might also be in order.",

    "question": "I have had symptoms really for several years but lately realised this is not normal. Not having health insurance at the moment after some life changing events does not make me run to the Dr.I would so appreciate any advice on this.I am a 59 year old woman, pretty good fit, do regular modest exercise. Been in good health all my life.Anyway, my symptoms are blurry vision especially in the am and very, very drowsy driving at night to point of being unable to stay awake.Also general fatigue, need caffeine to at all function or get out of the house. Poor concentration ability.No headaches, or dizziness though. Good appetite, no weight loss etc.Understand it is impossible to diagnose on line, but could it be an inner ear problem? Had some\u00a0\u00a0temporary aches in my inner ear. or a cataract,\u00a0\u00a0but that does not explain the lethargy.Will of course go to a clinic but they are very limited in time and resources.Thanks beforehandThis discussion is related to/posts/show/297435.",
