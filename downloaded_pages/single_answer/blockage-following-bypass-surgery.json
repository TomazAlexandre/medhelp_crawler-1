            "answer": "Well the disease process that caused the blockages in the first place remains, so you must maintain the diabetes and you cholesterol under very good control. HgbA1C under 6 % and LDL under 70, systolic blood pressure under 125 mm HG. Also dietary restrictions to keep your triglycerides under 150 or if diet is not sufficient then start taking niacin.If you adhere to all of these recommendation then you will have minimized the risk of progression of coronary artery disease.
