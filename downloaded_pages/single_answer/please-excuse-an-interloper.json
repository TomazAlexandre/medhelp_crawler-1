            "answer": "Hi!To treat these tremors you have to find the cause. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You will need blood sugar monitoring, MRI of brain and cervical spine, T3, T4, TSH, sleep studies, serum electrolytes, brain EEG, etc to reach a diagnosis. Take care!",

    "question": "I am not diagnosed with also, nor do I think I have it. My disease is too slow. However, I would dearly appreciate any help. I have tremors that started as humming sensation in upper right leg, which spread to both legs and arms. Most recently in back and sides of torso and neck. I have fibromyalgia so thought it wasn't really muscles. Now there is no doubt but tremors, if that is what they are, can be felt by others though not usually visible.\u00a0\u00a0I believed it was muscle fatigue making me tired and now neuro agrees. I'm on. 05 mg klonopin 2x daily. How long before I should get some relief? So far off ly k ocks me out.Anything I can do. Hands vibrate/shake just from pulling up the covers T night, legs and back if I turn over. Is there anything other than another med to ease muscles? Pain limits me but I'll try...Thanks. I know u have a lot to deal with and appreciate any help. Did anyone try klonopin with no relief?Thanks again.",
