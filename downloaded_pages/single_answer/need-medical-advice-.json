    "question": "i have a question, if i smoke marijuana once, not even that much, it had been my first time in about three months because i had gotten caught w/ it, at that time i had been kind of\u00a0\u00a0a chronic user about once a day. but that was three months ago and im sure my body is rid of that. but i smoked last saturday for the first time in about three months and i was wondering about how long till it wud be out of my system, i smoked a pretty small amount, not even a half of a gram. i have diabetes does that effect how long it stays in my system? i was just wondering how long you think it wud take to get rid of naturally. i took a at home drug test and its been 4days\u00a0\u00a0since i smoked and i believe it came up negative, is that possible tho after four days? i have a job interview coming up and i kno for a fact they test you. so i was wondering wat you think?sincerelydan",
