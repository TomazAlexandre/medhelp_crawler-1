    "question": "Just went to see urologist and he put me on 2 weeks of cipro as I expected for prostrate. It helps the pain in my back and discomfort in bladder when it is really working but when it starts to where off the pain comes back. Is it helping or just bringing down inflamation temporarily. My main concern is the fatigue I am feeling, is this a possible prostitatis symptom, i feel like I have a fever but no temp?? And lower back pain, nurse said this is not a symptom of prostitatis? been through all blood/urine work for diabetes and infections and all clear. Seeing him again in 2 weeks any tests I should ask for? Thanks",
