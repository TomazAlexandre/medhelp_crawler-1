    "question": "My 14 year old daughter has had type 1 diabetes since age 2.\u00a0\u00a0She has an insulin pump.\u00a0\u00a0She also has anxiety and OCD and has seen a psychiatrist for over 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0She is currently taking Zoloft (150mg/daily) and she started taking 50mg Seroquel at night.\u00a0\u00a0She began taking the full 50mg Seroquel about a week ago.For the past two days, her blood sugar levels have been through the roof.\u00a0\u00a0We have changed her site, changed the location of her site, opened a new bottle of insulin, etc. etc.\u00a0\u00a0Could this high blood sugar trend be due to the Seroquel?\u00a0\u00a0The Seroquel has been helping her anxiety (she just started high school) so I hate to have her go off it.Thanks,Lori",
