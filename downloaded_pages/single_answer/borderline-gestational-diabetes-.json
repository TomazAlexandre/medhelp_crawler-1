            "answer": "They should have gone over diet with you. I was also at the borderline, but so thankful I didn't have it since I already had hypoglycemia since my early teenage years. Just try to eat lots of proteins, and try not to eat stuff like white bread, white pasta, sugary desserts, and candy. Every once in a while, I treat myself with some pasta, as long as it is whole grain, and I will have a small piece of candy occasionally,\u00a0\u00a0but it is best to avoid that stuff and switch to fruits and veggies. Just not watermelon. I've heard that can really mess up your blood sugar.",

This is my first pregnancy so I'm clueless..my doctor told me I was slightly measuring ahead but nothing major",
