            "answer": "Hi!The commonest cause of high ferritin is hemochromatosis, which is ruled out in your case.A high ferritin level with normal iron saturation is seen in conditions like\u00a0\u00a0alcoholic or infective liver disease, chronic inflammatory disease such as arthritis or asthma, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes. All these conditions can cause muscle ache and fatigue. Discuss with your doctor and run tests to rule these out. Take care!",

    "question": "I went for a blood test a while back and discovered that i had a high ferritin level. My doc at the time said this could be because of too much iron in the blood and that i was possibly a haemochromotosis carrier and asked me to do another blood test for haemo / iron. This test came back negative. So what else could explain why i had an elevated ferritin level?",
