    "question": "I have been taking antibiotics for a what i believe must have been a bacterial infection in my lungs. (I had laryngitis)It was given 20 pills of Amoxicillin Clavulanate Potassium for 10 days. 875mg /125mg. My voice has cleared up and has been clear for a couple of days. I was told that even thought i might feel fine i should finish the bottle. The problem is that two days ago my penis started itching a bit. I have been so busy with work and school the only time i got to check on it was during the showers i took. today i took the time to check on it and do internet research and i think what i have is \"Antibiotic candidiasis (also known as \"Iatrogenic candidiasis\") [Yeast infection]\" The pics provided on WebMB are very similar to what i have (Of course less severe). I still have 2.5 days of medication. Should i stop using the medicine? I really need to know i cannot make time to see my doctor again. And i would like a answer before i take any more pills.Im 19, Im 250lbs, and 5'10\u00a0\u00a0(Yes im aware im overweight)I am not sexually activeI dont drink or smokeI dont have diabetes or asthma or anything like that.(Sorry if this is in the wrong section)",
