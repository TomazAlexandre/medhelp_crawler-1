    "question": "My son is 24 and has been diabetic since he was 12.\u00a0\u00a0I still go with him to his doctor visits partly because over the years he has had some doctors that we have had to wait 2-3 hours to see.\u00a0\u00a0He also doesn't really like to go to the doctors because he knows they are always going to say this is wrong or that is wrong.\u00a0\u00a0His a1c runs 7.2, he does struggle with high blood pressure, and yes there is always some improvement that might help, but now most of the advice sounds more like criticism.--he checks his blood about 10 times a day. So I think he likes me there for moral support--I really don't say much other than hi; he is the one who discusses whatever with the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my real question is, is it ok that he still wants me at the appointments, and that most of the time I try to be available to go?",
