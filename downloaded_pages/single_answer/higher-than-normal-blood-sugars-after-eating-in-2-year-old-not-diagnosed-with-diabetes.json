            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It's normal for healthy kids and adults to have their blood sugars go high temporarily after eating a high carb food.\u00a0\u00a0It's also normal for healthy people to go low if they don't get enough food.\u00a0\u00a0The issue is with whether or not they recover, which is also shown by the fasting glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0Different people react differently to foods, so it's possible that your daughter could go that high, even though 258 is higher than normal.\u00a0\u00a0Did you wash her hands well before the test?\u00a0\u00a0That can change her score as well.Her fasting test numbers are good, so I wouldn't be all that concerned.\u00a0\u00a0You can take her in for a more full blood test which would actually show whether the antibodies for diabetes and pre-diabetes are in her system.\u00a0\u00a0It's always good to check, in my opinion, just to be sure.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed as being in the \"danger zone\" for type 2 diabetes; I am 33.\u00a0\u00a0My mom and grandma both have type two diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0When I got the glucose meter, I checked everyone in the family.\u00a0\u00a0My two year old daughter had a reading of 258.\u00a0\u00a0However, she had eaten a small piece of a cookie about 40 minutes before the reading.\u00a0\u00a0Her doctor told me to take a reading while fasting.\u00a0\u00a0The readings were 78 the next day and 87 the following day.\u00a0\u00a0He said she was fine, and I stopped checking her.\u00a0\u00a0Three weeks later, while I was checking my blood sugars two hours after breakfast, my two year old asked me to \"check her finger.\"\u00a0\u00a0Two and a half hours after eating 1 serving of honey nut cheerios and two whooper candies and nothing else, her reading was 187.\u00a0\u00a0Her eyes are bothering her, she is itchy sometimes, she is always hungry, moderately thirsty, etc... I called the Dr. again after the reading.\u00a0\u00a0They are sending her for the glucose tolerance test.\u00a0\u00a0Question...would a non-diabetic have readings that high after consuming small amounts of simple sugars-even 2.5 hours later?\u00a0\u00a0Her fasting checks are fine.\u00a0\u00a0I am confused.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I will know more soon, but does anyone have any answers?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time.",
