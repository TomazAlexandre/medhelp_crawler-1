            "answer": "Hi there and thanks so much for your question at the Brain Body fitness forum!.This response should never replace any medical advice...I totally hear your concern and that is a common feeling in fitness. The process of feeling fatigues it is very similar to when you are training with an empty stomach where fatigue kicks in sooner than later. It really sounds that you experience a drop in blood sugars and it is really important that you prevent that from happening again. People with diabetes if they sugar levels drop to the minimum level when exercising, can lose conscious and maybe die so it is extremely important that you watch your level of blood sugars.The process you are describing it can really happen if you are not feeding the right nutrients to you muscles, brain joints and body. Imagine that before a run or some weight training your glycogen stores (muscle energy) are empty or even full of protein or fats your fatigue levels will come in much sooner than with the right nutrients. Having said this what are the right nutrients? Number 1: Carbohydrates are the most essential nutrient for your muscles and the blood sugars in your brain: Try taking a 200 calorie like nuts, health bar, low sugar drink or walnuts. Then do the exercise and never to fatigue meaning that your heart should stay most of your workout in the aerobic range (55%-75% of maximum heart rate). The more intense the workout the more nutrients your body needs.After the workout make sure you replenish your body with protein and drinks with low sugars. Sometimes getting a heart rate monitor can help you monitor to never train beyond exhaustion that should only be reserved for athletes.Please let me know if making these changes helps you at all....thanks so much!",

    "question": "This happens mostly post lunch. I would feel I have eaten enough lunch but sometimes I seem to misjudge the required amount of food. As a result I would start feeling hungry quite soon and then if there is delay in getting access to food, within minutes it quickly develops into extreme fatigue reaching upto the eye, making me unfit for doing anything, and sometimes inducing drowsiness as well. Then I'm screwed, I will have to eat and take rest for 1 or sometimes 2 hours till I recover from the fatigue. Why does this happen?",
