    "question": "My girlfriend is 14, and she worries me a lot.Almost every other day or so, her sugar is 500, or 600, or 400... around there... BUT she takes care of it and takes the correct amount of Insulin all the time, she takes it before she eats. She told her Doctor, and the Doctor said he has nothing to do as long as if she's doing exactly what he's saying, and she is.She checks her sugar 3 times a day.Why is it like this? Is it because she's still a part of Puberty? Will she grow out of it? Oh, and she uses an Insulin Pump, she has Type one Diabetics, was not born, she got it when she was 10.",
