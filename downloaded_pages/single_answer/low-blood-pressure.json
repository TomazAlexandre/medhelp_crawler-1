            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!More than the periods it is vomiting and diarrhea that are contributing to low blood pressure. Please consult your PCP first to find the cause of diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc. If celiac, Crohn\u2019s and other problems have been ruled out then lactose intolerance and IBS are the possibilities. Gas in stomach, burping, diarrhea all go in favor of IBS. Pancreatic enzyme disorders, liver dysfunction, HIV, cancer of the gut, and infections by parasites other than giardia can all cause persisting diarrhea. Lyme and lupus are other possibilities that present this way.Once this settles down maybe your periods will. If not, you will need to consult your gynecologist too. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 30 yr old female that has always had perfect blood pressure. I have felt weak, extreme thirst, vomitting, nausea and diarrhea for the last 3 weeks. I have also had my period since September 1, 2011. Its not a heavy flow, mostly off and on all day and night. The last couple of days I have felt like I have the flu, body aches, fever, chills, night sweats and my blood pressure has been 89/53. Could my blood pressure problems be contributed to a loss of too much blood? I have a GYN, family doc and neurologist. Who do I need to call?",
