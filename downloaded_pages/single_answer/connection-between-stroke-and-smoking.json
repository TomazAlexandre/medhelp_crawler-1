            "answer": "hi liz595,How are you? Smoking is one of the\u00a0\u00a0a risk factors for stroke. Nicotine and carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke damage the cardiovascular system in many ways.Cigarette smoking has been linked to the buildup of fatty substances in the carotid artery(the main neck artery supplying blood to the brain). Blockage of this artery is a leading cause of stroke in Americans. Nicotine also raises blood pressure, and carbon monoxide reduces the amount of oxygen your blood can carry to the brain. Cigarette smoke also makes your blood thicker and more likely to clot.This and excessive alcohol intake, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and prior stroke are all preventable risk factors for stroke. By keeping a healthy lifestyle, the probability of stroke is diminished.I hope this helps. Take care and regards.",
