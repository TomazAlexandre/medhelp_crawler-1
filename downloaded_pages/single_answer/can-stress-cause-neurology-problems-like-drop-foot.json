            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. I apologize for a delayed response.\u00a0\u00a0There are many causes that can be responsible for spontaneous foot drop. Your neurologist needs to check you for diabetes, since a loss of protective sensation and position sensation of the joint can lead to unexpected trauma. The effects of diabetes can be an autonomic neuropathy and increased blood flow to the foot leading to demineralization of the bones in the foot and their weakening. Therefore, a multiple factors can play an integrated role in foot drop in diabetics. You will need to be checked for metabolic causes with tests like HbA1c, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, creatinine and blood urea and nitrogen, protein electrophoresis and B12 levels. Did you sustain any trauma to the affected limb? Peroneal nerve compression in the leg or spinal stenosis, L5 radiculopathy could also cause this. You would need an electromyography to confirm the diagnosis. Management would depend on the diagnosis. Discuss with your neurologist to allay your anxiety further. Wishing you all the best.",

    "question": "I'm a 31 year old female and I have a dropped foot.\u00a0\u00a0About two months ago I woke up and I had pins and needles and numbness in my foot.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the hospital and got x-rays and blood work done and the results were all good.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a neurologist today and he is of course sending me for a bunch of tests. I guess because my mind is all over the place with this problem I never thought to ask him if this can be because of stress and (or) depression.\u00a0\u00a0Before this happened I have been depressed and stressed out and now I am 100x more.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has ever heard of this can you please let me know any information on this subject.Thank you,",
