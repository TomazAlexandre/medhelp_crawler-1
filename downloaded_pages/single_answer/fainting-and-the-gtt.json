A yellow flag.Modern hospitals have adopted what is called the insulin clamp protocol rather than the old-fashioned fasting test.Presumeably they continued to check your blood sugar levels. What did the test results show over time?",

    "question": "I had my Glucose Tolerance test done yesterday. I fasted as required, after drinking that straight Glucose drink (better tasting then years ago), within 20 minutes I was feeling nauseated and then I guess I fainted in the waiting room.I was put in a quiet room with a bed for the next hour and a bit. I felt a bit better, but by the time I got home, my hands were shaking uncontrolably. I had a large glass of orange juice and it stopped in about 20 minutes. My other fast tests were 6.1 and higher, though this is the first time I've had the GTT since being sick.My kidneys are down to 71% efficiency. I guess my question is, if someone reacts badly to the Glucose drink it that a sign of Diabetes?",
