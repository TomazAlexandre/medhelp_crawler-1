    "question": "About 10 years ago I had my gallbladder removed.\u00a0\u00a0I never really had a regular bowel movement after\u00a0\u00a0(mostly went from severe diarrhea to severe constipation) nor am I able to tolerate much fried food, which isn't a bad thing.\u00a0\u00a0A few years later I was diagnosed with diverticulosis throughout all of my intestines with extremely painful bouts of diverticulitis ( just about every 3-4 months).In 2006 I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have been able to keep my glucose levels under control with diet and 1,000 milligrams of Metformin a day.\u00a0\u00a0AIC has been under 6.9, checking every three months.I recently have been diagnosed with gastro paresis, which the dr. says is from diabetic neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0 I had several test, the last one, a gastric emptying scan which lead to the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Everything I have read on the internet says that it comes from uncontrolled (high) blood sugar levels, which I do not have.\u00a0\u00a0 I have also read that it can come from previous stomach surgery, which would include removing my gallbladder, and sometimes from viral infections, (I had mono as a teenager and a relapse six months later and about 8 years ago I had Bells palsy which lasted about six months).I am wondering if I should see an endocrinologist to see if there is something else triggering these problems.\u00a0\u00a0I am so sick and tired of being sick and tired.Any suggestions?Thanks.This discussion is related to/posts/show/233832.",
