Infection of the uterus, endometriosis, fibroids, etc\u00a0\u00a0are some other causes for early abortion.You must also investigate the causes of abortion in second trimester like chromosomal abnormalities; infections like listeria, rickettsia, toxoplasma, mycoplasma, viral infections (herpes, rubella, CMV, HbAv), local infections (cervicitis, endometritis) and malaria; cervical dilatation; multiple pregnancies; leiomyomas, fibroids and anomalies of uterus; diabetes; hypertension; smoking; renal diseases; polycystic ovary; hormonal disturbances; and in some cases the cause is not known.Please consult your Obs and Gyn immediately.
