            "answer": "Hi,Can you elaborate more on the subdural bleeding? Does it look like dots on the upper layer of the skin or petechiae? Are there other signs or symptoms present? Petechiae are pinpoint-sized red dots under the surface of the skin which is caused by leakage of blood from capillaries into the skin. A common cause of petechiae is a low platelet count. Causes of a low platelet count may include: autoimmune disorders, viral infections, side effect of certain medications, bone marrow disorders, or infection of the bloodstream. Treatment of petechiae depends on the underlying cause.It would be best to have it evaluated by your doctor for proper management.Take care and regards.",
