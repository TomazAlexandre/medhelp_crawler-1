            "answer": "My Dr told me if you are at risk for hypertension, gestational diabetes, or overweight there shouldn't be anything to worry about. Also your body will naturally end up in random positions and will wake you up. It's nothing to stress about but if anything speak to your Dr. Your Dr may have a different opinion. So try not to stress and enjoy yourself and baby.",
