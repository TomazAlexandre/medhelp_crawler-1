There is a list of recommended doctors, nationwide.\u00a0\u00a0She can send her specific diagnosis, or symptoms to a doctor here, for a recommendation for treatment.I know, one of the hardest things about pituitary disorders is figuring out exactly what the problem is, and getting the right treatment. If she does have lymphocytic hypophysitis, I think (someone correct me if I'm wrong) this is just inflammation of the pituitary stalk, and may heal on it's own, with correct anti-inflammatory treatment. Maybe taking large amounts of anti-inflammatory enzymes, Vitamin C, getting professional nutritional support, or even lymphatic drainage massages might aid healing.\u00a0\u00a0I don't really know, but these are things I think I would try.With my son's pituitary tumor\\cyst, I still get that helpless feeling sometimes, but then I\u00a0\u00a0find\u00a0\u00a0another doctor to talk to, or another supplement or treatment to try (to ease his symptoms), and as long as my son feels better, so do I.Your daughter needs to have someone helping her with research, finding specialists who can give her good information, and hope.\u00a0\u00a0My nutritionist helped me a lot.Give your daughter as much support as you can.Take care,Enzy",

    "question": "Here is a journal entry from my 24-year-old daughter. No one seems to know what she has and she has been to some of the best institutions in the country.Living With Some Kind of TumorThe world's largest delayed reaction took place tonight. For the first time since learning of my pituitary condition back in March, I finally just sat down and really cried over it.I don't know why it took so long for it all to sink in, especially given the numerous specialists I've seen and tests I've had done over the past 8 months. Maybe I've been in denial all this time; or perhaps I've been so overwhelmed by it all that I haven't really had time to process it yet. I really don't know. All I know is that it's hit me all of a sudden, and I feel confused, and alone, and I have no idea what to do or who to turn to.People keep asking me what exactly it is that I have, the the honest answer is that nobody really seems to ******* know. Leave it to me to have some sort of bizarre and rare disorder whose exact diagnosis seems to elude even the experts. I couldn't just have a normal pituitary tumor like everyone else. No, I had to get a swollen pituitary stalk (the stalk that connects the pituitary gland to the hypothalamus). The neurosurgeon at the NY Presbyterian Hospital believes it might be something called \"lymphocytic hypophysitis,\" but the endocrinologist isn't sold on that diagnosis. Apparently, I don't exactly fit the profile for it based on my blood test results. But she doesn't seem to have an alternative suggestion.What I can explain are the symptoms I'm experiencing. I have nearly all the symptoms of hypopituitarism, which are outlined quite nicely here. Some of the fun symptoms include headaches, nausea, excessive thirst/urination (diabetes insipidus), and cessation of menstrual periods.The whole process of trying to diagnose and treat my condition has been a financial nightmare due to a lack of adequate health insurance. I wouldn't mind the exorbitant doctors' fees, except for the fact that I'm no closer to understanding my condition now than I was 8 months ago when it was first discovered. I understand that doctors are busy and stressed. I know that I'm not the center of the universe and that they aren't thinking about me and my medical problems 24/7. I get that, and it's fine. But it's very disheartening to schedule an appointment with a so-called expert, wait a month to see him, talk to him for 5 minutes, and then have him shrug and say, \"Well, let's see if it changes at all over the course of [x] months.\" Two months later, I get a bill for $200-$350. Thanks.Since my problem isn't straight-forward and I'm not dying, I've pretty much been put on the back burners of every doctor I've seen. I've essentially been in this \"wait-and-see\" mode wherein I get an MRI every 3-6 months and the doctors monitor my brain for any changes. If there are no changes, they tell me to get another one done in a few months. In the meantime, they prescribe drugs to keep some of the more intolerable symptoms under control. But the problem is not getting solved.I need to take DDAVP daily to make up for my ADH deficiency (which causes diabetes insipidus). Without this medication, my day is basically a never-ending cycle of drink, pee, drink, pee, drink, pee. It's inconvenient during the day, but at night it's unbearable. Can you imagine waking up because you're so thirsty that you're actually shaking? Or waking up every 30-90 minutes because you need to pee urgently? Well, I'll summarize it for you: it *****. I should know, I went an entire year without getting more than 2 hours of sleep in a row.Another thing is my estrogen level. I get hot flashes all the time, and the last time I had a period was in November of 2007. The doctors won't give me a straight answer on whether or not I can ever have children, which I'm assuming means bad news. Maybe that's a dumb thing to get upset over at a time in my life when I'm not attempting to conceive, but frankly, I'm absolutely devastated by the prospect that I might never be able to have kids. Being a mother one day is one of my top priorities in life. I love children. It's depressing.Not that it's an issue I'll run into anyway, because another symptom of my condition is that I have absolutely zero libido. Let's just be honest here for a moment, people\u2014no man is going to stay with a woman who is unable to have sex. That isn't an accusatory statement, it's just a fact. Sex is a basic human need whether you're a nice guy or a sexist pig. And it's not even like I can fake it...but I'd really rather not go into the unpleasant biological details of that statement.When I first got sick in May 2007, I was in really, really terrible shape. In addition to the symptoms already mentioned, I gained a whole bunch of weight (25 lbs in 2 months), yet ironically was unable to hold down solid food for weeks on end. I was constantly nauseaous and thirsty and would drink over 2 gallons of water a day; and I couldn't sleep because of the diabetes insipidus; and I couldn't function because I was exhausted and throwing up all the time. The worst part was that nobody in the ******* medical community believed me. Doctors couldn't find source of the problem, so they concluded that it was all in my head. Finally, almost a year after the onset of symptoms, I got a new doctor and convinced her to give me a referral for an MRI. And wouldn't you know it, turns out part of my pituitary gland is enlarged. Fancy that.I think what really sparked my delayed reaction to it all was leaving my job. Until now, I haven't really told much of anyone that I'm no longer employed. I imagine some people suspect as much, but I feel so deeply ashamed of myself that I've just lied to them about it. I simply can't really handle the truth of the situation. I've spent so much time trying to convince myself that as long as I have the symptoms under control, I can just ignore my condition and lead a normal life. Just pretend it doesn't exist and try to move on\u2014really, what other option is there? My symptoms were pretty much under control, until just a few months of this new job virtually undid all the progress I'd made. I had to increase the dosage of my medications to twice what I had been taking before, and I watched my health decline rapidly. Even knowing that it was destroying my health, leaving my job was not an easy choice. I'm the sort of person whose sense of self-worth is derived largely from professional/academic success\u2014so right now, I'm feeling pretty damned worthless.I can't ignore my condition anymore, and now that I've realized that, I don't know how to handle everything that I'm feeling. It's depressing to know that I'm unable to work at the level required to succeed in my chosen profession. It's depressing to come to terms with the fact that I am never going to have a family of my own. It's depressing to receive medical bill after medical bill; to owe so much money to a medical community that has done practically nothing for me at all. And it's depressing that I don't know who I can talk to about all this, because everyone with medical knowledge doesn't care, and everyone who cares has no idea what I'm up against. Everyone just thinks I'm fine, because I've been trying to live my life as though nothing is wrong. But it's all wrong, everything is wrong, and I just want for someone to console me and tell me it'll all be okay. But it won't.",
