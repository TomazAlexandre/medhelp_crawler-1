    "question": "I would like to discuss with my doctor the possibility of moving to insulin to control my Type II diabetes. He won't have any of it. I hear I can have better control and fewer side effects. I can also adjust the medicine to my eating/exercise and not adjust the eating/exercise to my medication. Is this true.",
