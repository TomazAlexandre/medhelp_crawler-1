            "answer": "Yes, this would all be compatible with PCOS.Here is some general information from my website on PCOS:www.integrativefertilitymd.comPCOS can affect 5% of all women and common symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, increased growth of hair on the body, loss of hair on the head, acne, and weight gain. Based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM sponsored Consensus Workshop Group, PCOS is diagnosed in women who meet two of the three following criteria: ovarian dysfunction (not ovulating regularly), hyperandrogenism (increased male type hormones on lab testing or clinically increased hair growth), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries which show multiple small cysts on ultrasound). PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose tolerance test.",

    "question": "I have infertility and miscarriage issues, so after discussing my issues with a doctor I work for, he ran ordered some blood work and a transvaginal ultrasound to look for PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0I was pre-ovulatory by 1 week.FSH, LH, Fasting Glucose, Prolactin, Testosterone (am), Estradiol, DHEAS, and Fasting Insulin all came back completely normal.\u00a0\u00a0TSH came back as 7.38 and I am now on Synthroid 0.075 mg.\u00a0\u00a0I am also on Metformin 2000 mg qd; started about 8 months ago for a slightly elevated fasting insulin level.He gave me a copy of the results but unfortunately did not have time to discuss them with me, so I'm not sure of what to make of the results:\"The uterus currently has normal size.\u00a0\u00a0It measures 6.3 x 3.6 x 2.9 cm.\u00a0\u00a0It is retroverted.\u00a0\u00a0The endometrium has a normal thickness of 7 mm.The ovaries have a normal size, the right estimated to be about 8 cc and the left left 7 cc.\u00a0\u00a0Each contain a number of small follicles.\u00a0\u00a0This could be compatible with polycystic disease but this diagnosis would need to be established clinically.\"Based on this interpretation and the blood results would this be compatible with PCOS?",
