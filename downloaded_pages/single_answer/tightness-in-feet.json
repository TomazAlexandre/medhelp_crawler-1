            "answer": "Hi,These symptoms could simply be due to tiredness and stress. Other possibilities include neuropathies like diabetes and B12 deficiency. If there is a history of smoking peripheral vascular diseases also need to be considered.I would suggest you not to strain your affected foot by prolonged standing and do some feet massage everyday to relieve cramps. Also make sure to drink plenty of water and electrolytes.Hope this helps!",
