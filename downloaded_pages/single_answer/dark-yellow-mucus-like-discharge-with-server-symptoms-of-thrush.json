            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You may not be having fungal infection and if you do have it, then there would be other associated problems too. Yellow vaginal discharge is seen in cervicits (inflammation of cervix), vulvovaginitis (inflammation of vulva and vagina) and STDs like gonorrhea and chlamydia. The discharge can also become yellow due to medicines and also it could be a normal finding. The other possibility is contact dermatitis causing an allergic reaction to soap, powders, lotions, garments etc. Please check if you have changed any in recent past.Yeast infection or thrush is at times very difficult to treat. You may need to take oral antifungal pills twice a week for 3-4 weeks along with local application of antifungal cream. There are many types of antifungals available. Take an OTC antifungal with a combination of two or more anti fungals. Use both oral and local application. At times both partners need to be treated. Test for diabetes and other STDs as presence of either or both can make it difficult to treat the fungal infection. Do consult your gynecologist and get a complete STD panel done. Take care!",
