            "answer": "Hello and Welcome to the Pain Management Forum. I am sorry to hear about your Chronic Pain.I am not an expert and I am far from a Physician. In my personal opinion and experience you don't go from Tylenol or Neurontin (Gabapentin) to Fentanyl. I could be dangerous as your system is not use to daily opiates.\u00a0\u00a0Indeed Fentanyl is a \"Big Dog\" opiate. It's used in extreme pain.This is from a trusted site: \"Fentanyl Patch should be used only for long-term or chronic pain requiring continuous, around-the-clock narcotic pain relief that is not helped by other less powerful pain medicines or less frequent dosing. Do not use Fentanyl Patch if you have not already been taking other prescription narcotic pain medicines (eg, morphine, codeine) on a regular schedule.\"Obviously there are other choices and you should discuss this with your treating Physician. I hope this helps.Take Care,~Tuck",

    "question": "I have diabetes with peripheral neuropathy. The neuropathy is very painful and my feet and hands are so numb and painful that they are virtually useless most of the time. I've been on Neurontin as well as both Vicodin and Percocet (at different times--not both at once) and neither really helps to relieve much of the pain. Would the Fentanyl patch be a good change for me to use in place of the Neurontin, Vicodin and/or Percocet? The tylenol in the Vicodin and percocet are of concern to me as I used a lot of that back in the 70s and 80s and it also does nothing for pain for me, i.e., if I have a headache, I have to take ibuprofin or excedrin and I'd rather be on one pain RX.I also have arthritic cervical spondylosis and dr has me on Celerex for that. Would the Fentanyl patch take care of that pain also? Then I would only be on one pain medication instead of two. Or is there another pain \"patch\" that would work? Thank you. Linda Sevilla",
