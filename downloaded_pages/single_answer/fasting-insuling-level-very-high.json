            "answer": "I stand corrected but the values you gave appear to correlate with a thyroid test. Fasting insulin levels are usually less than 25u/ml. This\u00a0\u00a0would make me perform more specific tests to see if this is an error such as an A1c test.Was the 101 glucose level at fasting? If so, 101 is considered prediabetic.Please consult with your doctor for a proper review/analysis of your test scores.",
