            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!You could be having two problems. One is leaking urine. The leaking could be due to urine getting trapped by a tumor, a hydrocele, a hernia, cancer of testicle, varicoceles or enlarged prostate. The leaking could also be due to weak bladder wall muscle---this gives a sensation of incomplete emptying of bladder. Inertstitial cystitis of bladder or narrowing of urethra could also cause leaking.The other problem could be Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome. All these result in tender abdomen, loose stool or loose stools alternating with constipation, abdominal distention, cramps etc. Please refer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitisParasites in the gut like threadworm, tape worm, giardiasis etc can behave this way. All these can also cause hives.Pain in the feet can be due to weakness, diabetes or any nutritional deficiency due to an irritable bowel disease.You need a comprehensive investigation taking all these points in consideration. Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!Here are a few tips on this link which will help you a lot: http://www.continence-foundation.org.uk/symptoms-and-treatments/overflow-incontinence.php",

    "question": "I have been feeling unwell for a long time now, and I have yet to discover why. The wide range of symptoms I am experiencing could have different causes for all I know. First, I've been having hives outbreaks for over a year now. I've been taking claritin every few days for a couple months now to prevent it. The hives started to appear after I used some skin medicine to cure scabies. I have also been having headaches and digestive problems (urinary leakage after urinating and abnormally soft feces) accompanied by stomach aches. I tested negative for Gonorrhea, so I know that isn't the cause. Also, I just recently quit smoking (I don't think smoking had anything to do with any of this, just thought I should make it known). Another thing--just recently I've been having strange pains around my feet, usually my Achilles tendon. The pain only comes when I am sitting or lying down. On top of all these symptoms I just feel unwell almost all the time. Any idea what is causing this? Thank you.",
