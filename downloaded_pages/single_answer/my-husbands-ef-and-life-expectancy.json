            "answer": "Hi, if the ejection fraction is below 35% it is diagnosed as cardiac failure. If medical therapy fails, cardiac transplantation is recommended for all eligible patients with an LVEF below 20%\u00a0\u00a0regardless of clinical symptoms. It is difficult to predict the exact prognosis, as this depends on other co morbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension and the cause for the low ejection fraction values. Patients with heart failure have a 5-year mortality rate approaching 50 percent in some studies. Regards.",

    "question": "My husband has an extensive medical history but what I think you may need to know is that about 3 years ago he was diagnosed with Burkett's Lymphoma and was treated with high dose chemo, mainly the drug I am talking about is Adriamycin which is cardio toxic. He just had a MVR (mitral valve repair) and post op his EF is 25-30%. He is 61 years old has mild symptoms, dry cough and fatigue this is occasional he has no water retention. I would like to know what his life expectancy is and what we can do to improve his EF if anything. He has an occasional beer, maybe once a week is a non smoker and could stand to loose about 20 -30pounds. He is on medication, Diovan which I believe the doctor doubled on his visit today. Please help",
