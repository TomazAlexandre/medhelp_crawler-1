            "answer": "I realized I needed help when I was 17 years old taking beta blockers and medication for diabetes. I was 300 pounds at my heaviest and worried that I would never be able to have children, or if I did have children I would die before getting a chance to raise them.I am just over 4 years post op and it was the best decision I've ever made. My weight has finally stabilized around 190 and I couldn't be happier. In fact last week I did my first 5 K! I never thought I'd be able to do something like that. Now I'm training for my first half marathon this November!The best advice I could give you is to talk to a doctor and see what your options are. Good luck in whatever path you choose.",
