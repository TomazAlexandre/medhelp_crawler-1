            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Management of multiple lesions in LAD, if the block is greater than 70% is usually CABG or coronary artery bypass grafting. An important factor to consider would be ejection fraction. The ejection fraction is a useful measure of left ventricular performance. The normal range is 63-77% for males and 55-75% for females. It reflects the pumping capacity of the heart. Prognosis will depend on the viable myocardium and co morbid conditions like diabetes and the clinical symptoms. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
