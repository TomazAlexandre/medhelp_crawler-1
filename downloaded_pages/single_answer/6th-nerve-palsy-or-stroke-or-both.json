            "answer": "Hi,Your MRI findings are suggestive of\u00a0\u00a0White matter disease or Stroke . 6th Nerve Palsy often results from MS . But your MRI findings do not suggest MS because in contrast to the mild microvascular ischaemic changes , MS presents more intense lesions . Please consult a neurologist\u00a0\u00a0for the correlation of symptoms with the MRI findings and get a specific diagnosis . Hope this helps you . Take care and regards !",

    "question": "I am a 52 year old female with controlled diabetes and high blood pressure. I woke up one morning with pain in my head and seeing double out of my left eye. My eye doctor says I have 6th nerve palsy. My family practice doctor says small stroke. My MRI says very mild microvascular ischemic changes. Small scattered foci of periventricular and subcortical white matter,T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity suggests mild microvascular ischemic changes.Is this a small stroke or 6th nerve palsy or both? thanks and have a blessed day",
