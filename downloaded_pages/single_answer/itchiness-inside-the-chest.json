            "answer": "Hello,Such itchy feeling inside the chest can be due to parasthesia. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition. Other reason for such symptoms is acid reflux. Try raising the head of her bed about four inches with blocks. It also might help to avoid eating or drinking for two hours before you lie down. To help control the stomach acid, one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them, or eat chocolate or spicy or greasy foods . Also give her some OTC antacid like Mylanta.Get her blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. She can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist/physician as it can be due to some neurological disorder.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",
