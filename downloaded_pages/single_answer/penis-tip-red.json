            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!You can wait for another week and see if the redness subsides. Meanwhile keep the area clean and dry. Avoid use of the same shampoo that you used earlier.If the redness persists, get a urine culture done to check for any infection. If this is normal, then a blood sugar level should be done to see if you have diabetes.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "HiFor about 8 months the area around my penis hole as been slightly red, theres no pain or stinging. The redness seemed to have coincided when i had dry skin with shampoo which got under the foreskin (i had phimosis) which caused the penis head to bleed. I'm sure it's not an STD as i've not had sex for five years and even then used protection.After seeing several Doctors, using Hydrocortisone, and two weeks ago I got circumsised, it seems to have remained. The urologist did say it would go once i've been circumsied, but seen little difference.Any ideas?",
