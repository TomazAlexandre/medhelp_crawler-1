            "answer": "Hello.I appreciate your concern for your friend. Your concern might just help him/her prevent any complications.From your description, I can think of a compressive pathology in the cervical spine. There is a possibility of intervertebral disc prolapse (protrusion, bulging, herniation). Intervertebral discs give a cushioning effect and allow mobility of one vertebral bone over the other. If a disc is bulging, bending the neck downwards (to see the feet) pushes it more towards the spinal cord and enhances the bulge. Bulging discs may produce symptoms of neuropathy.What your friend has is probably due to compression of the nerves which supply the skin, joints and the muscles of the upper limb.I suggest an MRI of the cervical spine as soon as possible.Are there any other physical illnesses, such as diabetes?Regards",
