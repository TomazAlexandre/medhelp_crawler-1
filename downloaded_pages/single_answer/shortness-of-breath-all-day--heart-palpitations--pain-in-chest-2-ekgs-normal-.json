    "question": "Im a 21 year old ectmorph male. Generally healthy. Former smoker of about 5 years. Clean for 1 year. About 3 months ago I started having What I assumed to be anxiety attacks. All symptoms matched. except my breathing rate never changed. In the last month alone I have made 2 trips to the ER. My heart was beating extremely abnormal, pain in my left/center chest, I was confused and My breathing was rough. It wasnt fast or heavy breathing. But more controlled. Except it felt like I was breathing with a few layers of clothes over my face. I had EKG scans both times and x rays on my chest. All of which have come back normal. But the breathing problem in the last 3 weeks has been presistent. It seems like every hour or every few hours there are a few minutes where im\u00a0\u00a0struggling to get those full breaths and only a few of them dont seem filtered. or clogged. Im always worried when it happens and It feels like Im always tired or have a lack of conciousness now. Its all being written off as anxiety by the doctors but it seems like they arent willing to dive into other possibilities besides asthma. Which when Given a breathing treatment had no effect at all. Im typically healthy, worked out a lot, but stopped since it made symptoms stronger and more evident. Any advice. I know my anxiety and Im convinced its not the main problem.\u00a0\u00a0when my heartbeats during these episodes it feels like a \"tick\" sound with my second part of my beat",
