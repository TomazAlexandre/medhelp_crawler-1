            "answer": "Hello,The only treatment of cellulitis skin is by oral and intravenous antibiotics. The high prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) increases the chances of cellulites and recurrent abscesses.Whether MRSA is causing cellulites in your husband\u2019s case or not depends on the blood culture sensitivity report. Blood culture sensitivity is often done to find out the causative pathogen and its sensitivity to various antibiotics. If it is MRSA, then antibiotics other than amoxycillins can be prescribed depending upon the blood culture report.Recurrent infection could be due to an underlying diabetes mellitus. So get his blood sugar levels checked.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "has anyone had leg cellulitus and actually go it to clear up? my husband has had this since december of 2010. he has took k-flex, cipro, augmentin, clindamycin,and bactrim. he also had to take diflucan for a severe case of yeast from the antibiotics. his infection is still ongoing. after 5 solid months of antibiotics, i would think it would resolve. his doctor doesnt seem\u00a0\u00a0to have any other options about what he should do. he is a west-coast truck driver, and has been unable to work since january. does anybody know something else he could do to get this infection to clear up? i guess i should mention this all started from a scratch on the back of his calf. any help would be appreciated.",
