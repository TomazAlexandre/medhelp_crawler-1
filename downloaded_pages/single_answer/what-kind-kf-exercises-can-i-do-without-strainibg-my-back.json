            "answer": "Cycling increases the heart rate but is non-impact which decreases any forces transmitted to the spine that typically occur during high impact activities such as running. Do cardio five times per week for 30 to 45 minute sessions to increase caloric burn for weight loss. You can also do some light aerobics in your house to increase the heart rate; avoid any high-impact jumping instead do step-ups, marching in place and side-steps.Core strengthening exercises tone up your stomach muscles but can also help to relieve back pain. Strong abs help support the back during any lifting or bending activities as well as walking. The plank exercise will strengthen the abs as well as your shoulders, chest and even make you sweat if you hold it long enough or add some lifting arm movements. Try the plank by lying on your belly on the floor. Push yourself up so that you're resting on your toes and forearms with elbows underneath your shoulders. Tighten your tummy and maintain a straight body from head to toe. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds and progress to one-minute holds. Repeat three times. Turn the plank into a dynamic exercise to increase the heart rate and burn more calories by adding in movements such as a push-up plank in which you start in a forearm plank position, then push yourself up into a full push-up position, lower into forearm plank and repeat 10 to 12 times or until fatigued.Yoga can help ease low back pain and help in weight loss. A 2011 study in the Archives of Internal Medicine found that yoga was effective in decreasing low back pain symptoms. You will need to do yoga poses that both stretch and strengthen the body and to get the heart rate up. Yoga can burn anywhere from 102 to 245 calories per hour.Talk to your doctor first and get the OK!",
