            "answer": "No that is not a concern with antipsychotics and psychiatric medications in general. There is some basic misinformation about this but most of it is from sites that are anti treatment. The long term side effects of concern from antipsychotics including Abilify are long term movement disorders (for more information google \"Patient Education Tardive Dyskinesia\" note as the site itself says \"some of these medications may be medically necessary\") and diabetes. Full information about the short term and long term side effects (as well as beneficial effects) of antipsychotics as well as other medications can be found on the medication websites as well as the P.D.R. (Physician's Desk Reference) which you can then discuss with your psychiatrist.",
