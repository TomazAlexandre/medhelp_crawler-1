    "question": "I have a 17 month old toddler boy. Just recently he had his insulin levels checked twice. First result was 1.3 and then repeat labs it was 1.1, which it has decreased. The range is 2.0-19.6 for this level. His blood glucose and cbc, and others blood work was normal. Now he's being referred to endorse, which I'm calling tomorrow. I'm just trying to get some understanding so I can sleep tonight.This discussion is related to/posts/Pediatric-Endocrinology-/Could-this-be-early-diabetes/show/708834.",
