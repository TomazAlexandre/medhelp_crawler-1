    "question": "Hello all,I am a 42 year old sedentary professional, overweight, hypothyroid for many years.\u00a0\u00a0For severalyears had been having strange sensation in chest like an elevator dropping.\u00a0\u00a0Cardiovacular tests unremarkable except for low stamina.\u00a0\u00a0About four years ago, after about two years of incredible stress levels I alway thought I managed well, I began having what were diagnosed as anxiety attacks, mainly related to sitting in traffic.\u00a0\u00a0Also diagnosed with some degree of depression and low-grade diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Taking synthroid, metformin (for diabetes), lipitor (as a precaution), lisinopril (blood pressure due to one reading that was 190), and sertraline (depression) regularly, with alprazolam as needed.\u00a0\u00a0The anxiety attacks continue to this day, and stress and caffeine increase intensity and frequency.\u00a0\u00a0Really bad attacks can seem to cause my eyes to go out of focus for a few seconds.Then, three years ago at Christmas I had what seemed like a anxiety attack which caused my right side lips, tongue and gums to tingle strongly and feel like they were numb, but no drooping or slurred speech.\u00a0\u00a0On doctor recommendation went to emergency room, CT scan showed something in head, thought it was stroke.\u00a0\u00a0Admitted to stroke unit, whole host of cardiovascular testing done, which came back unremarkable.\u00a0\u00a0Released the next day as tingle and numbness were slowly resolving.\u00a0\u00a0MRI of head done later, lacunar infract found on right side (age indeterminate - concluded not involved in numbness because was on same side of body as symptoms).\u00a0\u00a0Second MRI done with contrast.\u00a0\u00a0Final result, undetermined, go away and contact us again if additional symptoms arrise or return.A year later, had another MRI by second neurologist - sprinkling of white dots throughout brain (I believe detected on FLAIR).\u00a0\u00a0Main arteries \"squeaky\" clean.\u00a0\u00a0Saw two lacunar infarcts, one on right and one left.\u00a0\u00a0I had old MRI films with me and we got them out for comparison.\u00a0\u00a0Neurologist believes second infarct was there at the time of the first MRI but was not caught by the reviewer.\u00a0\u00a0Says he doesn't know what to make of the scattered white dots.\u00a0\u00a0Put me on plavix, ended prior aspirin regimen.\u00a0\u00a0Final conclusion, go away and contact us again if additional symptoms arrise or return.Any thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated!\u00a0\u00a0I know medicine is not an exact science but it would be nice if there was more information available on what the white dots might represent.Thank you all, and best regards,Larry",
