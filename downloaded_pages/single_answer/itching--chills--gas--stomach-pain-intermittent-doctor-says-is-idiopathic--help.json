Now she's on PROBIOTIC and in remission so to speak.I've had IBS/IBD for more than 20 yrs. Been dealing with alot of other health issues that required 4 surgeries in less than 2 yrs and another coming up. So I put these probs on the back burner....bad...bad...bad. I shouldn't have.I am being tested for Crohns, I go to the gastro tomorrow. PCP says my liver is also swollen and fatty. I have headaches, eye infections, chills/sweating, back pain, chronic tummy pain, constipation/diarrhea daily, chronic arthritis, rashes/bumps, chronic fatigue...etc.I had a CT Scan last week that bout put me in the hospital. awaiting gastro appt tomorrow to see what other tests next.BUT, you are on the right track...diet is key. Also check out PROBIOTIC...it's amazing stuff! And it's over the counter. Just a suggestion. Maybe it will help put the metabolism in check.Peace & Blessings",

    "question": "High lipase of 2900 over 2 months ago. I don't drink alchohol, smoke. No diabetes, excellent cholesterol level, and blood pressure is excellent 107/68. I am 5'8\" and weigh 180. I am very active. In July of this year I was hospitalized for 5 days on an IV and NBM (nothing by mouth) with lipase over 2900. Upon discharge my lipase was 2245. The lowest my lipase has been during the past 6 weeks has been 399. Recently it went up again to 499. I've been watching my diet with plenty of salads (lemon juice instead of dressing), fruits, vegetables very little meat (no red meat, no butter, no gravy, nada). Lipase is still 449. I have had a complete body scan, two cat scans, ultrasound, xray of chest. Nothing. My doctor has labeled this macrolipasemia. No other explanation other than this could be a baseline for me. Never heard of this before. Has anyone else? My father died in 1962 of some type of intestional blockage. We never knew what caused it. He was very healthy as well and suddenly developed this pain in his stomach. Within a few days he died.",
