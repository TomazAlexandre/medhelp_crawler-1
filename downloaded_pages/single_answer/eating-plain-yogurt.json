    "question": "Hello Doc,I would like to ask if eating plain yogurt two to three times a day is good. Is plain yogurt as healthy as low fat yogurt or non fat ones? My husband has arterio sclerosis and would like to know if its alright for him to have the plain yogurt. Low fat or non fat yogurt is pretty hard to find where we live. He's diagnosed with diabetes melitus and he's 67 years old. He's taking hypertension meds like ziac, and other meds like vastarel, capomed(captopril), pletal. He also has GERD so he also takes Nexium to avoid acid reflux.I really appreciate your feedback regarding this. Thank you very much.God blessMs None",
