            "answer": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGPT\"serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase\"Also called 'ALT'.\"It is measured as an evaluation of liver injury. Significantly elevated levels of ALT often suggest the existence of other medical problems such as viral hepatitis, diabetes, congestive heart failure, liver damage, bile duct problems, infectious mononucleosis, or myopathy. For this reason, ALT is commonly used as a way of screening for liver problems. However, elevated levels of ALT do not automatically mean that medical problems exist. Fluctuation of ALT levels is normal over the course of the day, and ALT levels can also increase in response to strenuous physical exercise. Many drugs may elevate ALT levels -\u00a0\u00a0anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, cholesterol medications, and anti-convulsants.\"",
