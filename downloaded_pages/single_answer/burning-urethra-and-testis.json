            "answer": "Hello,This burning of urethra can be due to urethritis or due to parasthesia skin. Get a urethral swab and get other medical conditions like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism ruled out. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
