            "answer": "Hi,These white bumps around your mouth may suggest a fungal infection. Fungal infection that may affect the area surrounding the mouth may present with white scaling patches that may appear itchy and scaly. Lesions surrounding the mouth may be due to cheilitis.Cheilitis is a condition that may be due to a bacterial or fungal infection.Other differentials will be impetigo,cold sores and aphthous ulcers.However, aphthous ulcers and cold sores are usually found in the inner membrane of the mouth.I suggest you have this assessed by your physician as folliculitis and fungal infections may actually be contagious.Avoid constantly licking the lips or biting the lips as this may aggravate the condition.Smoking may also worsen the condition.Do you have any underlying disease like diabetes?",
