            "answer": "In response to higher blood sugars, you will need to increase insulin doses. The basal dose will have to be raised to maintain numbers at fasting, bedtime and between meals at the proper level. You will have to change the I:C ratio for doses of fast-acting insulin before meals. I strongly suggest you get the book Using Insulin by John Walsh because it will answer the question in a lot more detail. Some people rely on doctors to adjust doses, but most Type 1's find it is easier to learn how to modify our own insulin use. Also send me a private message if you want the name of a couple websites where you can benefit from the experience and knowledge of a lot more type 1 diabetics (and parents)",
