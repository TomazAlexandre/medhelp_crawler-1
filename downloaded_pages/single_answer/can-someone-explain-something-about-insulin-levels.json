            "answer": "Hi,It does indeed sound confusing and stressful. MODY is possible. I'm not a doctor, just the mom of a diabetic, so of course you should be continuing to talk with your doctor. But here are a couple of good links that can explain MODY for you:http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/clinic/mody.htmhttp://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/412378http://www.genetichealth.com/DBTS_Genetics_of_MODY.shtmlGood luck as you continue to seek answers.",

    "question": "OK! I was confused before, and now I am even more confused. This is the deal: we had a glucose tolerance test with insulin and glucose levels because my daughter has been having symptoms of diabetes (frequency with incontinence, increased thirst, increased appetite). Her initial blood testing was inconclusive and antibody tests (insulin, GAD, islet) were all negative. Her gtt levels were as follow: fasting: G = 86 / I = less than 2, 30 min: G = 166 / I = 20, 60 min: G = 119 / I = 14, 120 min: G = 108 / I = 14. These insulin levels are all low, but the blood sugars are somewhat normal accept the 166 is slight high. Since this blood work we have had several times during the day and fasting low blood sugars. One morning she woke from a sound sleep at 5:45am and said she needed to check her blood and she was 54. We are not on insulin, but reciently diagnosed with diabetes. I spoke to the doctor, and he suggested my husband have blood work (fasting insulin level, C-Peptide, HgbA1c, and OGTT) because he is metabolic symdrome. He explained to me a genatic disorder called Non-Type 1 Diabetes or MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes in the Young). It is a genetic disorder that comes from having at least 3 generations of Type 2 diabetes on one side of the child's family. We actually have 4 generation on my husband's side: Dad (metabolic syndrome), Grandfather (type 2 diabetes), great-grandmother (type 2 diabetes), and great-great grandfather (died from complications of diabetes).My question is this: Does anyone know about this type of diabetes? If you do please give me some information!",
