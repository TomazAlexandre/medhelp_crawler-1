            "answer": "Hi!There are various conditions which can cause a blister. These include excess heat or cold, herpes, diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition. Do not burst any blister on your own. Apply any moisturizer or calamine lotion on this to soothe the pain and take any OTC painkiller such as ibuprofen. Consult a doctor to find the cause. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, for the past like 8 months I've had this little blister near the bottom of my palm... It's like a small tapioca bump. At first I thought it was temporary and would go away, but it hasn't. It recently started to hurt and the skin around the circle has become pink-purple-ish. It hurts when it comes in contact with other things... Is there any treatment or method to get rid of it fast? Because I have been writing and typing a lot of assignments recently and I still have more to work on...",
