            "answer": "Hello,It can be a comminuted fracture femur. In this type of fracture, the bone has broken into three or more pieces. In most cases, the number of bone fragments corresponds with the amount of force required to break the bone.Diabetes causes an increase in delayed unions and nonunions. Moreover due to the amputation, it is a more serious problem. You can take a second opinion from an orthopedic surgeon as surgery is the only treatment for such fractures.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "My sister is an amputee and a diabetic. She fell out of her wheelchair.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor says he is not doing surgery because the femur is shattered and he feels that the pins would not hold the bone and then you would have a bigger mess. What does he mean by shattered. When someone says to me shattered I think of 1,000 little pieces. He said that she needs to straighten the leg herself.\u00a0\u00a0I am beside myself, hope you will answer me.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, RitaShe started rehab today to show see how she can mount from a wheelchair to a car, to a wheelchair to a bed.\u00a0\u00a0They also started with her pain management",
