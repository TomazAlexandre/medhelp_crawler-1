            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!You will be surprised to know that stomach ulcers and severe acidity can result in hunger pangs. Even GERD presents with similar symptoms. At times the hunger pangs due to acidity wakes up a person in the wee hours of night.The other possibility is diabetes and hyperthyroidism. Worms in the gut too makes a person very hungry. The nutritional deficiency can also cause the period irregularity. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Lately i have been feeling hungry all day long. I feel like no matter how much or how often i eat i still feel the need to constantly be eating. I feel very nauea all the time as well. Past day or two i've been feeling very tired but dont know if its just losing my grandma 2 days ago,or if im getting a cold ( i have been stuffed up since yesterday). None of that seems to explain why i've been eating so much though.. i dont seem to even be gaining any weight. I also got my period almost 2 weeks early, at first it seemed like spotting and now its still light but is also lasting longer than my normal period would. I have had unprotected sex but that was less than 3 weeks ago.. i dont think i would be feeling symptoms now? it seems too early. Anyone have an idea of what is going on?",
