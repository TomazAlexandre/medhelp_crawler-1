            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause hypotension. Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Addisons\u2019 disease, hypoglycemia, VitB12 and folate deficiency can all cause hypotension. I know that you have been tested for most of these. Get a thyroid antibody test done too.The other reason is bleeding somewhere in the body, like a bleeding peptic or duodenal ulcer. Hence get a stool examination done for occult blood. The other causes of bleeding gut is IBS, ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Also even if you have a symptomatic stone in the kidney or anywhere in the urinary system, then it can also cause microscopic blood in urine. Get a urine routine and microscopic examination. Internal bleeding of any kind can cause low blood pressure.If either the stool or urine is positive for blood then you can investigate in that line further.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
