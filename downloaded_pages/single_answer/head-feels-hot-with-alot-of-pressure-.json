            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!First get your blood pressure checked. This could be due to high blood pressure. The other possibility is clot in some blood vessel. This can also give out heat sensation without there being any temperature. Hyperthyroidism, diabetes, temporal arteritis are the other possibilities. It can also be an allergic reaction to some soap or oil etc.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!",
