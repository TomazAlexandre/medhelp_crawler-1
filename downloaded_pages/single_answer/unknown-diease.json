            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Has diabetes been ruled out? This should be checked first. It can also be chronic fatigue syndrome. This usually presents with widespread myalgia and arthralgia, headaches, chronic mental and physical exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, concentration difficulty and memory problems.Then you also need to investigate other causes of brain fog like liver dysfunction (get liver enzymes done\u2014liver function test), kidney dysfunction (get kidney function test done), and anemia. Poor sleep pattern and sleep problems like sleep apnea too can cause brain fog. Sleep studies by sleep specialists can help diagnose this. Hypothyroidism, Low Vit D or Vit B12 too could be the cause.Hormonal imbalance in women due to either menopause or any other cause like PCOD should be investigated. In men this could be related to low testosterone.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",

    "question": "I been to a doctor who couldn't give me any answers despite blood tests, don't know them all but he tested me for syphilis, and aids, (just standard procedure) and for some other diseases and still couldn't fine anything wrong, i also received a cat scan and x-ray for tuberculosis, and it was negative. My problem is that i have a hard time thinking clearly, i can actually feel my mind (literally) being consumed, and i say consumed simply because it feels as if something is eating away at it. I'm having difficulty speaking at times when its at its worse, concentrating, focusing, retaining new information and remembering the old. When i drink alcohol, it makes it 10 times worse, depending on how much I've drunk, but it doesn't take much, less than on small can of beer ( 8oz) it all it takes to make it worse. Also if i don't brush my teeth, floss and all, it worsens it as well, even eating something overly sweet or take in to much sugar for the day and i can barley stay focused. Not to mention if i catch a cold i become dazed and confused. I positive it's some sort of bacterial infection of some sort. Kinda like someone who would have syphilis, or at least the symptoms are identical, maybe not as dramatic, but just to give you some idea of what it feels like on a day to day basis with whatever it is I have.",
