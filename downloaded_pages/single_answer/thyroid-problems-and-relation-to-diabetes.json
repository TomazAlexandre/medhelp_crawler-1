    "question": "Hi,I've been working with an Endocronologist on my Thyorid for the last 18 months. I've been classified as subclinical Hashimoto's. Not taking any Synthroid at this point. Had nodules in the past that disappeared after a few months of Synthroid. My latest TSH was 6.22 and my T3 and T4 levels were within range. I have had slightly elevated Thyroid antibodies in the past.Recently, I had a regular physical and blood work with my primary doctor. My fasting glucose level was 110. My primary doctor is going to have me do an A1C test in a few weeks but since I take Niaspan, he thinks the elevated glucose might be related to the Niaspan as a side-effect.When I mentioned my fasting glucose to my Endocrinologist, she suggested that we check for Diabetes related antibodies on my next lab work and she wasn't so sure that it was related to the Niaspan. She wants to rule out Type I diabetes. I'm a lean body type person.I was reading somewhere that it's common for auto-immune thyroid patients to experience other autoimmune problems. Do you find that to be true in your experience as well?Thank you.",
