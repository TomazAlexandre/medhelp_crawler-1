    "question": "I have been type 1 diabetic for almost 18 years. For the last 3 years I have been having severe pain in my right side towards the kidney area. I have had several test done by my kidney doctor and they have found nothing. The pain is getting more frequent and lasting more than a couple of minutes. Before it would be off and on and last a couple of seconds. I am very good with pain, but lately it seems to bring me to a dead stop. Any insight or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
