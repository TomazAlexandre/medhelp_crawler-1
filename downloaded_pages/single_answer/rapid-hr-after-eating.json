If an irregular heart beat is found, an electrophysiology referral can be considered.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "Hi,For the past 10 years, I've experienced worsening symptoms immediately after meals: rapid, strong palpitations (recorded on Holter and said to be fast, i.e, 90-100 BPM but benign); fatigue; and sometimes diarriah.I'm thin, and have become much thinner of late. I've slowly given up foods associated with the symptoms, including wine, desserts, and high-carbs. I avoid restaurant food and frankly am at the point where I hate to eat! I weigh 109 pounds, (female, 5'6).I do have cardiomyopathy without LV failure and take several medications to prevent CHF, including lisinopril, eplerenone, ranexa. I've also had a biopsy to confirm microscopic colitis.My bloodwork is normal for diabetes and endocrine disorders.What could be causing the symptoms and what should my next steps be?Thanks in advance for your time.Carolina03",
