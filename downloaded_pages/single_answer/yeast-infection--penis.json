            "answer": "Hi,A yeast infection can be taken care of by using a topical cream like Canesten.You need to know as to why you have been going through these problems. Yeast infections thrives on sugar and can realy be noticed if you are uncircumcised. The Candeda multiplies and does best in a moist environment, like underneath the foreskin.Diabetes can also cause problems with the foreskin and can also cause yeast infections.It would be best for you to see a doctor about this problem and have them check you for Diabetes. If it is found that you don't have diabetes than it is important to find out why the yeast does not clear. Having been on antibiotics can also cause yeast infections.God bless,Ron",

    "question": "First lets start by saying that since I can remember I have had tight foreskin. Ive never really done any of the excercises I've read about online and the first time I ever tried to have sex the foreskin pulled back and got stuck and was very painful. That lead to an infection that was later cured by antibiotics. I was tested for an std and the test was negative. Lately I've had a yeast infection that has gotten worse and Im wondering about the dangers of this. It started off by being very red and irritated and hurt when I would urinate and then eventually spread to where I was pulling out smegma on a daily basis as well as cleaning out a white substance that would accumulate over the course of the day. I went to a clinic in which the nurse practicioner thought it was a yeast infection and prescribed me nystatin cream. Ive been cleaning the head and the areas I can get to with a mild dish soap everyday twice and day and drying off the area and then applying the nystatin and rubbing it in completely. It wasnt until today that I woke up and the skin was very irritated again just like when it started and it seems that my pee hole has gotten much smaller. This makes its very painful to urinate to the point where ive slowed down on my fluid intake. My pee is very yellow so im sure is very acidic? This may be affecting some of the pain I am having but I swear my peehole seems to have gotten smaller, like the bottom half of the slit has closed up. It may be in my head but none of these symptoms started until today. One thing I may add was that during this last weekend, friday-monday I was drinking ALOT of beer. Like two 30 packs worth by myself which now I have read can very much contribute to the yeast infection and so I stopped drinking beer on monday. Two days later it seems like the infection is very dried out and starving for more yeast or moisture ( i.e. all the beer i was drinking) Could this be possible? Two days later the infection is dying out from the lack of yeast I was contributing to it? I am very worried for the safety of my penis one of my main questions is could this infection lead to something that would cause me to get surgery or even the loss of my penis? Im very worried that the cream isnt taking an affect as fast as I'd like it to. I did miss a couple treatments since the treatments were twice a day and I was doing one in the morning after a shower and at night after a shower, a couple of times I fell asleep without applying the cream and would wake up with the white stuff in overdrive almost ready to seep out of my foreskin. I would clean it and then use the cream.I am very worried for my penis medhelp, give me some feedback!",
