            "answer": "Did your husband have an overnight home oximetry to get those night numbers on his O2 sats? You mentioned his breathing pauses - if he has sleep apnea, it can cause drops in O2sats at night. It also increases risk of cardiac issues, stroke, hypertension, & diabetes. Needing more sleep can be the body's effort to compensate for poor sleep. Some other symptoms of possible sleep apnea are nighttime urination, daytime sleepiness, weight gain (for some), impotence, short term memory loss, foggy thinking.A sleep study will determine if he has sleep apnea and how low his oxygen goes at night.",
