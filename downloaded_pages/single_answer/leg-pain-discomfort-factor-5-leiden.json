            "answer": "Hi!Since you have factor 5 mutation, and other problems in family that can predispose to clot formation, and since you are now having tingling, numbness etc in calf, you should consult a vascular specialist and get this evaluated. Also check out whether you have diabetes and peripheral neuropathies in diabetes too can cause similar symptoms. You may need to get a duplex ultrasound or a dopplar test of your leg blood vessels. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "I have a factor 5 leiden genetic mutation that i was diagnosed with through genetic testing when my sister had several miscarriages. I am 26 years old I eat very healthy am active and am physically fit. I have been experiencing tingling and numbness in my legs and sometimes other extremities. It feels like the feeling you get when someone puts a needle in your veins. I get those sharp feelings for a second but than an overall numbness and pressure in my calves and the backs of my knees. Is this related to the thrombrophillia? I do not think I have a clot I believe it would be more swelling in in a more central area. My mother must have the factor 5 and she has had all kinds of neurological issues and has rls. My father has diabetes and vericose veins.Please help no one knows anything about this stuff and they are not helpful.Its really scary when you are so active but have poor circulation and strange pulsing feelings in your veins.",
