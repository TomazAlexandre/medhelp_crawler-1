    "question": "I have had diabetes type 1 for 30 years now. Recently I have had tests for Hashimoto's. I will find out results in August, but I do have all the sympyoms, weight gain, tiredness, aches and pains, a diffuse goiter, depression. I am getting severe low blood sugars and am wonderiing if it has anything to do with Hashimoto's, as I cant think of any other reason. Does anyone has both autoimmune disorders and have the same problem as me?",
