            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of the lesion, though localized discoloration around the toes is unlikely to be related to a systemic issue. Possibilities that may need to be considered include infections, inflammations etc. I would suggest consulting a primary care physician or a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "This issue with the brown rough skin on the joints of the big toe is not related to shoes rubbing - I rarely wear shoes.I would like to know if this is an indicator of something else... such as kidney or liver disorders.It does not follow the typical pattern of brown skin related to obesity and/or diabetes.It does not respond to over the counter lotions, anti fungal, or hydrocortisone creams...I find that the brown spots appear, fade away, and return for no apparent reason.This discussion is related to toe discoloration.This discussion is related to/posts/Foot-Care-Podiatry/toe-discoloration/show/989121.",
