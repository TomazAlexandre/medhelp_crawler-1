            "answer": "Hi, its unlikely that Small fiber sensory neuropathy (SFSN) occurs due to simvastatin. It is a disorder in which only the small sensory cutaneous nerves are affected and is often due to diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism (i.e. early or pre-diabetic state) and may progress to typical diabetic polyneuropathy. Treatment of SFSN depends on the underlying etiology. If it is due to diabetes or pre-diabetic state, then optimum diabetic control and exercise and weight loss to reduce insulin resistance are needed. Regards.",
