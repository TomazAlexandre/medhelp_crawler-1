    "question": "My mom just turns 63 and she had a stroke with no paralysis. However, from her MIR, it shows no blood flow on her left side of the middle cerebral artery and reduced blood flow on her ugly side of the middle cerebral artery. It also shoes two old artery blockages and one newer blockage on the righ side. She has no high blood pressure, no diabetes. Her overall health is good. I want to ask in her situation is it necessary to do the surgery to open the right side or using medication to control the blockage getting worse. She never took any medication before. Thanks! I'm very worried!",
