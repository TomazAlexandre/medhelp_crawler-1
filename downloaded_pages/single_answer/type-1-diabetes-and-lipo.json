    "question": "Hello, I have had diabetes since I was 15, I am now 22.\u00a0\u00a0I was underweight..about 90 lbs prior to the diabetes. I gradually moved up to 120 and recently jumped to 130. I don't mind the weight, just the appearance. I have a huge stomach pouch. I am often asked if I am pregnant. It damages my self esteem very much because I was always so skinny and in shape. I also have problems in my upper arms and thighs, these are all places where I take my shots but I do rotate. I have trouble exercising because I have lyme disease as well and it causes me to be severely fatigued and sometimes I hurt all over. I heard before of someones insurance covering a tummy tuck or liposuction for a woman with type 1 that had the same problem. I would not be able to afford the surgery at least any time soon. I am 5' 2\". Thank you for any help or suggestions..I am desperate",
