            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!This looks like an episode of transient ischemic attack wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. To diagnose this you need a prompt evaluation to identify the cause and determine appropriate therapy. CAT Scans done hours later or when you are fine will not reveal anything. All predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc. The second possibility is seizures.There are many causes of dizziness, lightheadedness, passing out, blackouts etc. It is difficult to comment without examination. I am just enumerating the possible causes. You can discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Dizziness could be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position), internal ear problems and cervical spondylitis or compression of cervical spinal nerves. All these cause dizziness when you get up from lying down position or when you change position that results in a change in the level of your head. Cervical spondylitis and ear problems also cause dizziness on changing the position of the neck.Other causes are anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling.If you have an accompanying headache then you must also look at benign intracranial hypertension. Heart problems too have to be ruled out in your case. If all other tests are normal, maybe an ECHO should be done to rule out mitral valve prolapse.Many have polycystic disease of the ovary associated with insulin resistance. Increased insulin levels can cause hypoglycemia. Poor eating patterns too can be a cause. Other rare causes are insulin secreting tumors or insulinomas, and certain medications.There are many self testing kits available in the market for testing blood sugar. So even if your blood sugar is normal at labs, please test it just after the episode. Also if eating and drinking something helps then it could be low sugar or GERD.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
