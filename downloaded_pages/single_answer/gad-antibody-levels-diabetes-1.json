            "answer": "Hi,the best recommendation I could make would be to start monitoring your blood sugar from time to time to make sure that if you are developing diabetes you catch it early.Second, adopt a lifestyle that will help minimise / delay the development of diabetes.This would mean making sure your weight is optimal, following a lower carb and healthy diet and exercising daily (or nearly every day).If you do develop diabetes, considering it will be type 1 (autoimmune) you would need to go on insulin early.Can also recommend Diabetes Solution by R. Bernstein if you want to read about lifestyle and particularly low carb diet for diabetes.",

    "question": "I recently had some blood tests, the results for the Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Antibody (GAD) came back at 211.3 the normal range is 0.0-0.5. I discussed these results with my Endocrinologist, he told me I will get type 1 diabetes, we are not sure when. I have Hashimotos disease, an autoimmune disease where my body attacks my thyroid. The doctor told me when you have an autoimmune disease, your body starts attacking other parts of the body and the GAB test result showed that my body was attacking my pancreas, that will eventually result in type 1 diabetes. I was in shock and I froze, so I didnt get to ask the doctor more about this. Where Should I go from here?",
