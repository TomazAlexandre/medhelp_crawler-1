            "answer": "I am a little unclear if you have diabetes or if you are hypoglycemic, from you question.\u00a0\u00a0If you are hypoglycemic then www.hypoglycemia.org is a good website for some information.As for marijuana, I don't think there is a correlation between low blood sugars and using marijuana.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that it will lessen your ability to detect low blood sugars, anything mind altering is not advisable for a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0And when you overloaded with sugar you were probably overcompensating.\u00a0\u00a0Take some glucose, wait 15 minutes, check your blood sugar and if needed take more glucose and repeat those steps as necessary.",
