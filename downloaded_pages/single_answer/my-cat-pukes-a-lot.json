            "answer": "Hi there!!Not sure if the drywall dust could cause your cat to vomit.\u00a0\u00a0But some things that could cause her to vomit are an overactive thyroid, diabetes, kidney problems, and pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0All these things are treatable but could become serious FAST if you don't get her seen by a vet.Have you noticed any other symptoms??\u00a0\u00a0Like is she drinking and peeing more than usual??\u00a0\u00a0Is her appetite still normal eventhough she is puking?\u00a0\u00a0 Also it's important to notice what the puke looks like.\u00a0\u00a0Is it just food or is it foamy etc??\u00a0\u00a0Some cats will overeat or eat too quickly and puke their food back up.\u00a0\u00a0This happens a lot with dry food.\u00a0\u00a0But if it's been going on for a few days and not getting better it is surely worth getting it checked into.\u00a0\u00a0Cats can go downhill very quickly when they are sick.\u00a0\u00a0And a lot of times by the time they are showing symptoms they are already in need of a vet.I hope that your kitty is ok and that she gets better soon.\u00a0\u00a0You posted this a few days ago so maybe you've already taken her to the vet.\u00a0\u00a0Hope all is well !!",

    "question": "my cat has been puking a few times a day. i'm taking her to the vet, but it's been hard to the last few weeks. i just was wondering if anyone knows what it is. we're not feeding her anything different, and i clean her bowls regularly.she did just turn 10, but she's very small for her age. she looks about a year. and she is extremely active.one other thing, i'm fixing my basement, so there's a lot of drywall dust around the house. could this be the problem?",
