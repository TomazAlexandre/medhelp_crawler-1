            "answer": "It's unclear whether your husband has abdominal obesity (which is an independent risk factor for heart disease) or whether he may have saggy or \"redundnant\" tissue that can make it look like this.\u00a0\u00a0If it's abdominal obesity, then it can be difficult to target exercises toward eliminating it in particular - generally, I'd recommend overall decrease in calories (sugar in particular!) and more cardiovascular exercise (and lifting some weights can be helpful too!).",

    "question": "My 61 year old husband is trying to improve his weight and is losing slowly.\u00a0\u00a0Height 5' 10\", weight 186lbs.The problem is that he has a distended abdomen that appears the size of a 8-9month pregnancy but no \"under the skin\" fat that can \"pinch an inch\", even on his belly. The belly doesn't have an \"apron\" that hangs. His legs look slim and arms also are normal sized.He has genetic high cholesterol that is med controlled and diet/med controlled diabetes, had a CABG at age 42 and again in 2005.\u00a0\u00a0Health seems good.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't exercise regularly though we are working on that.*** My question is how can we decrease this large belly if it's abdominal fat?\u00a0\u00a0 Will exercise alone help and if so what kind?\u00a0\u00a0What can be done?",
