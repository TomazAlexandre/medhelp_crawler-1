            "answer": "Honestly, what got me to lose weight the quickest was having gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Granted, technically, I didn't lose any weight... but I didn't gain a single pound the entire pregnancy and am now 35-40 pounds lighter than my heaviest and about 25 pounds lighter than when I got pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I credit the diabetic diet I was on for the weight loss as I couldn't exercise while pregnant due to a hernia.\u00a0\u00a0(and I controlled it with just diet - no meds)You should see if you can find an example gestational diabetes meal plan online and try to follow it.\u00a0\u00a0I never thought I ate very much either - or too many carbs - until I followed it.\u00a0\u00a0But it's not as hard as it may seem, either!First, though, cut out all the fast food.\u00a0\u00a0There are so many more calories in those foods - even more than the processed foods we can buy at the supermarket.\u00a0\u00a0The honey bbq wings have got to go!\u00a0\u00a0Those things are going to have a ton of hidden carbs in them!\u00a0\u00a0And when you do eat carbs, try to get fiber in the same meal to help balance it out (ever gram of fiber takes about 1 gram of carbs of your count).\u00a0\u00a0And switch your drinks to water!!!\u00a0\u00a0It's amazing how many calories we drink every day.Another interesting fact about the carbs - everyone reacts to certain carbs different ways.\u00a0\u00a0White rice is a killer for me, I would eat less than the recommended amount for the diet, and my blood sugar level would soar.\u00a0\u00a0But, I could eat slightly more than the recommended amount of pasta, and my blood sugar level would be fine.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt you'll run out and get a blood glucose monitor to check it, but it's a good thing to keep in mind.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe some of the carbs you do eat are actually affecting you as though you've eaten more than you really did.The only other thing I did to lose my pcos weight is to walk.\u00a0\u00a0I'm walking about 2-3 miles 5 days a week.\u00a0\u00a0Just walking.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what the trainer has you doing, and I'm not doubting their expertise at all!\u00a0\u00a0Just letting you know how I got the weight off. :)As for the gyno - there are a few options.\u00a0\u00a0If you had your records forwarded to a new doctor, they probably wouldn't need to test or, at least, not so many tests.\u00a0\u00a0If you can't afford a doctor at all, can you try a sliding fee scale clinic or apply for Medicaid?\u00a0\u00a0Good luck - it's worth it!",

    "question": "i am 24, and was diagnosed with PCOS when i was 16 or 17. i had and still have no health insurance, and could not keep up with the gyno appts and medication. therefore when i was 19 i stopped taking metformin and going to a gyno all together. i am 287lbs and 5'3. i have been going to a personal trainer 2x a week since april and have only lost 14lbs. i am not following a weight loss plan because i get discouraged when i don't lose weight. i do not over eat, and i do eat relatively healthy. mostly veggies/chicken. i do enjoy white bread and pasta but i have cut that out 99% and now just eat wheat bread(which i do prefer more than white). i eat things high in protein as well. i am not much of a sweets person so rarely do i ever eat candy (in fact i dont know when the last time i did have candy was) and im not much for cookies or cake (unless its for holidays)....foods that i eat on a weekly basis consist of peanutbutter, wheat english muffins, plain popcorn, chick peas, plain oatmeal, vegetables, salads, cheese...i have a weakness for subways honey oat bread w/ shredded cheese and veggies(a veggie sub with cheese)...i also eat quinoa alot.some of the foods that i eat when i go out would be boneless honey bbq wings, if i eat at mcdonalds or burger king i get chicken nuggets...i do love diet soda and i have been trying to eliminate that all together. i have never in my life drank regular soda but my trainer told me that even diet soda is no good. basically i need to know what foods i should be eating on a daily basis, how many calories etc....i know metformin would help me but i can't get to a new gynocologist to run tests all over again and treat me for it since i financially cant afford it. any help would be appreciated. i am tired of looking in the mirror everyday and would do anything just to lose weight",
