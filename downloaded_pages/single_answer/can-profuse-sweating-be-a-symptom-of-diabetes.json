    "question": "I have been experiencing profuse sweating. It started over the past 2 months. I am a female, age 48. I have spoken with my primary care physician and he tells me it is due to hormones. I have researched this problem on the internetand discovered maybe it could be due to diabetes. Diabetes runs in my family. My sweating consists of getting completely soaked. I can be sitting in a cool room, air conditioner running and still get to point of dripping wet.It is a very embarrisng problem. Does anyone have any experience with this problem? If so, I would appreciate any advice I can get.",
