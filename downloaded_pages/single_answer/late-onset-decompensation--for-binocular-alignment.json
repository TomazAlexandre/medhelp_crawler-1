    "question": "what is the physiological process or reason for the brain to stop causing the eyes to focus together.?\u00a0\u00a0My neuro opthamologist said that the brain just \"gives up\" trying to get the eyes to focus together.\u00a0\u00a0I have intermittent extropia with up close diplopia.\u00a0\u00a0Do the neurons atrophy or die that once controlled the ability of the eyes to stay focused?\u00a0\u00a0I never had an eye muscle imblance before, I am 67, is it an aging issue?\u00a0\u00a0I had a brain MRI which was fine and I do not have any of the diseases associated with diplopia.I know you see with your brain and it interprets the images from the optic nerve.\u00a0\u00a0I am just puzzled as to why the brain stops causing the eye muscles to stay focused together? Any info on this process would be greatly appreciated< I have read a lot about this condition, but I haven't been able to get a clear understanding as to why this just \"happens\"",
