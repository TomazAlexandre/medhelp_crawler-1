            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to male pattern baldness. Male pattern baldness or Androgenic alopecia is a common form of hair loss and typically occurs in M shaped pattern.Men who have this type of hair loss usually have inherited the trait. Other causes may be use of some drugs, infections and underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. A biopsy (taking a small sample of cells to examine under a microscope) of your scalp may be needed to establish the correct diagnosis.Depending on your type of hair loss, treatments are available. If a medicine like Accutane is causing your hair loss, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine and if it is due to infections or systemic disease, then treating it will treat baldness.Medicines which are useful are minoxidil and finasteride. Finally one can resort to hair transplantation also.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "before jan 3rd 2011. I have always had a head full of hair. I could never see my scalp anywhere when i looked in the mirror. On jan 6th or 7th 2011 i noticed very very thin or borderline no hair in the back top of my scalp. Ican now see and feel my scalp because it is bald in that area. There was no sighns or warning or gradual process to indicate that this was coming. I am 43 yrs old. What could have caused my hair to fall out so suddenly without any gradual process ?",
