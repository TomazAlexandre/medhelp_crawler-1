    "question": "Does anyone on here have Hypoglycemia as well as Hypothyroidism or has had a thyroidectomy as well?I had 90% of my thyroid removed in 2003. This year I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and its gotten so bad.I believe this is related to my lack of functioning thyroid.I was recently switched from llevoxyl (100 mcg) to naturethroid (65mg) Have been on naturethroid for 2 months.I have been feeling better on naturethroid, but my hypoglycemia has gotten very severe despite my diet, etc. Im 5'5-165 lbs..I run 3 miles every day and eat very healthy. Eat a high protein diet to help my hypoglycemia but my hypoglycemia is getting unbarable even when I eat the right things and several small meals a day.I really would like to see if anyone else has expeirenced this and if they have any advice for me.Below are my most recent labs:T3,free: 2.9T4 free: 0.43 (low)T3 total: 122Tsh: 1.79",
