            "answer": "Hi!Since most of the symptoms involve the right side of your husband\u2019s body he could be having some neurological problem involving one half of your body. There is a chance that he has compression of the spinal nerves in the upper cervical spine region. Another possibility is transient ischemic attack (maybe ruled out by MRI of brain). However, if TIA is suspected then all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc. It can also be peripheral neuropathy due to lupus, diabetes, thyroid disorders etc.Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
