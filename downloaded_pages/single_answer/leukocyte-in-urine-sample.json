            "answer": "Hi,The urinalysis that is routinely done, is it for evaluation of sugar in urine or for any other underlying disorders that are monitored in the urine?Upto 5 leucocytes (WBC) in urine are considered acceptable.Leucocytes in large numbers can be indicative of inflammation along the urinary tract or possible infection if accompanied by bacteria.The type of infection will determine further treatment.HbA1C reading of 7.4 indicates that your blood sugar levels have been inadequately controlled, at least in the past 3 months. You will need to meet your treating doctor to adjust the dose of the antidiabetic medications you are on.Natural remedies for a possible infection of the tract include drinking plenty of fluids ( in excess of 2000 ml, if there is no fluid restriction due to impaired kidney function), addition of citrus juices in the diet, and plenty of fresh vegetables.Do keep us posted on your doubts and progress.Regards",
