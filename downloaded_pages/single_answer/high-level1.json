            "answer": "It's been awhile since I've been that high, but I know I felt pretty crummy: very fatigued, eyes blurry and generally blah. You were just diagnosed but has your doctor put you on a regimen to get those numbers down? If you start to feel like you have the flu or vomiting you need to go to the ER because numbers staying that high can lead to DKA which is a life threatening emergency, not as common in type 2's as type 1's, but it happens. In addition to what the doctor has prescribed to get those numbers down, do reduce carb intake as much as possible and drink a lot of water. Exercise isn't advised when you are that high.",
