            "answer": "I hope some of your questions have been answered by now. 6th nerve palsy is a non-localizing neurologic lesion. This means it can be anywhere along the 6th nerve from where it starts in the brainstem to its path toward the lateral rectus muscle. If the nerve isn't working, and the other eye isn't moving either, then you definitely need to see an EyeMD (ophthalmologist) and possibly a neurologist. Good luck! The MRI should help to shed some light on your condition, too. Diabetes could be another cause and blood pressure.",
