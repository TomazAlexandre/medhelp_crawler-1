            "answer": "Take your son to the doctor immediately if he is drinking that much water. One of the medications could have affected his kidneys or if the Metformin was for diabetes then it could have returned. What was he on it for? If a person takes Depakoate they are supposed to get regular blood tests for liver function. That is standard procedure. As for tardive dyskinesia there is treatment out there. See a neurologist who is a movement disorders specialist. I have severe tardive dyskinesia and have found Zofran to be quite helpful. There are many other medications as well. I have found the natural remedy rhodiola as I learned about from a clinical neurologist at Columbia University to be quite helpful but as always ask a doctor first.",

    "question": "For the past 3 years, we have been battleing with our 8 year old son over his behavior.\u00a0\u00a0I always said he was oppositional defiant, his dad says he is ADHD, and his Dr says he is bi-polar.\u00a0\u00a0He has been on\u00a0\u00a0Depakote XR, Metformin, and Risperdal.\u00a0\u00a0Like I said up till 3 weeks ago he was on all those, and all of a sudden, his Dr in 1 day, took him off all 3 and put him on Adderral.\u00a0\u00a0While on Adderral, he slept about 2-3 hours a night, but I will say that his behavior and moods were better.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn't eating at all, so I took him off of it after 7 days.\u00a0\u00a0Now this past Monday 5/21/08, I notice he has tardive dyskinesia....really bad too.\u00a0\u00a0Wasn't the Dr supposed to have tapered him off the 3 meds? And wasn't the Dr. supposed to have been checking depakote levels, and liver panels and stuff?\u00a0\u00a0My son will not be going back to that Dr, but I need some answers.\u00a0\u00a0Did I mention that now I have to literally take food away from my son because he does not know when he is full and yesterday drank about 30 8 ox glasses of water?????\u00a0\u00a0What do I do?",
