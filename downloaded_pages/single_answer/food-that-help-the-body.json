            "answer": "hi, i found this some days ago,,,please read,,,What not to eat- papaya and mangoes (atleast in the initial 3-4 months as they are supposed to generate heat)- Kalajamun/Jamun/Jambhul fruit, Pineapple, Green apples (with rough surface) and Sapota should be avoided during the whole pregnancy period- Dry fruits like kaju (cashew), jaggery, honey, green chillies, chilly powder should be eaten minimally as they generate heat- Avoid eating finely processed foods like maida (pizza, white bread etc), chinese (ajinomoto is not good), foods which use baking powder, oily and fast foods, cokes.- With respect to coconut water I had received varied feedback - while relatives were in favour of it, suggesting I have one per day. I overheard a doc mentioning to another lady in the next bed (when I was hospitalised) to avoid coconut water and bananas. After my diabetes was detected I was also told to avoid coconut water and bananas.- Remember not to have fruit juices from outside vendors or eat unwashed fruits. Apparently, there is some kind of virus (Toxoplasma, I guess) which if a pregnant woman gets infected with, can pass on to the foetus, lead to abortions etc.Normally, one should quit hot baths or hot showers(men especially), quit caffiene, cool drinks, alchohol, smoking. Maintain good hygeine in both of ur genital parts, to get rid of any infection,,then no pineapples, unripemangoes and chicken,,,,,If u r not able to quit anything completely,,u can minimise its use,,Do u have any fert issues,,,Last but not least,,take folic acid supplements, atleast 3 months before u ttc,,and both on multiviatmin tabs,,,Hope this helps!",
