            "answer": "Yours is a complex and serious situation.\u00a0\u00a0The accident you had sounds dreadful.\u00a0\u00a0I know that it can be extremely difficult to stop smoking but you must stop, if there is to be any hope of slowing the progression of both the emphysema and the coronary and peripheral arterial disease that caused your heart attack and strokes.\u00a0\u00a0You and your doctors must also focus on your metabolic status, specifically the lipid elevation.\u00a0\u00a0The combination of elevated cholesterol and abnormalities of the other lipids you cite combined with the vascular disease at a fairly young age and combined with an enlarged fatty liver suggests the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus.\u00a0\u00a0In addition a chronically elevated blood carbon monoxide level can significantly reduce the amount of oxygen available to your whole body, especially the oxygen available to your heart muscle.If you continue to smoke and your blood lipids remain abnormal, you are likely to experience more heart disease and strokes.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, should you stop smoking and lower your lipids, you could increase your longevity significantly.\u00a0\u00a0You will not be able to do this on your own.\u00a0\u00a0You will need both family and physician support.Good luck.",
