            "answer": "Post on the neuropathy forum, not here.Quick answer, from what I've heard: There are no set \"stages\" for neuropathy. It can progress rapidly or stay exactly the same.Good news: A recent study showed that some patients with PRE-diabetes (but not true diabetes) could reverse their neuropathy with strict diet/exercise/glycemic control.Also, diabetic neuropathy has been helped with certain supplements, such as alpha-lipoic acid (800 mg/day in the study, though that was IV) and gamma-linoleic acid (like borage oil). B12 (methylcobalamin) is also good for the nerves.Try visiting the peripheral neuropathy forum on BrainTalk. Very informative folk: Just Google it.",
