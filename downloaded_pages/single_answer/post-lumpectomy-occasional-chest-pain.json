    "question": "I had a benign lumpectomy 2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Periodically I feel chest pain, sort of like a knotting or cramping, have had EKG, enzyme tests following, fearing it was my heart, but those were negative.\u00a0\u00a0I'm suspecting that perhaps there is some nerve involvement and with wearing different supporting bras, perhaps there is a pulling that is aggravating the incision area - ?\u00a0\u00a0 I can palpate areas around the incision that are sore to the touch, but do not totally mimic the pain I feel.\u00a0\u00a0The pain increases with deep breathing.\u00a0\u00a0It is not sharp.\u00a0\u00a0I have family history of breast cancer, heart disease and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I watch my blood sugar and it stays within normal limits.\u00a0\u00a0Mammograms annually.",
