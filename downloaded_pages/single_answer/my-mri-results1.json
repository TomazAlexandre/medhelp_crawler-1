            "answer": "Hi again,Small vessel disease (SVD) would usually be just one of the 'potential causes' mentioned in the MRI report if the findings are consistent to SVD but the report is not conclusive, it's the neurologists job to dx you. The more informative information would be the location and description within the report because this gives specific details on what the MRI has found.I did notice you've mentioned in one of your other posts, \"i am a 51 year old female ihave had mini strokes\" and as far as i am aware small vessel disease (SVD) is associated with mini strokes, and conditions like Diabetes and high blood pressure are the more common causes of SVD but they probably wouldn't be the only causes and this would be what the neurologist needs to work out with further tests.Cheers........JJ",
