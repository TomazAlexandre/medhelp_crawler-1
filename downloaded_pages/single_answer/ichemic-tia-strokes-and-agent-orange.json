            "answer": "Good question, and to get the most definitive answer, you should contact your VA to speak with a specialist.I did a brief review and saw that Agent Orange is linked to increased incidence of multiple types of cancer, nerve damage, skin, digestive, and respiratory issues due to direct contact with membranes of the skin, GI tract, and respiratory tract. However, I saw no note about increased vascular issues, of which TIA would be considered. It appears that Agent Orange would not be a culprit for that, but I cannot say definitively either way. Other risk factors would be more likely the cause of your TIA (diabetes, HTN, smoking history).",
