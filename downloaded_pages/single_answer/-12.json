            "answer": "Hello,Numbness and erectile dysfunction of the penis can be due to smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord injury, nerve damage (for example, from prostate surgery), or neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease).My sincere advice is to consult a urologist/neurologist and get these possibilities ruled out.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
