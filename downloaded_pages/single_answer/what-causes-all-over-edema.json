            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The swelling or edema could be due to water retention as in low protein in blood, kidney problems, severe anemia etc. It could be due to hypothyroidism too. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms. Liver failure too can cause general body edema or swelling. The diagnosis and further tests will depend on whether the swelling is a pitting edema (causes a dent on pressure) or a non pitting edema.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
