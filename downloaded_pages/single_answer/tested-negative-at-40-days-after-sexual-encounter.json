    "question": "To follow up our last conversation I was tested 40 days after sexual encounter in 2009 and it was negative. The counselor at PP said I could come back and retest at 3 months but said she felt the result would still be negative. Now I am having all these strange symptoms like, itchy anus, chronic hives, stiff neck, lethargic\u00a0\u00a0and overall feeling of malaise. I also had a low wbc 3.7and low abs lmyph count and low rbc. My doctor said to an assistant right in front of me we sometimes see this is hiv patients but her differential looks okay so we will just retest in a couple of months. huh that with all these weird symptoms vs. the encounter 2 years ago and testing negative at only 40 days instead of the recommended 3 months has me scared again. What else could be causing such strange symptoms though. All other tests came back fine, thyroid, diabetes ect.This discussion is related to/posts/HIV-Prevention/Risk-from-giving-oral-sex-and-symtpoms-after/show/1042918.",
