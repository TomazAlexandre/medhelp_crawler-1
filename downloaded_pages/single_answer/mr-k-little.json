            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Tinnitus and certain neurological disorders such as paresthesia (caused by diabetes, pinched nerves, Lyme\u2019s, lupus, thyroid disorders etc) and central neuropathic pain are similar in many ways. So, yes, you can suffer from tinnitus and pain at the same time or one may precede the other. This is because the same part of central nervous system controls the impulses from the auditory nervous system and somatosensory systems. Changes in the brain or these systems can cause a cross-connection (just a term used to simplify the system) between the two seemingly unrelated systems of the body.So, once the pain is corrected by removing all the splinters and treating the jagged ends of bones, the tinnitus will also go away. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
