            "answer": "Hello!In large number of cases the darkening of the thighs and groin area is related to obesity. There is a condition called acanthosis nigrans which occurs due to insulin related problems. Obesity causes an increase in insulin levels in the body producing too much melanin in certain areas. If you are not obese discuss with your doctor as acanthosis nigrans could be a sign of several disorders like diabetes, polycystic ovarian disease. Seek the opinion of a dermatologist. There may be some medical procedures like dermabrasion and others which may really help in removing these dark areas. I do hope it helps.Take care and regards!",
