            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. I understand you have got blood work done. However, since we cannot discuss all details here, I am enumerating the possible causes of unexplained weight loss. You need to discuss with your doctor.One possibility is that you have an eating disorder. In which case taking help from a doctor specialized in treating eating disorders will help. There are many other causes of unexplained weight loss like worms in stool, depression, anorexia nervosa, AIDS, cancers especially colon cancers, drug abuse, infections and loss of appetite.Loss of appetite can again be due to certain medications, drug abuse, depression, AIDS, acute and chronic infections, eating disorders, cancers and hypothyroidism.Either you do not eat well or there is increased metabolism as in hyperthyroid states, HIV, cancer etc. Poor absorption as in irritable bowel syndromes and malabsorption syndromes too is possible.Malabsorption syndromes are seen in intestinal tuberculosis, HIV, tropical sprue, parasites in stool and Whipple\u2019s Disease. Diabetes too can be the cause. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi, since two months I've been losing weight - about 6 kg - and experiencing a lot of other symptoms: extreme fatigue, very puffy upper eye lids, a strange sensation and sometimes pressure throughout my head but most pronounced in my forehead area, muscle aches, intermittent vision problems.I've checked my thyroid, both by getting blood work done to check relevant hormone levels and doing an ultrasound. And I had my blood checked in general. All has come back normal but the symptoms are worsening and my general doctor is getting clueless. I don't have a history of anything, but I do have sleep apnea, which was told to me years ago by a neurolgist and that has been confirmed by my girlfriend's complaints about my unusually loud snoring.And I'll look into that, but hope someone might look at these symptoms and give me some insight into some of the most likely culprits.",
