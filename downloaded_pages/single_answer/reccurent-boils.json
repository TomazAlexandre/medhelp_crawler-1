            "answer": "HiThere may be several causes for recurrent boils such as chronic furunculosis, often caused by staphylococcus aureus and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0hidradenitis suppurativa, an inflammatory condition of the hair follicle and apocrine gland. Persistent furunculosis may be an indication of a depressed immune system.Hidradenitis Suppurativa is an uncommon chronic inflammatory skin condition. The disease manifests as clusters of chronic abscesses and boils, which can range from very large to very small. The lesions are extremely painful to the touch.Treatment of furunculosis usually involves use of warm compresses, incision and drainage, antibacterial washes and antibiotics depending on the severity. A culture and sensitivity of the discharge may be required so that the causative organism and antibiotic sensitivity can be tested. The usual course of oral antibiotics is 5-10 days or even longer in persistent cases. Dietary supplements of vitamin A and vitamin E are also helpful. In persistent cases of recurrent boils, the physician may want to examine family members or close contacts to see if they are carriers of staphylococcus.There is not a single treatment developed as yet for Hidradenitis. The current modalities of treatment include antibiotics, long term (commonly tetracyclines- as a preventive measure) and short term (typically Ciprofloxicillin- for secondary infections), retinoids, high-dose systemic steroids, birth control pills (to make up for the hormonal imbalance). Surgical treatments such as incision and drainage of the lesions and sometimes radiotherapy are also used for treatment.Your friend should wear loose fitting clothes and underwear. A general advice would be to stop smoking and lose weight, which may contribute indirectly in symptom control.Your friend should also consult a physician to determine whether there is an underlying disease such as diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune disorders.Take care!",
