            "answer": "The \"eye doctor\" you're seeing should be an Eye MD ophthalmologist physician to accept that explanation. IF you're seeing a non-MD, non-physician optometrist you have not been evaluated properly.Double vision just in left gaze could be a left lateral rectus palsy (6th cranial nerve) and that can be due to some very serious problems like small strokes, tumors, aneurysms, diabetes, etc.If the double vision is new you need a full work up which would included seeing an ophthalmologist ideally a neuroophthalmologist or strabismus specialist and possibly a neurologist. Blood work and MRI likely necessary also.JCH MD",
