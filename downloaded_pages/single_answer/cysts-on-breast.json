    "question": "For the last 2 years I have small sores on the outside of my breast.\u00a0\u00a0They range in size and appearance but typically last for about two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0It is common to have several at a time on both breasts.\u00a0\u00a0The sore has a white head on it, sometimes drains fluid.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the sore is red and sunken in, and appears to be an open sore.\u00a0\u00a0This first started appearing weeks after the birth of my second daughter who was born c-section.\u00a0\u00a0I was tested for MRSA twice both times negative.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor says they are cysts on the outside of my breast and recommends I see a dermatologist.\u00a0\u00a0I saw a video on IBC (Inflammatory Breast Cancer).\u00a0\u00a0Is this possible that this is what I have or can you have cysts on the outside of your breast?",
