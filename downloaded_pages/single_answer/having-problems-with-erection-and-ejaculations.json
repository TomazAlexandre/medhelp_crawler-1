            "answer": "Hi there!Erectile dysfunction can develop due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors with your partner. You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, or you have difficulty controlling anxiety; I would suggest seeing your primary care physician or a urologist for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "I'm a 50 yr old male, excellent shape. I weight train 4 days a week. I am on no meds at all.I don't smoke or do drugs and drink very very little. Never had any problems until lastMarch of 2012. No high blood pressure or diabetes.Symptoms started out with a slight painful urination. I always use protection to let youknow.After a couple days I realized that well something was going on as it was getting alittle worse.Went to to my GP cause I was thinking how is this posible I have an STD but hadn't had sexin 3 months. Ok so the GP did a swab and also checked my urine.1 st, Treatment was a shot and a weeks worth of anti biotics. Urine was clear and the swabcame back also Negative. As i was continuing to take the firast round of anti biotics thesymptoms got worse. The burn was getting so bad I could barely urinate.Went back to the dr to see what was going on as I am in pain als a clear slight dischargefrom my penis and it looked very very red.2 nd, Treatment was two anti biotic shots, another swab and this time he did a urine cultureand checked my prostate.Prostate was fine. Tests all came back once again as negative.Symptoms continued. I was looking up online myself to see what could be going on. The best Icame up with was I might have passed a tiny stone and could be stuck in my urethra.Ok so seems like what people said to do was drink tons of water and wait til you have a fullbladded and then go to the bathroom and squeeze your penis head while letting yourbladderfully open then release your hold on your penis head and all the pressure shouldflush out any tiny stone if that was the case.Hmm, welll don't know about any stone passing and all I woulnd up with was a severe bruiseon the top of my penis head that looked horrible, more like a hematoma I guess. Took almosttwo months for the bruise to go away. The burning lasted for almost 1 month then went away.Ever since then I just have not felt the same down there. Symptoms are don't feel like I geterections as often as I used to which was constant, lol high testosterone levels alwayshave. Now I'm not always getting fully hard and a able to keep good erections and myejactulations just suck. Feels almost so sensitive that barely wants to come out.I do have problems with two disks I think the L5 and S1 regions. Could buldging disks becausing any of this? Need help very frustrated.",
