            "answer": "Ok, your are at a risk of 1 in 5 for a genetic anomaly. The test that should be offerd to you from your Ob or either a CVS or Genetic amniocentesis, both have the same 2% risk of losing the pregnancy from the tests. Both are very accurate. Now if it does not matter if the child has a genetic anomaly ( Down's Syndrome) don't do the test. That is an obvious answer. But I let alot of couples know that if Down's syndrome would not matter than why test, some couples want to know and for some it is meant to be.Second I would suggest you see a Maternal Fetal Specialist, High Risk OB. Reasons are that you are at a highter risk of gestational diabetes, miscarrage, pre-ecclampsia, etc.The only thing I can thinking of to limit the risk of miscarriage that you may have control over is progesterone levels. Ovarian progesterone maintains the pregnancy the first ten weeks then the placenta makes progesterone. Progesterone will not maintain a pregnacy that is an inevitable miscarrage or non compatible with life, mostly those that lack the ovarian vitality to make progesterone.Obviously, fluids and prenatal vitamins, and get an MFM Ob appointment ASAP.Congratualtions and all the best,JM",
