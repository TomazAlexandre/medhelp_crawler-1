Which I concur.\u00a0\u00a0But if it WERE to be hiv related it would be later stage hiv. I would think at later stage hiv though, that I would have a lot more things to worry about than just some abscesses on my ***.I've always been a pretty frequently-sick person.\u00a0\u00a0I get the flu or colds when anyone has them.\u00a0\u00a0And I've had light skin problems my whole life. light eczema or light psoriasis I guess it would be.",

    "question": "Over the last number of months I have had recurrent problems with abscesses, furuncles, and follicalitus all around 'the underpants area\".I was frequenting spas, not for sex, but for massages and occasional hand jobs.\u00a0\u00a0I figured the hygiene in those places not being so high was the cause of some staph infection.\u00a0\u00a0But it continues. I don't think i am hiv positive but am worried to hell that i am.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had any of the symptoms of hiv,and haven't had unprotected vaginal sex with anyone of a positive status.\u00a0\u00a0I am not gay or a drug injector.Still, my problem obviously suggest immune system problem.I believe diabetes is the primary possibility.\u00a0\u00a0my anxiety is really really high because I'm thinking the worst.",
