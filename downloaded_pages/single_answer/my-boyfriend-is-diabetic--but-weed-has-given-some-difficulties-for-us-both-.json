            "answer": "If your boyfriend does not have diabetes under control, there is an excellent chance that his quick temper is being caused by it.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugar level fluctuations can cause even the nicest of people to become virtual monsters - but suggesting that it's their blood sugar level can backfire, too. I don't believe marijuana has any direct ill effects on diabetes - and have often heard quite the opposite.\u00a0\u00a0Since he was kicked out of his home, how does he get the medical care he needs for his diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Does he take his diagnosis seriously?\u00a0\u00a0If he has a blood glucose monitor - see if he's willing to test when he's being \"irritable\" - anything over 300 is dangerous for him.\u00a0\u00a0If he doesn't have a monitor, see if there's a way to get one for him.\u00a0\u00a0He needs to take care of his diabetes... it's not an illness you can ignore and hope it goes away.",

    "question": "Hello.My boyfriend is 17, I am 16. He was diagnosed with diabetes a year or so ago. We've been together for almost four months but I quickly noticed his problem with weed. He smokes it every day and it's been really hurting me. He probably shouldn't be smoking weed with his diabetes. Not only that, but we are having a lot of problems in our relationship. He is so easily offended and irritable. At first, I didn't see how unstable he was until now. I know he means well, but sometimes this just isn't enough. He's had a tough life and I think the lack of love from his parents has made him want to reach out for attention later in years. Recently he was kicked out of his and for smoking too much weed.I don't know how to confront him about it, I'm afraid he'll feel hurt. I'm also afraid that he will become angry at me. I don't know what to do. What should I be worried about? Do these emotional problems come from weed? I really need help and advice.",
