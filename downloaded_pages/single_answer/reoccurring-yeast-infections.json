            "answer": "Hi!Well, yes, the risk of vaginal infections especially thrush or fungal infection is higher in women on contraceptive pills containing estrogen. Changing the pill type often helps in these cases. Yeast infection or thrush is at times very difficult to treat. You may need to take oral antifungal pills twice a week for 3-4 weeks along with local application of antifungal cream. Antifungal with a combination of two or more anti fungals is more effective. At times both partners need to be treated. However, these are strong medicines, and please do not take without consulting your gynecologist who would first confirm that it is indeed fungal infection.Various reasons for recurrent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Discuss this with your gynecologist. Take care!",

    "question": "First off I would like to ask how long a canes oral capsule takes to start working and how long until it should be gone?Secondly it you get them all the time is there something you can do about it or a doctor can do about it. I find they are most common for me when I go to the gym frequently. I make a point of showering and changing into clean clothes immediately after my workouts. I also change my underwear everyday when I get home from work and put on thin track pants to allow breathing. Another question: could it be the birth control I'm on?",
