    "question": "Well I'm sorry if someone may have posted something like this before but I wouldn't mind some advice.2 years ago I was sent to the ER with very severe lower back pain. The hospital sent me home with painkillers and Valium and told me I was holding stress in that area of my back and that is what was causing the pain. I undertook a much less stressful lifestyle however things have gotten worse.6 months ago and over the course of about 12 weeks I lost all sensation in my bladder. I am now unable to tell when my bladder is full and was prone to wetting myself however have gotten into a routine of going to the bathroom every 2nd hour and sitting for a few minutes. Over this time I began losing sensation in my genitals and much to my own embarrasment can rarely reach climax anymore. I have also experienced about a 50% loss of feeling down the left side of my body. What may be a sharp scratch on my right side which will cause me to flinch feels much less painful on my left side. My back pain has also worsened to the point where I now cannot walk more than a few hundred metres without ending up in severe pain. I get bloating/swelling in my left leg so badly that I often cannot put my shoes on as my foot won't fit in them.I am a 27 year old female, 5'10, 225lbs (down from 240, have switched to a healthier diet), mild asthmatic, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 2 1/2 years ago which is diet controlled and I am VERY mindful about what I eat the amount of sugar I ingest. I gave up smoking a month ago, probably have 1-2 glasses of wine a month and do not take any recreational drugs.My GP referred me to have a CT scan which showed some slight narrowing in L5/S1 however nothing that can explain my symptoms. I have seen a Neurosurgeon who has referred me for a full spine and a brain MRI. My Neurosurgeon confuses me as he doesn't explain things very well and I feel somewhat left in the dark about what the problem 'might' be.",
