            "answer": "HI,Even if you do not eat anything, the glucose made by the liver does cause an increase in your blood sugar. In addition the cortisol bump in early mornings cause many folks to have higher blood sugars then. So you have a few reasons for this rise.I think you should record the range in sugars you see and show all to your doctor. Based on the numbers you wrote I think you should discuss restarting the metformin with your doctor because they are not in the normal range. The best way to go with early diabetes is to get a hold on it quickly, and give it less time to do damage to your body so definitely talk about this with your doc.Take care",
