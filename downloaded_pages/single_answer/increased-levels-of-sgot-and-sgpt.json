            "answer": "Hi there,You seem to have mildly elevated hepatic enzymes and alkaline phosphatase.Mildly elevated ALP can be seen in infectious mononucleosis, bile duct obstruction, hepatitis, heavy alcohol consumption, and fatty liver. In fatty liver there is fat in the liver, along with inflammation and damage. Fatty liver due to alcoholism is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. Only if fatty liver disease advances a person can develop cirrhosis .The process can stop and, in some cases, reverse on its own without specific therapy. Lifestyle changes may be helpful. You should refrain from taking alcohol, as this will cause further injury to the liver. Treat diabetes if present and control obesity and high triglyceride levels. Adopt lifestyle changes like weight reduction, exercise etc. An ultrasound will confirm whether you have fatty liver or not. Consult your doctor for more queries and assistance. I hope it helps.Best wishes and kind regards!",
