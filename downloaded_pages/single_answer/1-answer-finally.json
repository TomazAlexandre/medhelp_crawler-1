            "answer": "Hi, I'm sorry, not the diagonosis one would ask for, but at least an answer.As for the drug, I only know what I just read at Wikipedia:The main use for metformin is in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2, especially when this accompanies obesity and insulin resistance. Metformin is the only anti-diabetic drug that has been proven to reduce the cardiovascular complications of diabetes, as shown in a large study of overweight patients with diabetes.[10] Unlike the other most-commonly prescribed class of oral diabetes drugs, the sulfonylureas, metformin (taken alone) does not induce hypoglycemia.[11] Hypoglycemia during intense exercise has been documented, but is extremely rare.[12] It also does not cause weight gain, and may indeed produce minor weight loss.[13] Metformin also modestly reduces LDL and triglyceride levels.Sounds pretty good to me; proven to reduce cardiovascular complications, can reduce LDL and triglyceride levels, and might produce minor weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't get to any side effects.Hopefully someone with experience with taking this medicine will come along soon and share their experience with it.Good luck,Kathy",
