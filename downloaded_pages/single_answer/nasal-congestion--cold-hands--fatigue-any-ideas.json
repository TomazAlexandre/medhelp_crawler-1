    "question": "For the past 3-4 months, I've had the following symptoms:- Nasal Congestion with no nasal discharge, this is pretty much constant. It only abates when I exercise or take antihistamines/nasal sprays.- A sort of pressure over my face, primarily the forehead. I don't really know how to describe it, but something like a dull pain, perhaps. Rarely in the mornings, appears during the day and gets worse in the evening.- Cold hands and feet, but the hands are considerably colder. Varies in intensity but I am almost always cold. At its worst, washing my hands with even slightly warm water feels like putting my hands in a boiling pot.- At times I feel really, really hungry, despite having eaten recently. I'm not starving myself either, as I've started eating more since this began.- Constantly fatigued, trouble trying to focus at times.- Shortness of breath. Not to the point where I notice it all the time, but definitely when I'm exercising.- Mild, occasional diarrhea- Occasional bloated feeling and trouble properly emptying my bladder (resulting in having to go to the bathroom frequently, particularly when I try to sleep).- Moderate muscle and joint aches.- My throat isn't what I'd call sore but at times it... feels like there's something there. During those times it's harder for me to swallow.- At times I get a mild skin rash over my chest which disappears in an hour or two and re-appears on a daily basis.I've been to both a general practitioner and an ENT. The first time, the GP diagnosed me with sinusitis, I got some antibiotics for it which didn't help with my symptoms, so I went again. He concluded that my sinusitis had gone away and that the symptoms would get better. They didn't, so I went to an ENT who gave me some more antibiotics (didn't work) and ordered a blood test for me. According to him, the blood test showed nothing abnormal... but my symptoms aren't getting any better at all.",
