            "answer": "Hello Stretconstant,Thanks for posting to our Forum.\u00a0\u00a0As you may know, we're all volunteers with extensive experience as diabetics or caregivers -- or both.\u00a0\u00a0None of us is a medical professional, so be sure to check out all advice you get here with your own doc.\u00a0\u00a0If you're adult enuf to be thinking about using marijuana, you're adult enough to talk with your docs about it, too.Marijuana does nothing therapeutic for a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that mairjuana relaxes a person and makes him/her more suggestible, it can be argued that marijuana introduces new risks and dangers to a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0For example, many folks report getting the \"munchies\" when they smoke marijuana or eat it in baked goods.\u00a0\u00a0Taking on extra calories & carbos in particular is specifically NOT recommended for us.\u00a0\u00a0We already have difficulty processing carbos and are advised to keep our weight withint normal ranges to eliminate one more cause for cardio-vascular problems.Having said all that, however, I know that young people, in particular may be drawn to marijuana because -- by itself -- it has no calories or carbos.\u00a0\u00a0I used it a bit in college (25+ years ago) for taht reason.\u00a0\u00a0For me, it was also a \"gateway\" drug to experiment with other things, since I'd chosen to be around drug users instead of my regular pals.\u00a0\u00a0I was able to pull myself out of the drug world and am enjoying a great career & family life because of it.\u00a0\u00a0OTOH, some of my less-fortunate pals at the time ended in prison and worse.While you asked a simple question, I know I've provided anything but a simple answer.\u00a0\u00a0Be careful.\u00a0\u00a0Try meditation, exercise, and volunteering to help other folks as ways to help yourself deal with life's stresses and to continue your path to becoming a more capable & competent adult, free from self-pity.",
