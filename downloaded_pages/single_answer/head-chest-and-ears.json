            "answer": "Hi,If you are experiencing chest pains and shortness of breath associated with activity, I suggest that you seek immediate consultation. You may need a complete cardiac assessment to rule out any cardiac problems. If you have a strong family history of heart problems, stroke and diabetes and if you have been smoking then you will be needing a thorough evaluation. Headaches of a benign nature ( like migraines and tension headaches) are given as a diagnosis when all other possible underlying conditions have been ruled out.So please seek\u00a0\u00a0a consultation with your physician.Refrain from any strenuous acitivities. Avoid straining and vigorous exercises. Also avoid exposure to extreme heat.Do keep us posted regarding your physician's advice.",
