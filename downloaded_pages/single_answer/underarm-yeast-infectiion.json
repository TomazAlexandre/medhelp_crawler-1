            "answer": "Hello,The bumps that you get after shaving are due to folliculitis. Folliculitis is the inflammation of one or more hair follicles. The condition may occur anywhere on the skin.Folliculitis starts when hair follicles are damaged by friction from clothing or blockage of the follicle. In most cases of folliculitis, the damaged follicles are then infected with the bacteria Staphylococcus (staph).Please keep the area clean and apply some topical antiseptics. Also wear loose-fitting cotton clothing and use an antibacterial soap or mild soap like dove.Avoid any kind of cosmetics. Topical antibiotics such as mupirocin or neomycin containing ointment are also useful.In case the symptoms persist then oral antibiotics may be needed.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult a dermatologist in that case.Regarding the yeast infection, it is better to get a KOH examination of the skin scrapings done to confirm the diagnosis.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
