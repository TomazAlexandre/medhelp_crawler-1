            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to hear that you are still not feeling normal. Everything depends on the extent of surgery, radiation and drugs side effects, and on the possibilities of anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism etc co-existing.Also meningioma is known to recur. Hence though its just five months, this possibility too needs to be looked into.I suggest you consult your treating doctor for a re-evaluation, and try and find the cause for your symptoms. Take care!",
