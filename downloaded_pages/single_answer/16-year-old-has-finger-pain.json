The other possibilities she may have been tested for: low vitamin B12, low vitamin D, diabetes, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and anemia.

    "question": "My daughter has been complaining about her hands/fingers hurting for some time. I had blood work done and everything came back normal. I thought that might appease her and make it better but it didn't. She is still complaining. I've tried icing them, having her wear gloves, take aspirin and Motrin. She doesn't do anything that should be make her fingers hurt. She doesn't use the computer or text on the phone (believe it or not). Any ideas? I'm stumped!",
