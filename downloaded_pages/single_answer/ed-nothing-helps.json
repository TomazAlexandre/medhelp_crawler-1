    "question": "I am a 61 year old male.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on various anti-depressants since my late 30's (Major Dysthymic Depression, PTSD).\u00a0\u00a0Since 1992 I have had off and on again problems maintaining an erection and finally around 2000 I pretty much lost interest in sex all together.\u00a0\u00a0Finally in 2005 I went to an Endocrinologist and she diagnosed me as having way low testosterone.\u00a0\u00a0She put me on patches and later Androgel pumps and finally little packets that I squeeze on.\u00a0\u00a0The \"mood\" returned with a vengeance, but unfortunately my erection hasn't.\u00a0\u00a0I have noticed that if I am lying in bed in the middle of the night, I can occasionally get a hard erection but most of the time it is way to soft to do anything.\u00a0\u00a0I have had Rx for Viagra and the various clones, and also just got a penis pump a couple of months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Neither works at all.I have high blood pressure (125/60 -140/70 with an occasional spike to 150/65), and am on Metformin for diabetes (ranges anywhere from 70 to 130 average through out the day).\u00a0\u00a0I have run out of ideas on what to do and my wife is getting aggravated, although luckily with her menopause, her libido has been mostly low so that helps.Any suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0If nothing else how do I get the damn pump to work?",
