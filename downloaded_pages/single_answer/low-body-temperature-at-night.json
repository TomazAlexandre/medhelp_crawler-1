            "answer": "I'm sure this could be many things, but I would investigate blood sugar control.\u00a0\u00a0It is not unheard of to get hypoglycemic while sleeping. See this article: http://www.diabetesselfmanagement.com/articles/low-blood-glucose/hypoglycemia_symptoms/5/Body temperature is primarily controlled by the hypothalmus, but insulin and adrenal function (cortisol) play a role through sugar regulation and metabolism in the brain. If your blood sugar levels are very low you may feel very shaky and have big swings in your body temp. Could also be related to sex hormones\u00a0\u00a0levels (estrogen, progesterone). e.g. if you were having hot flashes with peri/menopause a night sweat would leave you cold. (Don't know if you are male or female.)If I were you, I would look first your blood sugar control. Do you have big swings in hot/cold after eating high carb meals? A family history of diabetes? Is this every night?\u00a0\u00a0When is your last meal before going to bed? More than 2-4 hours?Sorry I can't be of more help but I would research those ideas to see if you find a good fit for your symptoms, not only when sleeping but in other parts of your day.",
