    "question": "Hi everyone, thanks for reading. I am a 46 year old female in good health, but I suffer from alot of stress and anxiety. In the past I've been frightened over symptoms that seem like they could be some disease coming on but it's always been chalked up to stress. It can get embarrassing! Many of my eymptoms manifest as tight muscles, sometimes burning sensations, stomach problems, et.While I am not in an immediately high stress situation, I am overworked and as of later always borderline depressed. The last month or so some new symptoms have erupted..my feet are tingling constantly..like the low level pins and needles..sort of a buzzing which intensifies with every step but seems to settle down at night. I have tingling, burning and prickling sensations in my hands, a burning, hot sensation in my mouth, slight numbness on the face, and this off again on again buzzing in my chest and sometimes the groin. I have read that others have felt something like the \"celphone going off\" sort of vibration..that is what is going on in the trunk of my body, but the extremities like the hands and feet are prickling, burning and tingling all day long.Has anyone else gone thru this for extended periods of time? I can understand it short term, but I dont get why it would go on for months at a time. I am very close to getting bloodowrk done for Diabetes. I have no other reason to do this other than that tingling is involved.Any help would be great..thank you!",
