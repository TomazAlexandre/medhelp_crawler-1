            "answer": "Hi there!Libido/ sex drive has a multi-factorial involvement and diabetes may not be the only factor involved. Though diabetes, particularly with high blood sugars could result in a low sex drive; other issues such as stress, anxiety, nutritional deficiencies, fatigue, anemia, a few medications/drugs, hormonal imbalance etc may need to be ruled out as well; before prescribing empirical cialis. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary care physician, in case there might be other factors involved and appropriate management. If there are no other issues found, behavioral therapy may be tried, in case it might help.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I was just diagnosed with this disease a little over two years ago. When I was first treated with insulin for the first two months, my libido sky rocketed. Now it has been two years and my sex drive comes in little spirts and then dies as soon as it comes. I am in my twenties and I go to the gym 5-6 days a week (somewhat in the hopes that my sex drive will return if I am healthy enough). It upsets me to no and all my endo suggested was to use cialis. I feel this is a mask to the problem and I don't see a permanent solution in sight. I don't want any relationships because I just wouldn't know how to break it to my partner. It's tearing me up inside and it's all I worry about. I exercise and eat as healthily as possible. What can I do to fix this, should I switch my endo and get a second opinion? Is there anything I can do to make this work?",
