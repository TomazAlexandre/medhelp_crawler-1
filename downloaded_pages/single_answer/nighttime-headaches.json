            "answer": "Hi,Nighttime headaches can have many causes. Sometimes migraines and cluster headaches awaken a person from sleep. In other cases, nighttime headaches are actually hypnic \u2014 or \"alarm clock\" \u2014 headaches. Hypnic headaches begin only during sleep, usually awakening the person at the same time every night. Hypnic headaches are most common after age 50. The pain can be mild to moderate and usually lasts from 15 minutes to two hours, but occasionally longer. The exact cause of hypnic headaches isn't known.Please\u00a0\u00a0see your doctor. Headaches are typically diagnosed based on a person's medical history and specific signs and symptoms. In some cases, imaging tests \u2014 such as computerized tomography \u2014 are needed as well. Treatment varies, depending on the type of headache and any underlying causes. Hope this helps you . Take care and regards !",
