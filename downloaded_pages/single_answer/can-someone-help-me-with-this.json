    "question": "I need to prelude this by saying I did numerous irresponsible things, but that doesn't change the fact that I need help.Back in January I wanted to lose weight since I'm at risk for diabetes so I tried a low dose of ephedrine. 25mg along with 50mg zoloft. I have taken ephedrine before but this time I got really speedy, weird effects. A few days later I thought 'maybe I just used too much' so I tried 12.5mg and 25mg, same thing. I waited a week just out of curiosity and tried 6mg and 10mg and got a weaker version of the same thing.I know I screwed up, but 80% of strokes and 60% of cancers are avoidable, we all make mistakes. And people take 75mg+ a day w/o problem (I used 40mg spread over a week), but it didn't work that way for me.Ever since then I have been twitching and having weird panic attacks. My hands get sweaty and cold, my feet go cold, my brain gets foggy, I feel depersonalized and unreal but instead of panic I have symptoms of psychosis, my thoughts get mumbled. This lasts 10-20 minutes, then wears off. I get them now and again.I would say my symptoms are better now compared to a few months ago, but today I had a horrible panic attack, the worst I've ever had. I still feel worn out and physically drained, and it was about 6 hours ago that it happened.I have a drs. appointment on monday, and I want to see an endocrinologist and neurologist to see if I did any damage to myself. What should I be asking about, if anything?I notice that (I think) vitamin B-12 seems to improve my symptoms. I have no idea why though. It seems to help with the brain fog.Can anyone relate to any of this?",
