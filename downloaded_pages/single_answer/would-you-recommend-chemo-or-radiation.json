            "answer": "Hi there.The decision to give additional therapy such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy would depend on the size of the primary tumor, the lymph node status, the grade of the tumor and the over all stage.Lymph node positive disease would usually require adjuvant chemotherapy, and if with 4 or more nodes or a very large primary tumor, then radiation therapy would be required.If all your other diseases are controlled (Lupus and Diabetes), then I can't see any reason why you will not tolerate chemotherapy if indicated.\u00a0\u00a0Caution is advised for radiation therapy since this may have greater toxicities on the skin for patients diagnosed with Lupus.Regards.",
