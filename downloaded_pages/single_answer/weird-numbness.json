            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.One-sided numbness of the body is most commonly due to a problem in the brain rather than the spinal cord or peripheral nerves. Many possibilities exist for one-sided numbness, and depend somewhat on your age, your risk factors, and the nature of your symptoms, which would be better determined during your physical examination with a neurologist.The most concerning cause of numbness on one side of the body is a stroke, but given the normal CT head and MRI of your brain, per your report, it is less likely. But if you do have risk factors of smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, or diabetes, you should work with your primary physician to reduce these risks.Other potential causes of one-sided numbness include multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, a vascular malformation and others. These, too, are less likely given your normal brain imaging.The one-sided numbness you are describing seems to be transient. Transient one-sided body numbness (lasting for example for minutes up to 30 minutes then resolving) could be due to a migraine (the aura of migraine, in which case following the numbness, a headache occurs) or seizure. Another cause could be low calcium in your blood.I agree that you would benefit from evaluation by a neurologist. You may wish to eliminate the alleve D and evaluate if the symptoms recur.\u00a0\u00a0I would also recommend a carotid ultrasound if you have not had the vessels imaged.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "I have had a weird numbness of my face, mouth and right arm. The numbness occurs periodically upon standing up. It starts in my right sinus ( I have a constant sinus headache), travels to my mouth and tongue and then down my right arm. I also have a metallic taste in my mouth when the numbness occurs. The numbness is usually short term and is like pins and needles. However a couple of days ago it was intense and lasted for about two minutes. I went to the hospital following this intense episode. They did a cat scan of my chest and head as well as an MRI and MRA. All were negative. My blood pressure is fine, ekg was normal and heart rate is normal. I have no speech problems when this occurs. I do feel an aura before these symptoms occur. The symptoms first occurred after taking an alleve D for the sinus headache (I normally do not take any medication for my sinuses). I am going to see a neurologist next week, but would appreciate any ideas you might have.",
