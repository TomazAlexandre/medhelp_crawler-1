    "question": "My mother is a 74 year old with a long history of insulin dependent diabetes with some heart and liver disease involvement.\u00a0\u00a0About 18 months ago, she developed uncontrollable GI bleeding within her stomach and has been transfused weekly since then.\u00a0\u00a0She was diagnosed with portal hypertensive gastropathy and underwent a TIPS procedure which did not decrease the stomach bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0She has also been treated numerous times with argon plasma coagulation without success.\u00a0\u00a0The GI doctors have now diagnosed her with GAVE's Syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0She is now requiring about 5 units of blood per week and has had approximately 150 units of blood since she started bleeding 18 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0This past week, she required 7 units of blood.The GI doctor says there is nothing else they can do and that a surgeon will likely not agree to do a gastrectomy due to her overall poor health related to the diabetes, heart and liver disease.\u00a0\u00a0My question is... Is this true?\u00a0\u00a0Why wouldn't it be better to attempt a gastrectomy and give a person a chance at surviving as opposed to continuing to slowly bleed to death.",
