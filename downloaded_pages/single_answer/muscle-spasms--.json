            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Did you start potassium after the cramps started or you have been taking it? If you have been taking it, stop it and see. If you just started then I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium (stop spplemets for a day or two and then test), calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause. Get a complete hormone panel-FSH, LH, estrogen and progesterone. Hormone replacement therapy may also help. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
