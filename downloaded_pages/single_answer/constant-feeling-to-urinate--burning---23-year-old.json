            "answer": "Hello,I cannot confirm anything without examination but it can be urinary tract infection, prostatitis, diabetes mellitus, glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism and hyperparathyroidism.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography , prostate specific antigen, thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis. I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made. But firstly try drinking plenty of water because if it is simple UTI, then adequate amount of fluids will flush out the infection.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "of the blue, one day I just had a stinging sensation in my penis. I figured it was a UTI and went to the doctor a few days later. It was slightly improving at that point. He did a urinalysis and it was clean. He said it'd get better.Next day it was worse, so he prescribed me 5 days of Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprin. He said it was probably a yeast infection.After 3 days, it seemed better. Then I masterbated and the next day it was back.Now the constant need to urinate is more obvious than the stinging sensation. As soon as I go, I need to go again, but there isnt any urine left. He switched me to 100mg twice a day of doxycycline, but it has only slightly improved for a day or 2, then got much worse.I also have testicular pain, pain in the lower abdomen, and lower back pain, so I believe it's acute prostatitis.I also have had dribbling for a couple years now, but it was never severe enough to need to deal with.I am in great shape, workout daily, eat a decent diet, cut caffeine out since I've had these issues, drink a ton of water.Does it sound like this is acute prostatitis? If so, what is the best treatment for this. I believe my doctor just doesnt know enough about it, and I am uninsured currently, so seeing a urologist really isnt an option",
