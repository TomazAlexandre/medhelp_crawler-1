            "answer": "A rash is not a typical symptom of diabetes. So a rash alone, or a virus, would not typically be connected to diabetes. However, in people with the genetic predisposition to developing diabetes, certain viruses sometimes \"trigger\" the autoimmune system to over-react and not only battle the virus, but then to proceed to destroy the pancreas' insulin-producing cells as well. This is what is thought to be the cause of type 1 diabetes.That being said, you should look for the typical symptoms: abnormal thirst, going to the bathroom a lot because of drinking abnormal amounts of liquids to quench that thirst, hunger that is uncommon, weight loss despite eating a lot, fatigue, and irritability. If these are present, then ask his doctor to check his blood sugar levels, for a simple blood test is the real answer.",
