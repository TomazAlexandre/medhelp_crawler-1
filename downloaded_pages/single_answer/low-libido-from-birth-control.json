            "answer": "Hello,Loss of libido is very commonly found in women and mostly the cause is psychological in nature. It can be due to stress and anxiety or relationship problems with your partner.However if there is no stress and anxiety then the physical causes need to be ruled out. These include anemia, diabetes and hormonal imbalance. Some investigations which need to be done( some may have been done in the hormonal studies) are follicle stimulating hormone levels, estradiol, thyroxine and thyrotrophin levels in the blood test reports.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing",

    "question": "Ok, so I havent been able to have an orgasm for like a month or\u00a0\u00a0two and I just realized that I was switched from the birth control pill sprintec to mononessa(the generic form of it).. and I was wondering if that change could have something to do with my inability to orgasm? Usually I am able to do it without a problem, but lately it has been very difficult to acheive with my boyfriend, and even on my own it's not as satisfying as it used to be. Should I talk to my doctor about changing my birth control back , and if I did ask my doctor what could I say to her without me feeling awkward about the orgasm part of it? It lowers my sex drive, which is depressing also. I wasn't even told that they were going to change my birth control. But before I knew it, I ended up getting a new birtch control pill in the mail and my dr said it was ok to take it so I did. The periods are shorter and not as long which is good but not having that sex drive is killing my mood.",
