    "question": "Back on November 13, 2016 I had protected sex with a female. Since then I have been unusually sick at one point, been diagnosed with a varicocele, had pains when sitting, frequent uruination, constipation/diarrhea,\u00a0\u00a0loss of appetite, loss of weight and muscle, and acne. I got tested for everything, including herpes twice (February 22 & March 13, both cake back negative). I have troubles staying asleep at night almost everyday, nerve pain and numbers randomly, and I usually have no energy throughout the day, especially after eating. From what I looked up it can either be from undiagnosed diabetes (since I never been tested for it before) or something to do with hpv or hsv. I will post pictures of my concern",
