    "question": "I do not have a thyroid. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced diabetes insipidus? The reason for the test is because I have been extremely thirsty and urinating almost every 1.5 hours a day. I received a copy of the test results. They tested my ADH level (arginine vasopressin) The results are L<1.0 Range:1.0-13.3They say there are different types of diabetes insipidus, basically that the kidneys are doing what they are supposed to do or a pituitary issue.Has anyone experienced this or have any advice? Also, my thyroid levels are actually very good and I feel they are where they need to be. (Taking 1 grain Naturethroid and 50 mcg levothyroxine everyday)I haven't heard back from the doctor since they were just finalized yesterday.From looking this up, I may need further testing to rule out exactly what is going on?-Osmolality, elecrolytes, water deprivation test, MRI to show pituitary?Any advice?Thanks!",
