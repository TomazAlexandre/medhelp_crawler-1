            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.With Pleurisy there is usually pain, so the shortness of breath may not be related to this. More so, as the lung function tests are normal. The breathlessness could be also be due to cardiac disorders. In cardiac disorders the heart is unable to pump the blood adequately, more so when subjected to stress like exercise. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. So please consult your primary care physician who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test to rule out a cardiac cause for the symptoms. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
