            "answer": "You should do the Mediterranean Diet!Exercise is also vital to preventing and reversing diabetes.You should get 150 to 175 minutes of moderately intensive exercise each week divided into about 30 minutes five days a week.The best program to combat insulin resistance is about 50 percent aerobic, which is walking and running, and 50 percent strength, which uses weights.A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Associationfound that mixing aerobic and resistance (strength) exercises works betterthan doing either alone. Anaerobic strength exercises build muscles that make patients more sensitive to insulin, and aerobic exercise is needed forcardio fitness as well as for increasing insulin sensitivity.Strength training has another benefit. Anaerobic exercise burns 19 times the the glucose of aerobic.A good multiple vitamin, fish oil, and antioxidants work to reduce insulin resistance. All diabetics should take alpha lipoic acid. It\u2019s protective of the nerves, kidneys, and eyes and also helps insulin resistance.Before taking supplements, talk to your doctor about how they may interactwith any medication you\u2019re taking and the dosage of supplements you should take.",
