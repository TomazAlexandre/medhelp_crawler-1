            "answer": "Hello,Normal semen volume is 1 to 5.6 milliliters (mL) per ejaculation. There are many causes of low semen volume. The chief one is a blockage or retrograde ejaculation. You are right in thinking that it can be due to blockage in a seminal vesicle or ejaculatory duct. Other causes are low testosterone levels which decrease the production of semen, prostrate diseases, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, tumors etc.I suggest you to get a semen examination and an ultrasound prostate done to confirm the diagnosis.I hope it helps. Take care.",

    "question": "44 yo mail. Recently have noticed that I do not experience a forceful ejaculation and have a decrease in seem volume. No problem with erections but ejaculations just drip out. I do have a history of 2 biopsies due to high PSA but with no evidence of prostate inflammation. Latest PSA was normal. Is it possibly due to a blocked seminal vessel?This discussion is related to/posts/show/916850.",
