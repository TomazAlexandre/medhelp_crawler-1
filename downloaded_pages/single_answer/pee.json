            "answer": "Hi,At such a young age, it\u2019s a bit unusual for you to have been diagnosed as BPH because this is an ailment which occurs with ageing and doesn\u2019t normally occur at the age of 28 years. Majority of the patients present at the age of around 50 years. Hence, I\u2019ll suggest you to consult another urologist and revisit the diagnosis. Other causes of frequent urination like diabetes mellitus also need to be ruled out. In fact, stones in the urinary tract are much more common in causing the increased frequency of urination compared to BPH. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
