            "answer": "Hi!The various causes of leg pain are atherosclerosis, deep vein thrombosis - leg pain on walking (A blood clot in a deep vein), Leriche syndrome (block in abdominal aorta and/or main leg artery), limb ischaemia (low oxygen to limbs), sciatica, spondylitis of lower vertebrae and peripheral vascular disease (arteries of limbs are involved). A color Doppler test will rule out the possibility of involvement of an artery or vein and its blockage by a clot. Paresthesias or abnormal sensations due to peripheral neuropathies secondary to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme's or lupus should also be ruled out. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi, I am 33yrs old and for the past 3 years I have had on - off (becoming constant) - pain in my legs. Worse on one side. Main pain is a constant, throbbing, ache - almost like i have run a marathon when i havent! Also the muscles twitch in random places and when bad they cramp and feel like they are tearing. These symptoms seem worse when i am fatigued - which i always seem to be :(I have just researched into peripheral nerve hyperexcitablity.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be an option? I have tried endep, valdoxin,(but after a while they actually cause horrible restless legs which i dont get when off the meds), natural therapies, sleeping tables. A day out with the children and I can barely walk and am in pain for days. Please help.",
