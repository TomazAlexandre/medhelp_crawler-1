            "answer": "Hi, MPO in the blood is a specific marker of vascular inflammation and vulnerable plaque/erosions/fissures. Its a predictor of heart disease. It may also be raised in peripheral vascular diseases. If you do not have any cardiac symptoms now, you can wait and watch and monitor your levels.
