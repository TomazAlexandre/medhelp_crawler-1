    "question": "Hi, My friend is 42 years old, overall he is a healthy individual..no blood pressure problems, or diabetes , no problems at all, doesn't take any medications, either. However, about a day ago he said he experienced a sharp excruciating pain in his left eye, mostly like someone was stabbing him with a needle. The pain only lasted for a few seconds but it was very very painful, after the pain was gone there was a red line in the eyeball, the line was very close to the lachrymal duct. He went to sleep right after this happened. The next day when he woke up he still had the red line in the eyeball and also a very bad headache. He took two ibuprofen pills and the headache went away and the red line went away, too. He never experienced anything like that before. We would like to know if this is something to be concerned about or it might just been something random with no real concerns. thanks very much",
