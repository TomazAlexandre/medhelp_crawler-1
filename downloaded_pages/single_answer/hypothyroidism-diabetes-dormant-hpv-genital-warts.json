    "question": "Can Hypothyroidism and/or Type I Diabetes bring out a Dormant HPV? I had a total hysterectomy 14 years ago when I was 30 years old. Almost 2 years ago I was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes & since that time have been developing these warts around my private areas. Now I've been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and just beginning treatment. This Thyroid gland - Sheesh! Who knew...I've never been told by a Dr how important the Thyroid gland really is...Until now I had thought of it like the Appendix...there but not necessary for a healthy life...back in 2004 my then Dr said my thyroid levels were a little low and he put me on a medicine and after having botched the more serious reason for seeing him I stopped all treatments from him & forgot all about it. I'd never even mentioned it to any Dr I've seen since. I've battled my diabetes with lows & high blood glucose levels & over the past 10-ish months mostly highs & with that has come a yeast infection that won't go away no matter what I do and with sustained highs these wart things flare up & spread.So again, could my condition be brought on by my Hypothyroidism and/or Type I Diabetes? How can I get rid of these wart things?",
