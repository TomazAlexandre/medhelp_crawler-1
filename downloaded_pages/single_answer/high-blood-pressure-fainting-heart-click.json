            "answer": "Hello and welcome!There are several conditions which can mimic seizures like syncope, migraines, and panic attacks etc.Tests like EEG may be needed to confirm a diagnosis of epilepsy. In addition, some epilepsy medications have potential cardiac complications, further adding complexity to the management of patients with epilepsy. Cardiovascular disease and treatments can precipitate new seizures or even affect the management of pre-existing epilepsy. Conditions like vasovagal syncope, prolonged QT interval can mimic seizures so extensive evaluation of both systems is essential for an accurate diagnosis of seizures. Conditions like diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders can all lead to heart problems. With high blood pressure and a heart murmur you need an urgent echocardiogram and medications to control your blood pressure. Get a complete clinical evaluation done. That may be really helpful. Best luck!",

    "question": "Hi....I was diagnosed with epilepsy about 3 years ago buthave never been confident that it was really what I had. I dont think my episodes are seizure like, I basically jsut \"faint\" and if i sit down I can come out of it....Anyway...the past week I have had very high blood pressure, like 140/100 ish. and my heart rates been fast too..between 90 and 120. I do have a heart click (or murmur) that I found out about like 4 years ago before i knew of the epilspey I went to a cardiologist and wore a heart monitor which showed it....I am not wondering if this is all related??? I went to my regular doc today and she said I need to see cardiologist asap ..like within a week. Im worried. Shedid a bunch of blood tests...Anyone have any ideas? Im stressing out big time which is probably just making my blood presasure worse. By the way, Im only 21 years old very healthy work out and dont drink caffeiene. Any help would be appreciated.",
