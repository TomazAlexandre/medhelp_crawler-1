            "answer": "Hi!It is possible that you have a cut or a break in mucosa which burns when urine passes over it. Penile ulcers/cuts may be due to infective or non-infective causes of which infective causes like STD and bacterial and fungal infection are probably ruled out in your case. Penile cuts can also be due to dermatitis, eczema or due to allergy to lotions, creams or latex of condoms. These need to be ruled out.At times a hair too grows inwards and keeps tickling the urethra causing a need to urinate. A frenulum tag too can cause this type of sensation. Diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus too should be ruled out.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral to an urologist. Take care!",
