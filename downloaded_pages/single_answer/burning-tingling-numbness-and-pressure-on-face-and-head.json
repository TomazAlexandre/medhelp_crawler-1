They can also cause ear numbness that spreads to face.In females it can be due to hormonal imbalance and a complete panel including FSH, LH, estrogen, progesterone and thyroid profile should be done. It can also be due to anxiety and stress. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
