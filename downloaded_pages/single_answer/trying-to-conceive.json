            "answer": "Hello,Is your wife on medications for PCOS? Spotting before expected date of periods could be due to implantation bleeding secondary to pregnancy. Other causes of spotting before periods are hormonal imbalances, infections of the female reproductive tract, polyps, fibroids etc.Diarrhea and constipation could be due to any gastrointestinal infection, food allergy, food intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome etc.Fatty liver grade 1 can be seen in obesity, high lipid profile, diabetes mellitus .If she is obese she should control her weight. All you can do is wait for her periods. If she misses her periods take up pregnancy test. Visit a gynecologist for more queries and assistance. Do keep me posted.Take care and regards!",
