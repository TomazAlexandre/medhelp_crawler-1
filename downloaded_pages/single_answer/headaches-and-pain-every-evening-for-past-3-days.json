    "question": "Hi. I'm not sure if my 48-year-old mom's fever-like symptoms of headaches and pain right now has anything to do with diabetes, but in case it does: About 5 months ago, the doctor said that my mom was at risk of being diabetic and diagnosed her with pre-diabetes and prescribed her to take a 500 mg tablet of Metformin every day.\u00a0\u00a0After another checkup one month ago, the doctor said her glucose levels were normal again, and she was to stop taking Metformin.Starting one week ago, fearing that her glucose levels might rise too high with all the holiday food, my mom unwisely decided to take a 500 mg tablet of Metformin every day again.\u00a0\u00a03-4 days later, after a heavy lunch (not sugary foods), my mom's body starting shaking and teeth chattering, which calmed down after ~15 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0 For the past 3 days since that shaking incident, she stopped taking Metformin but she'd get a gradual headache that's light in the morning but gets heavier throughout the day, till evening when she starts feeling cold, she loses her apetite, and it feels like her body's hurting from the inside -- massaging helps that pain.\u00a0\u00a0Her forehead temperature's fairly normal in the evening, maybe slightly warm.\u00a0\u00a0She got her flu shot about 2-3 months ago, so is this just from a fever, or is it something to do with diabetes or those 3-4 days that she unwisely took Metformin last week?Her next appointment with the doctor is in 2 weeks and we can't get an appointment before that -- what should she do?",
