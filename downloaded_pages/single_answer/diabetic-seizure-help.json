That might give you some measure of comfort.Also, if you're not a member of the Children with Diabetes forum, please visit and see if you'd like to join. It's active and there are always parents around at all hours of the night. And the support is incredible.

    "question": "Hi, my daughter is 17 and has had diabetes for 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0She's had seizures before but she had a really bad one last Friday at 2AM and I'm having some major issues moving past this since it was so different. Her sister went into her room because her alarm was going off and she woke up from her alarm clock (she regularly tests at 2 AM); walked into the bathroom and looked into the mirror and pointed at it and started screaming. She then began running around screaming and ran into the wall and fell.\u00a0\u00a0Her sister wasn't exactly sure what was going on but started screaming for us (our bdrm is downstairs) and the dog was barking and we ran up there.\u00a0\u00a0The look of terror in her face was horrible and she kept screaming as I got the glucagon ready and started into a seizure after her face morphed all strangely.\u00a0\u00a0She seized and foamed at the mouth and bit her tongue so she was choking and I told her Dad to put her on her side.\u00a0\u00a0I finally got the glucagon into her when she stopped seizing and just fell on her back with her eyes open and stopped breathing.\u00a0\u00a0We thought she was dead..... I'm not sure how long it was before she stared breathing again but from what I can recall, it wasn't too long. My husband, our youngest and myself are having major issues moving on with everything.\u00a0\u00a0My diabetic daughter doesn't understand because she doesn't remember anything (which I'm so grateful for). I guess my major questions are, what if we didn't hear her?\u00a0\u00a0What would have happened? Would we have lost her? How do we go on from here? I'm in the midst of looking for a good therapist but we already got a dud so I'm a little hesitant in that area.\u00a0\u00a0Any help would be awesome.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, she has always been very sensitive to extreme activity.\u00a0\u00a0She had 2 tennis matches the day before and went to bed in the 180's, was on a lower rate of insulin, and had a snack before bed.Thanks",
