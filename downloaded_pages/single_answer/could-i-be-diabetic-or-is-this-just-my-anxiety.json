            "answer": "The majority of your symptoms do not point to diabetes, but there are frequently no obvious symptoms or symptoms that we tend to ignore. A couple of the really common signs are frequent urination and abnormal thirst.My best advice is to see your doctor and have them test you for diabetes. Be sure they do the test that indicates what your blood sugar levels have been doing for the past few weeks. ONE test can not adequately determine if your blood sugar level is consistantly at the level of the result. Even though the test you have will be a 12 hour fasting glucose, that does not guarantee that you have excreted all the sugar you've consumed in the past few days. So that one test may read higher, which would indicate either diabetes or PRE-dieabetes and that would be incorrect.While you're at your doctors, please talk to him/her about all these other symptoms you've been having during the past year. Many of them could easily be put down to anxiety, but it's never good to just assume anxiety is the culprit. And don't let your doctor just blow it off as anxiety. Ask for tests to be run. It's your right to request them. If it puts your doctors nose out of joint, too bad. Ignore them or find a doctor who will be more thorough and not pin everything on anxiety.Chest pains should never be ignored, especially if there is numbness along with the pains.I don't want to scare you, but I hope you make an appointment to see your doctor soon and get answers to all your concerns.I wish you the best and hope you'll let us know what the tests tell you.PeaceGreenlydia",

    "question": "Ive been suffering a lot of symptoms over the past year such as:Headachesdizzinesstwitching randomlySense of impending doomHyperactivity feelingPressure on one side of my headNumbness down my left arm, left side of head and left lower legTinglingBlack spot in left eye that comes and goesI also suffer from ADHD, ODD, OCD and Asperger's, as well as some depression and of course my Anxiety.I've recently been feeling very drained, groggy and feel a slight pressure in my head but when ever I drink some coke or energy drink, it goes away for a while and feels near enough ok again. It only works when I drink things, not so much when I eat them, and eventually the symptoms do come back again. More recent symptoms include chest pains along with the numbness and pressure feelings. Could this be a sign of Diabetes? My grandmother and Aunt both suffered from diabetes also and so is it possible it could have been passed down to me? Or could this just be my anxiety?",
