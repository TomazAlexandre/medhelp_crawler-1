            "answer": "HiDry skin is termed xerotic skin. Xeroses may be due to several factors: Irritant dermatitis, hormonal problems, kidney problems and autoimmune diseases may present as xeroses. In your case, you have noted brownish discoloration of these skin patches. This may be postinflammatory hyperpigmentation if you have previously scratched on these areas. A dermatitic skin condition is a likely a differential for now. If there other associated signs and symptoms like weight problems, diabetes and urinary problems, then the skin condition may herald an underlying systemic disease.I do not want you to worry too much about this. What I have mentioned above are possible differentials only. They need to be excluded through further tests.",
