            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Passing out or losing consciousness are often associated with alcoholic drinks and not necessarily from a soda. This may be due to a variety of factors such as the situation or the medical history of the patients like presence of diabetes. Vasovagal syncope, one of the most common types, may occur in situations such as\u00a0\u00a0blood drawing, coughing, urination or defecation.\u00a0\u00a0This can also happen when there is a\u00a0\u00a0change in body posture, from heart-related conditions or from neurological conditions, low blood-sugar levels and lung disease such as emphysema and a pulmonary embolus. If it recurs, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Direct clinical examination and diagnostic tests may be indicated.\u00a0\u00a0Take care and do keep us posted.",
