            "answer": "Hi,It will help us to know which antidepressant your uncle is taking. Xanax will not cause these symptoms.There is a possibility of peripheral neuropathy casing these cold sensations, causes of which include thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, vitamin B 12 deficiency and alcohol induced peripheral neuropathy.This requires further evaluation. Please ask him to get an appointment with his GP and get a clinical exam done.Thanks",
