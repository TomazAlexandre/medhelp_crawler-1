    "question": "I am a relatively healthy 28 year old female living in the Northeast United States.\u00a0\u00a0About two months ago I fainted 4 times within 15 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0The first time I didn't lose consciousness completely.\u00a0\u00a0The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th times I completely blacked out and didn't know what was going on the 4th time was in the vestibule of the emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't breath and my lips turned blue.\u00a0\u00a0I was blood and urine tested for pregnancy, infection, dehydration, thyroid, and glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0I was given a EKG and an Echo-cardiogram, as well as a chest x-ray.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that I didn't have a heart, or lung condition and that I wasn't dehydrated, didn't have an over or under active thyroid, and didn't have any type of infection, diabetes or dehydration.\u00a0\u00a0I had heart palpitations, headache, rapid pulse, and nausea.\u00a0\u00a0At the time the only medications I had were Flonase and Benadryl for allergies.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently still taking the Flonase, as well as 50mg of Zoloft daily.\u00a0\u00a0The fainting hasn't happened again but I have felt like I was going to faint.\u00a0\u00a0I felt faint last night.\u00a0\u00a0Also I have had 4 ear infections in as many months. The nausea comes and goes but I feel that I may be getting the 5th ear infection right now.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like someone jamming sharpened pencils in my ears, mainly the left but sometimes both.\u00a0\u00a0I feel an intense pressure in my head sometimes, and often feel dizzy. I also feel a leaking feeling in my head not on it like my brain is dripping.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes there is liquid in my ear.\u00a0\u00a0I had 2 ear infections both inner and outer in one ear and an outer in the other. I have an appointment with an ENT but they are booked until mid October.\u00a0\u00a0Should I wait and just continue using the benzocaine drops to get me through the pain or insist to see someone else?\u00a0\u00a0I'm already a hypochondriac, and this testing with no answers is making me worry more.",
