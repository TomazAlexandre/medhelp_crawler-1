            "answer": "Hi there!Microalbuminuria, decreased eGFR and elevated creatinine levels indicate renal compromise which may or may not be related to diabetes. With history of just 2 years of the condition, the later is a more likely possibility. I would suggest discussing the situation and the management plan in detail with your treating doctor.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes with blood glucose of 506 with eGFR of 70. When I went back 2 days later to do additional blood work (I had been on Metformin for 2 days), my blood glucose came back at 246, microalbumin at 357, creatine of 156 and eGFR at 89. What does this mean? Do I have kidney disease for sure since my microalbumin was so high? Or do they have to redo labs or do other labs to confirm? At most I have only had diabetes for 2 years; my routine blood work showed blood glucose of 124 in 2010 although I was never told till now. Please help. Thank you.",
