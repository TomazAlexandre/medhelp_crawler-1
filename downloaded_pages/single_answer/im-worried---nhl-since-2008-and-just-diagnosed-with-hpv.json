            "answer": "Hello Kathleen,Welcome to our forum.\u00a0\u00a0Can you tell me what kind of NHL you had and what ongoing treatments you are on since your chemo 2 years ago?\u00a0\u00a0I'm assuming you have an indolent type and are expecting reoccurrence?I don't know a lot about HPV, but I did a little online research and it sounds like it's an infection that can lay dormant for years.\u00a0\u00a0I read something interesting...about 80% of sexually active people will get HPV at some point in their lifetime.\u00a0\u00a0It also sounds like its an infection that comes and goes (sometimes without symptoms, and sometimes with the presence of genital warts).\u00a0\u00a0Possibly your partner had the infection when you were together but has since cleared up with him?\u00a0\u00a0There are treatments available for HPV, but not everyone needs it as it will usually clear up on its own.I'm not really sure if there is anything you have to look out for, although if you are going through NHL treatment, your immunity may not be able to kick the infection on its own.\u00a0\u00a0In this case you better talk to your cancer doctor about how to treat it.",

    "question": "Doctors:I really don't want to make this post long but I do have a history of Cancer. I was diagnosed in 2004 with a different type and treated.\u00a0\u00a0Surgery and Chemo and Radiation.I was in remission about 4 years and then the Pet scan came back positive for NHL.\u00a0\u00a0I've been receiving ongoing treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Last Chemo was about 2 years ago.I see all doctors on a regular bases and have bee doing very well.\u00a0\u00a0Now I have a problem and not sure what to do.I've been alone since 2000 and all pap's have always been normal. I just had a pap done and showed HPV.I met someone last year and he's very aware of my medical history.\u00a0\u00a0He does have Diabetes but has regular blood work-ups every 3 months.I told him about the abnormal pap and he did call his doctor and had blood work done... everything was fine.Now my question?\u00a0\u00a0 I haven't been with anyone except him for 13 years,, how did this happen?What dangers should I look out for due to the fact I have NHL and now HPV?",
