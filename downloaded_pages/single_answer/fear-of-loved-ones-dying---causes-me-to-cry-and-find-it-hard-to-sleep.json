However I only seem to think about it at night in the when im about to go to spleep and then I start to cry for at least 15 minutes sometimes up to 30 or 40 minutes. But I live quite a good life so I don't understand why this happens to me. My family doesn't know Yet but I plan on telling them soon although my dad did find out when I was about 7 but it was gone and now it's suddenly came back. I was wondering if this was a sign of depression or if it's just a normal thing. any suggestions",
