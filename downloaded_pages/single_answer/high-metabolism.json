            "answer": "Hi!To know if you need to increase calories first calculate your basal metabolic rate depending on your lifestyle. There are many BMR calculators available on line. While they are not 100% accurate, they give you a rough idea regarding the number of calories required to maintain your basal metabolic functions. To increase your weight, you will need to eat a slightly higher calorie than your BMR requirement.However, before you do that rule out whether your inability to gain weight is due to chronic inflammation (arthritis, IBS etc), diabetes, hyperthyroidism or worms in gut.Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
