            "answer": "Hi there!Well, delayed healing could occur due to several reasons such as mal-alignment, infection, metabolic issues that affect healing such as diabetes, mobility/ inadequate rest and support, inadequate nutrition etc. To promote healing it is advised to rest the two arms and avoid excessive mobility and look for other secondary factors. Bone stimulators may also be an option worth considering to promote healing. If things do not go as planned, surgical options such as grafts can be considered later. I would suggest discussing the situation and the suggested management plan in detail with the treating orthopedician.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, IM 25 usually fit and healthy but was involved in a RTA 6 weeks ago (I was riding a motorbike 50 MPH hit by a car head on 35-40 MPH) thank god I escaped with only two broken arms and wrists, never even lost consciousness. I sustained 27 fractures between Right(6) and left(21) radius and ulna both intra articular with my left radius coming through the skin on the ulna side of my arm. I was in surgery within 2hrs and op was 13.5 hrs long, I had two plates and numerous screws on my left and one plate and 8 screws on the right fitted. The day after surgery I developed compartment syndrome in my left arm which was controlled by reopening one of my wounds and reclosing several days later. At my first few out patient appointments I was told everything was doing really well and the use of my right arm started coming back straight away, at 3 weeks physio started on my left. Now at just over six weeks I have near full use of my right and fingers only on my left with loss of sensation to thumb, pinky, ring finger and most of my palm and still in a lot of pain. My Dr's have now just told me that none of the fractures have even started healing and two have come out of fixation. Other than that they are being very vague oh and that at best my wrist will be fused straight. Im really worried about loosing it and my drs just keep dodging that question. Is it a possibility, is there anything I can do to help it IM taking supplements on top of healthy diet but don't sleep much and I have been told about ultrasound bone healers would a device like that help with that many complicated fractures. Sorry not got xrays. Thanks in advance for any replies.",
