Even for those with a family history, a case at 30 years old would be remarkable.The frequency in voiding urine in the night may also be a sign of diabetes (which you may consider getting a blood test for), the lower back and lower abdomen pain may be related with your exercises, your posture especially on the bike may ne contributory.
