She said the most noticeable symptom was incredible thirst, then it wasn't satisfied even when she drank a lot of water.Reason is the body senses too much sugar and is trying to dilute the sugar with water.Also, fatigue and general tiredness at the same time.Light headed and tingly isn't what she said.Does it happen just before meals? Or right after? Or is it all the time, not affected by meals?",
