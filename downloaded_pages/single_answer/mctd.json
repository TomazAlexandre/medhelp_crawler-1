            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear you have been through so much. More than MCTD, it is likely you have multiple endocrine involvement with possibly diabetes and Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. You need to get these tested for. Also, symptoms could be the side effect of chem.-radiation you underwent. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "Five years ago I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. I had a total thyroidectomy as well as RAI treatment. Since then I have been on so many doses of synthroid trying to get it right. I didn't have any thyroid problems prior to this. Since my cancer treatment I had stiff joints so dr ordered bloodwork. I am ANA positive and now I have a positive RNP also. Stiff\u00a0\u00a0joints were due to synthroid dose changes.\u00a0\u00a0I have had so many problems since- vertigo, salivary gland problem, achy joints, muscles, and diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse. Everything I have experienced I was attributing to my treatment and thyroid med changes but could it be mctd? Dr put that on my lab sheet but said numbers haven't increased so we would check every year. Just wondering if these things are symptoms.",
