    "question": "I've been experiencing poor wound healing lately, regarding things like small cuts, zits and such. The wound itself seems to always close, but seemingly always leaves a mark on my skin. Also, it heals slower than it used to. For example, I've given blood for regular blood work 5 days ago, and while the puncture wound has closed quickly, I can still easily see the mark on my skin.My sugar is ok, checked it few times. Been to the doctor, and unfortunately health service is poor in my city of residence. Doctor sort of nonchalantly told me not to worry and it's normal, unless the bleeding doesn't stop when a cut occurs (no such problems, thanksfully). I dont know if she was right or just blowing me off. I've been wondering could my dieting perhaps is the reason? I've been trying to lose weight and I've been heavily on meat + eggs, with almost no carbs, almost nothing else. I think I have also eaten too little calories during the day (less than 1000 surely). Could this be the reason? Any ideas? I am generally in decent health, other than this. Age 35, male.Thank you in advancePavel",
