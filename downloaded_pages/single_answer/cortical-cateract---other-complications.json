            "answer": "Cataracts are more common in diabetics that are not well controlled BUT they are more common in well controled diabetics than in the general population.\u00a0\u00a0Cataracts are more common in type 1 than type 2 diabetes.One variable you have no control over is how long you've had diabetes. After 20 years virtually all type 1 and 2 diabetics have some diabetic complications.Life would be great (or at least not so suspenseful) if we knew 'what was around the corner'. Keep your A1C at 6 or less to minimize complications. 7 or more isn't good enough.JCH III MD",

    "question": "I am 26 years old and am currently in between cateract surgeries.\u00a0\u00a0My opthamologist says that I am not developing any other eye disease (retinopathy etc.).\u00a0\u00a0I was always under the impression that cateracts developed from out of control sugar levels, however, my A1C has always stayed between 6.5-7.5 for the last 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0However, there was a period of 2 years or so before being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes that my A1C stayed around 10.\u00a0\u00a0So my question is, am I really not doing as well keeping my sugars under control as I had thought?\u00a0\u00a0or is this something that developed from previously not keeping my sugars under control.\u00a0\u00a0Also, at this rate, are more complications most likely around the corner?",
