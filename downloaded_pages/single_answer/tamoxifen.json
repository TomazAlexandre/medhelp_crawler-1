            "answer": "Hi there.First of all it should be discussed with your doctor whether the tamoxifen is really causing the weakness or not.\u00a0\u00a0Her diabetes maybe the more influential reason for the weakness especially if the sugar control is not optimal.\u00a0\u00a0You may also want to discuss with her doctor regarding switching to an aromatase inhibitor (femara, arimidex, exemestane) which carries a more favorable side effect profile, with lesser risk of cardiovascular complications (thromboembolism, stroke, etc).\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you discuss all of these options with her doctors.\u00a0\u00a0Regards and God bless.",
