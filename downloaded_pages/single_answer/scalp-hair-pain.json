            "answer": "Hi there. Your grandchild could be having migraines, which are known to occur in the young also. It is possible that he is not able to address these due to anxiety and lack of knowledge. You need to look for and answer certain questions like does she have headaches, how long do the headaches last, how often does she get them, any triggers, the location of pain and the sensation, any associated symptoms like nausea, sensitivity to light etc. your family history of headaches need to be checked. Get his blood sugar profile done to check if he has diabetes. His fasting and post prandial blood glucose levels need\u00a0\u00a0to be assessed. He could be having raised intracranial pressure due to an intracranial neoplasm or cyst. An MRI brain may be required. Show him to a pediatric neurologist for assessment. Hope this helps. Take care.",
