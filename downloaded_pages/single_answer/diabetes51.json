People react in different fashions to 'low blood sugar', and children not infrequently become easily frustrated, hypersensitive and irritable when their bodies require some nourishment.

After he eats the \"monster\" side of him seems to subside within 15-20 minutes of eating.Is this a sign of diabetes?",
