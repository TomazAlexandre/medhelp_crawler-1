    "question": "So, I am 3 months late with all negative hpt tests. My stomach has been bloated all the the time within the past few weeks and cramping in my lower pelvic area and minor back aching have started within the past few weeks, as well. It comes and goes, though. I have also been spotting randomly and have had this strange clear rubbery discharge (tmi, i know). My boobs are sore, mood swings, increase in hunger, and I am just so confused. Confused because I went to the doctor for bowel issues recently and went back again for this to find out I have too much sugar in my urine... the doctor is thinking cysts on my ovaries, kidney disease/infection, or pregnancy/tubal. My blood sugar was fine, so she ruled out diabetes, but is still testing for it. So, I am waiting for my results to come back, but just wondering if anyone else has this problem or any input. She also mentioned something of gestational diabetes if I am pregnant, because some people test negative for months before actually getting a positive reading for pregnancy.",
