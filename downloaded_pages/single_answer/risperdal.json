            "answer": "I too am VERY hesitant to put a child on a drug such as this. Risperdal is an anti-psychotic primary used for the treatment of Schizophrenia, a bit extreme for a child. It is only FDA approved to treat SHORT TERM bipolar, but it is approved for pediatric use, bit it carries a \"black box\" warning.. This one also has hi incidence of screwing with his hormones and cause developmental delays, constitutional delay, and trigger diabetes. I would get multiple opinions from psychologists and psychiatrists before putting my child on such a drug, and only do it as an absolutely last resort.You must use EXTREAM caution with this drug and monitor your child closely, it can cause motor skill impairment, and movement disorders or muscle disturbances, such as restlessness, tremors and muscle stiffness.Also noted common side effects are sleepiness, increased appetite, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, increased saliva, constipation, dry mouth, tremor, muscle stiffness, dizziness, repetitive behavior, involuntary movement, rapid heartbeat, confusion and weight increase. You will have to monitor diet and weight closely as the weight side effect is 28-30% of patients.Note, none of the pediatric trials lasted longer than 8 weeks.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risperidonehttp://www.drugs.com/risperdal.htmlhttp://www.risperdalsideeffects.com/pages/children.htmlhttp://www.adrugrecall.com/risperdal/effects.htmlhttp://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/64985.php",

    "question": "Hi, I have posted a couple of times about my 5 year old son. Today we had our first appt with a psychiatrist. We are still currently seeing a counselor weekly.\u00a0\u00a0The psych is from the same agency as the counselor.\u00a0\u00a0Upon reading what the counselors reports and meeting my son he recomended i give my son risperdal for being bi-polar. Now mind you bipolar runs in my family and i felt that there was something going on with my son but this was not what i wanted to hear.\u00a0\u00a0I want to help him, i want him to do well in school and not be so angry all the time but i want to make sure i am doing the right thing.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had any experience with this medication?\u00a0\u00a0I read about possible side effects and some opinions on it some ppl love it some hate it i know it will all depend on how my son reacts to it but then i hear about how doctors are handing out meds to kids like candy and i don't want to be a part of that.\u00a0\u00a0The doc said if he does well with this med but is still having trouble with concentration, impulsivity, and restlessness that he might also have adhd and he would have to take a different med for that.\u00a0\u00a0My son is also taking miralax for encopresis to make him not constipated.\u00a0\u00a0Before all of this my son never took medication he is very healthy and rarely gets sick.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if this is good for his little body.\u00a0\u00a0I just want him to be happy.",
