            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms are suggestive of erectile dysfunction. Common causes causing erection problem are stress and anxiety,poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, which make sex a task rather than a pleasure,negative feelings about non performance,smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression etc.In your case, it looks more like psychological. Talk to your partner openly about any fears or apprehensions, eat nutritious healthy food, exercise regularly and cut down on smoking or alcohol if you are taking it.If still a problem then please get yourself evaluated for the medical conditions mentioned above.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "hey guys so couple months back while i was dating my gf i wanted to have sex with her and she wasnt sure because she was afraid she would get pregnant, She would give me **'s and i would be completely hard but when\u00a0\u00a0we were gonna have sex for the first time i couldnt keep it hard. Idk if i was to nervous or stressed out but long story short, anyway i went home and i continued to masturbate but it wasnt exciting for me watching it on a screen so i would only get semi hard or not hard at all because i would think to myself this is stupid. But im starting to brain wash myself to think that im starting to have an erectile disfunction. i only had sex once it was completely hard then. What should i do because im to afraid to date any other girls or so on because im worried that i couldnt get it up. im only 21",
