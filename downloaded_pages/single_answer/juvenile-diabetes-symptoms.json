            "answer": "I'm not a parent, but I do know that when I was diagnosed I had major headaches and stomach aches. But I doubt its type one diabetes because peeing a lot is how the body is trying to get rid of the excess sugar... and also you're really overly fatigued because all your sugar is staying in your blood and not going into your cells..but it can't hurt getting tested. It could be a different form of diabetes, there's more than just type one and two.Hope that helps :]",
