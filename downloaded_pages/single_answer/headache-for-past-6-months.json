    "question": "Back in October of 08, I started to have severe headaches after having none for months, and sinus pressure/build up. Was in and out of the doctor's office for repeated Sinus infections for the next 4 months. I have been on several antibiotics, Nasal steroids, and other assorted meds. I also do sinus rinses.I finally was referred to a ENT in Feb for an assesment to see if perhaps there was a fungus or something else at play. The sinus ct (was only sinuses) showed increase thickening and swelling, but no blockages. Been through Allergy testing and will start shots soon.While I have had all this work up, the pain and the pressure have NEVER gone away. The pain/pressure ebbs and flows, but it is always there. Sometimes it is just a feeling like a hat in place, putting slight pressure on the forehead.. and other times it ratchets up and feels like something is exploding/stabbing in my head. Right now, it reminds me of the scene in Alien, except instead of something breaking free from my chest, it feels like something is trying to break free of my forehead.I have noticed the past few weeks that I am starting to get periods of intense dizziness, and fatigue. Today for a period of a few hours it was all I could do just to stay upright and awake. Words seem harder to find.. I don't seem to be able to recall names as well I usually do.. and its hard trying to ascertain is this is due to the sheer duration of this headache or some other cause.Besides this headache/sinus/allergy thing.. I am relatively healthy, albeit a bit overweight. I currently take glucophage, but it is for insulin resistance/pcos not diabetes.",
