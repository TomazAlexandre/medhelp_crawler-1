            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes can all cause ear numbness that spreads to face and flushing. Hemi-facial numbness is also seen in Bell\u2019s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia where a spasm may cause numbness, or due to acoustic neuroma which is a benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss these possibilities with an ENT doctor.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
