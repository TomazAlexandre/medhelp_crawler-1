            "answer": "The national guidelines classify chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) into 4 categories:\u00a0\u00a0Mild, moderate, severe and very severe, the last category characterized by chronic respiratory failure with oxygen dependency.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately your dad's disease is very severe and, unless treatable heart disease is discovered and treated, or another treatable lung disease, superimposed on the COPD, is diagnosed and treated, he will most likely not get better.\u00a0\u00a0That is assuming that he is currently on optimum drug therapy for both his heart and his lung disease.Coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure and diabetes will only add to the burden of the COPD.It appears, based on the information provided, that your dad probably has \"seen his better days.\"\u00a0\u00a0But, in truth, his doctors are the ones best suited to provide you and your dad with a prognosis.Good luck.",

    "question": "My dad is 69 and has COPD. He is now on oxygen 24/7. We were told that he has congestive heart failure on the right side of his heart and a possible blockage on the left side of the heart. He is having trouble with his oxgyen level dropping. Can you tell me the stages of COPD? We want to know what to expect and if he will get better. I think he has seen his better days. My dad had triple by surgery about 9 years, he has diabetes and he has over come kidney cancer last year. He is scheduled this week for test on his left side of his heart.",
