            "answer": "Hello,Such type of pain of the penis can be due to anxiety, contact dermatitis, traumatic damage to the nerves of penis, diabetes, prostatitis, genital herpes, urethritis and STD\u2019s like Gonorrhea and Syphilis but they are less likely in your case.Prostatitis is an inflammation of the prostate gland. From your symptoms, it can be due to chronic prostatitis. It is also possible that sitting on an inadequately padded surface or for prolonged periods of time is causing transient irritation to the prostate. This could be appearing as the pain in the penis.You will need ultrasound, X-ray, and computerized tomography (CT) along with prostatic fluid examination along with prostate specific antigen.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "These problems came up up in May of 2010. A red rash came up on the tip of my penis, would become dry and flake off revealing a shiny red skin. And would repeat. For a brief few weeks it went away. And has came back constantly. Not itching, just there. Along with this, ive had pain in my testicles, which i am told the tubes are just inflammed and will go away and it comes and gos. But the last few months or so ive had not a stingy but more of a dull pain in the base of my penis. Just bothersome. And on and off days the inside of my penis will itch, just annoying. I am 150% positive it is not an STD of any kind. And as of a day or two ago ive been having a dull pain right below my waistline right beside the pelvic bone.....whats wrong with me??",
