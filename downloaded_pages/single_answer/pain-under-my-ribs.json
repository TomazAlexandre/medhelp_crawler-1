            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Chest pain aggravated by laughing yawning and deep breathing goes more in favor of costochondritis, which causes pain and tenderness at points where your ribs attach to your breastbone.\u00a0\u00a0Pleurisy or inflammation of the lung wall too can cause these symptoms but since you do not have a history of cough, cold and fever, the chances are less. If you have a suggestive history then this needs to be further investigated by a chest specialist. Pulmonary embolism is another possibility causing shortness of breath with chest pain.A CT scan of the chest can rule out both.Chances are that you have esophageal reflux (GERD), where the food in your stomach is thrown up into your food pipe or esophagus. This also causes burning sensation or discomfort in the chest area and burps. Another possibility is hiatal hernia, where a portion of stomach herniates into the chest cavity through the diaphragm.Odor in urine may not be related. Generally bad odor is due to infection, mainly by E coli. This can be diagnosed by urine culture. Strong fruity odor is due to uncontrolled diabetes. Interestingly urine odor changes in menopause too. Urinary bladder infection and kidney infections do produce strong smelling urine. Another reason is dehydration. Strong ammonia smell is due to protein breakdown. Drink plenty of fluids and see if the smell goes.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
