            "answer": "My name is Ardy and I am a volunteer with the JDRF, please understand I am not giving you any medical advice simply responding based on my personal experience with type 1, my son was diagnosed at the age of 11 and is now 38 years old.Ketones are substances that your liver can manufacture using raw ingredients such as proteins and fats. They can be used by your body cells as fuel. However, it is not the preferred fuel for your body. The preferred fuel is glucose, and ketones could be seen as a \"back-up plan.\"There are two things that can trigger the liver to produce ketones. The first trigger is a low or nearly non-existent insulin level. This can occur in people who have type 1 diabetes or very advanced type 2. The second trigger is a low glucose level. This can occur in people who have not eaten for a while (this is often the cause), or people who have been drinking alcohol.Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but most commonly is diagnosed from infancy to the late 30s. In this type of diabetes, a person's pancreas produces little or no insulin. Although the causes are not entirely known, scientists believe the body's own defense system (the immune system) attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Once over 80% of the beta cells are destroyed, the body is no longer able to regulate blood sugar levels and the patient develops some or all of the classic symptoms of diabetes:*excessive thirst* excessive urination* excessive hunger* weight loss* fatigue* blurred vision* sugar and ketones in the urineI hope this has been helpful to you",
