            "answer": "Hi,This may be related to a\u00a0\u00a0vascular, circulation problem or some growth.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes, smoking,\u00a0\u00a0high cholesterol or peripheral vascular disease are commonly associated with a circulation deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to discuss the option of an angiographic study, plethysmography (the measurement of volume change in an organ or limb) or ultrasound to evaluate for circulatory disorders.Another possibility could be a mass that may be obstructing blood flow.\u00a0\u00a0To test for this, imaging would need to be performed - either an abdominal/pelvic CT scan or ultrasound.A referral to a urologist or vascular surgeon would be reasonable for further evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0After they examine you, discuss the utility of imaging or testing for vascular disease.Regards.",
