    "question": "I have had diabetes all my life but have only taken metformin to control it. I am currently 7w6d pregnant with my first child. I have recently started taking humulin insulin and was wondering if anyone else takes insulin and if so does it hurt at the injection site a few mins afterwards and is that normal? I'm just worried about causing harm to my child. Thank you for your time.",
