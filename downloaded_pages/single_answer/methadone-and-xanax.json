    "question": "I posted this on an old thread about a week ago, and a member suggested that I repost it as a new thread.To: Detoxing off methadoneI haven't read through all the comments on this.\u00a0\u00a0I have gained some insight about what might have happened.\u00a0\u00a0One of these was accepting maintenance addiction as a disease like diabetes (m wife is a type 1 diabetic) and taking it every day like insulin.\u00a0\u00a0That would have been preferable to what happened to my 27 year old son, who died of an overdose in the ER last week.\u00a0\u00a0He was a musician with lots of talent ,a band was going to be\u00a0\u00a0built around him, he had a new and lovely girlfriend, and was thinking about joining military, so he definitely had a future.\u00a0\u00a0No one understood how hard it was going to be go get off it permanently.\u00a0\u00a0He lived with us for the last two years, and was miserable and unable to do most of the things he loved.There were remarks about Xanax as an aid to enduring withdrawals.\u00a0\u00a0Be very careful: this can be a lethal combination, because both inhibit respiration.\u00a0\u00a0I think, (pending the tox report) that that was what killed him.",
