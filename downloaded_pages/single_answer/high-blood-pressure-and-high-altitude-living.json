    "question": "My father is 58 years old and is a long-time sufferer of high blood pressure. He was also diagnosed with diabetes a few years ago. However, both ailments are well under control using medication and he is very careful about his diet and other factors that might affect his health. He is considering moving to a city that is 2500m (just over 8000 ft) above sea-level for a couple of years. Is such a move advisable or is living at such high altitudes dangerous for high blood pressure patients? What other health-related information is it important for him to consider? What kind of precautions are advised?Thank you for your help.",
