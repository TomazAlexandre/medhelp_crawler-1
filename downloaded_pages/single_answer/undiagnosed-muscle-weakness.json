            "answer": "Hi!Muscle weakness can be true type as seen in muscular dystrophy, inflammatory myopathy, or neuro-muscular myopathy (myasthenia gravis). It can also be a perceived muscular weakness as seen in chronic fatigue syndrome, electrolyte imbalance, hypothyroidism, low iton, diabetes and dehydration. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lupus, and Lymes can also cause muscle weakness.Muscular atrophy, dystrophy and myasthenia gravis apart from positive EMG will give show low creatinine levels. So, if you have low creatinine levels, you can feel muscle fatigue. Also you need to test for autoimmune disorders, electrolytes and diabetes. You need to drink plenty of water and see if it helps. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
