            "answer": "Dear neener99,Sotalol is an antiarrhythmic drug in the same class of medications as beta-blockers so it can cause all the same side-effects as beta-blockers such as problems with cognitive ability, fatigue, slow heart rates and shortness of breath.\u00a0\u00a0It can cause problems in men in the ability to have an erection but I am not aware of a similar effect in women.Here is some additional information about sotalol:Sotalol (brand name Betapace) is a Class II and III antiarrhythmic that comes in 80, 120, 160 and 240 mg tablets.\u00a0\u00a0It is indicated for a variety of heart arrhythmias.\u00a0\u00a0It is usually initiated in the hospital on ECG monitoring due to a potential for inducing ventricular tachycardia.\u00a0\u00a0The dosage starts at 80 mg twice daily and may be increased as needed.Contraindications: Asthma, sinus bradycardia, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block unless paced, long QT syndromes, cardiogenic shock, uncompensated heart failure.Precautions: sick sinus syndrome, heart failure, recent MI, diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Not recommended in nursing mothers.Drug interactions: Avoid Class 1A and Class III antiarrhythmics; caution with Class I antiarrhythmics; phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, astemizole.Potential adverse reactions: bradycardia, chest pain, palpitations, edema (swelling) ECG abnormalities, hypo- or hypertension, dyspnea (shortness of breath), asthma, dizziness, fatigue, headache, fainting, GI upset and rash.",
