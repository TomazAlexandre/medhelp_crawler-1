            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Well a tingling sensation can be explained by sciatica. However any other abnormal sensation can usually be explained by \u2018restless leg syndrome\u2019. \u201cRestless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable urge to move them for relief.\u201d You can read more about this on: http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/restless_legs/restless_legs.htmThere are a few things you must look into. Diabetes and hypothyroid states should be ruled out. Electrolyte imbalance and Vitamin B 12 deficiency too should be investigated. Deep vein clots and thrombosis too should be looked into.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
