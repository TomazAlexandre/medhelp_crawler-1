    "question": "My lab was diagnosed with diabetes in April of 2012, she was five at the time.\u00a0\u00a0Fast forward to January 2013 and she now is slowly recovering from a bad bout of acute pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0She was in the vet hospital for four days and it was kind of touch and go.\u00a0\u00a0The vet and I have always had a problem getting her sugar count down since she was diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0When she became ill last week she was getting 40cc on insulin twice daily.\u00a0\u00a0Her sugar was still in the 400s.\u00a0\u00a0While she was in the hospital the vet worked on her diabetes also and figured it was going to take 50cc twice daily.\u00a0\u00a0Four days ago when she came home the vet had given her 50cc and brought her suger down to 50 they had to give her dextrose to get it back up.\u00a0\u00a0They told us to give her 45cc twice daily after we got her home.\u00a0\u00a0She has been drinking just fine but not eating much since she got back home so we've only been giving her 22 units a day.\u00a0\u00a0Two days in a row she vomited once 6 hours after her shot.\u00a0\u00a0Just the one episode each day. I took her back to the vet expecting the worse and she said all her blood counts for the pancreatitis were good but her bile might be alittle backed up from the inflammation of the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0The big shocker was her blood glucose was at 107..this was only with 22units of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Even when I took her in for her pancreatits her sugar was at 700 and that was after vomiting most of the day.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if the 22 units is taking her sugar to low thats why shes been getting sick at the same time 2 days in a row.\u00a0\u00a0She really hasnt been eating much since she came home....still feeling crappy and on pain meds and anti nausea meds.\u00a0\u00a0Could she be in a temporary diabetes remission?",
