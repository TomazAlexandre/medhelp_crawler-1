            "answer": "Don't know whether the question is about anxiety or diabetes or both. If your blood sugar is not at the right level things can go wrong mentally as well. I'm sure you monitor it but right now that would be the first thing to do and if anything is wrong then speak to your doctor. Physical needs definitely come first. If its an anxiety episode think about what set it off. And what has worked to stop them at other times. Anxiety attacks can be monitored as well and what medication is unable to treat by itself talk therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy can work on. And there are real life issues too. But sometimes its a matter of keeping things in balance same as with the diabetes.",
