    "question": "My mother had a quadruple bypass and mitral valve replacement a few months ago. She is a diabetic (non-insulin-dependent). Her left leg had two incision for the CABG; one went from the top of her inner thigh to her knee and the other from the knee to the ankle. The day after her surgery, I was told the CICU night shift nurse forgot to turn my mother during the night and she had internal bleeding in her thigh. The blood pooled around the incision site and the entire back of her thigh was black. During the next several days, the \"bruise\" on the back of thigh began to dissipate, but the incision site remained black and became necrotic (an area of approximately 9 inches long and 3 inches wide). Today, the surgeon continues to surgically debride the site and says it will not be completely healed until sometime next summer. (BTW, the incision on the calf healed quickly without any complications.) Why did this necrosis occur? Is it related to her diabetes and the fact that she was not moved/turned during that first night? Many thanks for your input!",
