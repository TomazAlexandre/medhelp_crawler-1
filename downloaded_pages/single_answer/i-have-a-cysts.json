            "answer": "Hello darlingFirst of all big hugs!Can I ask you if you have started your periods yet??What has the doctor told you about the cyst? Has he explained what sort of cyst it is, how big and what he intends to do about it. What has he said to your Mom. It sounds to me like you are a very bright girl and you havn't been given enough information about your condition. You said the doctor told you that you have a cyst on your ovary but didnt xray. Did you have an ultrasound? where they put gell on your tummy?? Did he press your tummy and feel the cyst??Sorry for all he questionsAnna X",
