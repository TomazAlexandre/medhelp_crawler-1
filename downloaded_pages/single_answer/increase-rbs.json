            "answer": "Hello,mixed insulin may not be your best choice at this time.\u00a0\u00a0Please ask your doctor about basal-bolus insulin approach.\u00a0\u00a0This means that you will take basal (long acting) insulin 1 or 2/day and a bolus insulin before eating to cover your meals and also in case your blood sugar is staying higher than it should.Normal blood sugars are 80-140, running up as high as 450 is extremely dangerous.You should also carefully control how much you eat, and particularly need to look at eating a low carb diet to prevent blood sugars swing so high.30 minutes of walking after each meal (in combination with low carb eating) will also be helpful in managing blood sugar.If your Doctor does not help you to get on a more appropriate insulin dosing regime, you may wish to find another doctor who will help.I recommend the books \"Using Insulin\", \"Think Like a Pancreas\", and \"Diabetes Solutions\", all of which can educate you on the proper way to use insulin to control your blood sugars.Hope this is helpful.",
