            "answer": "Hon:Your dad's doctor knows what is best for him...we couldn't possibly, as anonymous people on an internet forum, tell you what is needed for optiumum health.I will say this though:\u00a0\u00a0It often takes 2 or 3 meds in combination to bring high blood pressure under control.\u00a0\u00a0 This is quite common.As far as losing weight, he should aim for a diet high in vegetables (especially dark, green ones) fresh fruits (berries are the best) and lean poultry and fish.\u00a0\u00a0 Red meat is high in saturated fats and should only be eaten once in a great while, and then only in small quantities (4 ounces or less...about the size of the palm of your hand.)Anyone with diabetes should avoid alcohol, sugary drinks (soda, juices) processed foods, sugary snacks, baked goods, white flour, white pasta, chips, crackers, etc.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "The doctor has prescribed Losartan Potassium 100mg, Metoprolol Tartrate 100mg & Amlodipine Besylate 10mg all together, are all these three really needed ? There is a lot of pain in the legs, weakness & headaches since the doctor added Losartan on the list..\u00a0\u00a0My dad is also taking Diabetic medication: Metformin HCL 500mg & Glyburide 5mg? Some of which were replaced for hypertension and type 2 diabetes and the usage of taking these medicines are not working the way the doctor has suggested. He is overweight so what kind of foods or nutrition plan should he follow to stay healthy with consuming so much of the various drug prescriptions.",
