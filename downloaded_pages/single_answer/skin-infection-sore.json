            "answer": "Hi,How is your brother feeling? I feel the symptoms indeed appear to be due to allergic reaction.I am not sure whether it is due to allergic reaction to aspirin or not as it does not appear that Aspirin can cause such a reaction. You need to also see a dermatologist for a planned intervention. Do you feel the skin over the rash is making some crackling sound?If yes, then it might be gangrene. Does your brother have diabetes? If yes, the rash could be due to any allergies which are complicated by Diabetes. If he does not have one then you can check for diabetes on him.Anti-histamines with Antibiotics with Anti-fungal need to be tried for his current ailment.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",
