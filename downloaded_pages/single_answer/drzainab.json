            "answer": "Corticosteriods are a very powerful drug, and patients who take corticosteroids regularly should not stop taking them suddenly, even if their symptoms improve. Gradually tapering the dose before stopping the drug completely can allow the body time to adjust.The medication can coverup symptoms of some medical conditions, and if the condition gets worse one would have no way of knowing. Corticosteroids may affect blood sugar levels and \"any person with diabetes who notices changes in blood or urine test results while taking corticosteroids should check with a physician\", apparently that is not problem.Usually, left ventricle hypercardiomyopathy also has high blood pressure, with that aside your sister's doctor should dx the underlying cause and treat....there could be heart muscle damage.\u00a0\u00a0The significance of LBBB may not be of any significance and only cause skipped or double beats. If serious, there are effective treatment.Hope this helps, and thanks for sharing.",
