            "answer": "I never had his problem with the food. I mean yes, white carbs will make you gain weight but it sounds like you may be allergic to it and thats why you have dizzy spells and can't breath. Metformin will help with weight loss, if you stay on a healthy diet. You can eat white carbs, just in moderation. BUT, if your allergic to them then just stay away from them. With your weight, shoot for small goals. Like 10% of your current weight.",

    "question": "In april I was diagnosed with PCOS.It explains the sudden weight gain ( well over the year from 73kilos to 93kilos )Anyway, my partner and I have been reading books on PCOS which is making it easier to understand, having a low GI and low sugar/carbs eating plan helps.Every now and then if I am naughty and eat like potato, bread, sugar ect I get really tight chested and dizzy. My mum who is a nurse said I may be allergic to wheat, sugar because I always have a reaction like this. (I hardly ate carbs before).Last night I felt so dizzy I feel to the floor and also when I went to bed I woke up gasping for breath and feeling too scared to go to sleep incase I would not wake up.Still this morning I feel very hot, kind of tingly is the best way to describe it and a little light headed.When I eat healthy foods I never get this. So the simple solution would be to cut all that out which is fine.Just wondering if anyone else gets this and is it related to PCOSMy bf and I were trying for a baby but I think that my weight is not good. I want to get down 10 kilos first to which he agreed. I don't want to end up with diabetes.My doc put me on Metformin 3 months ago. I have another app on Friday and he will put me on Clomid.",
