            "answer": "no thrush does not mean you have hiv and you can call back in like 5 days from today if your really anxious and they will give you your results if you tested 4 or 5 months after your last unprotected encounter you should have a accurate conclusive result if your really really worried go to a clinic that offers rapid testing thats what i did waiting that week for your results can be very stressful but in your case you had a low risk and thrush isnt only the sign of hiv it could be from smoking drinking a lot of things no your not over reacting we all do in crisis times like this your lucky you dont have to get tested like me 8 weeks 10weeks then 12weeks i am still worried\u00a0\u00a0good luck even though your not going to need it",

    "question": "Okay, I know I'm going to sound paranoid...But I'm going to be honest, I'm scared. I just want to know if I should be...or if I'm just being crazy.I got really drunk months ago (like four or five) and ended up going home with someone from a different country (Jamaica). He didn't have a condom...and I realized after a few minutes (like I said, I was trashed. I met him at the bar) and made him stop and I went home. Since then I've slept with three people and used protection, I was never really worried about HIV or anything.Anyways, three days ago I developed thrush. I went to the doctor and he mentioned that it occurs in people with diabetes and HIV. I'm also a smoker, and it could have just happened...But the fact that he mentioned HIV scared the hell out of me. It made me think right back to that guy from Jamaica. I looked up the HIV/AIDS rate there and it's super low, but...it's low here in America, and people still get it. I went and got blood work done today, and I'm just scared. No, I'm terrified. I have no other symptoms, but from what I've been reading symptoms don't always show up, right?I know you guys can't tell over the internet...But from what I've told you...Does it seem like I have a reason to be as scared as I am? I won't get my results until my next doctors appointment on the 21st...and I'm freaking out. I don't know if it's reasonable for me to be as scared as I am, or if I'm over-reacting.I just don't know...I'm so scared. I don't know if I'm just going crazy over nothing or if me developing thrush does mean that I have a good chance of having HIV...",
