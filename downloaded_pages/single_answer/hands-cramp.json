            "answer": "Hi there!It is not-normal to get a tingling sensation whether diabetic or not. A neuropathy is unlikely early in the course of diabetes though other neuro-muscular/ vascular issues, micronutrient deficiencies etc, that could present similarly, may need to be ruled out. You might consider an evaluation by a primary care physician for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
