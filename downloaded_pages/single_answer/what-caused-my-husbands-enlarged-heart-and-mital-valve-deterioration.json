After that point, the stretching and thickening do not adequately compensate, and dilated cardiomyopathy with heart failure develops. Usually a slow, gradual process.Yes, dilated cardiomyopathy may be caused by an acute inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) due to a viral infection. cardiomyopathy.\u00a0\u00a0The virus infects and weakens the heart muscle. As in coronary artery disease, the weakened heart stretches in an attempt to compensate, resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy and often heart failure. Occasionally, dilated cardiomyopathy results from a bacterial infection. Infection and inflammation could result in a quick enlargement of the heart.Other causes of dilated cardiomyopathy may be gradual or quick and that\u00a0\u00a0includes certain chronic hormonal disorders such as long-standing, poorly controlled diabetes, morbid obesity, a persistently rapid heart rate, or thyroid disease.Dilated cardiomyopathy also can be caused by use of certain substances, especially alcohol (when intake is heavy and malnutrition is also present), cocaine, antidepressants, and a few chemotherapy drugs.\u00a0\u00a0When no specific cause can be identified, the disorder is called an idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.",
