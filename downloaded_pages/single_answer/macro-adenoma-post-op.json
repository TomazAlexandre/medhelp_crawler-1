            "answer": "I am thrilled that your eyesight is better....I am rather... Uh... Surprised you are not on any meds? The pituitary is a funny beast. It gets.... Antsy when whacked about and can be unpredictable at this point hence why the norm is to have you take at least hydrocortisone for the time being. It keeps you alive should your pituitary decide to get wonky (and it can happen fast) and you end up.... Very sick to maybe dead.Pain post op is usually pretty minimal. Just don't be bending over, using straws of going crazy, the lack of pain can sometimes lull people into thinking that hey, all this is okay and they do things they should not.\u00a0\u00a0Do be careful.What is the endo saying?",

    "question": "Hi Everyone,Just 4 days post transsphenoidal resection.\u00a0\u00a0It was benign and non- functioning.\u00a0\u00a0The surgery was 2 hours, no packing and felt great in post op. The ICU afterward had its trials and tribe .\u00a0\u00a0But, I think that was mainly due to my never having surgery prior to and being extremely anxious. It was all a bit overwhelming.\u00a0\u00a0Going half blind, being diagnosed with a (close) brain tumor and needing surgery is mind blowing.\u00a0\u00a0Pardon the pun.\u00a0\u00a0My vision came back up 20/40 and 20/20.\u00a0\u00a0The 20/40 was 20/200 prior to surgery and getting worse by the day.\u00a0\u00a0So, this is just amazing.\u00a0\u00a0I am home and resting comfortably. No diabetes, no bruising, stuffy nose that seems to fill and release like barometric pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't even need pain meds.\u00a0\u00a0Tylenol, regular Tylenol on day 2..All good!\u00a0\u00a0Need no medicines to come home with either..Things can go well if you get a good surgeon as suggested on this site.\u00a0\u00a0My issue now is healing time, patience and reducing anxiety concerning CSF leaks.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any data on how often this occurs and how long it takes before you needn't be concerned about it happening?Or, if there are any ways to help avoid this?\u00a0\u00a0I am sure stressing doesn't help pressure in the head..",
