            "answer": "Hi, your symptoms are most likely to be related to stress or anxiety. This is more so as the previous tests done are normal and you are able to exercise. The symptoms mentioned could be caused by cervical spondylosis. Some metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders are known to simulate these symptoms. Please consult your primary care physician who will carry out blood tests and x rays to rule out these conditions. You seem to be very anxious and in pain, take OTC pain medications like Tylenol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. Try applying local analgesic creams. Place ice over the painful area every 1-2hrs for pain relief. Practice relaxation techniques like yoga and meditation. Regards.",
