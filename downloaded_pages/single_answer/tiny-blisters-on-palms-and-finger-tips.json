            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The commonest cause for these blisters can be allergic dermatitis. Go back and see if you have touched something different that what you usually do before episodes of these blisters. You also need to rule out certain conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm a 59 year old man, happily married for 37+ years, living in SE Pennsylvania.For the past several years, a couple times each year, very tiny blisters appear just under the surface of my skin. It starts on my left hand, spreads to my left hand finger tips then spreads to my right palm - usually my right hand finger tips are not effected, but sometimes they are as well.In the early stage they're not painful. Over time though the blisters become bigger, filled with fluid. Eventually the blisters break, the clear fluid drains and I'm left with scabs which eventually heal. During the healing process I suffer from dry, flaking skin and cracked finger tips. This process lasts for 3-5 weeks.If anyone can suggest a diagnosis and recommend treatment, even dietary modifications, I'd me sincerely grateful.",
