    "question": "I thank anyone who can give me any kind of suggestions with regard to this matter. Currently, I have been experieincing severe instances of chest pain on the left side, numbing of my feet, muscular spasms all over my body with the exeption of my back, along with over all muscle soreness. I also have a seizure disorder as well. My question is that the doctor is not sure whether or not it is my seizures causing this, but I do not believe it is the seizures simply due to the fact that this began with only the numbing feeling in my feet and I did not experience this in the past as a child or a teenager as well. I do have an EMG scan scheduled, but can anyone give me any logical theories or suggestions of what this might be in the mean time, because it has just been so frustrating to deal with. Thank you for any help or suggestions anyone can provide.Sincerely,Timothy",
