            "answer": "You're going about it all wrong. First, 75 grams of sugar is equivalent to 11 Heaping Tablespoons of sugar. Guaranteed the sugar rush then crash is not going to be pleasant - can be down right nasty.Home testing should be done this way;1. Test preprandial [before a meal]. This is your baseline measurement.2. Eat a high carb meal like big bowl of pasta nothing else - no breads, no salads, no nothing extra, only the pasta. Only drink water.3. Test 2-3 hours postprandial [after eating]. Then at the 4 hr mark.4. Normal folks will see a glucose level very close to normal 70-99 mg/dl. If yours drops <70 mg/dl the chance of reactive hypoglycemia exists.5. Buy some hard sweet candy or glucose tablets. Keep one handy in case your levels drop below 60 mg/dl. Do NOT consume more than one.If you see levels <70 mg/dl a follow up visit to your doctor and/or a referral to an Endocrinologist for proper evaluation should be confirmed.\"My blood glucose levels drop below 60 on numerous occasions\"When stating test levels it is important to know the time it occurs, makes a huge difference. Also important to know if this occurred after a meal and what type of meal it was.\"I have had an A1C test and my doctor says it is normal\"This doesn't tell us much. It is important to post the actual test result. A lot of primary care physicians do not have the expertise in diabetes care and tend to follow what drug companies tell them. This is like the fox watching over the chicken coop. So normal to them is actually not in the real world.",

    "question": "I want to self test myself for reactive hypoglycemia. From what I have read, I would need to take 75g of sugar and test my blood glucose levels every 30 minutes for 4 hours. Is this the proper way to self test for reactive hypoglycemia? If I post the results, would someone be able to determine if my levels are normal? My blood glucose levels drop below 60 on numerous occasions. I have had an A1C test and my doctor says it is normal.",
