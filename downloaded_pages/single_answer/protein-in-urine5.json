            "answer": "HiProteinuria\u00a0\u00a0(although a common findings in adults) can have many causes. Benign causes can be fever, intense activity or exercise, dehydration, emotional stress and acute illness.Some of the serious causes are renal diseases, hypertension, bone disease, diabetes etc.Further management would depend upon your medical history and any underlying conditions. Also the amount of proteins in urine can also be an indicator.Usually (in the absence of any underlying conditions) if the amount of protein in urine is low, then 2-3 repeat urine examinations should be done during the next month; if the protein in urine is high, then a comprehensive examination including a 24 hour assessment should be done.You should consult your doctor/nephrologist for management of this.Take care and do write in if you need more information.Regards",
