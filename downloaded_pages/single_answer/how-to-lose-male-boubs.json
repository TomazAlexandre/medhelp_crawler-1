            "answer": "Hi!All cardiovascular exercises will help you lose weight provided you do not have an underlying diseases such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, adrenal gland problem (Cushing's) etc. Your breasts could be enlarged due to fat deposit, low testosterone, adrenal gland dysfunction, pituitary tumors, or use of certain drugs. Hence, you must first consult a doctor and rule these out. The cardiovascular exercises which you can do include treadmill, jogging, swimming, and playing squash and lawn-tennis. Other than this you can do stretches to tones up your abdomen and chest. You can get many such on net. However, one month is a very short time to get good results. This is a slow and steady process, best undertaken under trained dietician and physical trainer post medical consultation. Take care!",
