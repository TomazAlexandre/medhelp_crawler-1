    "question": "In the last few days ive had 2 episodes of low blood sugar (shaky, weak, sweaty) which is stabelised by eating glucojel jelly beans. I have had this happen to me a fair few times before I got pregnant as well. I have been tested and have never been diagnosed with diabetes or anything. Now that I'm 13 weeks pregnant though im wondering if anyone else has experienced this and know if there are any negative effects these lows have on my baby?",
