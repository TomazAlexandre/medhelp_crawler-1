            "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I think your mother deserve to be treated, if that is what she wants.Your mother is 81, with diabetes, and CHF.\u00a0\u00a0The CHF could be treated with Coreg and lasix, and a strict diet of low/no soduim.My EF is 15%, at 57 years of age, with stage 5 renal disease.\u00a0\u00a0I receive treatment for the EF through a cardiologist, and I also receive dialysis 3X's a week for renal failure.\u00a0\u00a0There has been no mention of Hospice in my case, so perhaps your Mother needs to find a doctor who will treat her, even if it means going out of town.I do not believe that your mother's doctor can force Hospice on her if she doesn't want it, so stand strong and tell them to leave her alone.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have Power of Attorney for handling your mother's affairs?\u00a0\u00a0If not, you should get it, then her doctors will have to deal with you, directly, and ask what you want for your mother.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes when a person is ill, and the doctor tells them they should make funeral arrangements, the person just gives up, so it's up to you to help her.Hope some of this helps.",

    "question": "My mother is 81 years old, had diabetes since 40 yrs old-had a lower leg amputation and recently in hospital for CHF.\u00a0\u00a0The nursing home wants to put her on hospice because she has reached the medicare requirements of an EF of 20% but she (& we) want to keep having her treated in a hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Hospice is trying to tell us they would be the best route and I can't get anyone to give me her medical facts on how they make that decision.\u00a0\u00a0I am interested in a Dr's take on the situation.\u00a0\u00a0I understand the gravity of my mothers health but... if she could live with this for 5 yrs if treated, then I want to treat her.Thanks to anyone that can offer some insight.",
