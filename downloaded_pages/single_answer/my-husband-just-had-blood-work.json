            "answer": "TSH is often used as a screening test for thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor might suspect a thyroid issue.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that TSH often comes back \"normal\" when there is a problem.\u00a0\u00a0The old reference range for TSH was 0.5-5.0.\u00a0\u00a0The currently accepted one is 0.3-3.0.\u00a0\u00a0Many labs and doctors are still using the old range, leaving their patients with thyroid symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0If your husband's TSH comes back anywhere near the top or bottom of the 0.3-3.0 range, he should have further thyroid testing...free T3 (FT3) and free T4 (FT4).\u00a0\u00a0These give a much better indication of thyroid status.",
