    "question": "So today I went in for my appointment. I'm 27 weeks 4 days & two days ago I went into L&D for contractions that were 2-3 mins apart. It was the second time I went to the ER. No dilation so I was told to monitor at home and keep my doctors appointment today for a follow up. At my appointment I got weighed and I hit my 28 pound mark for weight gained throughout my total pregnancy. It was so depressing. I know I've gained weight but it's puzzling. I've cut down on what I eat and how much I eat but the weight still goes up. And baby is measuring 29 weeks when I'm 27. My doctor thinks I could have gestational diabetes so I have a glucose test on Monday. Being told you're too fat and then that you might have gestational diabetes *****! Anyone else go thru this?",
