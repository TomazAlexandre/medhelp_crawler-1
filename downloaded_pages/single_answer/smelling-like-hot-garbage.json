Medicines like anti depressants too can cause a body odor. Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I am severly over weight. (Hate the term MORBID OBESITY)I also have bad allergies to almost everything, which makes it hard for me to have a good since of smell.A good friend once told me, \"OMG it smell like HOT GARBAGE in here\"!!!, while we were driving to an event.Plus over the years, I have had ppl make comments about foul smelling odors, even roll down the windows in the middle of winter.I am very paranoid about my body odor and take showers daily but nothing seems to help my funk.I dry everything throughly and make sure I use deoderant and cologne. But that only helps temporarly.I can't stand the thought of offending ppl and so I have resorted to staying home and not going out, or having ppl come over to visit.Any suggestions for a Funky smelling hot mess ;-(",
