            "answer": "I am sorry, but I have never heard any claims that stress can cause type 1 diabetes. It is commonly thought at this time that type 1 diabetes is caused primarily by genetic abnormalities that cause our bodies' immune systems to malfunction if certain triggers activate the immune system. Those triggers, according to articles I have read, are thought to be viruses, and there are even some articles that list certain viruses that are thought to act as 'trigger' viruses because the virus protein structures are very similar to the protein structure of our pancreas' insulin-producing cells. Stress certainly plays a huge role in our glucose levels, for adrenalin acts to inhibit the effectiveness of insulin, but I have not read any studies that claim that stress is the cause of the disease.",
