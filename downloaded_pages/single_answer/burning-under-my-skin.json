    "question": "For about the last 2-3 months, I have been having excruciating burning under my skin as though I had been set on fire. It wakes me and I run to the mirror and expect to see something horrific but there isnt anything there. For about the next 30 minutes I am in alot of pain and then it goes away. This usually happens while Im asleep however it has happened a few times while awake. The burning started on my face the backs of my ears and the backs of my arms. Then about a week later it moved into my chest and remained there for sometime. I haven't had much burning over the past few weeks until lastnight. OMG I thought I was going to die, infact that is my fear, but my back was in so much pain..the burning covered the entire back. Now today Im getting little flashes of it on the back of my neck...\"what is happening to me?\" I am a 43 yo\u00a0\u00a0female with multiple medical problems over the years and Im very afraid that this is the start of something terrible!\u00a0\u00a0 :(",
