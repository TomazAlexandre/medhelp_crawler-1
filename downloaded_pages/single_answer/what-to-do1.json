            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your mother. Yes, you could enroll her into community health programs where community health nurses help patients take their medications either by calling on them personally or through phones. You could also enroll her into support groups, where people of same age and same problems come together and sort out their problems, share their experiences etc. This can be quite motivating. Also, please take her to a diabetes counselor. If there is need then she may need to consult a psychologist or a psychiatrist for her depression. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
