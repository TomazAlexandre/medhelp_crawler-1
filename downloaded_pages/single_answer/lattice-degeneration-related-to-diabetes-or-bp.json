    "question": "Can Type 2 Diabetes and/or a audden change in blood pressure aggrevate Lattice Degeneration?I was treated with laser for light flashes in both eyes in '93, '03, and 2 sessions with 2 different lasers in both eyes in the past month (Sept. '09)I have recently been diagnosed as being borderline diabetic but have not been able to tolerate any of the medications prescribed.\u00a0\u00a0I want to take insulin but my doctors say it is not advisable.I am 43 and have a cataract starting in my left eye and also had impending vein occlusion in the left eye which was corrected with daily dose asprin. I also randomly have occular migraines in bright light.Doctor switched my BP meds which raised my BP to 135 / 90, when back to old meds I average 117 / 74, even after 2 weeks of no meds I was just 124 / 80.I also stopped taking Effexor for depression because of weight gain, and the withdrawl symptoms have been terrible - including dizzyness and headaches - sometimes I wonder what that stuff did to my brain.My mother had retinal detachment requiring scleral buckle in both eyes and her vision has not been the same since, and I have been volunteering with the blind for years which makes me value my sight more than ever.I am concerned that all the changes in medications along with sudden changes in BP and problems with diabetes are rapidly making my eye problems worse.Any comments or suggestions would be most appreciated!",
