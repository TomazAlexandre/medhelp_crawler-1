            "answer": "Thyroid problems can't be diagnosed on the basis of a TSH test only, but with it that low, you could have hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0You need to have further tests done, such as Free T3, Free T4 and antibody testing to see if you have an autoimmune disease -- either Hashimoto's and/or Graves.\u00a0\u00a0You also need to have a thyroid ultra sound to check for goiter and/or nodules on your thyroid.Since you are going to see your pcp on Monday, why not get a lab order from him/her, so you can get that much done before your appt with the endo.\u00a0\u00a0If you ask your pcp to let the lab send you and/or the endo a copy, you will be that far ahead and possibly save some time in getting a diagnosis/treatment.An endo is not required to treat thyroid issues, though in some instances, it's best to have one; however, your pcp can also begin treatment if s/he thinks it's warranted.Since you are also diabetic, this could have a bearing on that as well, so I wouldn't waste time. You don't say whether or not your diabetes is under control, but it doesn't seem like you should panic either.\u00a0\u00a0I will say one thing though ----Hyperthyroidism can cause rapid heart rate, palps, etc and being diabetic, you should not take anything lightly.\u00a0\u00a0 If at any time whatsoever, during the weekend, you feel things are going downhill, you need to go to the ER.Good luck.",

    "question": "After a couple of months of what I thought were swollen lymph nodes and two doctor visits, I was finally diagnosed with thyroiditis by an ear, nose, throat doctor last Monday.\u00a0\u00a0He ordered a TSH tests and the results was .002.\u00a0\u00a0He referred me to a endocrinologist but I can't get in until November 9.No meds have been prescribed and no further blood tests were ordered.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, all I know is that my thyroid is swollen and my TSH is .002.This morning, I woke up hoarse and have been having difficulty swallowing.\u00a0\u00a0My thyroid is more swollen today but nowhere near as swollen as it was about two weeks ago -- but I haven't been hoarse or had trouble swallowing until today.\u00a0\u00a0I called my family practice doctor's office today and the doctor on call said I should make an appointment for Monday.I have Type 1 diabetes, too.I have the feeling that no one is \"in charge\" of my healthcare right now.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be seen sooner by an endo?\u00a0\u00a0Can my family practice doc treat me effectively until I can see the endo?My internet research says that I need to have other blood tests to determine the nature of my thyroiditis, so I don't really have a complete diagnosis yet.\u00a0\u00a0Can this wait until November 9?The bottom line questions for me are \"how serious is my situation right now?\" and \"do I need to get treatment ASAP\".Thanks for your ideas.",
