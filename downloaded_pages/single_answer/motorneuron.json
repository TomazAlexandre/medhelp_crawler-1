            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved appears to be originating from lower back region i.e. sciatic nerve. Loss of sensation in both lower limbs can also result from injury to spinal cord at level of L5-S1.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency or abnormal endocrine status.In your case I feel it is compressive pathology or trauma causing such symptoms.I think you should consult orthopaedician, and neurologist to evaluate your case.MRI scan of lower back spine is most important diagnostic tool in your case.Alternatively you can start taking Multivitamin supplements.Bye.",
