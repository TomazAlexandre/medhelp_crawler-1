            "answer": "Hi, Thank you very much for your questions; although it is quite difficult for me to give you a precise opinion here without being able to examine you, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your upper back & neck pain. Your symptoms could be suggestive of either some nerve injury or a pressure on the nerve due to the muscle spasms. Another possibility in your case could be damaged the soft-tissues such as muscles and ligaments if you are over-doing any shoulder exercises or lifting heavy weights. Since you have persistent pain, I would recommend you to see a neurologist who can evaluate the details of your case and could better determine the insight of your situation.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, it will be best if you would also visit a physiotherapist to let him/her assess your back and shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 19 year old male.\u00a0\u00a0For the past three months, I have been experiencing horrible upper-back and neck aches.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I get bad pressure/tightness like headaches right where my occipital muscle is.\u00a0\u00a0It feels as if someone is pulling/pushing my neck.\u00a0\u00a0It's so uncomfortable because it gives me a woozy feeling all day.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, I have tightness right over where my collar bone is.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to countless doctors including my GP, an Endocrinologist and a Neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for diabetes, thyroid disorders, multiple sclerosis and even had an EMG performed.\u00a0\u00a0The MRI's that I got didn't show any problem within my brain or my spinal cord, however I still feel pain.\u00a0\u00a0A while ago, I went to the gym and lifted heavy weights, more weight than I ever had before.\u00a0\u00a0Could I have pulled a muscle or pinched a nerve that is causing all of these weird symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
