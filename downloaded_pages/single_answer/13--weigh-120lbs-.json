            "answer": "Hi!Many a times a growing adolescent can weight much more than he looks because of heavy bones. While it is not a bad thing, if you weight more than 25 percentile of the weight expected for your age, gender, height, waist and ethnicity, then you need to consult a doctor. This could be due to over eating or lack of exercise or due to any other cause such as diabetes or hypothyroidism. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
