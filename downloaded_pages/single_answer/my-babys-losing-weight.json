            "answer": "Hi!Though I am really sorry to hear that your little one is not gaining weight, and can understand your concern, it is very difficult to determine the cause on net. It can be due to worms, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, food intolerance, not eating enough or due to some other underlying disease like anemia etc. Also maintain a food log as to what she eats and when, along with the quantity taken. This will give a rough estimate of her intake.You need to consult a pediatrician to run tests and find the cause. Take care!",
