            "answer": "The pain you are describing is unlikely relate to you heart as you are a healthy person and have essentially no risk factors for CAD (No Diabetes, No HTN, No high cholesterol, No family history of CAD and no smoking), except for the fact that you are a male.\u00a0\u00a0The pain sounds very musculoskeletal in nature and is probably related to the small muscles in your chest that when overworked may cramp up a little.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, if it continues to bother you, you should have it checked out by a physician, and if it is getting worse, especially with exertion, and is associated with shortness of breath or radiating pain to your arm or your jaw, you may consider getting a stress test to further assess it.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, I would not worry about it.\u00a0\u00a0Consider taking some pain medication before you exercise to see if it prevents it from coming on.\u00a0\u00a0That would also prove that it is most likely related to a pulled muscle.",
