My dr. has been testing for Cushing's but has decided PCOS to be more probable.I have always dealt with endometriosis and cysts.\u00a0\u00a0I was on birth control for 2 years and my symptoms decreased, but I gained a lot of weight.\u00a0\u00a0(40 lbs)Since beginning treatment for the tumor and thyroid condition I had ceased the medication I was on for Diabetes and just been controlling it with diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0(I was started on Metformin and switched to Janumet).\u00a0\u00a0My dr. has suggested I go back on Metformin for weight loss, regulate my periods and help with unwanted hair growth that has begun.Any suggestions, tips or other would be appreciated.PS. I have a 7 year old son from my first marriage. I am 30 and my husband and I started trying for a baby about 6 months ago.",
