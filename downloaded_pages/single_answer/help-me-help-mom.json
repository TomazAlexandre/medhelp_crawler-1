            "answer": "it is possible that some of your mom's behavior and memory problems could be the result of many small strokes she has suffered years ago (possibly even during surgery).\u00a0\u00a0 the symptoms may get wotrse with age, especially if she's accumulated new strokes at some point.\u00a0\u00a0 she should see someone who would assess her risk of stroke and start her on a good preventative regimen:\u00a0\u00a0that would involve a cholesterol lowering medication, likely an aspirin (which she should be taking anyway), blood pressure medication and check her for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 it would be best to see a neurologist and be referred to a neuropsychologist or a neurologist with special interest in stroke or memory problems to give your mom a full evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0 an \"alzheimer\" medicine may not be a bad idea if it isn't hurting her -- it often works too, at preventing rapid progression of disease.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if you are worried about your mom's driving, then you should not let her but if she appears to be safe and knows where she is going and how to follow street rules - perhaps, you should give her some of that independence back.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0depression is also a very common cause of memory problems and she should be checked for it.of course, it will take a lot of love and pursuasion to get her to see a doctor but i would do all the preparations beforehand and then simply take her there.\u00a0\u00a0 i.e., do the doctor search and, maybe, even talk it over with a physician prior to bringing your mom there, this way you won't waste time once you've got her convinced to go.good luck.",

    "question": "Pardon me, I'm 23, new to all of this. so I might not sound smart or sympathetic.\u00a0\u00a0But I really need some help because I'm now kind of in charge of my mom, but not at the dr.s level.7 years ago my mom, then 53, had open heart surgery, bypass on LAD.\u00a0\u00a0We chalked up most changes afterwards to the mental and physical traumas she'd been through.She had been in failing health for years before, but no one (Drs) knew why.\u00a0\u00a0Afterwards, even though her physical health was lots better, she seemed unable to hold a job, or even get a job.\u00a0\u00a0We noticed memory, balance, awarness, and sometimes \"tipsy\" behavior.She avoids Dr.s,\u00a0\u00a0has an unreasonable distrust.\u00a0\u00a0She only sees one at the clinic or emergency room when she's really sick. Almost 2 years ago, she had a bad reaction to a prescribed drug that landed her in the hospital for 6 days.\u00a0\u00a0While there, they did a MRI to determine why she had been\u00a0\u00a0put on alzhiemers medication.They told her that she had had some strokes, probably during the bypass operation, (and took her off of all medications.) That's what they 'found' in the MRIShe has done nothing about the MRI findings.\u00a0\u00a0She won't see a Dr, claims they didn't tell her to.We won't let her drive\" she can do it, but we notice that she'll suddenly 'snap to' and wonder how she got there.How much does she know?\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if she understands my concerns, yet I don't want to talk down to her.Thanks for any insight you can provide.MissM & Bro Bill",
