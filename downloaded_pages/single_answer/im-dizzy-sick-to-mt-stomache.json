            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The first few serious causes to be ruled out are very high or low BP, low blood sugar, and heart attack/angina.Other causes could be hormonal imbalance, gastric reflux, start of food poisoning, thyroid disorders, diabetes etc.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. It would be good to consult your PCP and gynecologist to rule these out. Take care!",
