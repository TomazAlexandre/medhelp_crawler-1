    "question": "I am 43 years of age..and I have been plagued for 2 years with heat and cold intolerance, unexpected weight gain of 60 lbs, memory problems fatigue, gerd (I'm on Nexium), gastropareisis (I'm on Metaclopromide), Nausea, bloating, indigestion, constipation, excessive gas, floating greasy stools when I eat bread, my teeth chip, and I get muscle cramping in my legs and feet every night (even though I have been taking Cal/Mag supplements for 4 years) I've had an ablation 5 years ago (before that I was as regular as a clock,\u00a0\u00a0My periods went from normal to abnormal amounts of blood changing a super sized tampon and super pad every ten minutes) and now I do not have my period.My Dr. says my last pap 1 year ago showed negative on the first part of the test, and unreadable for the second part, because there was too much blood, he was concerned given all my recent discoveries, and had another one on Friday July10, 2009, where he told me that I had Cervical Erosion, but yet my homone levels appear normal.Yet I have night sweats, where I wake up and am soaked wet, and have hot flashes, depression, and low sex drive.The Doctor put my on Synthyroid to help me loose weight (my thyroid levels were in the safe range but were closer to the hyperthyroid range) When starting the thyroid meds, my mental clarity improved, and I felt like 1 million bucks, but I continued to gain weight at a rapid rate, even when the dose was increased.\u00a0\u00a0So he took me off the synthyroid completely, as he wasn't convinced that this was my problem.\u00a0\u00a0We are now considering Celiac, as I bloat immediately after eating bread, and the excessive gas was a major problem.\u00a0\u00a0My mother has had her thyroid out, and my brother is on thyroid meds also.\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother had type 2 diabetes.I'm so tired of feeling terrible, I have given you my brief history.Based on the above information, What in the heck is going on with me?\u00a0\u00a0Do I have some kind of cervical cancer? Celiac Disease, Hormone problems, or thyroid problems????",
