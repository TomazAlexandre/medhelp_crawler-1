    "question": "I have had diabetes for 18 years now and I am 31 years old. For the past two years now I have been taking my sons blood glucose every couple weeks. Most of the time his blood sugar is fine but once he got a blood sugar of 300, I quickly took him to the doctor and his A1c was at normal level. Should I restrict him from candy and sweets or follow a normal diet.",
