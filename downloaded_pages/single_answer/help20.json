            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. Bell\u2019s palsy is weakening or paralysis of facial muscles due to trauma to the seventh cranial nerve. Since you have been suffering from frequent episodes, you need t be worked up for diabetes, low immune states like HIV, sarcoidosis etc.Are you pregnant, since frequent episodes are encountered during pregnancy? The doctor must be trying to work up for multiple sclerosis since there were spots of demyelination on MRI head. Lumbar puncture to check cerebrospinal fluid and any evidence of oligoclonal bands etc. consult a neurologist/rheumatologist for evaluation. Wishing you all the best.",
