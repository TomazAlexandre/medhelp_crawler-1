            "answer": "Hi!The simplest reason for the symptoms your son feels is dehydration. Let him drink water, clear soups, lemonade, fresh juice etc and see if it helps him. Underlying infection or inflammation (as in arthritis, IBS etc) in the body can result in the feeling of heat. Another possibility is hyperthyroidism or even diabetes. Antibiotic or other drug metabolism can also cause a feeling of heat in the body. Sometimes hormonal imbalance with fluctuating testosterone and adrenal gland hormones can cause hot flashes and heat intolerance in boys. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi,I have a 13-year-old son right in the middle of puberty with the voice drop and height increase, etc. More recently he has complained of increased sweating, which I know is normal for a boy at his age. However, he is also having what seems like to me are hot flashes, the way he describes them, where he feels increased warmth in his face and torso too. I can see him break out in the sweat but his face doesnt look really flushed, (he's a fair complected kid anyway). Last night he came from his room and stepped outside in the cool air for a minute. It was probably about 75 degrees in the house. He has never been intolerant to warmer temperatures in the house. He doesnt feel ill. He isnt an overweight child, and, in fact, is on the thin side. Does anyone here know if this is a normal process of puberty with fluctuating hormones, or could it be a sign that something is wrong?",
