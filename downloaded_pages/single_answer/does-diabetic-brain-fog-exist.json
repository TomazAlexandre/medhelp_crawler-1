Sometimes people mistake fatigue as brain fog too. Becoming forgetful could also be an early warning sign of dementia, something a doctor needs to look closely at. At any rate, it appears your mom needs to be re-evaluated by her doctor and possibly have her medication/s adjusted. A heads up to the doctor so he/she can spend extra time with your mom. Good luck.",
