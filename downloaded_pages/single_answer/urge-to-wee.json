            "answer": "Hello,It is important to rule out any kidney stones and inflammation of the kidneys as well. Patients with urinary calculi may report pain, infection, or hematuria. I suggest you to get an ultrasound or CT abdomen and a thorough examination, a complete urine examination and a urine culture done from a urologist. If kidney and urinary causes are ruled out then GI causes and other causes like diabetes should be investigated.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
