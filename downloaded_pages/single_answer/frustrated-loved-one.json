            "answer": "I can't say what it could be over the internet without evaluation.With the symptoms like \"shock\" sensations, this can be indicative of neuropathic pain.\u00a0\u00a0Obtaining thyroid and vitamin B12 studies can be considered.A neurologist would be an appropriate consult.\u00a0\u00a0Obtaining nerve conduction studies can exclude neuropathy.Another consideration would be rheumatologic disease, despite the absence of joint pain.\u00a0\u00a0An ANA level and sedimentation rate can help.These options can be discussed with her personal physician.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "I am writing in regards to my wife. She has been suffering from sypmtoms that has been very difficult to diagnose. My wife is alergic to Alcohol, Meldew, mold, citrus fruits, dust pollen etc. Her reactions include bruise like patches on her body bone pain small pimple like rashes on her upper torso,headache and a general filling of weakness. These come and go and we manage it by anti alergy tablets. In the last month however my wife has started complaining of electric shock like sensations all over her body and pain in both tissue and bone. These are not joint pains. The pain is all over the body and sometimes in such weird places as her cheek bone, collar bones etc. She is also complaining of heat sensations on parts of\u00a0\u00a0her body coming and going. This feels like being rubbed with chilly. The bone and body pain is consisitant is not going away.We are starting to get some general blood work done with our GP. However we live in Fiji and our medical facilities are at best average. She has suffered from no weight loss, does not have diabetes, no fever etc. She is 36 years old and other then the alergies and the above symptoms has no other medical problems. If any thing she has gained a few pounds over the last month.Before i take my spouse to better medical facilities abroad i would appreciate some feedback or at least an expert guess as to what this could be.Thank you in advance",
