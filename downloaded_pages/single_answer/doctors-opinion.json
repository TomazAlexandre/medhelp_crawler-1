            "answer": "Those of us who answer the questions posted on this Forum are not doctors, but are either long-time type 1 diabetics or are parents of type 1 diabetics. So we are not experienced with Metform since type 1 diabetics must take insulin to survive.That being said, Metformin IS a medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes, so your doctor would not be prescribing this medication if she did not consider you a type 2 diabetic. This medicine does not make you produce more insulin, but instead treats the problem of insulin-resistance. Here is a paragraph I copied from a web site that discusse the uses of this medication: \"These medicines (metformin in its various brand names) help control your blood sugar in a number of ways. These include helping your body respond better to the insulin it makes naturally, decreasing the amount of sugar your liver makes, and decreasing the amount of sugar your intestines absorb.\"As you may already know, oral medications are used IN CONJUNCTION with careful monitoring of diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. Since no doctor would proclaim you NOT a diabetic and then for the first time in your life put you on a diabetes medication, I think you are safe to assume that although your numbers were healthy ones when the bloodwork was done, you are a type 2 diabetic. So I would heartily recommend going back to the healthier lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0Even with the Metformin, your glucose numbers are a little higher than ideal if they are pre-meal numbers, and are certainly not the numbers we expect to see in a person who is NOT a diabetic. If these readings have been taken after meals, they are more within normal limits, but still are indications that your previous diagnosis of being diabetic was correct. So going back to your careful diet may help lower these numbers and make you feel better. Even the manufacturers of medications used to aid in treating type 2 diabetes make the point very clearly that these medications are NOT the primary treatment for type 2 diabetes and should never take the place of the best treatments, healthy diet and exercise.Mood swings, fatigue, sleepiness, dizziness and the symptoms you describe during the night could be caused by hypoglycemia, even though the web site that I researched that discussed Metformin stated that this medicine is not supposed to put a person at risk of hypoglycemia uniess it is used inconjunction with insulin. But each person is different, and you may be going low after a high-carb meal stimulates your body to overproduce insulin. I would suggest that you do a glucose test when this happens and go to bed with your meter by the bed If you wake up at night with odd symptoms, do a finger ***** and test the glucose. You may want to keep a small can or box of juice by the bed in case you are going low at night. If you do find that you are experiencing hypoglycemic reactions, then I would recommend that you call your doctor, who will probably adjust your medication.For each person, either type 1 or type 2, acheiving good control with medications is a careful balancing act. The doctor prescribes a certain dose, and only time will tell if this is actually perfect for that particular person. The medication makes it easier for your body to acheive normalcy in the way it uses the insulin it makes, but the right balance must be found by trial and error, and you may not be there yet. I would heartily recommend that you call your doctor and discuss these episdodes with her, armed with actual glucose numbers taken when you have moodiness or sleepiness or fatigue. If the communication with your doctor continues to leave you confused, then by all means find another doctor who you can trust and communicate effectively with.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, 7 years ago, while pregnant with my son. I continued to have problems after the pregnancy and was told by all who tested me that I was a type 2 diabetic.For nearly 7 years, I lived believing that I was diabetic, testing my daily sugars, attemping ot make healthy eating choices (that was not easy for me), and exercising as much as my schedule would allow.I moved from one city to another. I told my new health care phsycian about my condition. She did a work up on my blood, etc. As I was getting ready to ask her for the prescription that would allow my diabetic supplies to be covered under my health insurance...She tells me that I never had diabetes, and then prescribed two months worth of metformin.I have never been on ANY type of diabetic pill or insulin either before or after that.When my test results arrived back at her office. She said I was fine except there were traces of protein in my urine.Since going off my somewhat healthy diet, I've experienced..mood swings, a rash (that was common when my sugars were off the charts), fatigue, lathargic,etc. I relaize that those may all be symptoms of just not eating right and exercising...But should I have cause to worry about this Doc's Diagnosis? She is supposedly a Specialist in the field of Diabetes...My sugar tests are recently around 150 and have been as high as 185 to 195. Is there cause for alarm?I sometimes sleep immediately after a meal, experience dizziness, wake in the middle of the night and lose feeling to my hands.Thanks,TAZ",
