            "answer": "Similar things have happened to me throughout my pregnancy. I'm 31 weeks with twins. I passed my glucose test. It happens to me when I don't eat enough, or when I eat and haven't had enough water to drink (this is also the surest way to get me to vomit). My Dr recommended I drink one gallon of water per day and it hasn't happened since I've been drinking enough water and eating every two or three hours. Also ask your doctor at your next appointment just to be safe.",
