            "answer": "Hi,\"Flaccid bladder can often be traced to neurogenic problems: The bladder nerves fail to send appropriate messages to the brain. Multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries can both lead to a dilated bladder. Diabetes is also associated with atonic bladders.Obstruction of the urinary canal may cause flaccid bladder. Bladder stones are the typical causes of obstruction, but a man with an enlarged prostate can develop atonic bladder if the prostrate creates an obstruction of the urinary system.Management and TreatmentManagement of atonic bladders centers around the need to empty the bladder before overflow leakage or stretching occurs. Catheterization on a regular basis is often used. Patients learn to self-catheterize, and may have to wake up at night to use the catheter.For patients who cannot self-catheterize, other options exist. Cred\u00e9 is a bladder voiding technique in which the patient manually presses down on the bladder. In effect, this squeezes the urine out of the bladder. Valsalva, another technique, works by using the abdominal muscles as if having a bowel movement. This puts pressure on the bladder, and forces urine out.Surgical interventions are limited, but available. Bladder augmentation increases the bladder's storage capacity, lengthening the time periods between catheter use. A portion of the large intestine is removed and fitted onto the bladder to create additional capacity.Another surgical procedure called Mitrofanoff creates a passage using the appendix so that catheterization may be performed through the abdomen rather than the urethra. This makes self-catheterization easier for some patients.Researchers are currently evaluating the effect of botulinum toxin A injections into the detrusor muscle. Results are promising.\"www.bladderdisorders.info/articles/bladder-disorders/flaccid-atonic-bladder.phpYou will need to evaluate your diabetic status.If you are a smoker, you will need to have peripheral neuropathy ruled out.Improvement in diet and exercise that helps strengthen your pelvic floor and abdominal muscles can help with the voiding.Do keep us posted on your progress.Regards",

    "question": "I'm 56 yrs old, I thought I was in good health until after a few bladder infections and taking antibiotics my bladder stops working.\u00a0\u00a0Now I can't completely empty without self cathing.\u00a0\u00a0I have an atonic bladder. Apparently my bladder can really stretch.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 2 MRIs but they didn't find anything.\u00a0\u00a0I can force a couple of ounces of urine out but I can't completely empty. I'm not sure what to even call my condition and I don't know what options I have at this point since my urologist or nuerologist don't seem to have a clue.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to be proactive but need some direction.",
