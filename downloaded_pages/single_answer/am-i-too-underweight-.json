            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Yes, you should go to a doctor. Having a very low BMI, anemia or other medical problems can cause periods to become very irregular. Explain this to your mother. You need to be investigated for worms in your gut, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, irritable bowel and chronic inflammation as all these can make it difficult for you to gain weight. Also, they can affect your periods. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "So I'm 14 and 5'8.5 (175cm) and I weigh 90 pounds (41kg) I look a little bit underweight but really not that much but on every website it says I am wayyy under my BMI and it's kinda scaring me. It says it says the max underweight is 18 but my BMI is 13!!! WhAt?! I eat a lot actually and I don't eat healthy foods even though my family tells me too, I eat chocolate and icecream and lollies and i never gain weight! I probs have a fast metabolism but I've heard that if your really skinny and you eat like a pig but never gain weight you could have worms in your stomach cos they eat for you O__o that is scary. Sometimes I get dizzy spells from sitting up to quickly?? If that means anything.Also my periods are really irregular :( the biggest gap I've had is 4 months and the smallest gap I've had 2 months. Currently its been 55 days since my last. Should I go to a doctor and if so how do I explain this to my mom?This discussion is related to/posts/Anorexia--Bulimia--Binge-Eating/i-eat-weird-things/show/1435275.",
