            "answer": "Your vomiting sounds more like gastroparesis to me than ibs... you may want to go to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's website at www.jdrf.org and click on the Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST) to get some one-on-one contact with someone who knows about this problem. You will come to a page where you can enter the info you have posted here and the moderators will assign your request to someone who is suited to the question.Besides that, I wonder if you have been tested for celiac disease or for food allergies, for both can cause digestive tract problems. And another possible problem that can cause digestive tract problems is adrenal gland malfunction (low cortisol). Has this been tested? I ask about these because these problems are more common among type 1 diabetics than among the rest of the population, but sometimes we have to ask our doctors specifically to test for them since they may not show up in our routine lab work. Just a thought.But the vomiting does sound more like gastroparesis, and I do know of at least one member of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's ODST who has extensive knowledge of this problem, so I encourage you to contact them through their website as suggested above. I do hope you find some help.",
