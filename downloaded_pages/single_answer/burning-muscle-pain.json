            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. I understand you have undergone many tests, however I am listing out all the possibilities.The symptoms could be due to hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies (as in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s and lupus), pinched nerves, or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. In females above 40 years it can be a symptom of menopause or premenopause. Fibromyalgia is another possibility. At localized points it can also be a sign of deep vein thrombosis, especially if it is in legs and thigh. This would need a comprehensive investigation.Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Burning muscle pain with any minor exertion- climbing stairs, blow drying hair, holding milk carton, squatting down, chewing chewy foods as well as fatigue not relieved with rest. Healthy and active childhood and very involved in sports until symptoms slowly began at age 18. Very difficult to do more than the necessary tasks in a typical day due to fatigue and muscle pain.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions? Have been through enormous testing over the past 5 years with not much to help figure this out",
