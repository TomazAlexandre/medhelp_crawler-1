You might want to try intermittent fasting.Excerpt from Intermittent Fasting: Does It Work?...\"One reason intermittent fasting has received so much attention lately is because of books like Dr. Michael Mosley's \"The Fast Diet\" and Dr. Caroline Apovian's \"The Overnight Diet.\" These books tout scientific research that shows how calorie restriction from partial fasts could help maintain a healthy weight. For Mosley, a personal tipping point was the impetus to find a useful diet.\"My start point was: Ugh, my blood sugar is terrible, I\u2019m basically diabetic, [I have] high cholesterol. I\u2019m a bit overweigtht. What am i going to do about it?\" he tells HuffPost Healthy Living. \"I started off by looking at calorie restriction. And I saw that that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s ever been found to extend life. The problem is, it just is impossible to do -- I cannot imagine myself doing it. I went from that to look at more four-day fasts and, subsequently, fewer day fasts -- and that seemed to work.\"In total, Mosley reports losing 19 pounds of fat, restoring healthy cholesterol levels and returning his fasting glucose (a measure of pre-diabetes) to normal.\"",
