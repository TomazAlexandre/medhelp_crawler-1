    "question": "My mother is 42 years old and she's diabetic. About 2-3 months ago she started feeling really cold at night, to the point where we have to put 2-3 blankets on her, hug her, and turn off the fan and a/c. We live in Florida so as you know its hot down here and my mother is the type of person who gets hot NOT cold. She is not on insilin, no internal problems, blood pressure is good. Her sugar is always a little bit high. That is about the only bad thing besides her weight. I'm concerned about her because of what has been going on. Can someone please give me suggestions. She's too hard-headed to go to the doctor.",
