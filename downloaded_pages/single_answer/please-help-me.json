    "question": "my hands are almost always multi colored.\u00a0 Red at the knuckles down to the middle of the finger on the top side following along the bone.\u00a0 The tips are almost always bright red along the cuticle but never swollen or in pain.\u00a0 I get splinter hemorrhages in my fingernails often, either just small dots or slightly longer lines.\u00a0 These splinter hemorrhages almost always appear near the end of the fingernail.\u00a0 I am not a very physical person and am likely not getting the majority of them from damaging my fingers as I get multiple nails and random.\u00a0 The color changes throughout the day, usually around meal times as it brings on some semblance of anxiety for me cause I had been anorexic, which has never really left my mind.\u00a0 I also smoke, around one pack per day and for a long time consumed large amounts of caffeine.\u00a0 I have been a heavy drinker from the age of 19-27, mainly beer anymore.\u00a0 I have had two blood tests done as part of a physical and they say my liver, diabetes, kidneys etc were all fine for the tests that they had done.\u00a0 there are 5 red spots on top of my hand and one under my wrist (all on right hand) that are not raised up or itchy in any way but all tend to have a central white dot in the middle and I can see the small vein structures in the spot.\u00a0 sort of like a spider vein but the pictures that I have seen are much to extreme for these things.\u00a0 I'm tired a lot then get hyper around meal times, I know there's crazy anxiety/depression going on but this is getting insane.\u00a0 I have a heck of a lot of problems with my colon as well and that has been going on for more than 6 months.\u00a0 I'm cold all the time,\u00a0\u00a0my hands/fingers get cold, I could go on and on about related symptoms but I'll leave it at this for now. I made this in a doctor chat originally but never got it there.\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks for even reading.",
