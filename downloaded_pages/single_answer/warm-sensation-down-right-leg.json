            "answer": "Hi there!A warm sensation in the leg can be related to nerve damage or some neuropathy. Vitamin B6, vitamin B12 defficiency, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s disease, hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus can cause a feeling of burning sensation in the legs. Sometimes a pinched nerve can also cause this feeling. You need to see a physician. Investigations like blood sugar levels, electromyography, nerve conduction tests, tests of blood, urine may be needed. Assessment of vitamin levels may be needed. A complete history, clinical examination and investigations will help in arriving at a diagnosis. I sincerely hope it helps. Take care and do keep us updated.",
