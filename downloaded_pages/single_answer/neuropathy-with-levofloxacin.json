            "answer": "Hi!Well, peripheral neuropathy is unlikely to be due to levofloxacin\u2014the symptoms may have coincided with your intake of this antibiotic. However, if at all it is due to the antibiotic, then it should go away once you stop medication. You can take probiotics along with multivitamin.If this does not help then you will need to consult doctor to rule out post viral fatigue, diabetes, thyroid issues, low vitamin B12, lupus etc. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
