            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Having too much creatine is typically a sign of kidney damage.\u00a0\u00a0Have your parents been tested for these complications from their diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0If not, I would suggest they visit their doctors soon to get tested and treatment if necessary.As for diet, vegetables have no creatine, so they would be an essential part of any diet, and especially one for a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Meats have higher creatine levels, so cutting back on meats would also be a possibility.\u00a0\u00a0But I suspect their higher creatine levels are not because of diet, but because of kidney complications.\u00a0\u00a0Please continue to work with their doctor to check for those issues.",
