            "answer": "Yes, doctors often miss thyroid problems because they can sometimes come on gradually--especially in the elderly. For those of us with heart problems, it's really important to make sure we don't have a thyroid imbalance. Thyroid problems can lead to or worsen heart arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, etc.The American Thyroid Association says adults should routinely have their thyroid checked at age 35, if I'm not mistaken and have the latest recommendations. Then if your thyroid tests normal, they say recheck it every 5 years or so thereafter. But in people with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, etc., they often will monitor it more frequently. Also, if your close blood relatives (biological parents, biological siblings, etc.) have had hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, because thyroid problems run in families.My Dad (age 84) just was diagnosed with hypothyroidism; as the result of a memory assessment, the assessment team ordered a thyroid test and B12 level to see if either of these might be causing or contributing to his memory problems. Don't know how long he's had it, but in reviewing copies of his medical records recently (in prep for the assessment), I can't see when his GP last tested it. I'm assuming it was tested at the hospital somewhere along the way over the past 5 years, but maybe not. He had triple bypass in July 2008, has diabetes and a history of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure.My Mom (now 82) asked her doctor to check her thyroid 5 or 6 years ago because her hair was dry and falling out. He looked at her like, \"Right....You have a thyroid problem.\" Sure enough, she did, and they've had to adjust her thyroid medication a lot to avoid being too high or too low since then. She, too, has had bypass and history of congestive heart failure as well as atrial fibrillation.Word to the wise--Make sure your elders are being tested for thyroid problems! You might assume, like I did, that they are being tested regularly, but they well may not be.Thanks for your post, Alleycat. You're one smart cat!",

    "question": "It seems to me that most doctors really do not know enough about Thyroids. The exception would be a endocrinoligist. The thyroid is responsible for many thing that regulate in your body especially the heart. Most Doctors do not even check you thyroid in a physical. Google Dr. Mack starr.",
