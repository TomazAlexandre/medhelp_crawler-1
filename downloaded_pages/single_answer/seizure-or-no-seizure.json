            "answer": "Hello.It is possible that the previous episodes may have been a seizure not picked up in EEG. The symptoms are a bit unusual.The stiffening of the body does hint strongly towards a seizure. Let us wait for this EEG report. I guess you will need some anti seizure medication.Regards",

    "question": "I have suffered two bouts of a seizure/black-out type occurance in the last year and a half.\u00a0\u00a0Both times I had severe flu and/or pnemonia symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0A fever was present both times.A couple days ago while suffering from flu symptoms with high fever, I awoke to find that I was going to pass out.\u00a0\u00a0I told my fiance, who again watched as I slipped into unconsciousness.\u00a0\u00a0She reports that I lie rigid with my eyes open.\u00a0\u00a0On the earlier occasion she said I stopped breathing for a short time.\u00a0\u00a0I have a visual and auditory warning of the impending \"black-out\".\u00a0\u00a0It begins to darken from the sides and my ears ring louder and louder until it's all quiet.\u00a0\u00a0This is quite frightening.\u00a0\u00a0I remember being very hot this last time preceeding the black-out.\u00a0\u00a0So after waking i consumed some fluids, as best as I could, to relieve any dehydration (which was my diagnosis for the first occurances in 2006) and tried to relax.\u00a0\u00a0An hour later I awoke and blacked-out again, this time with vomiting while unconscious.In 2006 I had a sleep derived EEG and CT scan of the head with normal results.\u00a0\u00a0I have had full blood tests including diabetes testing.\u00a0\u00a0Today I had an EEG again.\u00a0\u00a0My blood tests are not in as of yet.I am looking for input on this.",
