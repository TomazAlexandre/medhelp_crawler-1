            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Since the same leg affected by the accident is showing the symptoms of neuropathy, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evalaution. Although the chance of a direct effect of the accident is unlikely because it has been eleven years, further evaluation may need to be done. Numbness and tingling may be caused by a variety of issues such as injury to a nerve; pressure on the nerves of the spine; pressure on peripheral nerves from enlarged blood vessels, tumors, or\u00a0\u00a0scar tissue; infection; lack of blood supply to an area; lack of vitamin B12;\u00a0\u00a0medication side effect; and other medical conditions; including diabetes, thyroid dysfunction,abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body.Additional diagnostic tests such as blood tests and imaging studies may help determine the underlying cause. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Eleven years ago I was hit by a speeding car. I broke my right arm and my left leg but have permanent damage to my right ulnar nerve.Recently I started feeling a numbing tingling sensation in my left thigh that gradually changed to burning pain and a snapping feeling like a snapping rubber band. Now my entire thigh has started to go numb.I remember how my arm felt in the early days when I learned that I have permanent nerve damage and I fear that what is happening to my thigh is somehow linked.Is it possible that what is causing these symptoms in my leg is something leftover from that accident that wasn't caught back then? Because I can't think of any other reason why I'm starting to feel this in my leg.If not, I could really use some feedback on this.",
