    "question": "i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when i was ten. i took medication for about two years and my doctor decided to switch because i wasnt doing well. so i switched to tegretol, lithium carbonate, and synthroid for my thyroid. i am now 20. i have had no problems since i was twelve years old. i am in college and i maintain a good gpa and i am involved. my question is, how much longer do i need to take this medication? its a hassle, and someday i want to be able to have kids. im tired of people asking me what im doing when i take my medicine every morning and night. i feel like i lead a normal stable life. im just scared that my life will be turned upside down if i stop taking them. i see a psychiatrist every six months, but i dont really like her and she doesnt have any suggestions for me. i dont know what to do. i just want to lead a normal life without people judging me all the time.",
