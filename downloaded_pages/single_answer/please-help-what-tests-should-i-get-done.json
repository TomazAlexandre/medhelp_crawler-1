    "question": "Starting about four weeks ago, I felt a pins and needles feeling in my hands. It left, but returned two days later much worse, and including the arms and chest.In a week, it went away almost completely, only to return with a passing out feling.\u00a0\u00a0It went away again, but returned this time throughout the entire body, except head and neck.\u00a0\u00a0It felt very warm and like I was wearing wool. It went away, but now has returned with\u00a0\u00a0all the symptoms of before, plus my hands seem a bit shakey and perhaps week.There is a frightening pattern of this leaving and coming back even worst. Due to the nautiounes and headace, the doctors originally thought itwas a virus, but now they just don't know. what tests should I insist on having? What could they show?This discussion is related to/posts/show/585924.",
