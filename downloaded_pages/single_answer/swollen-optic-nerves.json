            "answer": "Swelling of the optic nerves (papilledema) is often very serious. Diabetes does not cause this. Sometimes the nerves just look swollen but really aren't (Fase or \"pseudo\" papilledema)\u00a0\u00a0This is specially true if you are farsighted. Hopefully your tests will show no true swelling.JCH III MD",

    "question": "i was born with a lazy eye so i was never really able to see out of my left eye. I got new glasses about 8 months ago .. . at first i thought they were a little strong (so much more in the left side) but i eventually got used to them. .. I went to the eye doctor yesterday because i felt as though my eyes have either gotten worse, or im straining to see out of these glasses . .. . i've also been having headaches lately. He told me that my optic nerves are slightly swollen and raised, however, they could just appear to be swollen? he said something about Optic disc edema .. . so i have to go back tomorrow for more testing. .. also, im going friday for an MRI. now im getting worried because my mom brought up how last year when i got blood work done my sugar was elavated\u00a0\u00a0. .. .i hope i dont have diabetes . . i dont have really any symptoms for it but could this be causing my eye problems? or is it just strain or something?",
