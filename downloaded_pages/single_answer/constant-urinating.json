            "answer": "HI,\u00a0\u00a0Voiding frequently can be due to many problems.\u00a0\u00a0First, you need to have your urine checked.\u00a0\u00a0An infection can cause frequency, so a culture should be sent.\u00a0\u00a0Blood in the urine can be due to a stone, tumor or injury, so a urinalysis should be sent.\u00a0\u00a0Heavy glucose in the urine may be a sign of diabetes. If the urinalysis and culture are negative, your doctor need to check that you are emptying your bladder, and not in retention.\u00a0\u00a0If you are emptying your bladder and your pelvic exam is normal, you may have overactive bladder.\u00a0\u00a0Aalternatively you could have interstitial cystitis but usually you have pain, pressure or discomfort in the bladder along with your frequency.\u00a0\u00a0You clearly need to see your doctor and get a basic evaluation for frequency, and possibly a referral to a Urologist or Gynecologist for further testing.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck---------------- David",
