            "answer": "Hello,First of all as far as I can understand,you are having pain in the anal hole(which you are calling prostate).This pain can be due to abrasions and friction rub to the delicate epithelium of the anus during fingering.The urge in urination can be due to increased intake of fluids or diabetes mellitus.Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection,hypercalcemia,hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism,hyperparathyroidism,diuretic drugs and benign hyperplasia of the prostate(in elderly males).In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen(already ruled out kidney causes) ,intravenous pyelography ,prostate specific antigen blood test,thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis.I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.Kind regards.",
