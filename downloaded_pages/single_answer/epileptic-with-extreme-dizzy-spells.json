            "answer": "I too am an epileptic. I have had grand mall problems for 50 some years. I say problems due to the medication taking care of the problem, but will be on it for life.I too had a spell like yours. It seemed to throw me sideways into the door. Dr. really was of little help \"for me\" and it went away in time. But drinking coke or anything with caffeine is not wise for you and I to do. It is not good for anyone; let alone people with our problem.I am not going to even try and tell you for sure what your problem is. But I do know I get very ill when I do not eat (low blood sugar problems). And the pop with an empty stomach could have given you a double whammy. I would for sure see the dr. however. Just in case it is more than that. One has to make sure. :) Marie",

    "question": "Ok, I am an epileptic, There is a strong history of diabetes is my family, every member on my fathers side is or was diabetic. For the past few months I have been having sever dizzy spells. Spells that were so intense to me that the world seemed to spin out of control,I would have to catch myself from falling, my knees would go weak, i would get extreamly nauseated and want to vomit, I couldn't see clearly, and I would hear buzzing in my ears. These spells would last for about 10 minutes, then things would seem to straighten up for the most part.With the exception of my head would feel like it was full of air for hours.I blew the other episodes off. But when I had an episode today It really scared me due to the fact that I was in town and was alone. I had to sit in the store parking lot for a few hours because I was afraide to drive home. I realized that When it happened ( at 12:30 pm) I had not eaten or drank anything yet today. I drank a Coke and about an hour later I started to feel a bit better and was able to drive home.Could this be something linked to my epilepsy or possibly the diabetes that runs in my fathers side of the family? Or god for bid some all together new?",
