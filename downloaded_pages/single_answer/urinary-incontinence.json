    "question": "I'm a 32 year old, non-smoker, straight male that started having symptoms 5 weeks ago of urine leakage, weak stream, and the near-constant urge to urinate.\u00a0\u00a0The leakage was minimal and only during the day as it didn't cause me to have accidents or wake up during the night.\u00a0\u00a0In the mornings, I didn't have the urge to urinate and had to force myself to start after waiting for a few minutes.\u00a0\u00a0This lasted about 10 days before I saw my local doctor.\u00a0\u00a0The urine sample came back normal but I was prescribed Bactrim.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms cleared up within a day or two and I felt normal while I was taking the Bactrim.\u00a0\u00a0After finishing the prescription, the symptoms returned within 16 hours of taking the last pill, though not as severe as before taking the Bactrim.\u00a0\u00a0A week ago, I returned to my local doctor.\u00a0\u00a0They used the urine sample from this visit for a culture for the next 2 days.\u00a0\u00a0If something was found from this sample, I was going to be prescribed Cipro but it again came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, I was sent for an x-ray & ultrasound, which both came back normal, as well.\u00a0\u00a0I was instructed to drink plenty of clear fluids this week and if symptoms persist until the end of the week, the next step would likely be consulting with a urologist.\u00a0\u00a0I have no history of previous bladder/urinary problems at all.What could be causing this if my urine samples, x-rays, & ultrasound are all normal?\u00a0\u00a0Since nothing was found, should I be more worried or less worried about the possible causes?\u00a0\u00a0Since my symptoms lessened after taking the Bactrim (2 pills per day for 10 days), would a longer dosage help get rid of the symptoms for good?\u00a0\u00a0What about Cipro instead?",
