            "answer": "Hi!If you cannot maintain your balance, then you need to find the cause and treat it. There is a possibility that you have compression of a cervical spinal nerve. This can be detected by a MRI. The other possibility is wax in ear. This also causes tinnitus and because of differences in the pressure conduction due to blocked external ear canal by wax, you may have balance problems.\u00a0\u00a0The other possibility is ear disease like M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease and internal ear infection or labrynthitis.Loss of balance can also be due to diabetes with peripheral sensory neuropathy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, affect of certain medications, past head injuries, loss of foot\u2019s perceptions and sensibilities, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), joint weakness etc.Postural hypotension or BP falling with change of posture is another cause. Mini strokes, MS, high blood pressure, tumors or injury to cerebellum of the brain, syncopal attacks, severe anemia, and thyroid disorders are some of the causes for loss of balance.\u00a0\u00a0It would be a good idea to consult an ENT and your PCP to start with. If there is no problem in the ear, then you need to consult a neurologist. Take care!",
