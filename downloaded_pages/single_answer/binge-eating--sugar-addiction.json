            "answer": "You posted back in December so not sure if you'll see this but I also sure I have sugar addiction, it sends me in to awful mood swings, one minute I was happy the next sobbing and it was the end of the world, it was terrible.I realized I am so sensitive or whatever the word is to describe it, to sugar so I stopped, now I make sure to eat very healthy and just have the occasional treat which I am amazed that I can handle that, not go all crazy devouring everything in sight.I binged during the day but now I wake up to eat, I am sure it's from severe anxiety, I don't eat junk, it's usually a protein bar or some crackers and cheese, so I have to work on stopping that now, I am a normal weight as when I actually get up in the morning I'm not hungry.I can tell you, I had to make the decision to stop all the sugar.You mention you're doing A levels which is very stressful so this is probably why you're turning to the sugar, thing is though it's a terrible cycle, I would eat junk food and could not stop.Somehow you have to find something to ease the stress, the sugar makes us feel better for while so we crave that feeling, fill up on good food, I had awful withdrawal from the sugar but eventually I felt so much better avoiding it.I'm not saying I know it all, far from it! but I read your post and totally understand it, I was the same exact way.Eating all the sugar I swear I was a different person, that's scary.Hope you are okay.",

I just want to binge all the time and can't stay motivated to do any work Sugar has ruined my life and I've been having such horrible mood swings, one day I'm on top of the world the next I'm eating a whole pizza and 12 giant cookies and can't stop crying. Anyone understand?",
