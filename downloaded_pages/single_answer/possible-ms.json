            "answer": "Hello.It will be a good idea to ask for an MRI of the brain. Though we can not diagnose MS only on the basis of your symptoms, an MRI may help. If the MRI comes back normal, it does not mean negative for MS.MS has been a diagnosis of exclusion. Once other common causes are ruled out, one can think of MS. CSF examination can also throw some light on this.I would suggest you ask for an EMG and nerve conduction study.Regards",

    "question": "Ok, to begin, I am a 21 year old type 1 diabetic with high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently in grad school studying to be a pharmacist so that is kind of a load on my mind.\u00a0\u00a0I live 800 miles away from my family and g/f so thats just another piece of info.\u00a0\u00a0Now for the symptoms... about 1 and 1/2 months ago I experienced a burning sensation at the bottom of my left foot that would happen periodically throughout the day... I had my diabetic doctor look at and he said with my good control it is not due to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, the burning sensation stopped and my whole bottom left leg and foot had a slight tingling sensation.\u00a0\u00a0Then that eventually led to random body tingles that would happen at any point in the day and woulud last for a split second.\u00a0\u00a0I had a general doctor look at me and he said it was anxiety but I havent taken any medication yet.\u00a0\u00a0Now I have random muscle twitching that can occur at any part of my body but all of this seems worse when I am relaxed and thinking about it.\u00a0\u00a0There has been a spot on my head that was numb for a day or two but that is gone now.. occasionally my face gets tingly feeling.\u00a0\u00a0I have not experienced any muscle wasting or weakness and I don't notice the twitching when I am active. Everything also seems more pronounced on my left side but the twitches do happen everywhere.\u00a0\u00a0But anyway, I still have the muscle twitches and they will not cease it seems.\u00a0\u00a0I have a neuro appointment in less than a week but I was curious if this sounds like MS to anyone who knows more about this than i do.\u00a0\u00a0Any help is appreciated thanks.",
