            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Generally a high ANA titre indicates an autoimmune disease (SLE, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, scleroderma, polymyositis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, dermatomyositis). Other conditions with high ANA titre include primary biliary cirrhosis, Addison disease, Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Mixed connective tissue disorders also cause a high ANA. What is important is the pattern of ANA staining: homogenous, speckled, or nucleolar. Rheumatoid arthritis is more or less ruled out. Depending on the pattern of ANA staining, other antibody tests will have to be done. The pattern of staining itself is quite diagnostic (for eg in SLE a homogenous pattern is seen, nucleolar pattern in scleroderma and speckled pattern in ITP and mixed connective tissue disorder and in lupus). In your case, since you have a speckled pattern, it could be due to ITP, scleroderma, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, mixed connective tissue disorder or due to lupus. Please consult a rheumatologist for this. Also since liver enzymes are high consult a hepatologist. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "Ok I have always been sick a lot. Always told low immune system. Well I had a period where I had seizures for about 6 years (left temporal lobe misfire). It went away on it's own. I have went blind for a couple days once. I have frequent infections and pneumonias. My toe nails fall off often(not fungal has been proven). My kidney got very enlarged and almost had to have removed once out of the blue. I swell, have pain all over, and stomach aches. My feet turn purple and go numb a lot. I get hard, warm red knots in my shins often. My glands swell a lot. I have positive ANA's all the time. My potassium bottoms out as well as my blood sugar. And most recently I have been very sick with repeated flu like symptoms. The last episode lasted 5 days I was in bed thinking I just had ANOTHER flu I could not kick. Well husband made me go to ER. My liver panel was 5 times the norm. Ultrasound shows no fatty liver. Cholesterol is good. Hepatitis all negative A,B and C. Seeing a ton of specialist now to figure this out. They all say autoimmune qualities, but have no answers. GI did a endoscopy and colonoscopy this week to test for chrone's and ciliacs.Came back negative. I am 32 and sick in bed half the time. I need answers.",
