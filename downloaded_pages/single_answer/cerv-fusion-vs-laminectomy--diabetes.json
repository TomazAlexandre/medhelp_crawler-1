    "question": "my friend has had diabetes her entire life.\u00a0\u00a0she wears a pump.\u00a0\u00a0sorry dont know what kind of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0she has a pinched nerve c5-6 and is wondering what procedure would be more successful, laminectomy or fusion.\u00a0\u00a0her doc said fusion but didnt tell her the part about the graft.\u00a0\u00a0she is about early 40s and has been in continuall pain for over a year.\u00a0\u00a0has had multiple mis diagnoses such as carpal tunnel, and shoulder impingement in which both cases resulted in surgery (for naught).\u00a0\u00a0i told her a year ago she had a pinched nerve but the docs kept missing it.\u00a0\u00a0she is depressed and just wants the pain to end and resume her life wiht her family, working in yard is her goal.\u00a0\u00a0the diabetes makes her sick frequently.\u00a0\u00a0please give success rates for both procedures.\u00a0\u00a0i say laminectomy due to she can always have a fusion later if it doesnt work and no graft so less chance of non union at fusion site bu of course i am not a doctor only a PTA.\u00a0\u00a0what do you suggest?",
