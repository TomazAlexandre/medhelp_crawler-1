            "answer": "Hello,blood sugars in the 200s are not a good idea.I have two options for you to consider:-1. Try a very low carb diet and see if this is enough to prevent your blood sugars going up into more than the low 100s.\u00a0\u00a0You can work out which foods prevent you going high by trying different foods and seeing which make you high and which have minimal effect.2. Ask your Dr to start you on fast acting insulin (Humalog, Aphidra, Novalog) to be taken before eating (usually 5 - 15 minutes before starting eating).\u00a0\u00a0At this stage you would probably only need a low dose of this insulin and definitely it can stop you going so high.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would hope that your Dr would consider this considering that you are feeling debilitated by your symptoms of high blood sugar.",

    "question": "Due to undiagnosed hypothyroid I gained 75lbs over a few months. With this weight gain I was then diagnosed with diabetes type 2. I have since lost half of the weight and have been able to reduce my metformin.One dr tells me I will probably never be able to stop my metformin and an other states they think I could lose 10 more pounds and not take any meds for my diabetes. Really confusing.Question is: After I eat my blood sugars go into the 200s and this lasts a couple hours. I feel so confused and drunk during this time. Then my sugar goes back to a nice 80-100 bld sugar level. My A1Cs are great between a 5-6 every month.I really do not like this feeling and makes me plan my outtings so I dont get into trouble driving or being embarassed around others as my speech slurs. Is there anything I can do?I wish I knew if this was damaging me during these two hours.",
