    "question": "About 3 weeks ago I had a hemmorrhage in my Rt eye.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my retinal Dr who said it was a small hemmorrhage in the vitreous and it will clear up.\u00a0\u00a0He asked me to follow up in 3 weeks time which I did.\u00a0\u00a0I was given an eye test and I asked the nurse if there was any improvement and she said no it was the same.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I had noticed improvement.When the Dr came in the see me he said he was a little concerned as my vision had gotten worse since the first exam but it could be \"just the way eye where acting that day\"\u00a0\u00a0He looked in my eye and took pictures.\u00a0\u00a0There were no leaks or abnormal vessel growth but there was still blood in the eye.\u00a0\u00a0I asked if things would improve he said the blood will clear and he was hopeful the vision would improve as well.\u00a0\u00a0I pushed him again about my vision and this time his response was the hemmorrhage was small so it should improve.I read some articles on google and them seem to indicate that small hemmorrhages are not much of a problem.\u00a0\u00a0I have Myopic degeneration but the Dr said it is stable for now and I had a similar issue with my left eye 2 years ago and that resolved itself fine in about a month or two so the Dr think the rt eye should respond.I am on edge about my vision.. will I be ok? will my vision improve once the blood clears?\u00a0\u00a0I think I am seeing a little better as the cloudiness is little ligher and I am seeing things I could not see a few weeks ago but it is still a bit blurryThanksa little scared",
