            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Breathlessness on exertion could be due to the decreased lung function. Again in cardiac disorders the heart is unable to pump the blood adequately, more so when subjected to stress like exercise. The calf pain and altered sensation in the feet could also be due to decreased oxygenation. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. So please consult your primary care physician who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test to rule out a cardiac cause for the pain. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest. Lung function tests could further help in evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
