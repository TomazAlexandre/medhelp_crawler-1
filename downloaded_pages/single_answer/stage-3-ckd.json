            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. Besides, diabetes and hypertension, kidney failure can occur due to infections of the kidneys, some medications like pain killers and due to hereditary causes like polycystic kidney disease. Once kidney failure sets in, medications are given to reduce the blood pressure and to correct the anemia. When the renal function is below the optimal level then dialysis is initiated. At the end stage of renal failure renal transplant from a competent donor would be the therapy of choice.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I just found out I have Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease.\u00a0\u00a0My GFR is 43.\u00a0\u00a0Seems,\u00a0\u00a0though, my level has been low for at least 2 years - my doctor just never bothered to tell me.\u00a0\u00a0Last level was 52 in 2010.\u00a0\u00a0My BP has always been fine, and my glucose level has always been within the normal limits (usually low, actually), until fairly recently.\u00a0\u00a0I do have high cholesterol.For the past year I've noticed swelling in my ankles and feet, but no other problems.\u00a0\u00a0I have urge incontinence, but no other urinary issues.Wondering if catching this earlier might have made a difference, what could have caused it if my BP and sugar levels were fine, and what do I do now?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor told me (seriously) that he was not worried about it, that it would not progress, and totally blew me off when I brought the low GFR up to him.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn't even going to tell me about it.",
