    "question": "I have PCOS and have type 2 diabetes so my doctor put me on insulin. I feel like my readings are ranging from 148-220 before meals and I'm concerned that something will go wrong with the baby's development because they aren't getting lower. Anyone have this issue and what did you do? I'm on novolog and levemir (levemir is just at bedtime).",
