            "answer": "Yes, could be MS, and a neurologist can better make that diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0But could also be a circulatory problem or could also be diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes in particular will make it feel like you're walking on glass.\u00a0\u00a0And if your circulation isn't up to par, your feet will turn colors.\u00a0\u00a0As for your eyes, you did say you also had a twitch, which that can be caused by lack of good deep sleep.\u00a0\u00a0So, I think your general doc should test you for diabetes and also find out if for some reason the blood is restricted that goes into your legs.\u00a0\u00a0He should also look into your oxygenation levels, which is normally checked when they do your blood pressure.But now, the blurry eye that lasts all day, that COULD suggest MS, and, even tho your brain MRI came out okay, you could ask for a spinal MRI, too, sometimes you can have evidence of MS just in the spine, PLUS they can do a few other tests that might help confirm MS, because a small percentage of people can have MS with a perfectly okay MRI of brain and spine.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosis of MS is tricky, so could be your general physician should go ahead and refer you to a neurologist to determine if MS can be ruled out or in.But blurry eye, that could also happen from glaucoma readings getting too high, so an opthalmologist should probably be another doc you should visit.\u00a0\u00a0And then there's the possibility that IF you have been using, for example, a hydrocortisone type cream for a skin cut or whatever, if you get it in your eye, it can blur it up, plus it will make it feel irritated.\u00a0\u00a0Those are just a couple other things to look into.",
