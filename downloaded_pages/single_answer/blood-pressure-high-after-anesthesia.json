            "answer": "Actually you can have hypertension in the postoperative state.\u00a0\u00a0It can be due to many things but usually due to sympathetic stimulation (surgery activates the fight or flight response inducing increase levels of norepinephrine).\u00a0\u00a0This can lead to increased blood pressure on its own.\u00a0\u00a0Other things such as pain which you may not have been aware of, extra IV fluids given during surgery, hypothermia, etc can all cause postop hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0However, it would be very important to make sure that your blood pressure is not elevated at baseline because people who have even borderline elevated blood pressure are more prone to postop hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0I would check your blood pressure 2-3 times per day for a week or so and write it down in a book.\u00a0\u00a0Your blood pressure at all times should be less than 140/90 or if you are diabetes less than 130/80.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I am a 52 year old female. A couple of years ago I had a partial thyroidectomy and last year I had a routine colonoscopy. Both times after coming out of the procedure my blood pressure was high. After the thyroidectomy they put me on 5 mg of Lopressor to get it down before they released me. After the colonoscopy they just watched it for quite awhile before releasing me. My blood pressure is not high normally.After anesthesia, shouldn't my pressure be low? Can you give me reasons why it would be high. And should I be concerned.",
