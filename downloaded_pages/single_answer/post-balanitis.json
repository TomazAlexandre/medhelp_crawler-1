            "answer": "Hello,It looks like recurrence of balanitis. When balanitis keeps recurring, it may be caused by a yeast infection transmitted back and forth between partners during sexual contact. Other than it can be due to incomplete treatment or diabetes. You should get your partner\u2019s status evaluated and your partner also needs to use antifungals.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
