    "question": "For 2 weeks now my left hand has been slowly going all the way numb. It started with a few episodes of full numbness but with stretching it helped. Then it went to the pinky and ring finger going all the way numb and staying numb. Now it's to my middle finger and on the top part of my hand. I can't open packages and jars anymore, And the resting period of using my hand doesn't help. I have researched it and everything comes back to diabetes. Yes it runs in my family but I get checked every 6-9 months and it still comes up negative. I am really scared because I don't know what's going on and then when the cold chills start and the numbness in my left foot starts it scares me even more. IF anyone knows what's going on I wuold love to know. Thank you",
