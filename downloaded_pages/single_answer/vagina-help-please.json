            "answer": "Hi,How are you? What other symptoms are present? The peeling white skin may be attributed to candida infection. If there is no recent history of sexual contact, intake of antibiotics as well as underlying medical conditions like diabetes may be responsible. If it persists, further evaluation by a gynecologist\u00a0\u00a0is recommended. Take care and do keep us posted.",
