            "answer": "I've had issues like before. Never once was I pregnant. But after going to the doctor to find out why my period was so off, I got diagnosed with insulin resistance. With a healthy diet, exercise and a prescription to help control my blood sugar, my period started 2 weeks following treatment and been normal since, and was able to reverse the insulin resistance and prevented diabetes, along with losing 50 lbs. I recommend talking to your doctor and having yourself checked.",

    "question": "Hi! I'm 20 years old. I had my last period in March. My last day then was March 29. My period was like normal for a few months and then I'm gonna stop having for 2 months or miss it for like a week but before March, my period was normal for 9 months then I stopped having my menstruation again and this is the longest time in a while. In January 2012, my period was late for 6 months. That was the longest ever. It's July now and there are still no PMS symptoms or pregnancy symptoms. I took 2 PT's in June, both negative but my bf and I had sex twice (withdrawal) since I took the PT. I feel normal. No symptoms of anything, no fatigue. I just feel sleepy all the time which is pretty normal to me and I have heavy white discharge (I assume because of UTI). Help! I don't know what to do.",
