    "question": "I have had hashimoto's thyroiditis for over 10 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0Recently my tests have shown that I need more medication as they are at the bottom of the range.\u00a0\u00a0I have gained wt. but exercise and eat low carb. diet. I have been monitoring my glucose levels with a home meter which shows a.m fasting in the low 100's. My question is, with my thyroid hormones being too low, would that make my glucose numbers too high.\u00a0\u00a0I seem to be in the pre diabetes stage. I will see my Dr. next week. Should I wait and get my thyroid to normal levels before taking Metformin.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/478319\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/478319</a>.",
