            "answer": "First, get an FT4 and FT3 test. TSH is elevated, but it's a pituitary hormone. Treating the frees is the direct route for thyroid. The TPO indicates Hashimoto's disease. I suggest a thyroid ultrasound due to the fact that many Hashis have nodules. Usually, they are benign, but better safe than sorry. I have four, all benign, and all shrunk on thyroid hormone.For the Hashi patient, make sure to take Selenium (200 strength) once per day for the thyroid swelling and attacking antibodies.Next, make sure D-3, B12 and iron levels are checked and treated. Hashis tend to be low in those areas. Low D can make the patient feel miserable.People with Hashimoto's can also be low in adrenals. A 24 hour saliva test is a good way to test those adrenals. People with Hashi can also have other auto-immunities. Good that the ANA is negative, but it's common for Hashis to have a mild case of Sjrogen's or even develop diabetes.Finally, examine your diet. Some things can trigger those antibodies. Do an elimination diet and give up one thing each week to determine if you feel better. Consider, yeast, gluten, dairy, corn, wheat, caffeine, green tea...Hashis tend to do better on a high protein and veggie/plus low carb and sugar diet.Once you get your FT4/FT3 levels checked, treat those levels. You may also want to start on a low level hormone now and work up to a higher level every four weeks. Some endos drag their feet and bump up every 8-10 weeks. Usually, not necessary to wait that long.You have options for thyroid hormone replacement. Armour and Naturethroid are T3/T4 combos, plus a trace amount of T1 and 2. These hormones are made from pig thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0For the synthetic route, keep to brand names as they are more reliable. Many endos erroneously treat only FT4 levels and will only prescribe Synthroid to patients, which is a shame because we can linger with hypo levels if our FT3 levels aren't high enough, generally in the top 1/3. I take Synthroid and a T3 drug called Cytomel. That T3 drug eliminated many of my hypo symptoms.Take care...:) Tamra",
