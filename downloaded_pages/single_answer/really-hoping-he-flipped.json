    "question": "So ill be 35 weeks Wednesday and I go for an ultrasound to check growth due to my gestational diabetes and if my little boy is head down, hes been transverse on every ultrasound ive had. It makes me nervous because at a few days before 30 weeks they said he was already measuring over 5 lb. And that he may not be able to turn, ive always delivered vaginally and ive never had any kind of surgery or anything so having a csection is a terrifying thought.",
