            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for writing in this forum.Without examination,confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but there are various possibilities for your symptoms. These include lack of blood supply to the arms as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the numbness is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing such symptoms are brachial neuralgia, transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
