            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Since you have never had seizures and your present EEG is normal the possibility of epilepsy is negligible. As far as the white matter lesions in the frontal lobe are concerned they can occur due to aging, diabetes, migraine, high BP, chronic alcoholism, smoking, and MS and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.In your case it seems to be due to migraine. I would suggest you to go ahead and follow the advice of your doctor. However if you are not reassured it is best to consult a neurologist.",

    "question": "I am a 28 y/o white female that has had bilateral temple pain x10 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0I had abnormal EEG that stated a abnomal wave in my left nobe three yrs ago.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on phenobaratol 60mg bid and told that I have seizures because that is the only dx that is noted for any abnormal brain waves. since I have been on phenobaratol I have had no viecle accidents before I had started I would have at least three a year. No I have never had a seizure that I know of. I have recently changed doctors because of ins reasons. This new physian had me go and get a MRI then possibly another EEG. I revieved the results today. the doctor stated that I do not have seizure because I have never had one and the EEG is a false reading because of what the MRI stated. my past medical history is malnutrion and thrust at 4mths of age, Steven-johnson syndrome ( possible reaction to neosprin), 12-18yrs, two healthy pregency, galbladder removeal 03(glastones and infection), sinus surgery 07(allgeries, straten septum and dilated passages).My MRI states that there is a 3mm focus of high T2 sugbak within the white matter of the right frontal lobe seen on image #8 of the axial FLAIR weighted sequence. slightly farther superiorly and posteriorly is a 2mm lesion within the right frontal white matter on image #7 of the axial FLAIR weighted sequence. There is an additional 3mm lesion at the grey/white junction of the right frontal lobe on image #10 of the same sequence. These findings are non-specific in etiology. They do not have a distribution classic for multiple sclerosis but theoretically a very early demyelinating process could give an apperence such as this. Probably more likely given the pt history, is that these are related to migraine headaches. patients with migraine headaches have been shown to be prone to developing small subcentimeter white matter lesions such as this. there are no abnormalities on the diffusion weighted sequence to suggest that these findings are secondary to an acute ischemic process. there is no mass, hemorrhage,or midline shift. the sulei and ventricles are normal in size and configuration.\u00a0\u00a0The major expected arterial flow voids are present and appear within normal limits.\u00a0\u00a0The paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: MINIMAL NON-SPECIFIC WHITE MATTER DISEASE MOST LIKELY RELATED TO THE PATIEN'S HISTORY OF MIGRAINE HEADACHES. NO OTHER ABNORMALITIES ARE IDENTIFIEDMy new Doctor is now taking me off the phenobatatol and putting me of topamax. My question is should I request a consult with a neuro doctor and get his advice because now I have two very different dx and how do I know which one to trust and which one is right? Will a neuro be able to answer this question or do I need further testing or more trial and error?",
