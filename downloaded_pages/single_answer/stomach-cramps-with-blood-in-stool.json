            "answer": "No, the issues you have should not be tied in to diabetes. The blood could and at your age, is very common with hemmorhoids and fissures, however blood in stool should be diagnosed from a doctor. Have them check to make sure you do have hemmorhoids,etc.The loose bowel/cramps can be part of many GI issues. IBS, IBD, food allergies,etc. Again, your doc can determine what exactly is causing the issue.",

    "question": "Im a 23 year old male, within the last week my bowel movements have been abnormal. I have had stomach cramps and loose bowels to the point where i feel i will not make it to the restroom. I have also noticed an occasional tab of blood on my toilet paper and on 2 occasions this week red discoloring on my bowel movement. I am usually very regular, consistent bathroom goer. This week i have went more often and has been more strenuous then usual. I was wondering if this in anyway could be connected to diabetes which is common in my family. I was checked 2 years ago and it came back negative, or if it is related to a seperate stomach issue. Thank You.",
