            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms that you have described, chances of it being pityraisis versicolor are more. More elaboration of the symptoms and description of the rash is needed to list a few more differentials because without examination I cannot precisely make a diagnosis. Pityriasis versicolor is caused by a fungus that lives in the skin of almost all adults. Factors that can cause the fungus to become more visible include high humidity and immune or hormone abnormalities.Treatment involves topical and oral antifungal medicines.Hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing. Warm regards.",

    "question": "So my sister is 25 years old. She's got this weird thing on her skin. It's similar to what people who lose pigments in their skin have, but it's slightly different. My sister is white, and I know that condition usually happens in other races. She's really worried, but like me has no money for a doctor. it's been going on for a long time, and has spread all over. She says it's itchy as well. Is it possible it might be a side effect of organ failure? or diabetes? We're worried. If anyone can help we'd appreciate it! Thanks!",
