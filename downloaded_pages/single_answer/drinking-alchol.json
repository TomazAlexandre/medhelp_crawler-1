            "answer": "Alcohol can be very dangerous for diabetics because it can make us go very low. Also when you are drinking heavily you are not as aware of the need to test or to inject insulin. I don't know how recently your son was diagnosed, but young Type 1's go through a rough adjustment, especially in adolescence and often feel the need to \"rebel\" against the restrictions of being a diabetic. It's not easy to be different at that age!What probably will not work at all is to lecture and get mad. It will just put him on the defensive. If you generally have good communication you might try talking with him when he has not been drinking (it is pointless to talk with someone when they're drunk) and discuss the need to take care of his diabetes. Even though your desire is to say Don't Drink, if he is going to drink anyway you want him to remember to test, use his insulin and be sure and eat something with his drinks. He might also want to tell a friend what to look for when he is going low and to always carry glucose tablets with him. You might want to look up and print out some information for him to read. TuDiabetes.com is a great website that has lots of young Type 1's. He might be more inclined to listen to advice from them.Lastly if he is really doing this a lot and you don't feel he will listen, you might want to have him consider counseling with someone who knows about the issues of young Type 1 diabetics. There are a lot of emotions involved and talking can help.",
