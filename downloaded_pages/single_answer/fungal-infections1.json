            "answer": "HelloVarious reasons for recurrent or persistent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Treatment resistance can be overcome by applying a cream with a combination of antifungals (Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1% and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%) or using oral antifungals under a doctor\u2019s guidance. You should get it evaluated from a dermatologist and get your blood sugar levels checked.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have suffered from fungal infections on my groin, scrotum, and butt and anus for over two years now. I have used oxytate(spelling), clotrimazole, ketoconazole, store bought brands, powders, a lot. I even use clobetasol propionate once or twice a week on areas. Fungal infections seem to go away sometimes but come back very easily and usually are there in some capacity. I have had intense itching in or around anus, at night especially sometimes. I work out a lot and sweat a lot but clean myself and shower and powder myself all the time. My wife and i are considering having a new baby and a gonna start trying within days. Should i be worried about all the creams and ointments i have put on my body? Infection is kinda under control right now but flare ups happen almost everytime i work out. I am scared of the steroid clobetasol propionate affecting my sperm since i have used it on my groin, scrotum and anus recently. I have been on average using it once or twice a week down there alon or twog with ketoconazole everyday for month or two. Should i be worried about any bad things happening to my sperm or body? One more thing, i noticed when i sweat i have had my ph balance affected by the ketoconazole. I sweat and get a very bad sweat smell but way worse.",
