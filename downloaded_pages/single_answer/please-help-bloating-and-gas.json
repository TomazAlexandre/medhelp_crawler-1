            "answer": "Hi!Yes, gas, cramping etc can mean ovulation. However, they can also be due to IBS, Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, diabetes, food intolerance, malabsorption syndromes, constipation, gallbladder and liver problems, pancreatic dysfunction, or taking a diet rich in sulfites. Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber, dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. Hence these causes need to be ruled out.I suggest you buy an ovulation kit and try close to your ovulation date. Home pregnancy tests will be negative before your next period date. Only if you miss your periods, take a pregnancy tes. After stopping pills, ovulation takes some time to regularize. Hence monitor ovulation with the kit, and try close to it.Discuss this with your gynecologist. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been on the pill for 6 years and 3 months ago I came off it as my hubby and I want to start trying for a baby.On the 25/12/2011 I got my first normal period since going off the pill. It went on until the 29/12/2011. Now two weeks (or so) later I am extremely bloated and gassy for the last 2 days. Also expierencing constipation and small cramps in lower abs. Could this mean I am pregnany or more likely to be a sign of ovulation? Just about each month since we decided to start trying I have been doing home tests and always come back negative so trying not to get my hopes up but would love to hear your thoughts!Thanks!",
