    "question": "At my 21 week scan, the babys abdominal circum. was measuring about 2 weeks larger.\u00a0\u00a0All the other measurements agreed with the 21 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0There is a history of diabetes in my family (father type2, maternal grandmother type 2) . This is my second pregnancy, had the glucose tolerance test on my first pregnancy and was neg.\u00a0\u00a0My son was born 7lb 2oz, so normal weight.\u00a0\u00a0 I am thirsty alot.\u00a0\u00a0I did a blood sugar test with my dads home kit at 21 weeks and it was very low, 2.3mmol, had not eaten for few hours, and after a biscuit it was normal 5.1mmol an hour later.\u00a0\u00a0I know the GTT is done after 24 weeks, and will get my doc to do it then, but I am worried sick over all this.\u00a0\u00a0Would it not be the case my blood sugar should be high if gest diabetes is developing?\u00a0\u00a0Is it common enough for any measurements on an ultrasound to be larger with no complications?\u00a0\u00a0ThanksThis discussion is related to/posts/show/1256538.",
