            "answer": "None of us here are doctors, so I don't know if having Type I diabetes would affect HIV testing or not. But..........you definitely had a risk and need to test.If there is an HIV clinic or a Planned Parenthood near you, please go there and discuss this with the counselors ASAP. If there isn't, please see the doctor who monitors your diabetes. Please do not put this off any longer. Symptoms are never used to diagnose HIV, but you need to be seen.I wish you the very best",
