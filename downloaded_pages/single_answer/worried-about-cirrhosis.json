Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels.

    "question": "Hi,I am 33 years of age. 2 weeks agoi\u00a0\u00a0had my liver enzymes done and they came out as mildly elevated (less than 2x higher than normal). I have a history of drinking - no hard liquor but prob 5- 8 standard drinks a day (beer or wine)At the same time i did an ultrasound of the liver which showed mildly fatty liver.The doctor was unconcerned and said that if i lost some weight and stopped drinking for 6 weeks he would expect the enzymes to come back to normalMy question is this morning i noticed a reddish blemish under my eye (less than 1mm no veins / capillaries coming out of it) and am concerned it is a spider neviWith midly elevated liver counts and a \"fatty liver ultrasound\" does it unlikely that this blemish is a spider nevi caused by cirrhosis? Or should i get more tests done?Thanks",
