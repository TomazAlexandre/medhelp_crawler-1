            "answer": "The pain that you are experiencing may be due to problems in the shoulder or from the neck.Make an appointment to see the doctor again and ask for imaging to be done on your shoulder and neck.\u00a0\u00a0Problems in the neck bones can cause pinching and pressure on surrounding tissues and nerves which can cause referred pain.Do you recall doing anything in particular that may have triggered this off, like lifting anything heavy or knocking into a doorframe?\u00a0\u00a0You do not need to answer that, it is just something to think about.You may benefit with seeing a physiotherapist. Neck problems can radiate pain into other areas (shoulders, arms, hands and fingers) and the physiotherapist will be able to determine if your arm pain is related to issues in your neck.In the meantime, apply anti-inflammatory gels to the area and take pain relief medication as prescribed on the packet if you are able to take these.\u00a0\u00a0You may also find some relief with apply some heat packs to the area.\u00a0\u00a0If these worsen the pain, then try a cold compress.If you are constantly sleeping, get your doctor to check your iron and Vitamin B12 levels.\u00a0\u00a0Having arthritic problems, viral and bacterial infections will also make you feel tired.\u00a0\u00a0You can also ask your doctor to check whether you have any signs of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0People with sugar levels that are higher than normal can feel very tired.\u00a0\u00a0The sleeping may also be due to the medication that you are taking.",

    "question": "For the past couple of days the back side of my armpit has hurt like the dickens, I've had intermittent headaches,\u00a0\u00a0I'm constantly sleepy & pain radiates across my shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor did an EGG & that was fine. She gave me samples of Nalfon thinking it might be arthritis related,\u00a0\u00a0but nothing has changed including the pain. Do you have any ideas? I am a 61 year old male with Parkinson's disease, otherwise relatively healthy.",
