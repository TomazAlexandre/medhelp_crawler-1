    "question": "I had a panic attack while driving about 2 months ago. I have been dissassociating for about a year due to some extreme stress in my life (sexual assault) and those moments were terrifying me. Finally my body went into full panic mode when I was experiencing a dissassociating episode while driving and now I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. I am terrified to drive and when I have to I bring myself to panic. I keep trying to tell myself that I'm ok but it doesn't help. I am so scared that I'm losing my mind and feel like I can't control it. I have always been anxious but this is the worst. My doctor gave me a prescription for Celexa 20mg and Xanax (sometimes that is the only thing that calms me down enough to drive). I haven't taken the Celexa (I'm scared of the side effects). Does anybody have any advice? Thank you!",
