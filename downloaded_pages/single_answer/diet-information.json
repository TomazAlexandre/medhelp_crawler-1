            "answer": "Yikes, has your friend been to a dietician? Has her dr told her some of the obvious foods that would make her sick. Is the pancreatitis caused by her diabetes or gastroenteritis? Is she type II, non insulin dependent?The magic thing to say to try and fix all is avoid everything that makes you sick, but of course when everything makes you sick then what? Personally I think she should eat very small meals and a lot of them, due all her stomach issues. Eating small meals periodically through the day should also help keep her blood sugar in control. She might eat a little bit less than she should, but it might help her not get sick as often. Besides that the only advice I can offer is with diabetes you should avoid foods with a high glycemic index- these are mainly foods with added sugars- soda, foods that are highly processed- generic white bread or pasta, and foods high in starch- including potatoes. Also diet soda, no better for you. Fake sugars may not play as much with your blood sugar levels but it's still unhealthy and just junk. Besides all of that also foods with lots of fructose- so be careful with bananas, watermelon, etc. Fruits are good for you but in small quantities and if your blood sugar isn't controlled, you have to be very very careful with these. Aim more for fruits with less natural fructose in them.Besides that I'm unsure what will set off her tummy issues. It might help her to keep a food diary and not what, when, and how much she's eating and the reaction to it. It might also help her to experiment with eliminating some of the common foods that cause problems- dairy, wheat, gluten, caffeine, chocolate, nuts, fish, food dyes, high acidity, msg, and fake sugar.Hopefully that might help give her some ideas what to do. For now, just try to be a good friend and help her stay hopeful. It's very hard and depressing to not be able to go out and eat without getting sick. And it gets to a point where you just feel trapped inside your body and trapped inside your house. Also many days I feel like I never see any one because the only things people my age do is drink or eat and I can't do either- so make sure you find good activities that the two of you can do that don't push her out of her comfort zone or are dangerous to her health.",
