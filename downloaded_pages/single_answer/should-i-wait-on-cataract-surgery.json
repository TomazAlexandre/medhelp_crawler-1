    "question": "In 2006, I had cataract surgery on my left eye; soon thereafter, my retinopathy worsened, eventually leading to a vitrectomy.\u00a0\u00a0(I have had Type 1 diabetes for 42 years and am 63 years old.)\u00a0\u00a0Now a cataract in my right eye has reduced my vision to 20/50, and I have many annoying floaters. I realize that the floaters may be more visible after cataract surgery.\u00a0\u00a0(The left eye is almost 20/20).\u00a0\u00a0Since I am able to cope (teach full time), I wonder if I should risk having cataract surgery now or try to wait another year.\u00a0\u00a0My fear is that the cataract surgery will exacerbate my retinopathy.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any advice you can provide. Also, should I ask my surgeon about Avastin or similar products?",
