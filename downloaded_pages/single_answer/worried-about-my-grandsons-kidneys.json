    "question": "My 11 year old grandson complained of headache. His doctor checked his BP and it was high. So she did the urinalysis.\u00a0\u00a0It showed both blood and protein. So she a 24 hour urine collection, and it showed 4000 mg of protein. She said his kreatin was great, and that he has good renal function. Then she did an ultra sound.\u00a0\u00a0It looked normal.\u00a0\u00a0She says he has good renal function, and does not have diabetes.He complained of back ache when school started, but my daughter thought it was from the tremendously heavy back pack that he hauls back and forth to school.he has an appointment tomorrow am at 7:45 with a Pediatric Nephrologist who comes here from New Orleans.My question is this. Is there any more test other than a biopsy?\u00a0\u00a0I am crazy with worry. Do these symptoms and test always mean something critical?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for any encouragement.",
