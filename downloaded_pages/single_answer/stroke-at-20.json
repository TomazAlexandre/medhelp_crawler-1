            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.About \u2153\u00a0\u00a0of strokes which occur are in the younger age group. And this number is increasing due unhealthy habits like smoking, an increase in the diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia status in younger adults. What you had could be an ischemic stroke. If the primary cause, namely the lupus anticoagulant is inadequately controlled, then the thrombus formation can occur anywhere in the body. So, proper initiation and monitoring of anti coagulant therapy is mandatory.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
