            "answer": "Hi,This could be folliculitis, dermatitis, or allergic reaction. In most individuals there are outbreaks of folliculitis from time to time.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Patients with chronic unresponsive folliculitis may require investigation into the source of the infection. S. aureus bacteria can live in the patient's nostrils, periodically triggering a folliculitis outbreak.Individuals who are predisposed to folliculitis should be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months.If there any of the mentioned medical causes then treating those will reduce the occurence of the condition.http://www.dermatologychannel.net/follicle/folliculitis.shtmlSome stubborn cases of folliculitis have been responsive to laser-assisted hair removal. This process uses a laser to destroy the follicle. This reduces the scarring that results from folliculitis.Let us know if you need any other information and consult a skin specialist if the lesion is persistent.Regards.",

    "question": "I'm going to preface this by saying that my family has a history of bad skin. My mother has psoriasis, and that side of the family in general had some natural blotching.Anyway, the story begins a couple months back:I'm on a wrestling team at my university. I start noticing sores on either of my wrists. They puss and crack. Worse, the seem to be spreading. A couple of the other guys on my team do the same thing. One of them gets a doctor's appointment and gets diagnosed with staph infection. This sends everyone into a panic. After the news, I make the soonest appointment I can with my university's student health services....unfortunately it isn't soon enough.Prior to the appointment I had been treating the sores with a regimen of neosporin, over the counter anti-fungal cream, normal hand sanitizer, and bandages.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sores ended up closing, leaving behind a very VERY slight pink discoloration....barely noticable.\u00a0\u00a0I go to the doctor, and she says she can no longer really determine if it's staph because there's nothing to swab anymore. Just in case, she swabs the interior of my nose for ampicillin-resistant staph and prescribes me mupirocin cream.I apply the cream, and the discolorations get better....albeit they do not completely go away (I still have them).\u00a0\u00a0The test for the ampicillin resistant staph comes back negative. I go along my merry way.Fast forward:About a week and a half ago, I notice a grouping of small pimples around the front of my thighs. I am fairly sure they weren't there before. I immediately get scared and go online. After some research, I find out that staph infections can cause folliculitis...basically a normal pimple around the base of a hair.Is this a normal outbreak? Or should I get oral antibiotics for staph...and who should I go to for that? A normal doctor or a dermatologist?",
