            "answer": "I am no doctor. I have CTS Carpel Tunnel Syndrome. I worked as a Long Line Clipper on commercial fishing boats. Squeezing a long line clip as many as 12,000 time's a day. Repetitive motion injury's. Burning in the hands and forearms? The relief I have found was a bucket of Ice water to put both hands in when they woke me up. Fishing boats carry tons of Ice so I found it easy to soak my hands. Any Ice making refrige will be fine. Add some Salt to the water too. I used Salt water from the Gulf of Mexico, believe me, Salt your water too....I have not had any operations nor manipulations on this 46 year old body that my primary care doctor explained to me \" You wore out a body that should have lasted you 65 to 75 years in 46 years....\"\u00a0\u00a0An operation may or may not help. Get lots of opinions if you can and stay away from the Keyboard for a week and see how you feel then. Typing is may be the culprit with some of the pain too.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rocco",

    "question": "Hello, First and formost My husband will be going to the doctors this week, regardless how stubborn he is.. He had worked at a job for 11 years doing intricate work with his hands..but has since been truckdriving for the last 8 years. he suffers from occasional burning in his arms at nighttime when hes trying to sleep, and some nights he has to get up and shake his hands, arms tryin to get rid of this feeling, but lately he has awoken with his hands pretty swollen, I told him I thought it was either a pinched nerve in his neck/ shoulder from work or a shoulder injury he had few years back..I am concerned because I was just told this may be symptons of diabetes, dont know how true this is, but I also worry about a stroke. if you can give me just some examples of what this may be so i can inform him so he isnt so scared to go to the docs.. but trust me he is going if I have to drag him kicking and screaming..:) just want some insight on different areas we may have to explore..thanks in advance.",
