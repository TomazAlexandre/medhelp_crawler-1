            "answer": "Hi there!On the diabetic front, this could be a sign of low blood sugar (especially with the association of clammy/ cold sweat). In case the blood sugars have been found to be normal during such episodes, the headaches would need to be evaluated for by a general pediatrician.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "My 7 year old son has recently developed frequent headaches.\u00a0\u00a0He has been having severe headaches about two or three times a month that leave him not wanting to do anything but cry in pain and lay down.\u00a0\u00a0He has come home from school early several times due to the pain. The last time his teacher said that he was also feeling clammy like a cold sweat, but was not running a fever.\u00a0\u00a0My family has migranes and a history of diabetes, both juvinile and type 2, but with our migranes have never had sweating that accompanied them.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas about what could be causing the frequent headaches?",
