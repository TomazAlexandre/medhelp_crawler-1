            "answer": "I have Type II diabetes. I am on insulin and metformin. For the past six months or so, I have had an itchy scalp. It also feels like sandpaper. It itches the most, a few hours after I have washed my hair. When I went to cosmetology school, we used to use a pure cholesterol product on our hair and I was taught to apply it liberally all over my hair and wrap a towel on my head for about 1/2 an hour. I am going to try it and hopefully it will help. It's under $5 a jar, so it;s worth trying. I pray it helps. I haven't used it in years.",
