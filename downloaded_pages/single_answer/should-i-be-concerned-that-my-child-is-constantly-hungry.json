    "question": "My little girl is almost 6 and she has always been in the lower percentile on the growth chart at the drs., but otherwise healthy. In September of this past year she grew from wearing a clothes size 4 to now wearing a 7.\u00a0\u00a0Great!\u00a0\u00a0It was a shock to everyone that saw her-she was always a peanut. . But, I do feel that now she is in a \"bad habit\" of eating.\u00a0\u00a0She is not overweight...but, she will eat a full meal-while looking at my plate and asking me to save her some of mine.\u00a0\u00a0Then 30 minutes after 2 helpings, she is in the kitchen literally crying that she \"needs to eat\".\u00a0\u00a0In the beginning I had\u00a0\u00a0a hard time denying her food.\u00a0\u00a0Now I try to do healthy snacks.\u00a0\u00a0Rice cakes, apples and granola bars-things like that. But she is relentless.\u00a0\u00a0She would eat herself sick if I let her. But, my fear is that she can eat herself into a health problem.\u00a0\u00a0 Can she over eat for a long period of time and develop diabetes or another health problem-even though she isn't technically \"fat\"?Thank you,Chrissy",
