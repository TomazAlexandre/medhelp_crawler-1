    "question": "Hello,My opfhtolmologist found the crystals on the cornia of my both eyes. So far I did a blood test and verything is normal. I did minerals's test today and waiting for the results.I have two questions:Is it nessessary to make all those other test as previous person asked - MRI, bone marrow biopsy at this stage?I read the link offered by doctor John C. Hagan III. And one of the causes could be \"local defects of lipid methabolism\". Is is treatable? And the fact that I am overweighted could contribute to this problem?Thank you",
