    "question": "I just read that comedian Jerry Lewis passed away today at 91 of natural causes- you may or may not know this, but he had Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It's so sad that he passed, but isn't it awesome to see that someone with type 1 lived a long and I'd venture to say full life?\u00a0\u00a0Just wanted to post about him as a little encouragement that your type 1 diagnosis isn't the end of your life- it's a complication you have to manage, but you can do it!RIP Jerry",
