            "answer": "Hi!There could be many causes of gas in abdomen or lower stomach. If you have diabetes, it can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence get your blood sugar tested. It can also be due to excess consumption of food rich in sulfites like juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough. Constipation can also cause bloating. Very sedentary lifestyle is another cause. Also if you have IBS or acidity, it can cause bloating and gas. Walking around will help clear some gas. Check and see if you are eating something that is causing gas. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
