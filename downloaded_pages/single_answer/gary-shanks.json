            "answer": "Hi!Do you suffer from diabetes? If yes, then you have uncontrolled blood sugar. If you have not yet been diagnosed with diabetes, then go about seeing a doctor and running blood tests to confirm this.Then you will need to take medications as prescribed by your doctor, regularize your meal size and time, quality of food you eat, and you need to exercise.Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
