    "question": "Thanks for taking my question.Where do I start? I am a 32 year old female. About 8 years ago I was put on high blood pressure medication. I was about 24 at the time. My doctor could not figure out the reason for my elevated blood pressure since I do not have any of the risk factors and follow a pretty good active/healthy life.\u00a0\u00a0 I was able to stop the high blood medication because my blood pressure had returned back to normal after about\u00a0\u00a01 year. About\u00a0\u00a01 year later\u00a0\u00a0I was put on Paxil to treat my anxiety. It worked very well for about 2 years then it stopped working. I did not want to increase the dose since I had done extensive research on the effects of ssri's. Well then about 2 years ago I was diagnosed hypothyroid. and a year later with pre diabetes/hypoglycemia and my elevated blood pressure came back. I decided to research a way to safely stop the Paxil, since\u00a0\u00a0I had tried before with horrible withdrawal symptoms. SO after about a year and half of weanning I did it.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure is still high, I am still pre diabetic and have hypoglycemia, my thyroid levels still have not returned to normal, and my panic attacks still come and go. My doctor has ran many tests to try and figure out where all this is coming from, but he still does not know. I exercise 5- 6 times a week eat a vey healthy diet, do not or have ever smoked I am only 32 years old I don't have a family history of any of the things that I have been diagnosed with. I am so frustrated because of all these things that are wrong with me. I guess my question is could all of these things be caused by one thing such as endocrine disease and how is that diagnosed and treated. I am sorry for the long post. Hope to hear from you soon.Thank you,Iceman97",
