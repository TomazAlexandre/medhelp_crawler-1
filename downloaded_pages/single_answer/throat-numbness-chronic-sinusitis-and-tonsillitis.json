    "question": "I am a 40 year old woman with chronic tonsillitis, tonsilliths, and sinusitus since I was young. 2-3 times a year, I get throat infections (which have included strep A, Strep C, and HIB infections). I still have my tonsills. I have had recurrent muscle tension headaches and migraines for the past 20 yrs. I had a hysterectomy/ovary removal in January. Went for 9 months without HRT due to endometriosis. Recently started HRT. During the past 4 months, have suffered from facial numbness, throat numbness, a feeling of a \"lump\" sensation in my throat, and tinnitus. I have recently had numbness in the back of my throat, w/some problems with swallowing and speech (my tongue gets tired). The numbness, etc seems to correspond with my facial numbness. Allery testing negative. Sinus/throat exam showed enlarged left turbinate, deviated septum, \"allergic\" response on the right side of sinuses, & tonsillitis. Brain MRI normal, except a few white spots on frontal lobe, which Dr. believes caused by migraines (spots unchanged for 5 years). Neuro testing/EMG OK, except minor sensory deficit in feet (herniated disc). Uvula deviates to the left. Throat more swollen on right. Thyroid tests, diabetes, myasthenia gravis, lupus, RA, multiple sclerosis, protein electrophoresis, hearing tests normal. Iron levels normal, mildly low ferritin, elevated transferrin. White blood count normal, but on low side. Any ideas what could cause the throat numbness? Is it related to estrogen/hormones? Blood counts? Could it be anxiety and/or depression? Neurological? Any suggestions appreciated. Will be seeing ENT",
