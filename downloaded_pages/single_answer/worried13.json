    "question": "Over four years ago i had sex with a transexual on holiday. I did use protection but performed oral without but she did not cum. Ten weeks later i got\u00a0\u00a0a flu like illness but not like any i had before, with a very sore throat, m ograinne like headache etc. I had various vague symptos for months after this, dry mouth etc and i thought i may have had swollen lymph nodes but not certain. Now i still get some symptoms, like tiredness, sometimes a tingling in my legs, feet and hands and sometimes i get very small red dots on my lower legs for a few days. Sometimes i get very tired for a few hours. , I also at times get some redness of the skin on my chest and have a red patch near my neck which is always there but gets darker at times. My basic question is, is would i have such on'off symptoms for years after if i am HIV or is it more possible i have something like diabetes.",
