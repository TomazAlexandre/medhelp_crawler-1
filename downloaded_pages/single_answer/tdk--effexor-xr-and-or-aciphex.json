            "answer": "Your questions really need to be handled by a medical professional, we're not\u00a0\u00a0equipped to make any remote guess and what you should do. I would sit down with your family doctor and go through all of your meds. I think when someone has more then one specialist on board, the primary care physician should be apprised of all meds.I have erosive GERD and moved over to pariet, which I think is Aciphex from Nexium due to the cost, as I have to take a high dose - my insurance company wouldn't cover the drug so it was 120/mo - the pariet is only 20/mo.\u00a0\u00a0Bruxism has many causes including anxiety which can become a compulsive behaviour, Zoloft is notorious for causing bruxism as well. Maybe research all of your meds then sit down with your doctor, it could be from any of or a combination of all the drugs you are on or none of them. It's good to get a full yearly check-up as well.Much luck,LCC",

Which drug should I stop first to determine which is causing the problem?\u00a0\u00a0I have been on Effexor for over 5 years, the Aciphex probably as long.\u00a0\u00a0The dosage was increased to 225mg about a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0I am 60, still work and can not face my patients (mental health worker) looking like a snake!",
