    "question": "Hi,My husband 36yrs woke up with a distorted,super imposed vision. We took him to ER, the Dr's performed blood test for diabetes, MRI and MRA. All tests came back normal. Blood pressure was also in normal range. We were referred to an Opthamologist who did field test on the eyes and said everthing is normal. Only reason they could relate to is his migraines (which he has now and then).His left eye when he is moving to the left is stuck in the middle and doesn't move. The opthamologist has told us it is Sixth nerve palsy and would take 3 months to recover. Does patching of the left eye help? How can we do to make the recovery faster? Are there any vision therapy or eye exercises that can be done? When would the vision start to get better.What are our options? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks",
