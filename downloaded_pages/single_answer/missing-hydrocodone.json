            "answer": "there are many possible causes for what you describe.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not clear which medications are showing up and which are not showing up but a lot of that depends on the particular test and the particular laboratory and or or the amount of drug in the bloodstream.\u00a0\u00a0The medication is not used up by the neurons that control pain so I do not believe the explanation you are thinking about will be helpful to you.",

    "question": "My daughter is Bipolar-I with schizophrenic tendencies. She also has cervical cancer along with a variety of joint problems. She's prescribed Lortab, Xanax, Paxel and Soma. She is having trouble with Children Protection Services and taking drug tests almost weekly and her meds are not showing up. She's taken both urine and hair follicle tests but nothing EVER shows up.I had a similar problem years ago with Lithium. After taking 900mg/day for six years, it never built up to a therapeutic level ultimately developing drug induced diabetes. They've prescribed me physic meds for my nerve neuropathic pain.My question, \"Is it possible that physiological needs are grabbing up the remaining medication left behind by the pain relief?\"",
