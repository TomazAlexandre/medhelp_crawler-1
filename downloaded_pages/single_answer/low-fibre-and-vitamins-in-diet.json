            "answer": "Hello!A low fiber diet can lead to a condition called hemorrhoids .These are swollen veins in the anal canal. They can cause pain if they bulge out or are squeezed by the anal muscles.Haemorrhoids are usually seen during straining for stools. A high fiber diet may soften stools and ease the pain. Anal itching can be due to yeast infection, diabetes, worm infestation, haemorrhoids, anal fissure etc.Suppuration, thromboembolic phenomena, fibrosis, infection and fibrosis are few of the complications of piles if left untreated. I will advise you to drink plenty of water and take a high fiber diet. Do keep us posted.Good luck and regards",
