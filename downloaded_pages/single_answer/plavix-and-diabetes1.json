    "question": "Posted By Ken on August 08, 1998 at 17:05:59:I'm a 33 year old who has just suffered his third MI in two years.\u00a0\u00a0After this last attack, I had two angioplasties and two stents.\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, I was placed on Plavix (along with several other medications that I was already taking).My question:\u00a0\u00a0Are there any indications of Plavix causing hyperglycemia in insulin-dependent Type I diabetics?\u00a0\u00a0For me, taking Plavix in the morning caused a precipitous rise in my blood glucose levels that required very large amounts of insulin and at least four hours in order to bring to acceptable levels.My suspicion of Plavix is due to my having been a diabetic for 15 years and knowing my body and my symptoms very well.\u00a0\u00a0Plavix was the only new drug that I was taking in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0My endocrinologist doesn't think it should cause a problem, but I'm not so sure.For the last three days, however, I have been waiting until evening (with cardiologist's permission) to take my Plavix.\u00a0\u00a0By evening my blood sugar levels are better under control and I have a larger amount of insulin already at work in my body.\u00a0\u00a0The Plavix is only causing a very small rise in blood sugar levels when I take it at evening like this.I hope I'm not just confusing cause-effect with coincidence.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone knows of any studies, or anecdotal evidence, or pharmacological reasons, for this hyperglycemia, please post a response.Thanks.",
