            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0First of all, is the insulin you're using expired or possibly go bad?\u00a0\u00a0That's usually the first thing we try with unexplained highs, so try changing to a different vial of insulin.Second, no matter what you still need to bring him down from the high.\u00a0\u00a0If you're sure that the insulin is good, then is he spilling ketones in his urine?\u00a0\u00a0The treatment for that is different than if he's just high.\u00a0\u00a0If he's not spilling ketones, just figure out the right dose from whatever his correction factor is.\u00a0\u00a0That's the ratio of insulin needed to lower blood sugar scores by a set amount.\u00a0\u00a0There is a calculation that is different from a normal carb bolus, and the differences are explained pretty well here, along with a way to come up with that factor on page 16.http://www.cozmore.com/ous/Library/upload/Insulin_to_Carb_p14.pdfIt take an hour to see if the correction is working, as your doctor notes, that's when the insulin begins to peak.With ketones there is an additional amount of insulin needed based upon the amount of ketones being spilled.\u00a0\u00a0If you need info on that, let me know.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
