            "answer": "From your measurements, his weight is very much above the 95th percentile for his age. For his age he needs approximately 1800-2000 calories a day to grow. If he is hungry between meals, suggest snacking on NO-calorie or very low calories foods such as diet jello, salad with very little dressing, fruit, or 1 cup air popped popcorn. Limit time in front of the TV/DVD or non-active-video games. There have been studies showing the longer the length of time a child sit in front of the TV, the greater the weight gain. Additional suggestions: cook only low fat meats (chicken, fish, loin of pork) or non-meat sources (soy products, nuts), low fat vegetarian combinations (rice & beans, pasta & beans, low fat cheese & pasta), fat free or low fat dairy products (skim milk, 1% milk, low fat cheese, low fat yogurts, low fat soy milk/yogurt), use plant oils, non trans-fat margarines, and eat a lot of fruits, salads, and vegetables. Eat daily high fiber breads and cereals (oatmeal). Suggest increasing his physical activities\u00a0\u00a0per week and daily if you have to. He can walk, dance, or play outside. Have him help you cook simple healthy foods so he learns how to eat right. Make everything fun so he will enjoy living healthy. Hoped this helped you.",
