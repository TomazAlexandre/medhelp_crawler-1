            "answer": "Hello.Do you have any other symptoms apart from the pins and needles ? If your LDH one was more than LDH 2, it suggests some heart problem. An LDH of 357 is slightly above the normal range and is probably not clinically significant. A cardiologist may be able to judge it better.If there are no such problems, I suggest you check your blood sugar levels for Diabetes. Diabetes can cause neuropathy which can give rise to the symptoms you have.Can you mention your age and any other physical illness you might be having ?Regards",
