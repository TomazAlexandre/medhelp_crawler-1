            "answer": "Hi!Drink plenty of fluids and water. Keep a trough of water or use a humidifier at home in your rooms. You can apply petroleum jelly and glycerine on your body at bed time. When choosing a moisturizer, look for oil-based creams and ointments. Fresh juice of tomato, cucumber and orange can be applied or taken daily. Fresh cream too can be applied on body.If these tips do not help, chances are that the dryness is due to underlying skin conditions like dermatitis, psoriasis etc. Vitamin A deficiency, hypothyroidism, Sjogren's syndrome, and diabetes too can cause dry skin. Hence these should be ruled out. It may sound strange to you but extreme dryness is a sign of hormonal imbalance due to polycystic ovary or menopause (not in your case \uf04a) too. You would need to consult a skin specialist or your GP. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
