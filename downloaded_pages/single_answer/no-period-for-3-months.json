            "answer": "Hi I'm 21 and have been dealing with abscesses for a year, I've gotten one on my arm, 6 on my buttocks, 4 on my thigh area, and 1 in the pubic area. They said it was a staph infection but no one can tell me why it keeps happening, so I'm going to see a different dermatologist and see what he says, I'm just glad to see I'm not the only one with this problem, I have also had one abscess drained and felt everything I thought I would die, so now I only go to my primary care doctor who drains them and I don't feel a thing, but I just wanted to know if anyone was diagnosed with an underlying condition ie diabetes, cancer, aids etc because they say that could be causing them?",
