    "question": "im not sure where to put this question but due to my background i'll put it here. about 4/5 yrs ago i recovered from anorexia. lately i was struggling with how much weight iv put on and i skipped a couple of meals to try and lose a bit of weight. I am by no means underweight, but im prob about average for my height. anyway after that iv been eating better again, but today i started to feel really faint and lightheaded and i couldnt stop shaking uncontrollably! I checked my blood sugar because iv got a meter at home, and it was 2.1 which is really low. i dont know if maybe it was the past few days catching up with me. but i would have thought i should have some reserves, and also it has happened before when i havent restriced at all and been eating normal, and iv suddenly come over all shaky and faint. does anyone else get like this?",
