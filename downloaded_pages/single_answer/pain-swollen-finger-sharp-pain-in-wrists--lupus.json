            "answer": "Hey Vickie, welcome to the forum.Catabolic steroids (they break down muscle/tissue), like prednisone and cortisone, and can have serious side effects, including high blood pressure, diabetes, increased risk of infection, cataracts, osteoporosis, muscle weakness, deposits of fat in chest, face, upper back, and stomach, changes in appetite, weight gain, water retention and mood changes.You may be on prednisone already as it is prescribed for Lupusand now you doctor suggesting cortisone shots, for something likelycaused by drug side effects and unresolved Lupus causative factors,is typical but as you said ...only a temporary fix and not without consequences.You owe it to yourself, after all the years of suffering, to look into unregulated or under-regulated hypothyroidism (see a thread here under \"Low T7\" on july 18), other\u00a0\u00a0hormonal imbalances, adrenal fatigue, nutritional deficiencies and methylation issues.- I suggest you consider researching MTHFR gene mutation, specially if you have low methylocobalamin (neurological B12) and low 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (neurological folate). A serum blood test does not reveal these deficiencies-you may have high levels of the unmethylated formsof these vitamins- so you need a Homocysteine CSF test to detect them.If you need any details, let me know.I hope this helps, however, my comments and suggestions are not intended to replace medical advice.Best wishesNiko",

    "question": "Hi; I've have had SLE for over 35\u00a0\u00a0years,this is a new pain. This new pain started a few months ago.I started having swollen hands,fingers and wrists with numbness and pain on both hands/wrists.However,my right is far worse.Then,started getting a sharper pain almost feeling like electric shock in my wrist.(at different times).The pains from my right wrist feels like its spreading up into my neck. I've tried hot and cold,also tried rubbing,I can't do that long at all..after 1 min (maybe) my whole arm really hurts and then feels like its 100 lbs. for a few minutes.I've read recently that 'carpal tunnel' is also another ' piece' of\u00a0\u00a0Lupus. Could these symptoms be lupus?Do you think I should contact a specialist/surgeon? My doctor seems to think cortisone shots in the wrists will help. But that is only a temporary fix.",
