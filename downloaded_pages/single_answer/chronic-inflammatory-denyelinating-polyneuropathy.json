            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.There are 2 types of nerves in our body, large and small. The small nerve endings supply the skin and sweat glands. There are two types of sensory neuropathy: small fiber and large fiber (depending on the size of the nerves affected). With small fiber neuropathies, symptoms include burning or buzzing or other vague symptoms starting in the feet and hands then in some cases spreading to other parts of the body. The EMG/nerve conduction studies (NCS) (tests done to check for neuropathy) will not show an abnormality, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a skin biopsy so that the number of nerve endings can literally be counted. There are other tests of the function of small nerves that can be ordered, such as QSART testing which looks at how much sweat the skin makes, since sweating is in a sense of function of these small nerves. There are several causes of small fiber neuropathy, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune problemsThe other type of sensory neuropathy is called a large fiber neuropathy. Sensory neuropathies can involve just one nerve or several nerves in the body. The symptoms are sensory loss and if motor nerves are involved, weakness occurs. Some types of sensory neuropathies occur and progress very slowly, others sort of wax and wane (with flare-ups) and some are progressive. One of the most common causes of neuropathy is diabetes, and sometimes only glucose intolerances, or abnormal rises in blood sugar after a glucose load can be the only indication (this is called a oral glucose tolerance test. Other causes include but are not limited to hereditary/genetic causes (such as in a disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth, in which there is a family history of sensory neuropathy usually from an early age associated with other clinical features such as high-arched feet), autoimmune problems (such as lupus (SLE), Sjogren's, Churg-Strauss (in which asthma also occurs), polyarteritis nodosa, which affects blood vessels), and demyelinating diseases (such as CIDP). Vitamin B12 and B6 deficiency, as well as excess vitamin B6, can also cause neuropathy. Some toxins, such as lead, arsenic, and thalium can cause large fiber sensory neuropathy. Other causes include abnormalities of protein metabolism, as in a type called amyloidosis or monoclonal proteinemia. In many neuropathies, both the sensory and motor nerves (the nerves that supply the muscles) are involved, leading to sensory symptoms as well as weakness.The diagnosis of large fiber neuropathy is made by findings on a test called EMG/NCS which assess how well the nerve conduct electricity and how well muscles respond. Rarely, in some cases a lumbar puncture provides useful in formation, and very rarely a nerve biopsy is required.The same processes that affect large fibers can affect small fibers. For example, diabetes can typically do this.Treatment for neuropathic pain (pain coming from nerves) includes gabapentin and pregabalin, and medications such as amitriptyline (which is an antidepressant but has actually been found to be helpful with neuropathic pain as well). If you are not getting much relief from the gabapentin, you should discuss with your physician your dosing.You should follow up with a neurologist who specializes in neuromuscular medicine.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "Over the past couple of years I have acquired a few health conditions (note:\u00a0\u00a0I did not have any of these prior to that time).\u00a0\u00a0Late 2009 I started getting heart palpitations.\u00a0\u00a0June 2010 my lower legs started swelling and it has now moved upward to my upper legs, belly, arms, and sometimes my head.\u00a0\u00a0I have severe edema at times, but regular edema is there all the time.\u00a0\u00a0In June 2010 I was biking 16-miles a day with NO PAIN in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0In August 2010 the bottoms of my feet became sensitive and by November they hurt when walking.\u00a0\u00a0To date, the bottoms of my feet are numb, toes are numb, but both are very painful too.\u00a0\u00a0Hurts to cut toe nails because of numbness but yet pain.\u00a0\u00a0When I take off my shoes and put my feet up I have to have a pillow under them otherwise the heels hurt on the backside of feet.\u00a0\u00a0But then I get up to walk.....I can't!\u00a0\u00a0The ball of my feet and heels are VERY painful.\u00a0\u00a0The ball of my feet, especially right foot, are BIG and hard and hurt.\u00a0\u00a0At night I have to crawl like a dog to the bathroom and then I have to try and get up on my feet (OUCH) to get up on toilet....I can't put pressure on any part of my feet.\u00a0\u00a0My bladder has gone wild too.\u00a0\u00a0I have to go all the time and at times I lose it before I can make it.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy at the Mayo December 2010, but nothing on the swelling.\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms were looked at separate, but why did they all come on around the same time?\u00a0\u00a0Should they not be looked at as having one underlying condition causing them all??\u00a0\u00a0I just ran across a profile card from a neurologist who had \"Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy\" as one of his specialties, could this be what I have?\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, this doctor retires in one month so I cannot see him.\u00a0\u00a0I have search for another doctor in the area, but no luck.\u00a0\u00a0I live in Minnesota.\u00a0\u00a0Please give me your input because I am not getting any positive info that is helping me.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking Cymbalta & Neurontin, but they haven't done anything.",
