            "answer": "Dear BigRon, welcome to the medhelp forum. I can understand your anxiety related to these multiple symptoms. Trauma to the affected foot causing nerve irritation could be one and needs clinical examination and radiological exclusion. This could be due to compression of tibial nerve as it passes through the tarsal tunnel in the foot. This can happen if you have varicose veins or swollen, corrugated veins due to damage venous valves. Clinical examination and nerve conduction study may be required. There are certain systemic causes, which can affect both the feet like vitamin deficiencies like B6, B12, B1 and niacin need to be assessed as per history of malnutrition and serum levels. This could also indicate thyroid disorders, liver and kidney dysfunction. Neuropathy secondary to alcohol abuse and diabetes are important causes of burning sensation in both the feet. Headaches with tinnitus could be due to ear infections, rhino sinusitis, or earwax. Headaches like migraines can also be associated with tinnitus. Thickening of voice needs a detailed examination and testing for hypothyroidism.If these were ruled out, you would require a neurological assessment and checking for criteria of MS diagnosis.Wishing you all the luck. Take care.",

    "question": "I have had burning tingling\u00a0\u00a0feet (mainly on the left foot)\u00a0\u00a0for 15 years now.\u00a0\u00a0In the last 9 months, it has been accompanied by headaches and tinnitus. The tinnitus is mainly ringing in the left ear, but occurs in both ears.\u00a0\u00a0I also notice that I sometimes get a gravely voice in the afternoon. This does not happen every day.\u00a0\u00a0 At first, I thought the thickening in my throat and gravely voice may be an allergy, but now I wonder if the neuropathy, the tinnitus,\u00a0\u00a0gravely voice and headaches are related.A good rest helps the condition as does limiting stress.\u00a0\u00a0 I do take alpha limpoic acid, aloe juice, along with a good multivitamin.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0eat pretty healthy with a diet with little grease.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I exercise 5 to 6 times per week.\u00a0\u00a0The condition makes me anxious and I have a difficult time concentrating.Is everything directly related? If they are or are not, what may be a solution to either cure or ease the annoyance?Any input would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0 By the way, I am mid 60's\u00a0\u00a0Thank you,",
