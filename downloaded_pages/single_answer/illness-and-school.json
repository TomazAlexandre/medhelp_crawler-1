            "answer": "Hi!I am not sure why you are having pain, but to carry on with school, you need to control this pain. Common causes of body pain are fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, electrolyte disturbance, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or Lyme or lupus. If no cause is found then eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of fluids and counseling will help. Please ask your parents to follow this up with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I'm 14 in the 8 th grade and have been sick all year. I've only been to one full day of school all year. The doctors aren't sure what's wrong with me but I'm in extreme pain constantly to the point of screaming. I have to go to school through. My school has worked with me and have made it so I only have to go to 3 classes a day. To you it seems like nothing but to Me it's terrible. I'm in pain can't concentrate can't do anything to help it. I am going to 6 subject a week. But I don't go to every class so I am behind in everything. I'm failing 3 of the subjects. I miss at least 2 classes of each a week. While I'm there I'm constantly thinking about the pain. I fail tests because I won't know about them. I'll miss papers and important information. I have failed 2 classes first quarter and 3 second quarter. What can I do? I can't fail the grade. But I'm just not there mentally and physically enough. How can I pass the grade?",
