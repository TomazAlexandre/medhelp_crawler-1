            "answer": "Hi!Burning and tingling at tip of penis is usually due to a STD or due to prostatits. So, get semen analysis and a STD panel (gonorrhea, chlamydia, mycoplasma, ureaplasma urealyticum, trichomonas, syphilis and herpes).\u00a0\u00a0If STD is totally ruled out, then the tingling or sticky sensation and burning\u00a0\u00a0you feel at the tip of penis can be due to an allergic reaction (say to body lotions, condoms, soaps etc) or it can be a skin condition like eczema, dermatitis etc or it can be a fungal infection. Other than that it can be a simple bacterial infection or balanitis. Frequent rubbing of clothes on a hypersensitive tip of penis can often keep it stimulated and cause increased semen volume. Get yourself tested for diabetes as presence of this can cause mild infection. It can also be a skin tag or hair causing irritation to the tip.\u00a0\u00a0If all these are ruled out then a peripheral artery disease (by dopplar ultrasound) and a peripheral nerve disease will have to be looked into. I have enumerated all possibilities as a confirmed diagnosis is not possible on net. Please discuss these possibilities with your urologist and I sincerely hope something is caught and you get the right treatment. Hope this helps.
