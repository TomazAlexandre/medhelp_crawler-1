            "answer": "I too am trying to figure out a relationship with inguinal or other nerve branches, back pain, and Pancreatic function.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed as a Type I Diabetic at 42 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I was a tightly controlled, brittle Diabetic, that all Endocrinologists I ever had stated to me I was the best controlled Diabetic patient they ever had.\u00a0\u00a05 years ago, my \"Metabolism changed\" and my long acting Insulin (Lantus) started wearing out after 20 hours.\u00a0\u00a0I would go to bed 100 wake up 400.\u00a0\u00a0This caused 3 hospitalizations for Diabetic Keto-Acidosis (DKA).\u00a0\u00a0They split my Lantus into AM/PM Dose adjusted my Insulin ratio.\u00a0\u00a0This worked for about 4 years, and suddenly this January - February I started having reactions to my Lantus, resulting in multiple severe, near death episodes of Hypoglycemia (unlike a normal low, these would come in waves, cause seizure like symptoms, and last up to 3 hours - it took 45 Glucose tabs tro come out of the first one, and many ER visits)\u00a0\u00a0, my long acting Insulin was switched to Levemir and this has worked, somewhat, for 6 months, until last night when I got the same multiple lows, in waves, ended up in ER\u00a0\u00a0(went from 245 to 43).\u00a0\u00a0As I have a Workers\" Comp back injury from falling through an uncompleted attic, that was not labeled as a safety hazard, was poorly lit, and the uncompleted floor area was covered by bags I was told to get by my Boss.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, long story short, I have always had a sneaking suspension that nerve impingement, damage, and pain may be the key factor behind my Diabetes, and if the pain gets worse, my blood sugars are higher, I need more Insulin, or if the nerve impingement was reduced and/or the pain lowered, I would need less, causing these lows?\u00a0\u00a0Anybody else experienced anything similar - symptom wise.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",

    "question": "Does the nerve from (thoracic) T7-8 influence insulin production, in any way?\u00a0\u00a0 I am asking because I was diagnosed at age 36 with type 2 diabetes but I have no family history and I was always in pretty good shape through playing ball.\u00a0\u00a0That seemed to be pretty rare but a few weeks later I started getting severe pain in my upper left abdomen and middle of my back which would last last for a couple of hours and would occur about once every 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0After seeing a gastro and urologist and getting CT abdomen/Pelvis, MRI Abdomen and upper endoscopy, it all was unremarkable.\u00a0\u00a0I then decided to see an orthopedist and the MRI of my spine showed a \"small left paracentral disc protrusion causing flattening of the left ventral thecal sac and mild cord deformity resulting in mild central canal stenosis.\"\u00a0\u00a0I am of the opinion that these 2 rare issues MUST be related and my research into the matter makes me think that the nerves that are being pressed on are actually affecting my blood sugar.I am controlling the diabetes withou medication by eating no carbs and excersizing. I also drink about 64 oz of water in additonal to 30 -40 oz. of other liquids.Some additional symptoms which may or may not be related are that I have loose stool very often (I will be cutting some of the liquid out), mild pain in my upper left abdomen or middle back throughout the day, urinating quite often (again, could be the water).I have read that the nerve can affect bowel and bladder and I see on some diagrams that the nerve through the T7 does reach the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0Are these issues related?\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible that the nerve being compressed is causing\u00a0\u00a0the high blood sugar?",
