            "answer": "Hello,There are a few possibilities of hand itchy which need to be ruled out. These include contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, infections, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease or syetmic diseases like liver or kidney causes.Take some antihistaminics like Benadryl and apply calamine lotion as it helps in soothing the skin. If the symptoms persist then topical and oral steroids may be needed. Also then the other systemic causes need to be ruled out for which I suggest you to get an evaluation done from a dermatologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
