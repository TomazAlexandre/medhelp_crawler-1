            "answer": "Hi!First get your blood pressure checked. This could be due to high blood pressure. The other possibility is clot in some blood vessel. This can also give out heat sensation without there being any temperature. It can also be an allergic reaction to some soap or oil etc. In females it could also be due to menopause. Hyperthyroidism, diabetes, temporal arteritis are the other possibilities. A simple test of ESR can rule out temporal arteritis since ESR is high in this. Other two problems can also be ruled out by blood tests. Sudden hypoglycemia too could be a cause. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
