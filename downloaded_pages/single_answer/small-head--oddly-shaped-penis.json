            "answer": "Hi there!I am not sure with your description what the head could be. You may consider getting it examined by a primary care physician. Ejaculation issues could be caused due to anxiety/ stress/ depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. At a primary level I would suggest being a bit relaxed about the situation and see if this seems to improve the condition. If you do not notice any improvement, it might be a good idea to consult a urologist for a detailed evaluation and appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "I am a healthy 20 year old who doesn't smoke, and runs moderately throughout the week.I have noticed that during sex, I do not feel pleasure and have never been able to ejaculate. I have a small head on my penis when compared to the rest of it. It resembles a funnel, where the base is tick and then narrows sharply with the head of my penis. Is there any way I can fix this?",
