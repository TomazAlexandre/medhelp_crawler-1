            "answer": "Hi,Your symptom is called polyuria (excessive frequency of voiding). It can be due to many reasons which can be physiological or disease-related, and include excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones.I suggest you to take opinion of your doctor who would do a clinical examination and advice for needful tests (such as routine urinanalysis, blood glucose test, blood & urinary osmolalities, ultrasonography of renal system, etc).Accordingly you might need to take measures such as control of excessive liquid intake, reduction in diuretic substances/drugs, treatment of any infection (with short-course antibiotics), removal of any urinary tract obstruction, treatment of diabetes, etc as the case may be.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
