    "question": "I had an ellius after a complete hysterectomy. Since, I have had 2 more surgeries, one major and one minor.These all happened within 3 months of each other. Since the ellius (I hope this is the correct spelling, from what I was told, my whole GI system shut down and I spent several days in Intensive Care). I have experienced pain, swelling, constipation, immense weight gain. I use a stool softener, with no relief. I have seen a Gastroentrologist, My Family Doctor, and talked with the Endocrinologist (I have type 2 diabetes) and none of them will even answer my questions regarding my current situation. My surgeries were in 10/09, 1/10, and 2/10. Oh I also spoke with my GYN and she directed me to the Gastroentrologist. All he did was tell me I could get another ellius very easily in life in the future and that was it. He refused to answer my questions, and told me to continue to take my stool softeners.I am in pain most of the time. I watch my diet very closely. I do not eat sweets, I exercise (lot of walking) and my problems continue.Has anyone else experienced such GI problems. I have tried to research this on the internet and have had no luck.I have gone to many doctors and have received no help. I am going to see a new Family Physician soon, and need suggestions as to what to ask.I thank everyone in advance if you have any suggestions.",
