            "answer": "Your son has had some rough times, and we are sorry to read about this. We are not medical professionals on this web forum and are qualified to answer questions about type 1 diabetes only from personal experience and our readings about type 1 diabetes. Your question does not tell us if your son is indeed a type 1 diabetic person. Is he? I assume that the answer is\u00a0\u00a0'yes' because you have appeared on this forum. Chronic infection in type 1 diabetics usually has more to do with high glucose levels forming a good setting for bacteria to breed than any kind of kidney function. I am not qualified to answer this question, but from a lay person's point of view, I can't see how the kidney removal 7 years ago would have anything to do with this infection.How good is your son's overall glucose control? Is his a1c level at 7 or lower? Those are the things I would suggest he look carefully at to protect himself -- to protect his remaining kidney from damage by high glucose levels and also to promote quick healing after injuries. Good glucose control is the best insurance against chronic infection, and it also promotes quicker healing of damaged tissues. We do wish him the very best.",

    "question": "my son, 15 years old and very athletic, recently had blunt trauma to his left testicle in a basketball game;it swelled quite a bit and we thought was holding fluid; My son then told us he had some kind of lump for over a year and when he got hit, he felt a \"pop\".\u00a0\u00a0He thought he had cancer but tests ruled that out.\u00a0\u00a0We scheduled an exploratory surgery and ended up having it removed due to severe chronic infection.\u00a0\u00a0In 1999 he had to have his left kidney removed again due to trauma in a football game.\u00a0\u00a0But after going through lots of testing it was discovered that the kidney never was functioning and when he got injured the mass formed in his kidney.\u00a0\u00a0My question is \"could this chronic infection and my son experiencing this lump for some time have any correlation with having his kidney removed 7 years ago?",
