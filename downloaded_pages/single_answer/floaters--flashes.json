    "question": "I am a 43 year old male. When I did my medical last year, my urine sugar was 4+ and FBS was 12.6. I was initially kept under medication for diabetes for two months. Then doctors put me on diet and found that I have the ability to control my blood sugar by diet alone. So now I am controlling my sugar by diet for the past 7 months and also check my FBS every two months.Six months ago (or one month after I stopped my medicine for diabetes) , I started to see floaters on my left eye and it gradually dveloped to my right eye as well. I immediately consulted an ophthalmologist. She did the dilute test and said it is beacuse of detachment of vitrous gel. However, floaters kept growing gradually and I sought the advice of another ophthalmologist. He had the same view. Three months after that I started to see flashes of lights. I consulted the ophthalmologist again. She did the dilute test and said that my vision and the retina are fine and there is nothing to worry.Now it has been three months since I start to see flashes and I still see them quite significantly. Doctors scan my eyes and could not find anything wrong with my eyes. And I also have lots of floaters like rings. Is it a sign of something dangerous? Could you please advise me asto what to do. I am desperate.",
