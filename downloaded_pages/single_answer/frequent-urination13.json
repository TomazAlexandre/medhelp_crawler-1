            "answer": "At one month into a pregnancy\u00a0\u00a0(if you are, in fact, pregnant) I think it\u00a0\u00a0unlikely that your symptoms are caused by this. Something outside your bladder such as a kidney stone, infection in a tube or ovary, infection in your large intestine or a bladder infection are some common causes of this as is diabetes. With a completely normal urinalysis, I would suspect that something outside of your bladder is the cause. You may do best to see a urologist.S.A.Liroff, M.D.\"This information is provided for general medical educational purposes only.
