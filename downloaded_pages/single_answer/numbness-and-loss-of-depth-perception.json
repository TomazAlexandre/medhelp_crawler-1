            "answer": "Okey dokey. You have a number of complicated problems. Don't be frightened. It is likely that these problems will be self-limiting. Square one is you probably have a viral infection. This often affects the cranial nerves, which in turn affect the eye, and this in turn may cause loss of depth perception. This is a varient of Bell's palsy. It would not necessarily show on an MRI. The drooling is consistent with such a diagnosis. You need a consult with what is called an opthamological neurologist. They will do a good neuro work-up and may suggest use of an eye patch. Vitamin C and anti-inflamatories are often prescribed. Do a \"pubmed\" search (the government database) for current treatments. You also need a test called an HBa1c. Diabetic patients are especially susceptible to cranial nerve palsy's. I suspect you may have diabetes, or an insulin-utilization syndrome. . The foot cramps are characteristic of either/both calcium and vitamin D3 deficiency.",
