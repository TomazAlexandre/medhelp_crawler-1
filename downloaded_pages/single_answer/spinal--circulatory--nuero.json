            "answer": "There can be several reasons of your hand, legs and generalized body numbness although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.Most likely your symptoms could be due to injury to a nerve, pressure on spinal/peripheral nerves (neuropathy), vitamin deficiency, lack of blood supply (circulatory disturbances) due to cholesterol plaque from atherosclerosis in the extremities, viral infection and use of certain medications.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, atherosclerosis can also cause pain, numbness, and tingling while walking and they can also reduce blood supply and lead to numbness. Please consult your doctor to get all these possibilities evaluation in your case for further assessment. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "Don't know where to go next... Male, 26, for two years have had... tingling, some numbness (wide spread) but the worst in hands and the very worst in legs/feet. In the past 7 or 8 months I've developed cramping, tightness and pain in my calf muscles and around the knees. Posture DOES seem to affect most of the symptoms, but in different ways. Sitting, laying makes tingling worse, running standing can worsens pain and cramping -- in other words -- i'm never comfortable. Also have wide spread, but mild facilitations, but i'm not concerned much about these. I think they are anxiety related, mostly due to worrying about this other stuff. Cervical MRI and Lumbar MRI clean. Getting a Thorasic MRI tomorrow and on the prescription it said \"cramping in legs, DTR, suspect stenosis.\" What does that mean? Had $2000 of bloodwork done.. all clean.. too many to name but was fine for Lyme, Lupus, B12, Folic, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis. Also had EMG/NCT (i think that's right) in whole body and it was fine. Still have not circulation tested and have not MRI of brain. Any ideas? Am I just nuts?",
