            "answer": "Of course you should be seen by a doctor. Do not pass go. Do not collect two hundred dollars. Incidentally, there is no \"weekly limit\" on alcohol, unless you are a stock-holder in a beer company. Alcohol is poison. Drinking alcohol by anyone at any time is plan stupid. I think you are really worried about whether or not your problem is life-threatening. Possibly, but probably not. My gut feeling is that you have a problem in postural compensation. That is to say, the vasculature in your legs and thighs do not readily contract in response to feedback. This causes a blood pressure drop and the oxygen deficiency causes the symptoms. There are obviously co-factors, perhaps partially blocked blood vessels. It would be prudent to seek a work-up and you should insist your physician take orthostatic vital signs.",

    "question": "Over the past couple of years I have been occassionally experiencing problems with my vision when standing up, in fact it has been quite hard to describe to my relatives so I thought I would try online. Sometimes when i stand up, from either being asleep or sat down working etc, my vision hearing and ability to speak properly seem to get completely dissorientated. With regards to my vision I cannot actually see any physical objects, but I can still see colours, I guess the only way of describing it is getting all the pixels on a TV, scrambling them up and changing the colours. As for hearing, I can still hear things they just sound incredibly distant and I cant focus on them properly. It seems to be the same with my speech when it happens although I know what I'm trying to say it doesnt ever seem to come out. The problem occurs every now and then, and I personally have no way of knowing when its going to happen or for how long, sometimes it can last mere seconds at a time whereas other times it can last a few minutes. Usually I dont think much of it as it seems to go away after a few minutes, but a couple of weeks ago it hit me when I was in a swimming pool and I nearly ended up drowning as a result.As far as I am aware there is no hereditory illnesses in the family, unless you count diabetes but considering the fact that I am slightly underweight, whereas those who had it were drastically overweight I'm assuming that that isnt a problem. Other than that I'm a fairly healthy 20 year old, physically active, I cycle a lot. I drink under the weekly limit of alcohol and dont smoke, and have never taken drugs. I'm just wondering whether this would signify a problem that should be seen by a doctor.",
