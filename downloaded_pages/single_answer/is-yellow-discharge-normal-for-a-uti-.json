            "answer": "Hello!There are several causes of vaginal discharge and pain like bacterial vaginosis, chlamydia or gonorrhea, pelvic inflammatory disease, trichomoniasis, vaginitis, yeast infections, diabetes etc.In trichomoniasis there may be purulent yellow or greenish foul smelling discharge. Tests like potassium hydroxide whiff test, visual detection under a microscope and PCR may help in diagnosing Trichomonial infection. Oral metronidazole is the treatment of choice and is given either in a single high dose or in divided doses for 5-7 days. If you are not satisfied about your diagnosis or treatment it is advisable to discuss your concerns with your treating doctor. A review of your clinical symptoms and investigations may be helpful. Do write to us again.Take care and regards!",
