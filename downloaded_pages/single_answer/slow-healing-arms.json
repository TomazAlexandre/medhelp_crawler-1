            "answer": "Hi,This could be a case or recurrent boils.Boil or furuncle is a skin disease caused by the infection of hair follicles, thus resulting in the localized accumulation of pus and dead tissue.A case of recurring boils is called chronic furunculosis.Boils are generally caused by an infection of the hair follicles by Staphylococcus aureus, a strain of bacterium that normally lives on the skin surface.Vitamin A or E deficiency, immune system disorders, diabetes can cause this condition.So it is best to exclude these by blood tests.Most boils run their course and it is best to give hot compreses which will aid in faster resolution. You can apply an anti-bacterial cream on the area.In severe cases oral antibiotics may have to be taken.ref:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boils",

    "question": "I have had this problem for a few years. It appears to begin as an infected hair folicle that produces a small \"zit\". Soon thereafter, a wartlike rise appears where the \"zit\" was. After a few months or so, a head comes up in the center of the rise and is very sore to the touch.this happens on both outside of forearms. I do live in a sunny enviroment but take care to wear sunscreen daily. I was wondering if these could be caused by a vitamin defeciency, sun, or something else. Any thoughts?",
