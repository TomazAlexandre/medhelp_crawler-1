    "question": "(This is meant as a post in a thread, not a new thread, hope it works).I, too, have had and now have an underarm rash, under one arm - it's red. Had it for years now. It goes from faint, to bright red; usually there's no discomfort, but when it's bright red it can start to get sensitive/sore.It gets bright red when I go 2 or 3 days without a shower.A poster mentioned their doctor said it might be diabetes releated, but he didn't have that; I was told this year I do have diabetes, I wish he'd said more about the problem if it is.I saw a dermatologist who wasn't optimisting about getting rid of it, but did offer something (poder I think) to try, which I did not use.Just today, I got the bright idea to use hydrogen peroxide on it and sure eniough, it foamed up, as it does when it hits an infection. Applied it a couple more times hours apart, and more foam.I still have no idea what it really is, and googling on yeast infection to see if that might be it found this thread. We'll see if the peroxide actually gets rid of it.This discussion is related to/posts/show/243173.",
