            "answer": "No, diabetics only smell sweet if they are producing ketones which is a result of significantly and consistently high blood sugars; it means there is a problem, possibly an urgent one. I don't know what the gassy odor could be, it's not a typical diabetic thing. Possibly it is gas and she is having some sort of side effect from medications or stomach problem. If she is a close friend perhaps you can tactfully ask her. Maybe she needs a med change.",

    "question": "I have a close friend who is type1, often times when around her I smell a - gassy odor, like she just passed gas, it is foul smelling. I know she simply didnt pass gas in public, weddings etc so I continue to wonder if this could be something she is simply giving off from her diabetes. I here diabetics smell sweet typically. Am i way off with the gas smell?",
