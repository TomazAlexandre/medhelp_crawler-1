            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Low rise in temperature is generally due to anemia (ruled out by CBC in your case, but get serum iron done), diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis.Since your stomach too feels queasy, there is a chance that you have inflammation of the bowels as seen in IBS, colitis or maybe even gluten or lactose intolerance. Discuss this with your doctor and try and get investigated.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
