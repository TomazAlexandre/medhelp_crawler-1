            "answer": "Hi there. There can be many possible causes for loss of concentration and memory loss and dizzy spells like dementia due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, delirium from drug or alcohol withdrawal or worsening of an infection causing confusion, change in sleep wake cycle etc. amnesia or memory loss due to head injury, stroke, emotional event etc. confusion may arise from asthma or COPD, cardiac problems like heart failure, coronary artery disease, irregular heartbeats, diabetes, kidney or liver failure ,malnutrition or vitamin deficiencies from long term alcoholism, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism etc. Head injury, transient ischemic attacks, seizure disorder and a brain tumor also cause confusion. Ear examination by an otolaryngologist needs to be done to rule out ear infection, earwax and rupture of tympanic membrane. Consult a neurologist for assessment and multiple sclerosis is a possibility. Hope these help. Take care.",
