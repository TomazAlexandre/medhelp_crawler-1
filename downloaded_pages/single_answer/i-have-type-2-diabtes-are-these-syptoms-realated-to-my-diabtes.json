            "answer": "Hi, I don't have diabetes, but I do have a nerve condition that causes me to have cold hands and feet, and decreased sensation in both.\u00a0\u00a0In diabetics this is often the result of diabetic neuropathy.Do you have a good doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Do you test your blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0Low blood sugar could cause the shakiness when you wake, I'm pretty sure.\u00a0\u00a0Do you get blood work done, like testing your thyroid function, CBC, and all that good stuff?\u00a0\u00a0Have you talked to a doctor about your weight loss and stomach pain after eating?It's a good idea to ask because I've found that all the symptoms a person has isn't necessarily related to the biggest health issue they're dealing with.\u00a0\u00a0I have multiple sclerosis, but I also have reflux disease, arthritis, restless leg syndrome, and more.\u00a0\u00a0A good doctor can help you figure it all out and hopefully help you deal with everything.I think a lot of these questions could better be answered by your doctor than by me (obviously, ha ha), but you asked here so I'm trying to help a little.\u00a0\u00a0I know how scary and frustrating all sorts of strange symptoms can be.Take care.",
