            "answer": "Dear ransari,Thank you very much for your question. I am happy to address the issues that you pose, although it is important that you recognize that my impression is based entirely on the information you have provided in your posting and is by no means a replacement for an office visit with a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosis is contingent on detailed history and physical exam and as such, the following information should be considered solely for educational purposes.It sounds like you have a very interesting patient, indeed!\u00a0\u00a0In such a complex case, it is definitely very important to be thorough.\u00a0\u00a0You have not mentioned an MRI of the brain and unless there is a contraindication to do so (i.e. pacemaker, etc), I would certainly conduct and MRI/MRA of the brain with and without contrast to evaluate for any subtle enhancement or mass lesions which might suggest leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, brain tumor, metastases, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Although the diagnosis of CNS vasculitis is often made by angiogram, a normal cerebral angiogram cannot exclude the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Other considerations include MS, a paraneoplastic syndrome and neurosarcoidosis.\u00a0\u00a0Have you conducted basic labs such as ESR, CRP, CBC, CT chest/abdomen/pelvis (to screen for malignancy), metabolic panel, etc?\u00a0\u00a0I would also conduct a lumbar puncture and send the CSF for\u00a0\u00a0cytology, flow cytometry, oligoclonal bands, IgG index, routine analysis.\u00a0\u00a0A serum paraneoplastic panel (including anti-Hu, anti-CV2, anti-Yo, anti-Ri, anti-CAR, anti-Ma, anti-Ta and anti-Zic4 antibodies) can be sent off to Mayo Clinic as well; it is important that paraneoplastic syndrome may be detectable years before the patient has any evidence of malignancy.You mention that your patient has hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0have you looked at the patient's renal arteries to evaluate for renal artery stenosis?\u00a0\u00a0Evidence of such may be suggestive of a systemic vasculitis with CNS manifestations.\u00a0\u00a0If this is the case, you can biopsy the renal arteries to arrive at a diagnosis which carries a much lower risk than brain biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately, you may need to refer your patient for brain biopsy in order to rule out CNS vasculitis if all other testing is fruitless.We see these types of patients all the time at the Cleveland Clinic and my best advice to you is to refer your patient to a neurologist who can conduct a more thorough exam and determine which testing is most appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0The above is simply a list of potentially appropriate tests but as you know, it is impossible to offer a diagnosis and plan of care without having the opportunity to take a history and examen the patient.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much for this interesting case, and good luck with arriving at a diagnosis.JBT, MD",
