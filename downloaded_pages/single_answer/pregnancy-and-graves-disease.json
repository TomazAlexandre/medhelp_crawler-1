            "answer": "PTU is safe during pregnancy to treat hyperthyroidism -- the goal is to keep the T4 and T3 in the upper range of normal.\u00a0\u00a0PTU crosses the placenta, but the risks to the child are low.\u00a0\u00a0Most women in this situation are also followed by high-risk OB w/ frequent fetal ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0Hyperthyroidism can increase insulin requirements, PTU may help this.\u00a0\u00a0Graves usually improves as the pregnancy progresses, so check levels frequently (every 4-5 weeks) and minimize the PTU dose needed.\u00a0\u00a0Neonatal Graves is not common -- ask your doctor to check TSI level around week 24-28 -- if very elevated (> 3-5x upper normal) then there is a higher risk of baby having Graves.T3 of 2.43 is hard to interpret w/o the reference range.\u00a0\u00a0Would also be useful to look at the TSH and T4.",
