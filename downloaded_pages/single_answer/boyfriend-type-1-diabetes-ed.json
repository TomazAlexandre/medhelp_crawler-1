    "question": "My boyfriend has type 1 diabetes so he is unable to have an erection. I'm fine without having sex (there's other ways that work for us ;)) however, I know he feels less of a man not being to have an erection. So my question is, is there anything a type 1 diabetic can take to help? Is it dangerous to take such medication? Can diabetics have semi normal sex life? Anything thing will to give my man a peace of mind. Thank you gentlemen!",
