    "question": "I received a text message from a friend yesterday asking \"Mark, if you throw up after you eat sugar, is that a sign of diabetes?\" I replied \"No but that's definitely not good.\" So i questioned her a bit about what was going on, she said whenever she eats/drinks candy, soda, cakes, and especially ice cream, she vomits. she doesn't want to go to the doctor, which i can understand. Does anyone know what might be going on with her? I'm going to talk to her again to try to pull more information from her. If anyone has any idea of what might be wrong, that'd be greatly appreciated, thank you.",
