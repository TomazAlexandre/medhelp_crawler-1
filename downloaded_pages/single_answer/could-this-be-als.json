    "question": "I am 28 years old and for the past few weeks have been experiencing involuntary muscle movements.\u00a0\u00a0I am having some muscle twitching under the skin, but the more noticable symptom is actual movement of a finger, arm, etc.\u00a0\u00a0They're not wildly flailing movements, but the are noticeble.\u00a0\u00a0They started and continue to occur throughout my whole body (head, arms, legs, trunk area) rather than in one part of my body and spreading, and occur probably 20-30 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0There is no pain or cramping.\u00a0\u00a0I have also recently experienced some tingling in my arms and legs.\u00a0\u00a0It's sort of a feeling of weakness, but I'm not having trouble picking things up or anything.\u00a0\u00a0And, this is quite possibly due to the anxiety I'm feeling over the other symptom.\u00a0\u00a0I know that ALS is rare, but these symptoms are still disturbing and I can't get in to see my doctor for another 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I thank you for any information you could give me.",
