    "question": "HELP!!! I'm in a lesbian relationship with a type one diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Her sex drive is pretty much non existant. She takes care of her diabetes well. We have no health insurance. Also she's had since she was 6(she's 21 now). She says its nothing to do with me that I am attractive but its hard not to think otherwise. I take care of her when shes low or high and im very understanding about it all. She talls me she wantss me in that way and i could see it and feel it sometimes but its as if she has no drive to pursue it. Our sex is great when it dose happen I just don't understand why not more. We only have sex about once a month maybe longer. We both want to try and fix it but these too embarrassed to admit it or talk to anyone about it. If anyone has insight and could help at all please let me know. Any suggestions is better then none",
