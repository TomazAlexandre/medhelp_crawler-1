            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Most of your symptoms can be due to blocked Eustachian tube. It is a membrane lined tube that connects the middle ear space to the back of the nose. Its main purpose is to check the ear pressure changes in the middle ear. If you have or had cold, allergies, sinusitis, ear pain/infection or post nasal drip, you can develop Eustachian tube blockage. Try chewing gum the next time you have ear popping/spasm/pain or do valsalva maneuver (Done by taking a deep breath and blowing while pinching your nostrils and closing your mouth). This will also clear dizziness etc.Numbness in feet can be due to pinched nerve in the lower back (sciatica or lumbar spinal nerve getting pinched), Vit B12 deficiency, peripheral neuropathy of diabetes, hypothyroidism or Lymes, poor circulation, rheumatoid arthritis or Raynaud\u2019s disease.Also, the head/neck scalp sensitiveness can be due to pinched spinal nerve in cervical spine, Vit B12 deficiency, peripheral neuropathy of diabetes, hypothyroidism or Lymes, poor circulation, rheumatoid arthritis or Raynaud\u2019s disease.Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I'm a 44 yr old male. Prior to this illness, my health was perfect (bp=112/78). 18 months ago I developed a respiratory infection that led to a viral ear/head infection. My primary symptoms were excruciating head and dental pain, diarrhea, extreme ear fullness, tinnitus in both ears, off balance (no room spin), light and sound sensitivity, scalp sensitivity, and also had a stiff neck and shoulders. I\u2019ve never experienced this type of illness before and what still hunts me is the amount of head pain I had. My brain felt like it wanted to explode through my ears and eyes.Depending on which doctor I reference, the culprit illness was either viral labyrinthitis or viral meningitis. I\u2019ve literally seen 12 ENTs and 4 oto-neuroligist and have had every possible scan and test performed but no solid diagnosis. I was diagnosed with everything from Meniere\u2019s, secondary hydrops, TMJ, patulous eustachian tube dysfunction, and vestibular nerve damage. Normal test results include Caloric, VNG, VEMP, and EKOG; however, I did test positive for left BPPV which was treated with Epley therapy. I\u2019ve been on several meds steroids, anti virals, diuretics, allergy, benzos, and anti-depressants. The head only MRI with and without contrast relieved no tumors. I don\u2019t drink alcohol or coffee nor do I consume much sugar or any caffeine.I\u2018m currently struggling mightily with ear problems such as violent ear popping, tinnitus, ear spasms, poor vision, off-balance 24/7, mild headache behind eyes and top of head, terrible sound sensitivity, extreme autophony, and numb feet. Most of these symptoms intensify with touching my head and/or with exercise an/or when consuming meds that cause dry mouth.Last night I broke down; consequently, my frightened wife rushed me to the ER where the ER doctor suspected perhaps a vestibular migraine. He injected me with a small dose of Imitrex and within 10min, my violent ear popping stopped completely! The tinnitus, auophony and dizziness still persisted but getting relief from the ear popping was wonderful.I'm addressing the \"slight\" TMJ popping via a night splint but other than that I'm waiting for my first appt with a neurologist. Is it plausible that a viral infection can lead to migraines that affect the vestibular system? Why is my head/scalp/neck so sensitive to touch and why are my feet always numb?Any insight would be GREATLY appreciated.",
