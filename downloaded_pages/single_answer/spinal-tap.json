            "answer": "Hi!Conditions that cause high protein in CSF are injury, nerve inflammation, bleeding or tumor. However, these usually cause a rapid increase in CSF proteins. Increased glucose is usually seen in diabetes, and is only related to high blood glucose level. So, since there are lesions in the brain, it could be any condition that has caused high protein. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
