            "answer": "Hi marthome,I volunteer for this website and I have had Type 1 diabetes for about 30 years. This is the first I have ever heard this concern. I looked on the internet which discussed the importance of good blood sugar control which can prevent skin conditions from developing such as bacterial infections. It also discusses possible drier skin due to high blood glucose levels which can potentially lead to infection if the skin is cracked. I use skin creams quite a bit especially on my feet and hands to prevent cracking. My hands are beat up from blood testing so I try and manage that with skin lotions as well. But I personally have never had an adverse blood sugar reading due to body lotion. I would ask your doctor if they have ever heard of this. It may be possible but I cannot find any information on it. Keep us posted if you find out anything I am quite curious. CG",
