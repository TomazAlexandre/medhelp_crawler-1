    "question": "My friend who is 52 was just recently diagnosed with a mild case of diabetes. Before he found this out, he was extremely tired, his appetite was off and his legs were slow to move. Normally he is very athletic, he worked out five days a week approximately 70 to 90 minutes a day. He just started crashing after a while. So he went into hospital he found out he was a diabetic but shortly after his 3 day stay in the hospital his weak legs begin to hurt. Right now as we speak his legs are in excrutiating pain.",
