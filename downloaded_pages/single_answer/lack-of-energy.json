            "answer": "Hi again, Steveman,That tiredness sounds familiar -- and my guess is that many of us experience it ... particularly when our blood sugars are running high, or when they're running low, or when they're fluctuating a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Any of those patterns fit?\u00a0\u00a0Of course, lack of sleep due to aches 'n' pains or due to worries & stresses can leave anyone exhausted, too.Tiredness is important to talk about with your doc, too, Steve, because it can help in assessing your overall health.Just because we have diabetes doesn't mean we should expect to feel lousy, or tired all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the time, I feel normal -- at least I *think* I do ;-)I suppose there are a variety of approaches to get out of a funk, but the experts always seem to include exercise (still my personal nemesis) as part of the routine.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to check with your doc before starting a new exercise plan, too.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to NOT exercise at a time when our BG is too low OR too high.\u00a0\u00a0Excercising above 225 or so will often drive up blood glucose even higher.I know you know that I'm not a physician, but for the benefit of others who read our Q&As I want to write it again.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you'll add a comment when you get to the root cause of your tiredness and when you begin to see some relief.All the best.",
