    "question": "okay so I'm 16 years old and my entire life I have had a problem with blacking out and fainting. it's been happening since I was about 5. at leased that's how far back I remember it happening since. I blackout multiple times a day for usually around 10 seconds. I eat ringing in my ears, lose my vision and get dizzy. but sometimes I literally faint. everything will get black and I lose control of my legs as just collapse. I eat healthy and generally 3 meals a day. I'm an athlete and stay active. I usually don't mind blacking out but I fainted while at my friends house and ran into a heater and it was embarrassing and I don't want to faint ever again. I hate it. can someone help?oh also, i lose circulation in my toes and I don't know why. the doctors think maybe that's caused by Reynolds but they were just giving me an opinion on what it could be. my doctor isn't very helpful. idk if losing circulation could be a symptom of something else but my doctor doesn't seem to help. please help!also Iv been tested negative for diabetes and asked to see a neurologist but when I was 2, I had a bad head injury.",
