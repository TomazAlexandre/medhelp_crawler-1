            "answer": "It is highly unlikely that your eye problem is kidney problems. If you have pain with urination, weight loss, or a family history of diabetes see a GP or FP to rule out diabetes or GU problems.As for your eyes perhaps your new job exposes you to irritants or allergies. Try Zaditor and/or Ophcon both over the counter.Just in case make an appointment with an Eye MD ophthalmologist for an evaluation in a week if your symptoms don't improve. You may just need to pay for the visit out of your own pocket as you do for meals, housing, clothes, etc.JCH III MD",

    "question": "I have been experiencing extreme swelling around my eyes for about 5 days. Alot of fluid retention in my upper eye lids and below my lower eye lids. No pain, just slight pressure from the water build up. Over the counter allergy meds have not helped. I have read some information about UTI and kidney infections causing swelling around the eyes and I have been experiencing frequent urination lately. I just started a new job and my health insurance does not kick in for two months. I am desperate for help because it worsens by the day and I am embarrassed to go out in public. A cold compress ever-so-slightly reduces the upper eye lid swelling but my cheeks continue to grow. I am beginning to experience depression due to this swelling, but cannot take vacation days or sick days from my new job. Please help. Is there anything I can do? Is there anything I can tell a doctor to look at since it is not allergies?",
