    "question": "Hey everyone, wow its been a long time since I have been on here.I can not believe that I am 25 weeks :). After all the problems I have had or thought I had. I made it to the 25th week but the sad news is that I was diag with gestational diabetes. \"My sugar level is running 180-190\". I am nervous about what the diabetes can do to my lil girl growing inside me. I read that it can cause a stillborn, or that the baby can be 10pds at delivery.If anyone has had this experience in their pregnancy please share your story with me.God bless.",
