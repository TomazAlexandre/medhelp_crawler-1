            "answer": "While it can be a sign of nerve damage, the history you presented with suggests that the pain is more likely due to an, as of yet, incompletely healed fractured clavicle.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on the severity of the fracture, complete return of function and range of motion may not be achieved in just a month, even with physical therapy.\u00a0\u00a0I would advise you to refrain from further applying pressure or using that shoulder until you see the orthopedic surgeon.",

    "question": "About a month ago I fell on the subway and smashed my collarbone into the pole, fracturing my left clavicle...while the break is healing well and I am getting more use of my arm, I get an intense burning pain in the top front of my left shoulder...from the break to the shoulder...e.g. this can happen when I try to wash dishes...holding the dish in my left hand (resting on the sink) and washing with the right...any bit of pressure on the dish brings its on...but it can also happen if I turn my head too quickly...I am wondering if this is nerve damage and if it is, will it heal on its own or do I need to see someone?\u00a0\u00a0I am seeing an orthopedic specialist in 2 weeks to follow up on the break but wonder if I should see someone sooner?\u00a0\u00a0I am a 55 year old female with diabetes and high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time.",
