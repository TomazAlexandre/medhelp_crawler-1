            "answer": "Hi,A CT scan without contrast can detect brain tumours. You may not have a brain tumour. There may be other causes of headache, fatigue and arm tingling. They could be Multiple sclerosis, Diabetes, Viral infections and many others. Please go for an MRI of the brain to find out if the cause is neurological. Please consult your neurologist for the same.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",
