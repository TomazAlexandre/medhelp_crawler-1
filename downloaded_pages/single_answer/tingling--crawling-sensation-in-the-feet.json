            "answer": "Hi there. You need to check for any degenerative disc disease to rule out compressive neuropathy or bulging disc causing these symptoms. If the MRI spine rules out this, you will need an MS evaluation. MS is a chronic demyelinating disorder where the disease phase is characterized by active phase and remissions. It has multiple symptoms and signs and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The symptoms of multiple sclerosis are loss of balance, muscle spasms, numbness in any area, problems with walking and coordination, tremors in one or more arms and legs. Bowel and bladder symptoms include frequency of micturition, urine leakage, eye symptoms like double vision uncontrollable rapid eye movements, facial pain, painful muscle spasms, tingling, burning in arms or legs, depression, dizziness, hearing loss, fatigue etc. The treatment is essentially limited to symptomatic therapy so the course of action would not change much whether MS has been diagnosed or not. Apart from clinical neurological examination, MRI shows MS as paler areas of demyelination, two different episodes of demyelination separated by one month in at least two different brain locations. Spinal tap is done and CSF electrophoresis reveals oligoclonal bands suggestive of immune activity, which is suggestive but not diagnostic of MS. Demyelinating neurons, transmit nerve signals slower than non-demyelinated ones and can be detected with EP tests. These are visual evoked potentials, brain stem auditory evoked response, and somatosensory evoked potential. Slower nerve responses in any one of these is not confirmatory of MS but can be used to complement diagnosis along with a neurological examination, medical history and an MRI in addition, a spinal tap. You also need to be checked for small vessel ischemic disease, cerebral ischemia etc for these MRI lesions. Therefore, it would be prudent to consult your neurologist with these concerns. Hope this helps. Take care.",

    "question": "I've been experiencing constant tingling, crawling sensation in my feet for a month now. It started with the right foot, and then in a few weeks the left one. Also the palm of the left hand has burning sensation once in a while as if I slapped something. No B12 deficiency, thyroid is normal, no diabetes, periods every month. My family doctor thinks that I don't need MRI of the head for MS because I don't have any other symptoms related to it. Any advice?",
