    "question": "My doctor thinks I have vaginal mrsa. I have had a cultural done just to be extra safe but since they aren't painful when he was touching them and inspecting them he highly doubts it's herpes. I have had the same partner for over a year. He is having the same symptoms as I. We have both had mrsa a number of times prior to this outbreak. The blisters burn and look like infected hair follicles as well as there is a slight itch at times. I have been washing with hibiclens for the last two days since I went to see my doctor and he has given me medication to take as well. My first case of mrsa is located right next to my nose, wasn't that long ago and it fully isn't gone. It has been there for about 7 months. I've taken bactrim and cipro a number of times but nothing get rid of it fully. I'm honestly just really uncomfortable and frustrated and I don't know how long this is going to take to disappear..... I have been very tired lately. Is this normal? How long will it take for this to go away?",
