    "question": "I am having trouble with my blood glucose apparently I went from a number of 321 and nearly fainting to within hours going to 98. I was given no medicine for this nor did I have any food in that timespan.The doctor thinks I have diabetes. I was given a monitor and have been testing all weekend with results goint between 87 to 117 for the past two days. I also was given a script for 1000mg Glucophage taken once daily. I can not seem to loose weight. I am 56 years old and had a hysterectomy at 26. I was left with one ovary. Can I still be going thru memopause? I have what I believe to be hot flashes but could they be something else and an indicator of some other endocrine problem. I had blood drawn for testing but have not yet recieved the results.",
