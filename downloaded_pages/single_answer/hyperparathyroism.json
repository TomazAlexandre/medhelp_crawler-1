            "answer": "Hello,Hyperpararathyroidism is not thought to cause Type 2 diabetes. Th chronic UTIs may be from the combination of having diabetes and stones in the past. UTIs are overall more difficult to clear in people with diabetes, and there are often somewhat atypical infections that may be missed. If you continue on this course a visit to an infectious disease specialist may be helpful.Take care.",

    "question": "I have just been diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma. Can this cause type 2 diabetes? Also, I have had chronic UTI's for about 2 yrs. or more. I did have a kidney stone which is now gone(lithotrypsy) but still have the infections. I am VERY frustrated with this! I have gotten very vague answers to this question from the urologist and endocrinologist that I have had to see due to this problem. I am awaiting surgery now. Just wondering what you thought. Thanks, AL",
