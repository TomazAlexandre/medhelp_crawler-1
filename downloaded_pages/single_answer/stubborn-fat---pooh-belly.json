            "answer": "There really is no way to \"spot reduce\"; losing weight over all is the way you will reduce.Do you know what your BMI is?\u00a0\u00a0That's calculated using your height and weight and is used as an indicator to determine if you are at a healthy weight.It sounds as though you get plenty of exercise; therefore, maybe you could vary the amount/intensity of the exercise or vary the amount of calories you consume daily.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, if our body becomes used to the same thing on a daily basis, there's no longer a challenge and you will hit a plateau.Have you ever tried yoga?\u00a0\u00a0That's excellent for toning muscles over the entire body; it's also relaxing.",

    "question": "I am 24 years old and have never had a flat stomach. In fact, throughout my life, my pudgy stomach has been described as \"(winnie) the pooh\". I've danced all my life, continue to stay active (walk, crunches, swim etc),\u00a0\u00a0I stay away from processed foods and sugars for the most part. I am not a snacker and I consume a good amount of vegetables and fruits. However, my belly still remains. If I pinch my belly fat, my fat reaches approx. 2.5 inches in width (this is when I am slouched down). You cannot tell I have a stomach until I slouch or if I'm wearing a tight shirt. I am able to \"suck in\" my stomach.I'm 5'0 and weigh 130 lbs, my legs are very muscular from being a dancer and athlete. I have type 2 diabetes due to my hyperthyroidsim. Therefore, I am extra careful of what I consume. I realize everyone has a place on their body where fat seems to accumulate, mine happens to be smack dab in the middle, which is unfortunate considering I am a woman and would love to feel confident in a 2-piece swimsuit or form-fitting dress.I have tried dieting, exercise (60 min power walks, zumba, treadmill, etc), cutting down food portions although I hardly eat seconds. I have tried EVERYTHING.Any suggestions of how to lose my fat? It simply will not go away!!! I am almost convinced I will always have my \"winnie the pooh\" belly.",
