            "answer": "You need to see a urologist and have your prostate checked. Any infection along the male parts can move upstream and cause a prostate infection. The pelvic pain, pins and needles, etc., all point towards prostatitis. Yes, even preteens can develop it. Ask about the discoloration of the foreskin and glans. I suspect a swollen prostate is limiting blood flow. The fluid discharge during a bowe movement also speaks to an enlarged prostate.Do you experience any pain or discomfort when ejaculating? It is not supposed to hurt.Your doctor will do a digital rectal exam to palate your prostate. Digital means finger up the tailpipe. He is not enjoying doing the exam any more than you are getting it. If there is obvious swelling, he may get a little aggressive as he palpates the gland. Do not be surprised if you have some type of discharge. He will want to know as that is a further diagnostic marker.The treatment is a month or more of antibiotics. If you have any issues with urination, tell him. He can also prescribe something to help the prostate relax. The medication will likely be an alpha-blocker. This has an side effect of lowering your blood pressure. Get up slowly so as not to pass out and hit the floor.I also noticed that you are in the diabetes forum too. Diabetes will often times slow healing time, evendors at your young age. You may not have noticed more frequent urination, or urine flow issues because of some of the symptoms associated with diabetes. Make sure you discuss that with the urologist too.",

    "question": "Hi, Iam 17, male, virgin. The problem is that my glans is losing its reddish pink colour and is becoming whitish & have very less sensation in the greyish area.Actually the problems started about March 2015. One day I had sharp pain in pelvic area during urination, It lasted 2-3 days. I went to a ayurvedicdoctor, he said it was because of dehydration and gave some medicines. The problem went away but resurfaced after some months(September or October).Now there were other symptoms like pain in the glans below the urinary opening, Sharp pain which start at pelvic region and end at the tip ofpenis, Sometimes when I defecated semen or a transparent sticky liquid would come out of my urinary opening.I also got a penis infection once - It was like wound on the inner foreskin with discharge of pus, then I had little red bumps on glans. Therewas itching and irritation on both foreskin and glans. I was prescribed cloben-g cream to be applied on glans. The problems again subsided along with the infection.Then\u00a0\u00a0the glans started turning whitish(in February 2016), At first it started in left side of glans and progressed to almost the entire glans. I also hadpins and needle sensation under my left leg. But after some months the whitishlayer near the frendulum part turned partially back to red and sensation also returned,then some other parts also turned normal. But they again started turningwhitish after some months(november). I had also noticed that this \"turning to whitish condition\" happens during hot climate. Also now left part of my foreskin iskind of numb but the foreskin has no colour variation. Please help me, I just want to know why it is happening and what can i do about it.",
