    "question": "In April 2010 I had two weeks in which I felt wiped out, i also started having issues with sexual performance. Between April and August I slowly developed tingling in my left hand, muscle pain in both calves and hamstrings and I sometimes felt dizzy.I went to the docs in August and they ran a load of tests, electrolytes, diabetes, tests for weird diseases causing muscle breakdown etc. All were fine apart from having raised liver enzymes.The doc gave me quinine which helped with the muscle pain a lot.I went to the optician about my dizzyness, got glasses for near sightedness and the dizzyness went right away and has not returned.In the last week I've noticed I have worse tingling in both hands and worse pain in both legs all over. All symptoms are symetrical. Apart from my right shoulder clicks and pops like mad and seems to tire more easily.I have no muscle weakness as I train with heavy weights daily so would know right away. I have take cialis over the last week and wonder if this can cause tingling? So, any guesses? MS? Something else?",
