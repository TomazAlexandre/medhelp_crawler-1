            "answer": "Hi,First,congratulations on taking the bull by the horns, so to speak, and being very proactive about changing your diet and lifestyle overall. That is fantastic!In regard to the low blood sugars, the answer is \"yes\" to both of your suggestions. When we exercise it helps improve sensitivity to insulin, and for most people with diabetes this means that their blood sugars drop with/after vigorous exercise. This is also seen with sustained exercise as a habit, both as a result of weight loss but also the effect of exercise itself. You should let your doctor know about this development. You may need a lower dose of your medication on those days when you plan to exercise. The other option is to have a light snack prior to exercising to help keep your blood sugar from dropping, but this may temper weight loss, so I would prefer decreasing medication on those days instead. It's up to you and your doctor.Take care and keep up the good work!",
