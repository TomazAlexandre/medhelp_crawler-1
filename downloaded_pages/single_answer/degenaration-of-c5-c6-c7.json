            "answer": "Hi there.The numbness of the left small and ring fingers can be partly explained by the degenerations since these can cause some form of compression in origins of the ulnar nerve (which is the nervous innervation of the said fingers) and the weakness in the legs can also be partly explained by the degenerations.\u00a0\u00a0However, the lightheadedness can be very hard to pin on the C5-C7 problem.\u00a0\u00a0Systemic causes can cause this such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, low hemoglobin, or diabetes mellitus.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you have this evaluated by your doctors and discuss the possibilities I mentioned.Regards and God bless.",
