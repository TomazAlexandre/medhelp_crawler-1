    "question": "My brother has had diabetes for 40 years, last Jan. he had either low or high blood sugar level and hit a person while driving. he started talking to the police and said Jesus made him do it and that he did it on purpose (the police have a video of him babbling and saying all kinds of things). They arrested him and he is charged with 2 felonies and is looking at jail time. Has this happen to anyone or does anyone know where we can go for help. He has a lawyer and the DA does not believe that the accident was caused by diabetes. They think he is either cazy or a racist (the lady he hit was black)my email is ***@****Type 1 diabetics - Beware - you are one candybar away from being put in jail - this could be you my brother has never had a racist act or violent temper.",
