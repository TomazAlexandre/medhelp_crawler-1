            "answer": "Hi,How are you? What other symptoms are present? Aside from allergies, this could also be due to irritation, infection, skin conditions and underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, liver or kidney problem. Allergic reactions usually respond to antihistamine and avoidance of the allergen or trigger. However, if it\u00a0\u00a0persists, you may need to have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Try also not to scratch to prevent secondary bacterial infection.Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I have red bumps all over my body; mainly around my inner thighs, arms, hands, between the fingers, or on the breasts. Sometimes under the breasts and on the knees. Oh, also my bum. They're usually my skin color or red; if they're my skin color and I scratch, they stay red. Did I mention that they tend to itch?They're pretty much all over my body.I've told my mother about this, but she says, \"It's just allergies.\" This has been going on for over a month. I've never had allergies before and I'm only allergic to penicillin. I really don't know what's wrong, and my mother only believes it's allergies.What could it be? And what can be done to help the itching or help them go away?",
