    "question": "I think my father is in the last stages\u00a0\u00a0before death. He has apparently been sober for about three years now but he \"isn't there at all\" now. I'm really just trying to do my research and make myself more aware of what's going on. I don't want to give all the details on here but will in a private message. If anyone knows anything about this sort of thing and diabetes type 1 due to alcohol, death, anything related I would really appreciate any help or information.Thank you so much.",
