            "answer": "Hi there!Victoza usually causes loss of appetite. The increase in appetite is likely to be due to constant low blood sugar levels. It is important to understand that avoiding food is not the appropriate way to lose weight. Weight loss has to be achieved with a healthy balanced diet and adequate amount of physical activity. Cutting down on the diet is neither a healthy way to lose fat not recommended, especially in people with diabetes/ prediabetes.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
