            "answer": "you are very lucky that this is your first yeast infection. Thats how my doc knew i had diabetes because of yeast infections every month. I have to take oral meds and use the 7 day cream, if i use the one day or three day it is horrible, burning and irritation worse than the yeast infection. When my sugars are high I can always count on a yeast infection.",

    "question": "I am struggling to get rid of this yeast infection, I've been diabetic for 10 years now and never had one before, I was treated with antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis a month ago, the smelly discharge disappeared but I got a yeast infection from the metronidazole. I've tried Monistat 7 and 1 in the last 2 weeks but the swelling and itching is still there, all the way to my anus. I just got my period and am very tired and stressed which does not help at all.I would really appreciate any advice on how to make it go away.",
