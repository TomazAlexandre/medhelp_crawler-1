            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Numbness of hands could be due to wrong pressure somewhere. If the mattress is also new then this could be a likely cause.\u00a0\u00a0A bed should not be causing these problems. Using a high pillow too can cause similar symptoms. Sleep elsewhere in the house and see if the symptoms persist. It can also be due to peripheral neuropathies of diabetes or hypothyroidism. Pinched cervical spinal nerves could also be the cause. If symptoms persist consult an orthopedic specialist or a neurologist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
