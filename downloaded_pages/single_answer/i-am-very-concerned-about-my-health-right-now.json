Going through your post, it seems like you have been through a lot of tests already. You have mentioned of a silent heart attack. Also, you have had a swollen eye. The presence of a heart attack may suggest an underlying disease condition which may act as risk factors .Example is diabetes. If diabetes is present, then the risk of getting skin infections may be increased. This may be a possibility that you need took into.Just continue to be proactive about this.

    "question": "I have severe migraine headaches almost every day since my last back surgery for scoliosis where they collapsed my spine and fixed two deteriorated back discs also.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I have developed very high blood pressure just recently that I cannot get under control despite meds, and now my hands and arms are shaking.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a lot of fatigue and was recently told by a doctor that I had had a mild heart attack that I didn't even know about.\u00a0\u00a0I had shortness of breath and chest pressure - that's all.\u00a0\u00a0Then my one eye swelled up real big one morning and turned completely red.The doctor said he didn't really know what was going on, but he thought it might be viral pinkeye (which my children never got, nor my husband), and that it should clear up in about two weeks; but my vision was blurry for over a month.Wondering if maybe I popped a blood vessel behind my eye or something ...who knows?\u00a0\u00a0My doctors act very indifferent and unconcerned about my health altogether.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0cannot seem to find a concerned doctor, and I KNOW something is going on with my health that should not be going on.\u00a0\u00a0Med history includes two back surgeries for severe scoliosis; open heart surgery for a left ventricle hole or something like that, and they say I still have some heart problems as I have erratic heart beat and very high heart rate also.\u00a0\u00a0What is really strange is that my blood pressure and heart rate are the highest when I first wake up in the morning!\u00a0\u00a0 I only have one kidney from birth.I have undertaken to do all I know to get my blood pressure down, which has always been very low until recently.I got off of birth control pills and stopped drinking any Coca Cola which I used to drink a lot of (diet) for energy.I don't smoke or drink alcohol or take drugs, except Excedrin for my headaches.\u00a0\u00a0The other drugs the doctors gave me for my headaches did not even phase them.\u00a0\u00a0Extra strength Excedrin helps some ....I exercise, too, and yet I am still a little overweight and cannot seem to drop the weight even though I hardly eat.My doctors (different ones) just act very indifferent and have no concern at all, so I am very frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0I know my own body and I know that something really wrong is going on.\u00a0\u00a0I have a lot of anxiety but all this shaking is out of line for me, and so is this very, very high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Please give me some kind of input so I can at least tell my doctors what to check for instead of them just acting like I am some kind of nut case.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!Oh, yes ..also I have severe lower back pain which is probably some more discs deteriorating.I have so many surgeries that I am now terrified of the idea of any more surgeries!",
