            "answer": "Some ideas for you (I have similar but not identical problems):Make sure you get enough vitamin b-12 (1000mcg/day, sublingual methylcolabamin form is what I was told to take) and b-1. Peroxidine is another important B vitamin but do not overdose; it can produce exactly the same symptoms with too much or too little.You may need a thorough lab workup. Anti-neuronal antibodies, diabetes or pre-diabetes, gluten insensitivity, immunoglobulin profile, thyroid (look at the sensory neuropathy suggestions at www.lizajane.org).Good luck!Don't forget B-12 (although once you start taking it, the supplements will hide any deficiency you could have now). Alpha lipoic acid can also help (800 mg a day was the smaller amount used in the published studies I have come across).",

    "question": "I am having burning sensation all over my body,from the neck down, it is constant, during the day,if I am up and about I really dont notice it that much, but if I sit or lie down, it really starts to bother me. I am starting to have difficluty falling asleep because of it. It seems to be on both sides, for example, if its on my arm, it ons both arms, if its on my thigh, its on both thighs, I also get these prickling feeling all over ocassionaly. There is no weakness in the muscle or numbness in any extremety, just theses annoying burning and pins and needle sensations.I had this same experience about 4 years ago, saw 2 neurologists, had blood tests, 3 MRI's and EMG. They really did not find anything wrong except 2 bulging discs. They gave me neurontin, paxil. It did nothing to relieve the symptoms. I went for physical therapy and then a chiropractoer, and it was useless, it seemed to make it worse. It eventually went away agter about 6 months. But now 4 years later it is back. I am not sure what I should do, go for all the tests again. I have seen a lot of postings here with similar symptoms, but I never see a resolution or diagnosis for these symptoms. Is there anybody out there that has actually found out what is causing this and how to alleviate the symptoms. Help!",
