            "answer": "Hi,I am very sorry about this serious health development for your father. It seems like his doctors are moving in the right direction i thinking about keeping him nourished as this is important for the healing process also.I your father's diabetes is atleast moderately well controlled, he should not have too many difficulties healing from the operation for the PEG tube. From what I recall, it is not a major surgery in terms of incision sizes(especially if it is being done by the GI or radiology teams). His doctors should ensure your Dad's blood sugars are well controlled overall during his stay in the hospital. A consultation with the diabetes service in the hospital may be a good idea.Take care .",

    "question": "Hi Doc, My dad is 63 and diabetic. He has been controlling his diabetes with injections. Last Friday (Dec 7), he suffered from a stroke (basal ganglioma), his left is paralysed and and has been receiving nutrients through an NG tube since Sunday noon. The doc recommended a PEG (tube through the abdominal wall) on Monday. My family and I are concerned about this surgery and his diabetic condition. We are concerned about the wound healing process. I would like your opinion or recommendation on this matter.Thank you very much.",
