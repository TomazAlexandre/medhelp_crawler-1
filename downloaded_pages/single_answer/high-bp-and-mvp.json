            "answer": "An increased systolic blood pressure will definitely increase the amount of regurgitation that occurs. That is why blood pressure control is so important - it actually reduces the amount of blood regurgitated with each beat and thus improves symptoms.I think new onset of symptoms is always a legitimate reason to contact the doctor, and you should do that. It might be that your elevated blood pressure is leading to all your symptoms and medication may help.",

    "question": "I have a 3\u00a0\u00a0MVP regurgitation.\u00a0\u00a0I also have aortic and annular calcification but without much stenosis.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking Cardizem CD, Plavix, Lozol, Lipitor, Zestril, and Catapres TTS1 to control atherosclerosis and blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is with my systolic BP, not the diastolic.\u00a0\u00a0I do not smoke or drink and never have.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabetes.Here are my questions:1. Can increased systolic BP create a greater problem with regurgitation?\u00a0\u00a0(It's back up again in the 170 range and I'm having a lot of trouble with fatigue.)2. Is a sharp pain in the upper left hand chest that has been coming and going for the last couple of days with durations of up to an hour at a shot important?I am never sure of when to contact a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that a lot of \"symptoms\" are not treatable or important and I do not want invasive tests that are not absolutely necessary.\u00a0\u00a0The last angiogram I had triggered a TIA and the last catheterization I had put my leg out of commission for months.Thanks so much for your comments.I always look forward to them.kd",
