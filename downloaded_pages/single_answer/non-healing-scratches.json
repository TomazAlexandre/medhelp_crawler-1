            "answer": "Hello,If your healing is not good, first of all, get your blood sugar levels done to rule out any diabetes. Other reasons are local infection, hypoxia (poor blood supply and thus oxygen supply to the skin and adjoining area), trauma, presence of foreign bodies, or systemic problems such as diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, immunodeficiency, or medications (like steroids).Best would be to consult a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hi, I have recently noticed that small wounds and scratches9 those that don't even bleed)are not healing properly. Scab forms over it and becomes thicker day by day with the wound becoming more and more painful and red and elevated. Today I accidentally got the scab off, there is big hole beneath it ( it started as a scratch) and it oozed clear fluid. I have prolonged PT and have always had multiple bruises on my skin, but my healing had been good. What has gone wrong?",
