            "answer": "Hi,The symptoms you have written in your post point to a lot of diagnosis which may be best ruled out by means of a history, physical and exams. However, there are a few which are of particular mention here. First is a Thyroid disorder.. This may be due to underperformance of the thyroid gland or decreased efficacy.Second is Diabetes Mellitus. This may be easily ruled out via exams.Thirdly is some spinal/skeletal disorder such as lumbar spondylosis.Each of them are distinct possibilities which may be elaborated.Hope this helped. You should take help from your doctor regarding this.Let me know if you need any other help.Best regards",
