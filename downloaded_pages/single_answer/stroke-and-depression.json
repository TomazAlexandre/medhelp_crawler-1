            "answer": "You've taken the first step and that is recognizing that you have depression.\u00a0\u00a0It is a BIGGIE.\u00a0\u00a0 It sounds like your stroke happenned relatively recently and you're still going through adjustments - both physical and emotional.\u00a0\u00a0 I hope your doctors are helping you through that -- you should not feel overwhelmed with all of these medical decisions (looking for the right meds combination, etc.) - let your doctor guide you.\u00a0\u00a0 They should have you on a good stroke prevention regimen (something for blood pressure, something for cholesterol, diabetes, if you have it, and a blood thinner or something like aspirin / plavix / aggrenox).\u00a0\u00a0 You should also be on an antiepileptic\u00a0\u00a0medication -- many patients have occasional seizures after they've had a stroke but it is easy to control and should not ruin your life.The best advice is:\u00a0\u00a0 talk to your doctor about your depression.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depending on the severity, you may be helped by talking to other stroke survivors, getting yourself involved in some community work or becoming closer to your family.\u00a0\u00a0 If your depression is severe, you may need a short course of antidepressant treatments -- it is VERY common for stroke survivors to require treatment to help them \"take the edge off.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You should definitely ask your doctor about it and if he/ she doesn't feel comfortable prescribing it, please, ask to see a psychiatrist or a geriatrician.\u00a0\u00a0 That would be the right thing to do to get your life back.You could also benefit from seeing a neuropsychologist who could administer a full battery of tests to see exactly where your memory troubles lie and, maybe, suggest therapy.One thing is clear:\u00a0\u00a0you will continue to get better -- seek help anytime you think otherwise!",
