            "answer": "Without a complete history, physical exam, lab review and medication list, I can\u2019t give you an exact diagnosis or treatment plan.\u00a0\u00a0We start to worry about liver function tests, one of which is ALT, when they are three times the upper limit of normal, which yours is nowhere near.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if you have been on Soriatane for 14 years, it is unlikely that it is causing an acute problem now.\u00a0\u00a0You say you are overweight and sometimes a fatty liver can cause a bump in the liver enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0Have you been tested for Hepatitis C?The number I would focus on more is your HgbA1C at 15.7.\u00a0\u00a0You want it to go below 7.0. The HgbA1C represents your sugar control in the last 2-3 months.\u00a0\u00a0The UKPDS study demonstrated for every percentage point decrease in HgbA1C (e.g., 9 to 8%), there was a 35% reduction in the risk of complications from retinopathy (which can lead to blindness) and nephropathy (which can lead to kidney failure).My advice would be to focus on getting your weight down to the normal range (BMI 18-24) and you may, more than likely, see all your \u201cnumbers\u201d heading toward normal.\u00a0\u00a0Best thing is to start slow by focusing on losing the first 5-10 lbs.",
