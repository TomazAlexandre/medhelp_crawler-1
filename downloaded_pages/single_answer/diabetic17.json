            "answer": "Maybe a bit more information would help. You were diagnosed Type 2? How long ago? What sort of a diet do you eat? The less carbs you eat the easier it is to control blood sugar. Do you exercise, even just walk regularly? Has your doctor tried you on various combinations of medication? You might try getting a referral to an endo as they have a lot more experience with diabetes.My next question, especially if you have only been diagnosed for a couple years or less, would be are you sure you are Type 2? You say you have lost 10 pounds, are you still significantly overweight? Do you have any other autoimmune disorders such as thyroid? The reason I ask is because I am similar age to you and I was assumed to be type 2 at diagnosis but am in fact LADA (a form of type 1).Finally, I'm a bit puzzled about your comment about insulin. Insulin is often cheaper than the type 2 meds you may be using and is covered by insurance. If you have been type 2 for many years or if you are LADA, you may no longer produce enough insulin yourself and then it is the only treatment that works to control blood sugar.",
