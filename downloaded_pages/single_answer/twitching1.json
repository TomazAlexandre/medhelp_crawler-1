Diabetes can cause peripheral neuropathy which can manifest as twitching in the muscles.As of now ALS does not seem to be a strong possibility as it is important to make sure your sugar levels are normal since you have a positive history of diabetes.Please get you levels done and keep us posted.",

Thnx I hope its not ALS cause that would be devastating .",
