            "answer": "I suggest seeing a different doctor...like in a walk in clinic. Do NOT tell them you have RA. Just tell them your symptoms.See what they have to say.I know how frustrating it can be when you have been previously diagnosed with something, and then every time you go to the doctor they attribute it to that one diagnosis.Sounds to me like something is being compressed. Spine relate possibly, but puzzled by the palpitations.Could be as \"simple\" as anxiety, but not likely.Have you been checked for diabetes? Diabetes can cause odd foot related symptoms.",

    "question": "I've had a laundry list of symptoms but because I have RA I feel like the doctors chalk everything up to that and don't do any real investigating or even offer suggestions for relief. The thing that has been plaguing me for several months is numbness. In both arms from the arm pit down and both legs from the knee down. It is greatly increased even lying down and I feel like there are rubber bands tired around my toes. In addition my chin and front of neck are sharing the same sensations. Also accompanied by faint palpitations. Any one have any ideas???",
