            "answer": "_Your father, as you describe him, has 2 serious strikes against him, and is behaving as though he couldn't care less.\u00a0\u00a0In some States a judge approached by the family of such an individual might agree to an involuntary commitment for treatment of his alcoholism, or appoint a guardian to make medical decisions for him.\u00a0\u00a0These are large and serious undertaking, and should only be considered witht the full involvement of local lawyers and physicians who have a clear picture of your father's medical conditions and who know the local statutes pertaining to competency issues and pertaining to involuntary treatment for alcoholism.\u00a0\u00a0Without a heavy-handed intervention (and, perhaps, in spite of one) your father's conditions will, in all likelihood, deteriorate further.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds to me that the best way to proceed is to work closely with a local physician who could guide you in caring for your father.\u00a0\u00a0If you work at it, you can probably even find someone in your area who could do a housecall and perform some basic laboratory tests.\u00a0\u00a0Once your father has been more carefully evaluated by a physician, you can get that doctor to give you some advice about \"what to look for.\"\u00a0\u00a0Until that time, use your common sense, and , when in doubt, pick up the phone and call the nearest emergency room for advice.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!This information is provided for general medical education purposes only.
