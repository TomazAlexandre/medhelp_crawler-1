            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Your symptoms may be the beginning of Carpal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by a compression of the median nerve which runs through your wrist.\u00a0\u00a0Usually this is associated with pain and numbness in your first three digits (thumb, index finger, and middle finger, and half of your fourth).\u00a0\u00a0 Excessive repetitive movements, such as typing, can lead to this condition.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes include:\u00a0\u00a0obesity, hypothyroidism, arthritis, diabetes, and trauma. Other differential diagnosis can include Ulnar nerve entrapment, which is compression of the ulnar nerve, which usually leads to pain and numbness in the fourth and fifth fingers.These can be diagnosed by electromyelography (EMG) and physical examination is also helpful.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend seeing your doctor to have it checked out.Hope this information was helpful.",
