            "answer": "Hi, shortness of breath can imply compromised cardiac function. Pregnancy and childbirth can aggravate prevailing\u00a0\u00a0heart conditions because increased work load. But your symptoms are persisting post child birth,\u00a0\u00a0so you will need to consult your doctor to rule out the probable causes. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms and also worsen the heart condition. So please consult your primary care physician who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest. Lung function tests could further help in evaluation. Regards.",

    "question": "I have PVC's, since I gave birth to my daughter three month's ago my PVC's have been increased to the point that I feel ill, and even have chest pressure. I've had PVC's since 2009, controlled by medication, however I want to know why my PVC's have increased, some days I'm ill all day long, and other days I'm okay. I've been having shortness of breathes during these episodes. Please let me know if this is due to the birth of my child or because i was pregnant. Thank you,Monie",
