            "answer": "Hi!The numbness can be due to compression of L5 and S1 spinal nerve roots. This can be confirmed by nerve conduction studies. Physiotherapy, manual therapy, hydrotherapy, weight loss (if need be) and exercise can help you reduce the numbness. Please discuss with a neurologist or spine specialist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "This is very strange to me. Over the last few weeks I have noticed a numbness on the insides of both of my shins starting around the bottom of the ankle, up to just below the calf muscle. I can feel pressure,but that may just be a sensation to the surrounding non-numb area. There is very little sensation from anything just touching the skin though, and what there is is sort of a generalized tingling. (for instance if I place a pencil eraser against a spot I do not feel it specifically in that spot, just the whole general area slightly registers contact. What is strange about this to me is that it is identicle on both legs, inside from ankle to calf muscle. A little medical history I has slipped a disc in my back once long ago, but no other potential nerve damage. I smoke, drink beer, eat red meat and don't really pay any attention to my diet. I am not obese or even out of shape at all, and there is no history of diabetes in my family, my grandmother had MS. That's all I can think of that might be relevant. There is no pain involved, but it is troubling to me as it was just sort of out of nowhere and the symmetry of the condition on both legs makes me think\u00a0\u00a0it can't be due to some injury, but maybe some kind of nerve issue. So what's going on?-James",
