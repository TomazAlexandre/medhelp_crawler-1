            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Actually, brain recovery is very difficult to predict. Also it depends on the area under pressure. Yes, it is quite common to lose proper speech, articulation, and comprehension after brain surgery. Also, it is important to rule out if there is infection or a recurrence of hematoma. Usually a speech therapist-physiotherapist combination works on the patient to improve and hasten the process of speech recovery.You could probably discuss these issues with your father's treating doctors. Wishing him a speedy recovery! Take care!",

    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0My dad had emergency for subdural hematoma about 10 days ago.\u00a0\u00a0We're not sure what caused it as there was no head trauma, but his doctors say it's a combination of old age (my dad is 66 years old), has mild/moderate diabetes, high blood pressure and has been taking aspirin for the last few months.\u00a0\u00a0He was just taken off of the heart and respiratory monitors, but is not yet mobile.He's alert and conscious and responsive, but his speech is garbled.\u00a0\u00a0He speaks words, but in an incomprehensible order.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like he knows what he wants to say, but has trouble getting the words out.\u00a0\u00a0He seems to understand what we say to him.\u00a0\u00a0I first saw him a couple of days ago, on day 8.\u00a0\u00a0His speech was not as I've just described; we were able to understand him.\u00a0\u00a0However, that night he complained of pressure in his head, and his speech hasn't been the same since.The doctors say this is normal progress.\u00a0\u00a0They say it may take up to 3 months for him to fully recover his speech.\u00a0\u00a0I'd like to exercise a healthy level of skepticism and get a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Your experience input is appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks much.",
