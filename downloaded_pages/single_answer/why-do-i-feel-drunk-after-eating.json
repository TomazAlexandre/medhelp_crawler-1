            "answer": "Could be leaky gut syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Although LGS is not approved by the medical establishment as a recognized condition, people who practice alternative medicine have been using probiotics for years to treat this condition.\u00a0\u00a0What happens is the coating inside the intestine becomes damaged and bad toxins leak out into the blood stream.\u00a0\u00a0Probiotics add good bacteria to trump the bad allowing the lining to repair itself.\u00a0\u00a0Garlic cloves, and any dark green vegtables work good also. If you can manage to eat four cloves of raw garlic for 4 weeks you will clean out your intestional tract ridding itself of most of the bad bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0Fiber and lots of water helps flush out the system as well.\u00a0\u00a0Stay away from carbs, sugars, and alcohol until system is cleaned and repaired.\u00a0\u00a0Better yet limit all sugar based products all together.Note: Serious medical conditions may to blame such as liver disease, diabetes and othe intestenial disorders.\u00a0\u00a0I would highly reccomend consulting with a doctor preferably a gastrointestenial one at best.",

    "question": "Lately after I eat I've been feeling drunk. The room doesn't spin or anything like that, but I definitely feel like I just chugged down a few beers. This has been occurring for about the last week now. I had some blood work done a few weeks ago for something unrelated, and the results came back fine. Other than my iron being a little low, my blood work was fine. I'm not diabetic, I don't have any serious vitamin or mineral deficiencies, my blood pressure is normal, I don't have any food allergies other than shell fish, and I'm not experiencing any pain or other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0This doesn't happen all the time, typically when I eat after a workout (I wait 2 or 2 1/2 hours), or after a large meal. Any idea what might cause this?",
