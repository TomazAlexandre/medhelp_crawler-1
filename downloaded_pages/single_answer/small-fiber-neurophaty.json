Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I cannot tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Small fiber neuropathy has been found to be associated with many medical conditions, including diabetes, connective tissue disease, thyroid disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency, paraproteinemia, HIV, hepatitis C, celiac disease, restless legs syndrome, toxic drug exposure, paraneoplastic syndromes, and Sjogren disease.\u00a0\u00a0There is, however, no described relationship between small fiber neuropathy and degenerative lumbosacral spine disease, although both disease processes can result in similar symptoms.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
