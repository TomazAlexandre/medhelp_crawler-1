            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The tingling are probably very mild seizures. The other possibility is deficiency of iron, calcium, Vit D, Vit B12. There could be hyperthyroidism or diabetes. Both can cause whole body tingling. At times electrolyte imbalance in the body can cause similar symptoms. Hence sodium and potassium levels would need to be checked. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your pediatrician and run the tests for these.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
