    "question": "Hi, I had a positive ANA in June of this year, and went back in for complete ANA panel.\u00a0\u00a0All results were completely normaly minus the Anti-DNA (DS) AbQn which was 13. I am a Type 1 diabetic (for 30 years), have no complications and keep it well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0I have never been diagnosed with arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0I have a spot on my hand which hurts and can swell, but it's not joint related (or on a joint) and only bad after spending lots of time on laptop or iPhone.Does this mean I have Lupus?\u00a0\u00a0I don't have any of the other symptoms out of the 11.\u00a0\u00a0So, I have two for sure, MAYBE you can count arthritis as being the third, but I definitely have no other of the 11 conditions which you must have 4.HELP.\u00a0\u00a0I did have this blood work done 1 week after a balloon sinuplasty so I did have significant nasal swelling and also was starting to get a sinus infection. Could this be it?\u00a0\u00a0I do have Hashimotos thyroiditis as well.\u00a0\u00a0I realize I'm more predisposed to getting autoimmune disorders because of my Type 1 diabetes, but this is freaking me out.\u00a0\u00a0I just got lab results today when I can't talk to my doctor's office.... But could Hashimotos, diabetes, or sinus infection cause the out of range Anti-DNA test???Please help, I'm very anxious and worried.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 36 years old and healthy with a precious 3 year old boy.",
