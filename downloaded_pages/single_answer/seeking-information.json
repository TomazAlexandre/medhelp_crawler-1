            "answer": "I suggest that you contact the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. On their website, www.jdrf.org, you will see a link on the left of the page that says 'Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST)'. Click on this link and then fill out and submit the form that pops up on your screen. When you submit this request, a volunteer will match your request for help with someone who can e-mail with you one-on-one to answer specific questions to help educate you about type 1 diabetes and about his issues as you describe them. They can also put you in contact with the local chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which might be a source of support for both of you.By the way, what you write about emotional swings corresponding directly to sugar ups and downs is true of most of us. The real key to controlling this is to test often and adjust either insulin or food intake often to keep lows and highs from happening before they affect how he feels. The emotional issues are rooted in very physical imbalances and getting those sugar levels stabilized will help him a great deal.And sometimes when the numbers are off, folks tend to feel guilty and feel ill and feel sorry for ourselves. This, too, is very normal although no fun. So the two issues both play a part. Having other folks to encourage him is a good thing. You sound like a wonderful girlfriend to care about these issues. I hope JDRF can give you some information and some help.",

    "question": "My boyfriend has Type 1 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0For the most part, according to his family, his management of the diabetes has improved with the onset of our relationship.\u00a0\u00a0I try to be helpful without being overbearing, as it seems sometimes he is a touch secretive as to not worry me.He has suffered a stroke in his late 20's.\u00a0\u00a0He does tend to get emotional, overly stressed about small things, though this is a family trait, as well.I noticed his attention paid to his diabetes waivers sometimes, and his mood swings to sometimes accompany the days where his sugar seems less even (high and low)Where can I go to find more information on proper diet, educate myself further to see the warning signs coming from him, and how I can maybe manage my actions to not stress him out without turning my own head inside out?He notices when I try to be accomodating wether physically or emotionally, so I need to find support on how to go about this without his notice and worry.His emotional state corresponds directly with his sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know which one causes the other.I appreciate any input from you all.\u00a0\u00a0He is the love of my life, and I do not see his diabetes as an obstacle.\u00a0\u00a0However, I would like to be a help and not a hinderance.Thanks!",
