            "answer": "Hello,Without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of the lesion. In acanthosis nigrans there is insulin resistance which leads to increased circulating insulin levels. This insulin spillover into the skin results in its abnormal increase in growth of the skin, though localized discoloration around the toes is unlikely to be related to a systemic issue. Wearing shoes that do not fit properly or going barefoot in the sun can also lead to darkening of the skin. Other possibilities that may need to be considered include infections, inflammations etc. I would suggest consulting a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Take care and regards!",

    "question": "I have brown velvety patches of skin on the knuckles of my toes, and was wondering whether this could be acanthosis nigricans (my mom said it looks like acanthosis nigricans) or something else. For a couple of weeks I was feeling thirsty at night before I went to bed, so my mom tested my blood sugar and it wasn't high, so I didn't probably have diabetes. Could acanthosis nigricans indicate some other endocrine disorder? Or maybe it's not even acanthosis nigricans? It's probably nothing, I'm just curious.",
