            "answer": "Hi there. Extra pyramidal disorder refers to defects in basal ganglia function, characterized by changes in the muscle tone, poverty of voluntary movements or abnormal involuntary movements. An occipital nerve block is an injection of steroid or local anesthetic around the greater and lesser occipital nerves located on the back of head above the neck. Steroids reduce inflammation and tissue swelling around the occipital nerves. This may reduce pain or other symptoms due to tension headaches or migraines. The only true contraindications to these nerve blocks are any known allergies to the medications injected, if you are on any blood thinners, any active ongoing infection, poorly controlled diabetes, heart disease, you need to postpone the block. Otherwise, it is not known to interfere with the extra pyramidal disorder. Hope this helps. Take care..",
