            "answer": "Since you have a family history of diabetes, I'd have to ask if you've checked with your doctor to make sure you don't have any underlying medical issues such as hypothyroidism, PCOS and/or insulin resistance, which can be a forerunner to type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You should also check side effects of any meds you might be taking to see if weight gain is one of them and if so, you might ask your doctor for something else that might not cause weight gain.Can you tell us what kinds of things you eat?\u00a0\u00a0What kind of exercise you prefer?\u00a0\u00a0Do you keep a food diary?\u00a0\u00a0It's generally figured that losing 1-2 pounds/week is safest and we have some members who have lost large amounts of weight, so you aren't alone. It's necessary to incorporate a sensible diet with moderate exercise and make \"small\" changes that you can live with, rather than trying to cut back to a 1000 calorie diet and exercise full tilt, all at once.\u00a0\u00a0That wouldn't be a routine that you would be able to stick with.One small change to begin with would be replacing a soda a day with a glass of water; exchange one candy bar for an apple, etc.\u00a0\u00a0If you stick with it, each small change will eventually become a habit until ultimately you drink all water and no sodas or eat fresh fruits and veggies instead of candy, along with whatever other \"healthy\" habits you form.The first thing I'd recommend is a food diary, in which you record every morsel of food or sip of drink, that goes into your mouth.\u00a0\u00a0That will tell you how many calories/day you are eating and will also help figure out where you need to cut back (fat? sugar?, etc) and what foods you may need to increase (protein? dairy? fiber?).\u00a0\u00a0Med Help has an excellent food diary and when you initially set it up, using your personal info, it will tell you how many calories you need daily to MAINTAIN your current weight - it will be your job, then to eat LESS calories or exercise MORE in order to create a deficit in calories.You should try to center your eating around lean protein, fresh/frozen fruits and veggies, low/no fat dairy, etc.\u00a0\u00a0And I'd also recommend a good multi vitamin daily to make sure you get the proper nutrients.I'd also recommend that you implement the weight tracker, which will help you see \"trends\"; and the exercise tracker, which will help you calculate calories expended during your exercise sessions.\u00a0\u00a0You can also make notes on these trackers or keep a journal to keep up with how you feel -- happy, sad, depressed, etc to help determine if you are engaging in emotional eating and if so, what emotions trigger it the most.Hope this helps you get started and we'll be here to help you move on to the next steps.",
