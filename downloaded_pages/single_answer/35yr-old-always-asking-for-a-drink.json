            "answer": "I am having a VERY similar issue with my 2 year old.\u00a0\u00a0There are only a couple of possibilities with the water drinking.\u00a0\u00a01)Diabetes Melitus- regular diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You should have his pediatrician check his urine for sugar and ketones.2) Diabetes Insipidus- not like regular diabetes, it relates to the hormone that causes the kidneys to produce urine.\u00a0\u00a0In that case the kidneys over production of urine causes the extreme thirst.\u00a0\u00a0It's usually diagnosed by MRI (for central diabetes insipidus) or blood tests.3) Psycogenic water drinking- An attachment to drinking water, but usually they dont wake up at night to drink.My 2 year old has been drinking water for almost 4 months, waking at night to drink, has dry skin on hands, feet and scalp and is having occasional instances of Ketosis with acetone breath and ketones in her urine.\u00a0\u00a0We've had an MRI but everything looked normal.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, Im really pushing for a pediatric Endocrinologist.I wish you the best of luck in finding answers for your little one.\u00a0\u00a0Dont let it slide, if he's crying for water something is probably going on.Callie",

    "question": "I am a pharmacist, so obviously my mind tracks to areas that sometimes it shouldnt...but this is something that I haven't been able to shake.\u00a0\u00a0My son, who is about 3 and a half...wakes up every morning, and the first words out of his mouth are I want something to eat and something to drink.\u00a0\u00a0He doesnt go for very long without asking for a drink, or saying he is thirsty...and acting so pitiful about it too.\u00a0\u00a0His lips are almost always dry/chapped looking...but he is always peeing.\u00a0\u00a0We will go potty, and it will be a good bit.\u00a0\u00a0And not but 10 minutes later, he is having to go again!\u00a0\u00a0I havent seen any weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0He wakes up in the middle of the night sometimes crying hysterically, and it seems like the only thing he wants is a glass of water, that he will CHUG and then pass out again.\u00a0\u00a0He has recently been going to bed a LOT earlier than usual...falling asleep in the car, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I attributed it to early mornings, but that doesnt seem right either.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes he acts a little spacy- but I dont know about that either.\u00a0\u00a0He always has had a problem with rashes on his butt and legs area, and they just never seem to go away.\u00a0\u00a0I just dont know what is NORMAL for him to be drinking, or if this is something to legitimately be concerned about.\u00a0\u00a0My dad's father had diabetes, but that is all for the family history.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions or ideas?\u00a0\u00a0I plan on giving the pediatrician a call, but it is still a concern.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!\u00a0\u00a0Nichole",
