            "answer": "It is disappointing to have all these tests done and no answers.You obviously didn't have enough for a Lupus or Sjogren's dx.Equally disappointing is the fact that you were tested for thyroid,with only one test, which is the least indicative of thyroid function-TSH.Really? You really have many symptoms of hypothyroidism.Please ask for Free T3 (ft3), Free T4 (ft4), Reverse T3 (rt3)Another suspicion is OAT (ovary-adrenal-thyroid) Axis Imbalance,however conventional endocrinologists won't help you with this, as it isoutside the scope of their practice.A Functional Medicine Doctor, trained in Holistic Endocrinology, would beable to treat such an imbalance.I hope this helps.Niko",
