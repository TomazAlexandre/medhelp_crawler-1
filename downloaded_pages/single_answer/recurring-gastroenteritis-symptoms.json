    "question": "I had a bout of what I believed to be gastroenteritis about a month ago. I am currently working overseas and when the symptoms began I went to a doctor but due to language difficulties I wasn't really sure if the doctor diagnosed gastroenteritis or not. The doctor prescribed antibiotics and within two weeks I was fine again. In the last two days I've started to suffer from some of the same symptoms again; mild fever, tiredness, excessive thirst, mild muscle pain and bowel discomfort. The symptoms are not as strong as the first time and I'm not suffering from diarrhea to the same extent as the last time although my stools are small and many. I've been watching what I eat very carefully and I haven't eaten out since the last time I was sick. The only coincidence with both bouts is that I ate lots of cherries about a day or two before the symptoms started, (cherries are in season here and they are delicious but they are something that I never eat at home). I can't imagine that they would be the cause but they are really the only common factor. Should I be worried about something like diabetes or can gastroenteritis recur in this manner?",
