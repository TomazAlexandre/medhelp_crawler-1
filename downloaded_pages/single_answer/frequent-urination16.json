    "question": "Hello,I am a 54 year old female with Interstitial Cystitis and IBS/Colitis. I take Vesicare and Librex for these conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past week I have been retaining fluids and have had dull pain in my lower abdomen. I started taking Macrobid because I have had trouble urinating much but going frequently. It didn't seem to help. I saw my gastroenterologist yesterday and told her what is going on. She examined me and prescribed Cipro because it helps with both UTI and bowel tenderness. Last night I experienced some of the worst cramping in my left side down into my rectal area. Finally after several minutes of this pain I had a very soft bowel movement. This happened twice more before I could lie down and sleep. I woke up during the night 4 times between the hours of 11pm to 8am urinating in large amounts. Today I have had one more bout of the soft stool and feel sore and weak. If I have another bout of this type of diarrhea would it be advisable to take Immodium? I just started the Cipro an hour ago. Thank you.",
