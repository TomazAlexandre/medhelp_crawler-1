            "answer": "It sounds like your aunt needs a full evaluation by a urologist or urogynecologist, which should help explain why her urine is not flowing. Is it because the bladder muscle is non functional? or because the urethral sphincter does not relax. If the bladder muscle is not able to contract, then a catheter may be the most effective solution. If the urethra is not relaxing, then alterations to medications may be helpful.A cystoscopy would help identify any lesions in the bladder which may a;sp be causing her symptoms. A biopsy would be done if there were any lesions seen. Cystoscopy can be done in the office or in the Operating room depending on the patient's need for anesthesia.Diabetes can often have an adverse impact on bladder function.Dr Hoyte",
