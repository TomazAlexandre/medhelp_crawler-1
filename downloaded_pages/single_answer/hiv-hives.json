    "question": "Hi,I had received unprotected oral sex from a stripper one and a half years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing else.\u00a0\u00a0I've had a couple of CBC tests done this past year because I have diabetes but no STD testing (partly because I'm too scared).\u00a0\u00a0The CBC results came back fine.However, within this past month, I've had the case of hives that wont go away.\u00a0\u00a0It is mainly on my arms and crotch area.\u00a0\u00a0They appear for a couple of hours and then dissapear.\u00a0\u00a0I took some over the counter medication and they stopped but when I'm off the medication, the hives reappear again.Could these be related to HIV and do I need to get tested for my activity?Thanks in advance.",
