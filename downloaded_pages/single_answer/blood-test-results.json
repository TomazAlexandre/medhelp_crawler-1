            "answer": "Hi!Normally there are no parietal cell antibodies in the blood. So, the test is negative. If the test comes positive, then this may be due to pernicious anemia, gastric ulcer, atrophic gastritis, diabetes or thyroid disease. Please discuss the results with your treating doctor.Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
