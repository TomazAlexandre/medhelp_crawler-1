            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor with your parents to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.Fungal infections of the human body are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.You are right in saying that vitiligo can be hereditary and often runs in families.Diagnosis can be confirmed by external examination, blood tests to check skin cell count\u00a0\u00a0for melanocytes and biopsy of the skin patches.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",
