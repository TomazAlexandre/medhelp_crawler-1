    "question": "I would like advise on HCG, I am a Diabetes 2 patient, non medication. I control it by diet. I have food cravings real bad, and it is difficult to keep from eating too much. I am afraid of becoming insulin dependent. I don't want that to happen. Although I am not overweight, would I be able to stand the HCG diet of 500 calories? I could stand to loose fat on stomach and thighs.\u00a0\u00a0I have a small frame, my wrists are only 5 1/2 inches round. I weight 115, and I am 5 Ft 4 inches tall.\u00a0\u00a0Should I try the diet?\u00a0\u00a0Should I try the HCG injections too? Does the injections suppress the appetite.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think I could stand a 500 calorie diet without appetite suppression. Maybe I should just do the diet, but more calories.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone out there have any experience that would help me decide. I will of course go to a doctor first before making a final decision.",
