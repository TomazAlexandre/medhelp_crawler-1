            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The possibility of a sleep related disorder cannot be totally ruled out. This needs to be confirmed by sleep studies. The other possibility is low blood sugar or hypoglycemia. This can cause convulsions if it dips too low and twitches during the day.I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Tuesday morning when I woke up, I checked my email only to find that my first class was cancelled so I went back to bed. at one point my entire body was convulsing, as if I were having a seizure, so I tried to call for help but I couldn't scream or move. afterwards I was asleep and dreaming. I caanot tell if this was a dream, or if it really happened. This is the third time in three years that something like this occured. The last time that this happened was either in the fall of 2006 or the winter of 2007, and the two incidents were around the same time, the onl difference was that those times I also saw red and yellow flashing lights, like the entire room was flashing these colors. during this most recent episode, there were no flashing colors, just the bedroom as it normally appears. Also during the day when I am fully awake I have a tendency to twitch, whether it be a full body shiver, or just something with my arms. This will happen in 90 degree weather, so It cannot be because I am cold. a\u00a0\u00a0couple of my friends tease me, saying I have non-verbal tourettes. Someone suggested to me that what I had experienced was just sleep paralysis, but I can't escape the feeling that there is more to it.",
