            "answer": "First, you\u2019ll need to be more specific about what you consider to be \u201cerectile dysfunction.\u201d This is a term that means many different things to different people. Are you referring to erections? If so, do you have erections upon awakening? It\u2019s also important to remember that if you\u2019re having erections at other times besides with a partner (e.g., morning erections), chances are there aren\u2019t any physical causes and there\u2019s something psychological contributing to your concern. If you AREN\u2019T having erections at all, then perhaps diabetes has affected the blood flow to your penis. You should ask your doctor about this and schedule an exam with a urologist to determine whether your circulation has been affected. If so, you have some options, such as medications that can increase blood flow.However, if you don\u2019t have a physical condition which affects erection, here\u2019s some information for you. When you're younger and just beginning to be sexual with others, erections pop up everywhere--including when you don't want them! Post-pubescent men are highly excitable. Most men find that once they leave their teens, they need more direct and intense stimulation. As you age, you'll find that erections sometimes take longer, and even come and go. This is not an indication if ill health, but just part of life. Sexual interest ebbs and flows as well, depending on other circumstances in your life.If you\u2019re conflicted about sex, or uninterested, or some other psychological or emotional concern is preventing you from being turned on, all the pills in the world can\u2019t help that. And the more stress you\u2019re under, the less energy your body has to respond sexually. Two other reasons why you might not be having erections are that you\u2019re bored with your current partner or the sexual activities you\u2019re doing together, or that there are some conflicts in the relationship and you\u2019re feeling anxious or angry. Something is getting in the way of your enjoyment, and you\u2019ll need to find out what it is. Best of luck. Dr. J",
