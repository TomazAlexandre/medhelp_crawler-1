            "answer": "You have a very diffucult situation. I suggest that you see a doctor that specializes in recurrent pregnancy loss and do a complete workup. Here is some general information from my website:Recurrent pregnancy loss can be attributed to many different causes. These causes include: genetic factors (e.g. abnormal fetal chromosomes, abnormal parental chromosomes); anatomic factors (e.g. structural abnormalities of the uterus such as scar tissue in the uterus, or congenital abnormalities of the uterus such as septate uterus); metabolic factors (e.g. diabetes); endocrine factors (e.g. abnormal thyroid, PCOS, diminished ovarian reserve); infectious factors (e.g. chlamydia, mycoplasma, ureaplasma); thrombotic factors (e.g. inherited thrombophilias); immunologic factors (e.g. anticardiolipin antibodies, autoimmune disorders, increased natural killer cell activity); male factors (e.g. sperm DNA fragmentation); and environmental factors (e.g. exposure to environmental toxins).",
