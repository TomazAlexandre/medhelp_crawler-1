            "answer": "Hi. The very high ALT would suggest liver and bile duct disease as the most obvious. Although it can also be high with any ingestion of poisons, pancreatitis and Cushings, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, heartworm treatments, and hemolytic anemia. The BUN/creatinine ratio is only very slightly out of range. The alkaline phosphatase is very high and again points to liver issues. Cushings is also a potential issue, as is heart disease. High Triglycerides tend to point to liver issues again, but also potentially hypothyroidism. High platelet counts are quite rare. The most likely is a connection to liver issues or Cushings.I think therefore your vet is going down the right route. Discounting Cushings is certainly the first priority, followed by looking more closely at liver issues and having a thyroid function (T3/T4) test undertaken.Tony",

    "question": "I have 12 year old long-haired Chihuahua that I took for the annual vet appointment. Some of her numbers came back elevated: ALT - 285, ALKP - 348, BUN/Creatinine Ratio -\u00a0\u00a031, Triglycerides - 674 & Platelet Count at 708. Did anyone have a similar situation and what was the outcome and the actions taken? She is my baby and I want to make sure she is taken care of. My vet suggested testing for the Cushing's disease. Any advise is greatly appreciated.",
