            "answer": "Hello,Various reasons for recurrent or persistent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Treatment resistance can be overcome by applying a cream with a combination of antifungals (Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1% and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%).It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Selsun blue medicated works short term and definitely relieves the itch- when I was a kid my doctor prescribed it for a skin fungus that appeared on my back from swimming in a neighbors inflated pool. The instructions were to put a thin layer of it on my back at night, let it dry, and sleep through the night with it. In the morning, wash it off and continue every night for a week. It completely disappeared and I never got the skin fungus again. Fast forward to the future, my then 4 year old daughter gets ring worm from a childhood friend and soon my daughter will be turning 8 and she continues to get it every other month and passes it to me. We will use the selsun blue and it works by getting rid of the ringworm, but the ring worm keeps reoccurring. It works short term, but it does relieve the itch. Maybe if it were the same selsun blue from when I was a kid; it would have eliminated the ringworm indefinitely. -- Does anyone have any better ideas, I have already been to my doctor who has prescribed oral anti fungal medicine-- works and keeps ringworm away a little longer than selsun blue, but not indefinitely.",
