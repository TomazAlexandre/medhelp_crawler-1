            "answer": "Hi, laxatives used long term can cause tolerance, so best avoided. As for your symptoms, IBS can produce a feeling of incomplete defecation. Then again please check for Diabetes as this can affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves leading to bowel symptoms. This can be detected by a simple blood test. Also local pathologies in the rectum like growths or inflammatory diseases can also leave a feeling to defecation. For this a proctoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy will help detect the lesion. So, would advise you to discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time. Regards.",
