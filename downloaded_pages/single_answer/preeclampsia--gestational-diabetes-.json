    "question": "Has anyone ever been diagnosed with both preeclampsia & GD during the same pregnancy? How did your pregnancy/delivery go? I am 27 weeks, 2nd pregnancy, and have both. I'm nervous about how the pregnancy will proceed. The doctor is saying I need to make it to 35 weeks before she will induce, unless it becomes harmful to the baby.",
