            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Your symptoms could be due to a recurrence of Carpel Tunnel Syndrome. The nerve innervating (supplying) the thumb, the index finger and the middle fingers is the median nerve. This can get compressed in the wrist, leading to numbness of these areas. The nerve can get compressed due to obesity, Diabetes Mellitus, hypothyroidism, arthritis and trauma. In your case hypothyroidism is the likely culprit.For a cure you have to control the hypothyroid status. I would advise you to consult your doctor for a reevaluation of the thyroid profile.Also, good working style like working without bending the wrist, smooth movements and taking breaks in between for stretching the hands will help control symptoms of carpel tunnel syndrome. Further wearing wrist support or wrist braces can further support along with strengthening exercises.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
