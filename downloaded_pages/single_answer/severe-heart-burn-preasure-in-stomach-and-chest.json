            "answer": "Sorry to know that you are facing so many problems and symptoms which are confusing you. I am not a doctor but I also suffered MI eight months back. About a month back when my cardiologist increased my coreg intake from 12.5mgx2 to 18.75mgx2 I had all the problems which you have mentioned about feeling of need to burps, dizzyness, tingling in head and chocking sensation. If you have changed, increased or added some drug recently please check with your doctor for their side effects. But I know from this forum that some medicines do have these side effects and as the body gets used to them the symptoms reduce.Good Luck",
