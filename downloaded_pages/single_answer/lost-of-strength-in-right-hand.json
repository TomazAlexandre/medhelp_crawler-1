    "question": "I am single woman looking for answer to a health problem that just came up today while staining a wood floor in a 136 yr old house....Without a mask but with all windows opened, I was staining the floor with my boyfriend..Once we completed the job, after abt 2 hours, I noticed my right hand was twitching...It felt numb...I was using my left hand for staining with a brush most of the time and was putting weight on my right side...The twitching and numbness is still there and I have lost strength in it..Do I need to see a doctor or should I wait 24 hrs and see if my strength returns in my right hand? What procautions should I take when staining floors..next is the polyerethane of the floor...I also had a heachache after exposure to the stain..Should I wear a mask? and or limit or keep out of the room until I feel better..Thanks",
