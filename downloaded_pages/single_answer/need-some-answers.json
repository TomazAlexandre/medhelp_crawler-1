            "answer": "Hi!In all probability your mother has some balance problem due to internal ear infections. She could also be having myoclonus secondary to ear infection, which may also have affected her brain. Another reason for the myoclonus causing head jerks is peripheral neuropathy (diabetes, thyroid problems, lupus etc) or pinched nerve in neck (MRI or nerve conduction studies or EMGs would be diagnostic). Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
