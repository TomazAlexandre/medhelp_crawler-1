            "answer": "Moderately increased microalbumin levels in urine indicate that a person is in one of the very early phases of developing kidney disease. Very high levels are an indication that kidney disease is present in a more severe form. Lower than normal can indicate kidney issues and/or liver disease [cirrhosis, hepatitis, ascites].Your posted levels are questionable without the lab ranges as every lab usually sets their own ranges to specific tests. My current lab sets serum albumin ranges from 3.3 - 4.7 g/dl. Another lab has their range at 10 -15 g/dl.You might get specifics to your question answered by posting on the kidney forum and/or by using Google search..",

    "question": "what does it mean when the miroalbumin/random is 28.4 and calcium/microalbumin/creatine random is 212.I know it is an indication of diabetes or kidney desease. My question is are this values reflecting an advance kidney desease? I know that normal range is way lower than this.Please explain",
