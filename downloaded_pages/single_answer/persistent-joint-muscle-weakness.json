            "answer": "There are two main categories of diseases that could explain your symptoms: vascular and neurologic. If for some reason, you are not getting enough blood supply to your legs, this can result in pain on walking. Ask yourself how far can you walk before your legs start to hurt (especially calves). Usually with vascular problems, the symptoms should go away with rest which includes sitting.\u00a0\u00a0The workup which is usually initiated by a primary care doc would include checking the pulses in the legs and looking at the arterial blood flow/pressure there with special tests.Neurological causes are numerous but point to either a peripheral neuropathy (a general term for an abnormality in the nerve or nerve coverings in your legs) or muscle disorder. Start with an exam by a neurologist. This will help point you in the right direction in terms of laboratory testing (checking for diabetes, thyroid disease, vitamin deficiencies,electrolyte abnormalities, muscle proteins and breakdown products like CK enzymes and lactic acid. There are also metabolic derangements that can be checked for in which your muscles get weak with exercise because of their abnormal processing of oxygen and sugar. Then an EMG or electromyogram which is a study that looks at the integrity of your muscles and nerves can be very helpful in localizing th problem. Talk to your primary care doc about getting a routine exam and then a referral to a neuro. Best of luck.",

    "question": "I am a 44 year old male.\u00a0\u00a0I would consider my overall physical state as healthy although I am overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I had a physical in February of 2001 and everything was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I take vitamins daily to account for any discrepencies in my diet.\u00a0\u00a0I am a teacher but, other than that, lead a rather sedentary lifestyle.Several months ago I began to experience a sensation originating in my right ankle.\u00a0\u00a0It felt like I was being injected with a warm solution.\u00a0\u00a0The sensation began to make it's way up to the calf area.Within several weeks I began to experience muscle weakness in both legs.\u00a0\u00a0It has been bothering me every day since.\u00a0\u00a0I would estimate that about 40% of the time the weakness/pain is in my ankles/feet, another 40% of the time in my calves and the other 20% of the time in my knees/hamstrings.\u00a0\u00a0Muscle twitching in my calves, ankles upper legs is common, also.\u00a0\u00a0I have not, as of yet, had any problems with my upper body.Even the smallest amount of exercise makes my legs feel weak, like they have just run in a marathon.The weakness/pain is relieved by lying down but not by sitting down.\u00a0\u00a0If I lie on the couch it seems to help a lot and I don't have any problems sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0When I arise in the morning my legs feel pretty good until I start walking around.I am looking for some direction and some suggestions as to how to proceed.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like a neurological problem or perhaps something else?Thank you for your help!",
