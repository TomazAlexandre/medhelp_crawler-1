            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms are suggestive of early satiety(feeling of fullness even before completion of meals).Causes for early satiety are gastritis,gastroparesis(delayed gastric emptying,a disorder in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents),gastric outlet obstruction,heartburns due to acid reflux(GERD),irritable bowel syndrome,diabetes,hyperthyroidism ,cushing\u2019s disease and rarely GI esp stomach tumors.Other possibilities for your chronic abdominal pain and severe bloating are high salt intake,too little proteins in diet,food allergies,gallstones,H.pylori infestation, Functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS) and chronic pancreatitis.In my opinion,pls discuss these possibilities with your gastroenterologist and get them ryled out one by one to reach a confirmatory diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
