            "answer": "Hello,Constipation can cause pressure on the prostate but it is unlikely to cause any erection problems. Get it evaluated from a urologist and get other causes of erectile dysfunction ruled out. The causes are many like diabetes, depression, autonomic nervous system problem, excessive alcohol ingestion or tobacco smoking etc. You may need to consult your doctor to see which amongst these causes are responsible for your problem.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "So, I believe I am currently constipated, and ever since being that my penis has been lump. There are no pain or anything like that, I just cant really feel it anymore. Now this has been going on for 1 day now, and today I started getting some red rash on the foreskin, with red dots on the head of the penis.Is there a reason to worry about this, or should it go back to normal once the constipation is out of the world?",
