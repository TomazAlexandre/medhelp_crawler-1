    "question": "Hi,I have been having stomach problems for a while now and over the past few weeks it has gotten really bad. I have been to see my doctor and he has put me on omeprazole. The pain doesn't seemt to be doing away but is getting worse and spreading to other areasI have pain above my navel and also (this pain wasn't there a few weeks ago) under my ribs to the right. My symtoms did not include these when I first started to feel ill! First it was lower abdominal pain, dizzyness and headaches. I have had blood tests and they were normal/negative for anemia and diabetes.Then about 3 weeks ago I felt a sharp pain in my stomach and fainted and went to the hospital. They just have me some antacids and told me to go home.I have seen my doctor many times and I feel like they are not listening to my problems or my symptoms which I feel are getting worse and are now seriously effecting me everyday.I have another appointment in 2 weeks, but I am worried about my symptoms. Can anyone shed any light on what this could be????",
