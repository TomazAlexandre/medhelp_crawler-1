    "question": "Hi allHistory:I am a 46 year old male and run TRT, not overweight, blood pressure currently 140/80 it has been lower.\u00a0\u00a0Do not drink or smoke.\u00a0\u00a0And asthmatic.Issue:I have noted that my Haemoglobin is elevated at 184 and Haematocrit 54.\u00a0\u00a0My ALT and AST ALP are all within normal range,My GGT is elevated at 84, 6 weeks prior to that it was 68.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering why my Gamma GT is elevated and has increased in that 6 week period.\u00a0\u00a0I was using TUDCA and take a daily dose of Omega 3 with high content EPA and DHA.\u00a0\u00a0I do take aspirin to reduce any potential clotting 75mg per day along with the fish oils.I read that isolated or disproportionately elevated GGT suggests alcohol abuse. Since I don't drink we can rule that out.One possibility maybe the association between elevated GGT and cardiovascular disease or elevated GGT as a marker/risk factor for cardiovascular disease. GGT can also suggest insulin resistance and/or diabetes or the risk of diabetes. It's tied up in the metabolic syndrome apparently.I recently had an ultra sound for organ abnormalities and a 12 lead ECG, both came back ok.\u00a0\u00a0SO question is why the elevated GGT?\u00a0\u00a0Insulin resistance?\u00a0\u00a0Cancer? The aspirin, or could there still be cardiovascular issues regardless of the ECG?Your comments welcome.Thanks",
