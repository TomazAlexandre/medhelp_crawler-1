            "answer": "Hi!Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause low diastolic blood pressure. Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Addisons\u2019 disease, hypoglycemia, VitB12 and folate deficiency can all cause hypotension. The other reason is bleeding somewhere in the body, like a bleeding peptic or duodenal ulcer. Hence get a stool examination done for occult blood. The other causes of bleeding gut is IBS, ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
