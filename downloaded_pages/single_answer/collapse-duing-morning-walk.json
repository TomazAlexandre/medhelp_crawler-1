            "answer": "I am not a doctor. I had one similar incidence. As in your case I had MI in August 2007 with stent in LAD and severe LV dysfunction, EF 30%. In next five months I was on similar drugs as yours(except for diabetes) and was feeling lot of improvement in my quality of life. I could walk 30-40 minutes morning and evening. In january 2008 one night I was having chat till late night. I had taken coreg, ramipril, nitrate etc much after I took my dinner. As I got up(after chat) at 2 AM, I sudenly felt weakness and as I tried to lie down on bed nearby I fell unconsisous for few seconds. My BP was low and pulse was very low. I called my cardiologist in the night and after listening to details he told not to worry as it may have been caused by sudden lowering of BP.However, not satisfied with his observations I went to Escorts, got my holter test done, MRI, EP study, echo etc. Nothing pointed towards heart. But they somehow made a case for installation of ICD saying that it could have been arithimia. Today I am having an ICD. The incident has not occured so far. To some extend I regret I did not listen to my cardiologist.There are medicines which can reduce chances of arithimia. I think I should have waited for a while on those medicines. Your doctor is the right person to advice you. But if he takes decision for ICD discuss with him whether it could be delayed until more clear symptoms are noticed.I hope this helps.",

    "question": "Following an AMI with LV dysfunction and poor ejection fraction(less than 30% in October 2007), I was on medications including Coreg,Aspirin,Clopidogrel,Statins and Nitroglycerine.I had shots of insulin (human) to fight back my diabetes mellitus too. On a strict regimen of diet and exercises I have felt the comforts of good health all these days. However things turned topsy turvey when two weeks back I had a sudden and unexpected fall just infront of my gate on reentering the household after a 30 minutes' morning walk.The spell was quite uncertain and I seldom remember what exactly had occurred.With the unexpected fall., I broke my teeth ..no cerebral damages sorted out.I presume that I must have a sudden degradation in glucose level in the morning which resulted in the sudden collapse. However my cardiologist would assign the happening to a sudden loss in heart rhythm and stableness.Will there be a recurrence of such instances in the future?also please advise as to what can be promulgated to avert such happenings in future.",
