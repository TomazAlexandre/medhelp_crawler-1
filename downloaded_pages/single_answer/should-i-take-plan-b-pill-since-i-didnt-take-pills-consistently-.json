    "question": "Hi everyone....I'm honestly petrified. I've been taking birth control (Sprintec) for about a year now. I started it a long time ago when I was a kid so that my periods would be lighter. Anyways, I usually use a condom, but today my boyfriend and I had unprotected sex and he ejaculated inside of me. This is fine when on birth control, but I looked it up just to be safe and I'm reading that it's perfectly fine UNLESS you aren't taking it correctly. I didn't really know you were supposed to take it at/around the same time everyday. I sometimes take it in the morning or evenings or night....sometimes I'll accidently skip a day or two by accident (example: I Thursdays pill Friday morning, then I take Friday's pill that night...and so forth.) I don't have an actual doctor to go to so this is my only hope. I'm wondering if it's okay to take the plan B pill or if I should wait it out. Either way, I need an answer fast. I'm so scared. I can barely take care of myself or diabetes type one and I am way too unhealthy to be a parent!!",
