            "answer": "As you have had this persistent cough, and you are a diabetic, it would be wise to see your doctor to get checked out for any respiratory problems.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes after a bacterial or viral infection a cough can linger on for quite a long time, but it is important to check if there is another problem like asthma or even your heart burn that could be causing the acid to flow up into your oesophagus (wind pipe).\u00a0\u00a0This can damage and aggravate the lining of the throat.As you will already know that smoking is not good.\u00a0\u00a0One cigarette contains 92 carcinogens.\u00a0\u00a0Every time you inhale the toxic smoke into your body, you are also depleting your body and brain of vital oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0And you will have no doubt seen the horrors that can happen when there is lack of oxygen getting to limbs due to smoking and due to having bad circulation and especially when you have diabetes - amputation!\u00a0\u00a0Even if you reduce smoking by 1 cigarette a day and gradually decrease the amount that you smoke each day will benefit you in the long run.You still may have some post nasal drip when the mucus that drips down aggravates your oesophagus.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that you drink plenty of hot soothing drinks.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid milk products whilst you have a mucus problem.You may find that doing steam inhalations could help to clear up any residual catarrh.\u00a0\u00a0In a bowl pour in a kettleful of boiling water, taking care not to get scalded.\u00a0\u00a0Put some vick or olbas oil into the hot water and bend your head over the water at the same time cover your head and the bowl with a towel and breathe in the steam through your nose and out through your mouth.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor advised me to do this 4 times a day for a duration of 10 minutes each time.\u00a0\u00a0Do this for as long as you need to.The high pitched cough is to do with the fact that as the air travels past your vocal cords, without your realising it you will be positioning the chords that when the air is expelled it forms the high pitch noise.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It appears that in effect you are coughing through the top range of your voice.\u00a0\u00a0Try coughing my throwing out the air from the lower end of the vocal chords.\u00a0\u00a0It depends on how you position your jaw and how your mouth is open.Wishing you a speedy recovery.",

    "question": "I had a really bad cold a couple months ago that had me down for a month where my cough was extremely loud and high pitched. Well I got rid of the cold last month; but, still have the high pitched cough daily.Also sometimes I sneeze and my sneeze is cut off by this cough in which hurts at times.Most times it's a dry cough and sometimes productive cough.\u00a0\u00a0Other times it gets so bad I actually get sick (not from being sick it just shoots up)\u00a0\u00a0I know TMI\u00a0\u00a0lol.I always seem to feel like I have mucus deep down in my throat and/or lungs and when I breath it feels hollow and deep if that makes any sense at all.Has this happened to anyone else?A little history about myself:I had a endoscopy colonoscopy, and heart catherization done w/in the last 2 years in which was all pretty much ok.I do get really bad heartburn at night most nights and actually I do smoke in which is probably why my SOB has been getting worse along with blood pressure and heart rate.\u00a0\u00a0My heart has been pounding lately.\u00a0\u00a0Thinking about quitting smoking threw hypnoses this year.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as I get enough money together.Years ago I had test done for allergies.\u00a0\u00a0It was negative.\u00a0\u00a0None listed for food or airborne.I do have hypothyroidism and a couple small nodules that have been the same size for yrs.\u00a0\u00a0U/S done last year.I have type 2 diabetes in which is controlled threw diet and high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0Not that any of that probably matters; but, I'm just trying to cover it all.Female in her late 40's.Could have I damaged my vocal cords?Even though it feels like a smokers cough sorta; but, very high pitched....could be just be a result of my past cold?Could I have a virus or infection and not know it?Any ideas to any of this???",
