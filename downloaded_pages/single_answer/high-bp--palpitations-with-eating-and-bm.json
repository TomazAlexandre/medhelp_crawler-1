            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Aside from the CT scan, what other symptoms are present? If you do not have other co-morbid conditions like hypertension or diabetes, it would be beneficial to have further evaluation or work-up such as blood tests or\u00a0\u00a0ECGto rule this out. Aside from CT scan, colonoscopy may also be done as a screening tool to rule out colon issues. Enlarged lymph nodes in the abdomen may suggest presence of infection, inflammation, malignancy or autoimmune diseases and may need to be ruled out also. Take care and do keep us posted.",
