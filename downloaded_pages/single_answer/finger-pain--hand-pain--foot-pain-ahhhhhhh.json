            "answer": "Hello,Two possibilities are there.It can be peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy means that nerves in the extremities are damaged.It can be caused in diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, hereditary disorders, inflammatory conditions, and exposure to toxic substances (including some medications) or alcohol.Diagnosis is by complete physical examination including neurological examination and investigations like blood sugar levels, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electrical nerve testing, spinal tap and a nerve biopsy.Second possibility is of arthritis(rheumatoid arthritis or gout).Both these conditions start with small joint involvement of the hands and feet.Diagnosis can be confirmed after presence of Rheumatoid factor in blood,ESR and blood urea and creatinine.I feel that you should consult a rheumatologist(joint specialist) or a neurologist for evaluation of these two conditions.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
