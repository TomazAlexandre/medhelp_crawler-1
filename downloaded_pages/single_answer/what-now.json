    "question": "Hi there, I am really starting to feel as if there is something seriously wrong with me. For the past four weeks I suffer from insomnia, something I've never had problems with before. I am lucky if I get 2 to 3 hours sleep a night, even when I go to bed later, I still wake up at 1 to 1h30. I also have terrible nightsweats so that I have to jump in the shower at least twice during the night. Sometimes I have extreme nausea but not always, it seems to come and go. What is bothering me the most is the brain fog I have recently, it's as if I cant think. I can't retain normal conversations anymore because I cannot focus long enough to complete what I was saying. I also picked up a lot of weight around my midsection, this really bothers me because I've been slim all my life. Even though I eat healthy ad exercise I cannot seem to lose the weight.My sex drive has completely dissapeared, in fact I don't know what a libido is anymore. I also suffer from joint pain and muscle pain more and more as well as abdominal tenderness.. I had nephritus as a child and ever since I tend to get kidney infections about once a year. I don't know if any of this could have anything to do with it. Also, there is a history of diabetes in my family, both my grandparents on my mom's side suffered from diabetes, I don't know if this is relevant. I had quite a lot of tests done last week. I have to see my endo on Friday to discuss the results.I am really worried because it keeps on getting worse. If this is what my life will be like from now on I'd rather not be here because what is the point of going through life constantly tired and feeling like a zombie, the is no satisfaction in anything and nothing exites me or gives me pleasure anymore. Anyway, some of the results were TSH 1.26, Free T4 9.51 Free T3 4.53. Also can you please explain to me if the following are normal? 17b Oestradiol 198.0, FSH 5.65 and LH 5.18. This is just a few of results which I have been wondering ab out. Please help. Thank you",
