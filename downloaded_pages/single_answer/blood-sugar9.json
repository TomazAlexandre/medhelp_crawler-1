            "answer": "That number is high, but it could just be isolated if you ate something really sugary, among other factors.\u00a0\u00a0If you are concerned, I would start checking it regularly and talk to your doctor about it at your next appointment.\u00a0\u00a0I have gestational diabetes, but wasn't diagnosed until I was 28 weeks, so if it was high before that I didn't know it.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, my doctor said my blood sugar should be below 95 when I first wake up in the morning, and below 120 two hours after a meal.\u00a0\u00a0If yours is consistently higher than that, then I would definately have a talk with your doctor about it.\u00a0\u00a0Hope that helps.",
