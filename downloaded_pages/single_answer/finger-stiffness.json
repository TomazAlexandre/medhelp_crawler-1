            "answer": "HiA pain in the arm, elbow, and hand may have several different causes- orthopedic (gout, pseudogout, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis), medical (diabetes, gall bladder disease), arterial (Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon), neurological (cervical radiculopathy) and traumatic (carpel tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, golfers elbow).The exact diagnosis would depend on a complete clinical, physical and neurological examination.Do you have any history of injury or have you been diagnose with any medical conditions like diabetes.Do you have any associated symptoms like numbness and tingling, neck stiffness, which may suggest some nerve entrapment pathology? Any associated weakness may indicate damage to the brachial plexus involvement. Presence of swelling or redness indicates inflammation.Is the pain at rest or on movements like flexion, extension or gripping? This may point towards tendonitis.If the pain is occurs during exercise, it may suggest lack of blood flow to the arm, which may be due to cardiac pathology or arterial narrowing to the arm.You should consult a doctor for a complete evaluation.Hope you got some input.",
