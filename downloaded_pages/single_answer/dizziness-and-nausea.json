            "answer": "I think you have had two unrelated bouts of gastroenteritis. The second one may have been Winter Vomiting Bug. In any case that's behind you. Your bouts of dizziness may be due to mild hypotension. You may also be stressed. My feeling is though that you do not have too much to worry about. I think you will be fine.",

    "question": "Hello dear doctors,I am a man, aged thirty. I don\u2019t drink and I don\u2019t smoke. I also practice sport regularly. About three months ago, I had a lot of work, so I stayed up late for three or two nights. Immediately afterwards, I fell sick. The symptoms I had are the following: vomiting, dizziness, slight pain in my heart, and diarrhea. I could not even drink water, and I lost a bit weight. I visited a general practitioner who told me that it was due to fatigue, stress, or food poisoning. He prescribed multivitamins (effervescent), medicine containing magnesium, and some capsules for the stomach. After a week I felt better.Almost a month and half later, I fell sick again, but this time it was very serious. I almost DIED. I had the same symptoms, except diarrhea. It was the most horrible experience I went through.I visited the same general practitioner. He examined me again: no blood pressure, no anemia, no diabetes, no heart problems (connected my hands, legs and chest to a machine), my leg jerked when he tapped my knee with a rubber hammer, After almost 10 days, I felt better.Now it has been two months after the second time I fell sick, but some time during the day (maybe once or twice a day), I feel a bit lightheaded and a slight. At times I feel nauseous.I live alone and far away from my family. No one to rescue me if something bad happens. I don\u2019t know what to do. Any recommendations please? Thank you so much in advance.",
