            "answer": "Medication and lifestyle plays a big role in treatment of CHF.If your mother does not take the prescribed medication, it is not so surprising that she is running into trouble.The symptoms you describe point in the direction of uncontrolled and progressing CHF.For instance, shortness of breath can be an indication that her body is retaining too much fluid.It is of importance that your mother takes her medication, even if they come with some side effects.Keep in mind and convince her that many side effects will become less after a few weeks of taking the medication.Going to the hospital might help her, but if she remains unwilling to take medication, the symptoms will reappear soon after her hospital stay.",

    "question": "Back in 2013 or 2014, my mother, now 61, was diagnosed with CHF (and I'm not sure what her EF was), diabetes, and had a pacemaker put in. She has had high blood pressure for as long as I can remember. She has been hospitalized at least 4 times since then for CHF, HBP, and/or cellulitis.What started it all was she started passing out frequently, before the pacemaker was implanted. Luckily, she hasn't passed out since then. But she has refused to take medications for her conditions because she didn't like how they made her feel. She stopped seeing the doctor because it was \"too stressful\" and she thought she could take care of it herself.Unfortunately, I have noticed her CHF getting worse with new symptoms. Before, she would get light-headed and short of breath if she did too much but now she can't even walk 15 feet to the bathroom without getting light-headed. She just mostly sits and sleeps in her chair most of the day because she gets light-headed or short of breath too easily. She has also developed a dry cough that came out of nowhere. One day she had trouble breathing but chalked it up to allergies. (She seemed better the next day.) She can't do her word puzzles because she has problems coming up with the correct word or phrase. Another new symptom is that she always seems to be cold, even if it's a warm-ish day. She isn't keeping to a diet or exercise.I've been debating on whether or not to convince her to at least go to the hospital because these new symptoms concern me.",
