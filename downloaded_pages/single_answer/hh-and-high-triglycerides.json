            "answer": "First and foremost, we recommend that you meet with a cardiologist for evaluation. We also recommend that you meet with a medical geneticist, who can review your history, perform a physical exam and help establish if the cause of your elevated triglyceride levels are related to hemochromatosis or other genetics factors. A medical geneticist can be found at the American College of Medical Genetics website. We wish you the best.",
