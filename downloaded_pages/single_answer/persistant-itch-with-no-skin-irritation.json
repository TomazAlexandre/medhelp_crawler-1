            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis).Other causes of itchy skin in the heel may be atopic dermatitis(eczema),contact dermatitis, neurodermatitis(lichen simplex) and internal diseases like diabetes,kidney or liver diseases.Please get your blood sugar levels evaluated. Also consult a dermatologist and discuss the above possibilities with him.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I've had this itch in the center of my back since summer of 2007. It comes and goes, but is more noticeable when I seem to be under stress. I feel this tingle inside my skin that causes me to itch, however there is no visible sign of irritation or rash. The location is always the same. Could this be my nerves, or the beginning of a more serious condition forming? I had a very close friend who died in 2007 from a skin cancer called Mycosis Fungoides (sp). Her symptoms started off as persistent itching on her hands and eventually consumed her entire body. Doctors told her it was Eczema. Clearly they were wrong. Do I have anything to worry about?",
