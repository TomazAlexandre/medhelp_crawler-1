            "answer": "Are you sure this is inappropriate sinus tachycardia? The rates seem very high for this disorder. It may be secondary to\u00a0\u00a0medications, or other systemic disturbances, and is not likely to be simply secondary to an increased intrinsic heart rate. Uncontrolled fast heart rates can definitely associated with a tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy. So. perhaps an EP study can be pursued if there are some arrhythmias recorded.",

    "question": "Sinus tachycardia long term effectsI\u2019m 26 years old, with IDDM treated with Insulin pump, and ADHD treated with Ritalin LA 20 mg since 2003. My heart rate was fast ever since I can remember but it was never treated. In 2007 I was diagnosed with hypertension (100/170) and started to feel palpitations (heart rates measured between 89-197 in 2 24 ecg tests), and started treatment with ACE inhibitors for hypertension, but nothing for the tachycardia. There is no known any diabetes complications and all the results are negative, including urine for Catecholamine, TSH, no Anemia, and else. EPS from January 2010 was negative.During 2009-2010 under treatment with verapamil 40mg (for the uncontrolled sinus tachycardia and blood pressure) 3 events of loss of consciousness, in the first and the second I was ventilated and anesthetized in the ICU for 10 days, and in the 2nd and the 3rd I developed complete AV block.Now not given any treatment not for ADHD and not for the sinus tachycardia, and with inserted reveal cardiac monitor- heart rate average is around 100-197 (in rest).The doctors are quiet prevented from treating because of the medical history. (Treating with beta blockers is quite complicated because of the hypoglycemia events I do have sometimes).Does untreated sinus tachycardia along with other risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension and IDDM have a long term effects?Thank you in advance",
