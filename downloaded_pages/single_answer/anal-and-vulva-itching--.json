            "answer": "Go back to your doctor and ask for a swab to be taken of the bad areas of your skin.\u00a0\u00a0The swab is then sent to a laboratory to be analysed.Unfortunately, if this is a fungal infection (which it highly likely is) you would need to be taking the Introconazole antifungal capsules for a few months as well as a Canesten spray and a oil spray called Emollin.It can take many weeks to months of the treatment for it to settle.The other thing is ask your doctor to send you to have a glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0If ou have glucose intolerance, pre diabetes or diabetes, these skin issues can fester.\u00a0\u00a0If you have bee on antibiotics these skin problems can be encouraged.Buy a large container as much as you can afford of Epsom Salts.\u00a0\u00a0Bathe every day with 2-3 large cups full of Epsom Salts in the bath water.\u00a0\u00a0Add some baby oil or coconut oil into the bath water because Epsom Salts is very drying to the skin.\u00a0\u00a0Soak in the water for 10 or more minutes.\u00a0\u00a0The Epsom Salts changes the pH level of your skin which the bugs don't like.Do NOT use any soap, bath or shower gels.\u00a0\u00a0This will aggravate your condition even more.Wear cotton pants and don't wear manmade fabric and nylon ones.\u00a0\u00a0This will make you sweat more and encourage the aggravation on your skin.Don't wear tights and tight trousers.\u00a0\u00a0At home don't wear anything under your skirt to let the air to your skin.Your doctor can prescribe Dermol 600 which is a anti microbial bath solution that you pour into the bath.\u00a0\u00a0I use this with the Epsom Salts and the baby oil, sometimes coconut oil.\u00a0\u00a0Don't put too much any of the oils in, otherwise you will end up slipping and sliding.Whilst waiting for an appointment to see your doctor, as a home remedy you can apply natural set yogurt to your private areas after you have washed these with water and gently dried.\u00a0\u00a0The yogurt helps by cooling down the irritation and the itching and also helps to bring down the inflammation and swelling.When you have sex, use latex free condoms as you may have an allergy to latex.Anal itching can sometimes be from thread worms so do look at your faeces to see if there are any thin thread like worms.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes you won't see any, but may still have them.\u00a0\u00a0They come out at night time to lay their eggs on the anus and cause a lot of itching.\u00a0\u00a0If you have been scratching this can then aggravate things.As much as everything is itching, try not to scratch.\u00a0\u00a0Scratching will damage your skin and thicken.For moisturising,\u00a0\u00a0you can try virgin coconut oil.\u00a0\u00a0Coconut oil has antibacterial and antifungal properties.\u00a0\u00a0It can be eaten, used for cooking and baking, used on the skin.\u00a0\u00a0It is the only oil that does not change its composition when heated.Another home remedy is to bathe in a handful or 2 or plain porridge oats.\u00a0\u00a0No, the oats do not block up the plug hole.You need a cream to kill off whatever bugs you have on it, as well as moisturise it every day.Wishing you a speedy recovery.Best wishes.",

    "question": "I've had itching on my vulva and creases between thighs and vulva, and all inside my bum cheeks and the actual anal hole and the perineum between vulva and anus, this has been going on since about last summer, but it's gotten a lot worse since this January. It's not in my vagina, it's just the vulva lips. I have tried yeast infection creams, tablets, I've taken 2 Diflucan tablets just the past few days cuz my doc recommended. She also had prescribed me protocol a few months ago but didn't really help. She later prescribed me clomitrazole lubriderm (I think it's called) and I used it for 2 weeks and for the two weeks after that I was finally itch free and able to sleep at nite! But after about 2 weeks of heaven, it came back... So I used it again for another week but in fear of thinning the skin, I got just canesten from Walmart (so clomitrazole but no steroid) but it didn't help any. I've tried Vaseline, baby oil, several kinds of baby diaper rash cream, gold bond powder and nothing seems to help. I've really been wondering about trying the garlic clove, but wasn't sure if it could make things worse? My doc thinks now that it's not yeast, I don't know if it's fungal or what but I need answers soon... I'm a 19 yr old girl, been in a relationship with the same boyfriend for 4 years, he hasn't experienced any irritation or anything to his genitals so I clearly haven't passed anything on to him.So my main symptoms are: extreme itching (mainly at nite when in bed), redness all on vulva and between bum cheeks, fairly dry and sometimes flaky, irritated, sometimes small cracks in anus at the top and between creases of thighs and vulva, and it feels like my anus hole is slightly swollen, but I'm not sure if that's how tight it's supposed to feel or if it's tighter than it should be. It wakes me up at nite and has been a huge struggle to deal with, I would appreciate any help or stories or recommendations!",
