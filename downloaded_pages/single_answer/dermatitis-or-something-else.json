    "question": "My father passed away four years ago and shortly after his passing I started getting little red bumps around my abdomen and lower back, right where my jeans would sit, I went and saw a dermatologist who said I was allergic to nickel..so I avoided the metal in clothing etc. he gave me a oily ointment to apply, it worked for awhile then the problem came back, I have been checked for diabetes and skin patch tests, nothing...I now have bumps on lower back that are itchy also behind my legs, but these bumps feel different, also on my legs I have three areas which seemed like mosquito bites, but after itching them for three months I dont think that is what they are, they go away briefly then reapear. Also have same problem on arms ...what is going on with me help :(",
