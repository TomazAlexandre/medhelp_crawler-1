            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Chronic constipation and thus bloating can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber and also due to dehydration. Diabetes and hypothyroidism, colon disorders (ruled out in your case), irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn\u2019s disease, diverticular diseases (ruled out in your case), cancers, severe acidity etc can all cause constipation.A proper investigation is required preferably by a gastroenterologist (a doctor who looks after the digestive system) to know what is the cause. The treatment will follow correct diagnosis.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
