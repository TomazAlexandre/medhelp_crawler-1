            "answer": "Are you taking any kind of new medication? There's many things that can cause the dizziness including low blood pressure and diabetes or hypoglycemia which you have ruled out so I assume you've been tested for those.Have they checked your heart? It's possible it's something as simple as PVC's but it's not a bad idea to get it checked out.I'd also get your thyroid checked. Go see your doctor and explain all these symptoms to him and ask for a thorough exam and tests. I hope you find out something soon!",

    "question": "I have been feeling dizzy for the past few days, kinda like the dizzy when you stand up to quickly. The difference is that when it does happen I could be sitting of standing for a while, it happens randomly. Other symptoms are when I yawn I feel about three pumps through my upper body and this morning my chest right in the middle just under the collar bone it felt like a weird beating possibly a problem with my heart. I have no blood pressure problems, no diabetes, I am 5'7\" and around 170 pounds, the only current medical conditions I have been diagnosed with are ADD and depression. I do have cold hands and feet it could be a possible case of Raynaud's disease but not diagnosed.",
