            "answer": "Hi!Teeth braces while aligning the teeth can also cause a change in your facial looks. Ask your orthodontist if your facial look is due to this re-alignment. Since all other tests are normal, it is unlikely to be anything serious. Still, if in doubt, check for diabetes, thyroid disorder, anemia and worms in stool. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
