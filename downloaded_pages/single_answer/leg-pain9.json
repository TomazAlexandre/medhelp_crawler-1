            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the cause of your symptoms are but I will try to provide you with some information.It is possible the cause of your leg pain may be non-neurologic. It could be orthopedic or musculoskeletal (sprained muscle, arthritis, small stress fracture) etc.One possible neurologic cause of changes in sensation with some weakness is neuropathy. Neuropathy is a problem with the nerves that innervate the muscles and skin of the extremities and other areas. Based on the area you are describing, lower outer leg, that is the area supplied by the peroneal nerve and its branches. Sometimes, the peroneal nerve can be pinched as it passes by the knee. There are MANY other causes of peroneal neuropathy including diabetes, alcohol use, inflammatory disorders, etc. However, what is sort of inconsistent given the history you provide is that your symptoms come and go relatively quickly whereas neuropathy is something that usually causes constant and progressive symptoms. The weakness caused by peroneal neuropathy is the type that may lead to foot drop: difficulty standing on the heels, difficulty with flexing the foot upward.Another possible cause is a radiculopathy: compression on the nerves as they exit the spine due to spine arthritis, a herniated disc etc. Again, your symptoms are not exactly consistent with this, the pain associated with radiculopathy is usually a shooting type of pain. If your symptoms are felt to be neurologic in origin, there are certain tests which can be done by a neurologic to determine how the nerves are functioning.Because it is not clear whether or not your symptoms are neurologic, orthopedic, or otherwise, I suggest you see a general practioner (primary doctor, family doctor). After examining you he/she can determine whether or not you would benefit from referral to a specialist.Thank you for using the forum I hope you find this information useful good luck.",

    "question": "I have been suffering with planter fasciitis for two years now and with ibuprofen treatment, cortisone shots, and boots, I have gotten it to where it is tolerable. About six months ago I started dealing with hip pain. It would wake me up while sleeping on one side forcing me to turn over. I was told in a casual conversation with a doctor that it was bursitis so I rely on my ibuprofen to help with that also. What truly concerns me is that a few months ago I started experiencing a dull sudden ache in my lower outside left leg. It comes on quite suddenly and then passes almost as quickly leaving a slight feeling of numbness and weakness all the way down to my foot. It is a sick ache that I will liken to what you might feel after being hit with a baseball bat. It really hurts and it is starting to happen more often while also moving toward the middle front of my leg and up a little bit. I stand on my feet while I work. I am a 44 yr. old female. I stopped walking when my foot problem flared up, but have recently started back. I am left feeling beat up after I excercise. Please tell me who I should see.",
