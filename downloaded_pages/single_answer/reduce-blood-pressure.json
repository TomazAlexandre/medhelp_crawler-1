            "answer": "The one you will stick to.Find exercise and activity you like to do, keep your heart rate up for a while, and engage in it on a regular basis.\u00a0\u00a0I think they used to think it was only aerobic stuff like running and biking that lowered B.P., but now they've discovered vigorous weight training does it as well.Knock down your calories as well.\u00a0\u00a0Restricted calorie intake has been shown definitively to reduce hypertension (not to mention cancer, diabetes, and will stabilize your blood sugar). You don't have to starve yourself, but start slowly decreasing your calories, maybe by 10-20% of what you normally eat, and see if that makes a difference.If you eat a high-carb diet, it might be a little easier to back off the carbs if you restrict your calories. Protein has a more satiating effect than carbs on appetite. Many people can't eat a lot of carbs without it stimulating their appetite.",
