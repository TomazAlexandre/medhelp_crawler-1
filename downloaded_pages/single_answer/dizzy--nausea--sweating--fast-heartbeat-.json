    "question": "28yr old male88kg barely overweightNo diabetes, seen a cardiologist nothing wrong with me heart but put me on metropol tarterate thing to stop the racing heartEvery 2-4 days I get nausea, slight headache, dizzy, sweating, my head tingles, chest tightness, feel like my hearts doing something it's not supposed too. Usually in the evening or when I'm laying down. I feel terrible for a day or two then all of a sudden it goes. I feel like a pressure is removed from me and I'm relaxed. But then after half a day or a day it starts all over again. I'm at the end of my rope and have stopped work because of it. Has anyone experienced this? I've been back to my GP 7 times in the last 3 months because of it and every time he just says 'diet, you are young and eat garbage' and I tell him I'm not. I'm barely holding together here any help would be appreciated",
