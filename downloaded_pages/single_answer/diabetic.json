    "question": "I have type 2 for 12 yrs now, and I have been running highs to 500 for this long, I notice that when ever I eat anything, my sugars jump to the moon,, I was told I am a sensitive diabetic and I am on an insulin pump pushing the highest amount given in the pump. was on meds they just took me off of all of them. Now I notice that was sleeping and I woke to a quick snap in my head that woke me right away, and now the top of my head hurts very tender and sore.. I don't know if this is from having high sugars, and hitting the lows here lately.",
