            "answer": "Hi!The vitamin D supplements that you are taking may not be enough to overcome the deficiency. Hence, you need to discuss this with your doctor.Unexplained aches and pains on and off could also be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In women it can be due to hormonal disturbances related to PCOD/menopause and in men it can be due to low testosterone. Severe anemia, and parathyroid gland disorders can also be the cause. Autoimmune disorders, multiple sclerosis and peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme or lupus too should be investigated for.A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "I went to the doctor lately because I was suffering from joint/bone pain, mouth ulcers, dizziness, extremely fatigue, and lightheaded ness he took blood and said I was deficient in vitamin D. I've been taking supplements strictly for roughly 2 months now but nothing has improved the joint/bone pain is almost debilitating and earlier today there was a large amount of blood in my stool (this has never happened before) I'm quite worried and was wondering if someone could tell me what all this could possibly be.",
