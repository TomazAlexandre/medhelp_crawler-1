    "question": "I have had diarrhea/loose stool for almost two weeks now. I also experienced dry heaving/vomiting and was dizzy. The stool is very acidic and burns. My doctor suggested a liquid diet but that isn't helping. When I get the sensation to go to the bathroom I have to get there fast.My doctor tested me for parasites with a stool sample and it was negative. I have had a chest x-ray, EKG, and they checked my gall bladder for gall stones but found nothing. Any liver tests I have had comes back with one of the enzymes a little elevated but my doctor chalked that up to diabetes. The other thing I know is I have been told I have a fatter liver.My doctor is taking his time helping me and I am not sure what to do! I haven't been to work in a week and am afraid of losing my job.I was in the hosptial a couple months ago with pain/pressure just below my rib cage and I was diagnosed with GERD and began taking Prilosec. It helped but now a month later I am experiencing these symptoms. I have also stopped taking the Prilosec for 4 days now.I can't eat, control my diabetes or stop going to the bathroom! What should I do?? Please help me!",
