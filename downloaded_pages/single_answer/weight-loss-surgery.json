            "answer": "Hi!Bariatric and weight loss surgery is contemplated in those who are morbidly obese and not losing weight by diet control and exercise. If you are trying to lose weight and cannot, then probably you have anemia, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary, or diabetes, etc, which is making it difficult to lose weight. Also, you may not be burning enough calories. You need to consult your doctor, a nutrition expert/dietician and a physical trainer regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
