            "answer": "I am sorry about your cat!Many dermal mast cell tumors in cats are benign and surgical excision may even be curative.\u00a0\u00a0Surgical excision can often be performed with a local anesthetic if the mass is not too large, with or without a mild sedation.\u00a0\u00a0This type of surgery is fast, not overly invasive and, is not very costly.If a splenic mast cell tumor is suspected, X-Rays and then an abdominal ultrasound should be performed.\u00a0\u00a0Surgical removal of a splenic mass would be an invasive surgery.If it is positive that your cat has a splenic or other abdominal mass and you do not want to have him undergo surgery, than there are holistic anti-cancer treatments than can be used.\u00a0\u00a0The best option would be to seek assistance from a holistic vet, or if your present vet does holistic treatments you can inquire from him/her about the use of Neoplasene oral anti-cancer therapy.\u00a0\u00a0Other anti-cancer options are: Poly MVA available online from polymva.com, Hoxsey Formula (available online), adding Turmeric to your cats diet and placing him on a cancer diet (which is also diabetic friendly) among other options, such as Chinese herbal anti-cancer remedies.\u00a0\u00a0All of the listed options are diabetic friendly.If you are interested in the anti-cancer diet and herbal remedies please post again.For information about veterinary help and schools in your area please post to the medhelp vet community.",

    "question": "Hello. My cat (Sancho) is 13.5 years old. He was diagnosed with diabetes about two years ago and currently needs insulin shots twice a day and a special diet to control his sugar levels. We took him in for his annual vaccines and blood work this week and the vet noticed a small lump on the top of his head. A biopsy was sent to the lab and the results show that it is a mast cell tumor (malign). The vet has explained that further diagnostics are required to see if the spleen is compromised before she can determine if it can be removed entirely or not but unfortunately I just can't afford further diagnostics, surgery, or a lengthy cancer treatment. I am also concerned that due to his advanced age and diabetes he would have a rough time recovering from any invasive treatment and this could reduce his quality of life.Sancho has not exhibited any signs of being unwell... he is eating well, has not lost any weight, and is just being his usual lazy self. My questions are:1. Does anyone know of any univeristies or centers in Quebec or Ontario where veterinary students can run diagnostics/ surgery at lower costs?2. Given Sancho's diabetes, age, and the fact that he seems \"fine\" should I put him through the trauma of a lengthy and possibly invasive treatment? (we all know that stress can have HUGE effects on a cat's well-being)3. If we decide to just try to maintain his quality of life and don't remove the mass... are there any natural products we can give him that will not throw off his sugar levels?4. Any other suggestions/ ideas will be appreciated...Thank you.",
