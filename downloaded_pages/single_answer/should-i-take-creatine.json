Try to gain weight in a healthy way. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. You may consult a nutritionist and get a diet chart made which will provide you with adequate calories in a healthy way. There can be many causes which can prevent a person from gaining weight. The common causes are hyperthyroidism, diabetes, severe anemia, certain STDs, worm infestation, and certain liver disorders. A healthy and regular meal is vital to gain or lose weight. Consuming more calories than you burn will help in gaining weight. Do consult a doctor before taking any supplements.

    "question": "Hey I am a 22 year old white male. I try to lift 4 times a week and run once or twice. I am pretty skinny but have gotten some tone over the past year. I take whey protein right after my work outs, and occasionally for breakfast as well. I was just thinking about starting creatine before lifting and wanted to get some opinions on this. I wanna max my results, but in a healthy long-term way. Everything I have read is pretty mixed reviews.Thanks!",
