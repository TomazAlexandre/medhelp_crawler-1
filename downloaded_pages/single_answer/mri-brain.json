Though they are of no immediate threat, all these causes, and the presence of ischemic changes can be a risk factor for future stroke.

Diffuse subcortical and periventricularmicroangiopathic changes. There is a small focus of extra-axial FLAIRhyperintensity in the left frontal region. No hydrocephalus, midline shift, orextra-axial collection. There is no accentuated or lobar volume loss. Largerintracranial vascular flow voids are preserved. No volume loss or signalchanges in the hippocampal formations. Partially empty configuration of thesella. Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. Normal marrow signalintensity in the calvarium and skull base.",
