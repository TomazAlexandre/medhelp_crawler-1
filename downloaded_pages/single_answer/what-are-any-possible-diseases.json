            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Dizziness that you are facing could be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position), internal ear problems and cervical spondylitis or compression of cervical spinal nerves. All these cause dizziness when you get up from lying down position or when you change position that results in a change in the level of your head. Cervical spondylitis and ear problems also cause dizziness on changing the position of the neck.Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause postural or orthostatic hypotension. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ENT consultation, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required for a confirmed diagnosis.Compression of the spinal nerves in the cervical spine region or pinched nerve can happen due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
