    "question": "Hello I have been trying to find out if any of the stds can affect Blood Sugar? The reason why I am concerned is That I allowed my self to be with a woman and,yes I did use a condom that was a suspected drug user. I am sure she is.However,I have had std testing done before for my own Information before I was with her and the tests came up negitave. My glucoe has been sort of erratic and elevated. I have been a type 1 diabetic for 35 years.I screwed up. Can any std cause blood sugar problems and I have been feeling sick for a while. maybe it is a cold. Any inf I would appricate it . Oh yes I went to see my doctor and he said you dont have anything becuase you have been tested twice in 1 year. Pissed me off but oh wellthx again",
