    "question": "Hello...I just had a quick question.\u00a0\u00a0I posted a while back that I had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am 2 1/2 weeks from delivery and looking forward to hopefully getting rid of the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr. said that she will check my levels in 6 weeks after birth to see if my sugars are back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0My question is that I have the one touch glucometer at home, and was curious if periodically testing myself would give me an idea if I am OK or not( I know it wont be good for a diagnosis, just so I know what I'm facing)\u00a0\u00a0if I were to test myself I was just curious what the normal levels for a non pregnant person are...I know know I am supposed to be less then 95 fasting and 120 2 hours after meals now.I was also curious about one more thing....can a non diabetic person have a high blood sugar reading due to an excessive eating episode and be OK?\u00a0\u00a0 Like for instance if one ate a lot of bad stuff in one sitting, and 2 hours later the sugar was out of normal range does that mean you are a diabetic or can that happen to non diabetics too?I am also aware that risk of developing type 2 diabetes is higher now after having this GD...but I intend to go back to weight watchers after my baby and maintain a healthy weight and lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0Is diabetes really preventable?\u00a0\u00a0I know this is a lot...I really appreciate any input that anyone can give me!!!",
