            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Nocturnal enuresis or involuntary voiding of urine during sleep may be attributed to genetic issues, smaller functional bladder capacity, detrusor overactivity, medication side effects, as well as bladder irritants, such as alcohol and caffeine.Adult onset nocturnal enuresis is often a result of problems with the urethra, such as prostatic or primary vesicle neck obstruction.\u00a0\u00a0It is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation and to rule out underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, urinary tract infection, urinary tract stones, neurological disorders, anatomical abnormalities, urinary tract calculi, prostate cancer, prostate enlargement, bladder cancer, and obstructive sleep apnea- which may also be responsible. Take care and do keep us posted.",
