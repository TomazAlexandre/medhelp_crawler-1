            "answer": "I am not a physician, but the mom of a type one diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0We had the same problem when my daughter was diagnosed 5 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0She was always thin and had lost weight, just prior to being diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0When she was diagnosed her endocrinologist wanted her to gain 5 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It took over 2 years for her to gain back the 5 extra pounds.There can be several reasons why the weight is not staying on. One reason is that you are taking insulin to balance the carbohydrates that you eat so that it is a tough battle.I would suggest talking to your endocrinologist as there can be other things that might be contributing to the in ability to keep weight on.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can affect several systems in the body from metabolism to growth.\u00a0\u00a0 The other thing that I would suggest is to talk to a nutritionist, on which foods would be best for you to help maintain a healthy weight.I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0 Please stop back and let us know how it goes.",
