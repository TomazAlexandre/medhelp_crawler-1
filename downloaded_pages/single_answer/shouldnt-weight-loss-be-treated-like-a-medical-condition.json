    "question": "With so many Americans being obese and suffering from chronic weight related health problems like diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol shouldn't weight loss be treated like the medical condition it is? I would say yes. A fantastic weight loss program called the Genetix Program does just that. I have lost 12 lbs in just 2 weeks. I'm very excited to be getting healthy and staying that way.",
