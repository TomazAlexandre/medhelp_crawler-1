    "question": "I am also a 27 year old female who started having these episodes in November. I saw a neurologist and had an EEG which came back negative for signs of epilepsy. I had blood work done and I have no sign of thyroid problems or diabetes. My primary physician (Cleveland Clinic, FL) referred me to a psychiatric doctor who specializes in panic disorder because he thought that it was panic attacks. The psychiatric doctor says that they are NOT panic attacks.I see a therapist now because I have anxiety disorder. But this is not an anxiety attack. It is very different. It comes out of nowhere, is extremely intense, and I have to shake my hands because the begin to tingle a lot, almost like they are falling asleep. It is followed by either nausea or diarreah. It happens when I'm sleeping, and I will wake up. Or when I'm having a normal conversation with a friend, or when I'm at the grocery store or driving. It's very random, and disabling at the time.There are so many blogs about other people experiencing the same thing yet no one has a clear answer. Please help....",
