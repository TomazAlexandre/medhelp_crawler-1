    "question": "I was dxed with insulin resisitant T-2 a few years ago. I am 53 and take Metphormin 500mg one in the morning and 1 and a half at night before bed. I just started the new script whereas I was taking just one in the morning and one at night. I have noticed my morning readings drop. In the morning I usually run around 165, and after having a nice breakfast and lunch my readings are 115 before dinner. My question is, what do i actually have? Is it T-2, is it insulin resisitant or what. My A1c levels are always at 6.5 or 6.7, which doesn't seem like diabetes to me. Thanks.",
