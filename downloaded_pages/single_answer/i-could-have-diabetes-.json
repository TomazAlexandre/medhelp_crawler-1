            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.I would imagine that almost anyone would feel sick after 6 cans of cola and donuts. That is a lot of sugar to pump into your body even if you are not diabetic. If you are concerned about diabetes then I recommend that you ask your doctor to do a fasting blood sugar. See what your levels are and ask your doctor if there is any indication of diabetes. The way you felt may have been your body's way of telling you that it was too much sugar.I hope this helps.Cathy",
