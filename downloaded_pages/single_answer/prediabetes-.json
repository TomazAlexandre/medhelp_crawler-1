            "answer": "Hi,Your 1 hour numbers are definitely too high.Given your age and weight, a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is unlikely (is there any family history of diabetes?), and you may possibly be very early type 1.the thing with Type 1 is that you can go from fairly ok, to very sick within a very short period.I would be continuing to monitor for a few more days (along with recording exactly what you eat), and then going to your dr.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully your dr will refer you to an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0However,\u00a0\u00a0your dr also may not be very concerned because your 2 hour post-eating numbers appear to be normal (or close to it).\u00a0\u00a0However, I think you are right to be concerned.In the meantime, please eat low carb (plenty of non-starchy veges, meats, healthy fats etc, but restrict all sugars / grains).\u00a0\u00a0Please also familiarize yourself with the symptoms of type 1.\u00a0\u00a0 I would continue to test blood sugar at 1 hour after eating to help you work out what meals are giving least impact on blood sugar.hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Please check back and let us know what's going on with you.I",
