            "answer": "Hi there,Weight loss surgery is usually indicated for men who are at least 100 pounds overweight and women who are at least 80 pounds overweight .If you also have diabetes, heart disease or sleep apnea and you are somewhat less overweight, surgery still might be an option. If you have been cleared of the infection 6 months back I do not think there should be any problem in the surgery. It is best to consult your operating surgeon and get your doubts clarified. I hope it helps.Best wishes and regards!",
