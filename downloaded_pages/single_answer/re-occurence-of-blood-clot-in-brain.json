            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. The numbness and tingling can be due to alcoholic neuropathy or due to deep vein thrombosis or due to atherosclerosis. It can also be due to peripheral neuropathy as seen in diabetes, lupus and thyroid disorders. Also, yes, a subdural hematoma pressing the left side of brain can cause symptoms in right half of body. Please urgently consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
