            "answer": "Hello,Chronic sinusitis or chronic allergic rhinitis can lead to the saliva changes making them sticky and thick. A CTscan of the sinuses may help with the diagnosis.Are you taking some medicines like diuretics, antihistamines, antidepressants and muscle relaxants? They can also cause dry throat and mouth. Alcohol abuse, stress and depression are other important causes.Diabetes and hypothyroidism are also known to cause such symptoms.Pls get your self evaluated for that. Other medical conditions include nerve (to salivary glands) damage, Autoimmune conditions such as Sjogren's syndrome and sarcoidosis - the inflammation of body tissue.I feel that you should get yourself thoroughly examined by a physician/ENT specialist and start with the treatment. Till that time, chew sugar free gum or suck on sugar free sweets and drink plenty of water and avoid caffeine drinks.Pls don\u2019t smoke tobacco or drink alcohol and brush and floss thoroughly and regularly to avoid a build up of plaque which leads to tooth decay.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted.",
