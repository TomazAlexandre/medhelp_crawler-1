    "question": "I've been seeing an alternative Dr for health concerns. He did bloodwork and was concerned I had slow onset diabetes type 1. He said my c-peptide test was .66 which he said was low. Has anyone heard of this? He is sending me to my primary care Dr for further testing. Thanks for any comments!",
