    "question": "I have been seeing a Chiropractor for an issue I was having with my foot.\u00a0\u00a0The pain was so great I had to give up jogging.\u00a0\u00a0It was in the arch of my foot.\u00a0\u00a0Good news I really feel like that has been helped.\u00a0\u00a0 However something new has happened.\u00a0\u00a0It started a few weeks ago my right toes go numb.\u00a0\u00a0It last from a few minutes to 30 mins several times a day.\u00a0\u00a0In the last week my other foot is now doing the same thing... at the same time the other one is numb.\u00a0\u00a0Today both feet and my right hand went numb while I was out to lunch.\u00a0\u00a0 It doesnt seem to matter if I am sitting or standing.\u00a0\u00a0 I thought the first on set of the issues was maybe just related to some of the healing process.\u00a0\u00a0I havent talked to my Chiropractor about this yet.\u00a0\u00a0 After reading articles on the internet I am concerned I maybe should call my GP instead.\u00a0\u00a0I am a healthy, 40 yr old woman.\u00a0\u00a0I take no medications just vitamin sup....\u00a0\u00a0What are your thoughts?",
