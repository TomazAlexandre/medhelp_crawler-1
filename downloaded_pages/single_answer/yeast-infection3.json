            "answer": "Hi!It is difficult to comment without examination whether the itch is due to fungal infection or not. Usually yeast or fungal infection results in a thick curd like discharge. Vaginal itching may also be due to chemical irritants (such as detergents, fabric softeners, feminine sprays, ointments, creams, douches, and contraceptive foams or jellies), drop in estrogen due to hormonal imbalance, pin worms and stress.\u00a0\u00a0Also, vaginitis can be caused by other infections, including bacterial vaginosis.Using Monistat will not help unless it is a fungal/yeast infection. I suggest you first consult a gynecologist. Keep the area dry. Wear cotton panties. Check and see if you can identify any personal care items that could be causing the itch. If yes, stop using them. If you have a family history of diabetes, get this investigated. Please consult your gynecologist without fail. Take care!",
