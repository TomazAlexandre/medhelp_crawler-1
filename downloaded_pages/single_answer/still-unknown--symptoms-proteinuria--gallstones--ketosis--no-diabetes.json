    "question": "Can Gallstones cause proteinuria?Hi, I am a 26 y/o male and had been experiencing edema in my abdominal area.This all started after I took D-Ribose which I was taking for fibromyalgia. I was also doing a Paleo/Low-Carb diet that time. It was around July 2010.I found out that D-Ribose can lower the blood sugar. That last day I took it, I felt so ill all over, in retrospect I realized I probably had too low blood sugar. A year later I still am experiencing ketotic-like breath and proteinuria.My blood tests:24Hr Urine Protein 192 (normal is <150mg/24h)Fasting Blood Glucose 94 (65-99mg/dL)serum Creatinine normalegfr normalNo ketones in urine but I see my urine still having that oily slick, and it bubbles (protein)Granted I couldn't reach 2000 calories in a day, but I try to eat above 100g carbs/day. Did I develop too much tolerance of glucose intake that I still get ketosis and proteinnuria?Can Gallstones cause proteinuria? Could that be causing proteinuriaHelp, my doctors don't know what's going on :'( I also have no money left to go back. Lost my insurance. Please have mercy on my if you have sons or daughters my age.Thanks very much. Please keep me in your thoughts.",
