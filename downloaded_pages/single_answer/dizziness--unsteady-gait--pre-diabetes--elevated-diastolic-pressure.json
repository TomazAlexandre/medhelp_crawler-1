    "question": "In Feb 2016 I experienced a prolonged health meltdown that has not been fully reversed to this day.An unexpected panic attack struck on the way to work, I ended up in the ER, north of NYC.I went to a clinic a couple days later. On hearing my \"crazy talk\" doctors referred me to a psychiatrist.I refused to comply. My D-3 and B-12 blood readings were very low at that time, below the lower bound.I felt daily morning malaise usually strongest in the morning, felt much better in the afternoon.Multiple blood tests were done subsequently but it wasn't until 9 months later that an A1C revealed for the 1st time that I was pre-diabetic (5.8 to 6.0 range).Meanwhile unsteadiness was becoming a growing concern. I dreaded the daily commute.It manifested itself as uncomfortable feeling while standing in meetings, later my gait was influenced too.Getting on a train or subway car made things better (this is the only intersection with MdDS that I know of).Looking at my cell phone even briefly makes me dizzy, the longer I look the worse the dizziness.A neurologist found cervical disc herniation but no carotid artery or other obstructions in the neck.I also have had persistent sinus issues for decades (serrapeptase recently took care of them),as well as constant TMJ pressure and bruxism at night. Again serrapeptase alleviated all of these symptoms.An ENT doctor told me that my ENG/VNG tests were normal.A neuro - ophthalmologist examined my eyes and told me that everything is fine.She sent me to a neuro-audiologist but by then I was too tired of going from doctor to doctor and I gave up.Cold weather and cold wind makes symptoms worse. Tinnitus is 1 of my constant companions.I switched from my carb heavy diet to LCHF and lost 12 pounds over 5 months. That helped but did not eliminate the dizziness. I also do yoga asanas daily as well as meditation, very earnestly, like a drowning man holds onto a straw. Despite the great progress I've made with yoga postures, vitamin/mineral supplementation, diet, etc. symptoms are not fully gone.On the way home from the office I tend to feel unsteady again (morning commute is better), after having been exposed to computer screens for 8+ hours. I dare not look at my phone lest dizziness gets worse.I believe that my dizziness has an optical (nerve) component, it's not merely inner ear related.It may also be related to intermittent pressure I've been feeling in the \"third eye\" area for months/years due to inflamed sinuses. Whenever I visit my parents (once every 2-4 months) I get anxious and come back literally sick but immediately get better the next day. I am afraid of driving any more due to anxiety and want to get rid of my car.Other symptoms - weak digestive fire, get tired easily climbing stairs, painful ejaculations (hence not interested in sex), low testosterone levels (320 was the last reading); high blood pressure (getting better), especially a consistently elevated diastolic reading; tension headaches; lower back pain.Dizziness level varies from day to day from nearly debilitating to barely noticeable.Any ideas what may be going on and what else to try? (male, 47 y.o., 148 lbs)My current PCP thinks that I need a shrink and calming meds like the ones psychiatrists prescribe.But I want a permanent cure by addressing root causes, not interested in popping pills for years.",
