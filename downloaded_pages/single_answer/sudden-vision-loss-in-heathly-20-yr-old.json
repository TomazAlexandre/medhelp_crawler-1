    "question": "Last weekend I woke up and started cold sweats, and my arms were numb and tingly. Suddenly my vision started to fade. At first it was like I stood up too quickly and had a blood rush but instead of my vision becoming clearer, it went away completely. I could not see anything for at least 5 minutes. When my vision returned it came back sketchy and in black and white outlines, then color came in until it was as clear as my normal vision. About 3 minutes later it happened again, for another 5 minutes.Although I was scared, I thought my vision loss was because I hadn't slept enough. However one of my friends told me to call my parents. Because of our family history of diabetes, strokes, and heart conditions the news alerted my father and he insisted I find a ride to the nearest ER.As soon as I got to the ER the doctor did a basic stroke test on me. He told me I needed to have an MRI done. I had blood work and a CAT scan and everything was normal. He scheduled a follow up appointment with a neurologist. I then went to the hospital for a TTE ( transthoracic echocardiogram) with a bubble study. The tech told me I would be notified of my results by phone the following day.It has been a week and I still do not know the results of my tests.Finally to get to the rest of my numerous questions! This incident may be turning me into a mild hypochondriac because now I am over analyzing every little feeling. ( just kidding)What would be the possible causes of my vision loss, and am I at risk for it suddenly happening again? Since my visit to the ER there has been no mention of the MRI, should I bring this up with my doctor and ask if I still need one? Also if the bubbles did not cross the wall of my heart and this is not causing blood clots going to my brain, causing the vision loss, what are the other possible causes? Finally what other tests can I expect that the neurologist will order, if any?",
