            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to obtain a history from you and examine you, I can not comment on a formal diagnosis or treatment plan for your symptoms. However, I will try to provide you with some information regarding this matter.It is difficult to know what is wrong without your foot without the ability to fully evaluate it and get a history. The sensory changes may be a condition called peripheral neuropathy. It is injury to a nerve that is outside of the central nervous system. One example of a peripheral neuropathy is sciatica. There are several forms of neuropathies and further workup is necessary to make a diagnosis. These include an EMG/NCS which assess how well the nerve conducts electricity and how well muscles respond. Additionally, it is important to check for diabetes, rheumatological disorders, and vitamin levels. Rarely, in some cases a lumbar puncture provides useful in formation, and very rarely a nerve biopsy is required.I would suggest that you follow up with your primary care physician. If the sensory changes are bothersome, there are treatment options. Treatment for neuropathic pain (pain coming from nerves) includes neurontin and lyrica, and medications such as elavil (which is an antidepressant but has actually been found to be helpful with neuropathic pain as well).Thank you for using the forum, I hope you find this information useful, good luck.",
