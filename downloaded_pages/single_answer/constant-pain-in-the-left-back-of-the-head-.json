    "question": "I had trauma to the head by a domestic violence partner long ago, then to the front of the head when I fell in a hotel in Hamburg, Germany, then trauma by the corner of a car door on the back of the head where it hurts, then again near the same spot I hit with the car door, but this time by the corner of a kitchen covert.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, I had a very small blood clot burst and my left retina was floating on blood and I had a blank blurry spot on the Amsler grid so I needed emergency laser surgery to cauterize the burst blood vessel.\u00a0\u00a0I have only borderline blood pressure, I do not eat fatty foods at all and even though my dad died of diabetes, heart failure with arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis, I have eaten in a healthy manner for over 30 years, my glucose is normal, have only borderline high blood pressure (like 150's and low 160's over 70's and very low 80's), eat NO animal fat, no white bread, NO sugar, SUPER low salt diet, lots of veggies, tilapia fish 3 times a week and only lean turkey or chicken here and there.\u00a0\u00a0I am worried re the constant pain in the back of my head because of what happened to that small blood vessel in my left eye.\u00a0\u00a0EKG showed nothing abnormal.\u00a0\u00a0Will have an ultrasound of the Carotid artery to rule out plaque buildup or hardening of the arteries (although I doubt it is that because of my diet).\u00a0\u00a0So what else could it be?\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned because IF I DO NOT FIND OUT THE CAUSE, THE NEXT RUPTURED BLOOD CLOT COULD BE IN THE BRAIN OR THE HEART!\u00a0\u00a0Thank you in advance and I would really appreciate an answer from a Board Certified Neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0PS\u00a0\u00a0I am under stress from work and family.This discussion is related to/posts/show/897307.",
