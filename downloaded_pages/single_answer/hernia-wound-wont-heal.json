    "question": "My friend, a British woman aged 68, living in north London, had her 2nd hernia surgery Jan 2009. She is diabetic. Unfortunately the wound has not healed. A thin layer of skin has grown over the open wound. Post-surgery she went home and was treated daily by a nurse for several weeks during spring 2009 but now there is this problem. Her GP is unhelpful and says she will have to have reconstructive surgery but he offers no information. Why is her wound not healing? Could it be MRSA? What can she do now? Any help you offer would be greatly appreciated.",
