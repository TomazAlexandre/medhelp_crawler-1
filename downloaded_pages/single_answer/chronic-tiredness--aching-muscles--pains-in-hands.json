    "question": "HelloI've been feeling unwell for around 18 months.\u00a0\u00a0Very fatigued, numbness in my hands, aching muscles (especially in legs).\u00a0\u00a0Very bad in the mornings, but ease up as the day goes on.\u00a0\u00a0Memory and concentration is poor.\u00a0\u00a0Recently been experiencing sharp stabbing pains in my muscles, a little like having a burning hot needle being pushed through the skin.\u00a0\u00a0One of my back teeth has crumbled.I've had numerous blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid function was on the low side, but after seeing an endocrinologist, they said it was not low enough to warrant the symptoms outlined and probably not hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Calcium was on the low side, as was vitamin D (taking 10,000 units per day).\u00a0\u00a0Iron is ok.\u00a0\u00a0Not diabetes either as blood sugar is fine.I don't sleep well.\u00a0\u00a0I keep my husband awake at night as (I am asleep) I contort and move around violently. When I wake I never feel rested and am in pain and discomfort.It seems to come in cycles in its severity.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I can function ok, keep on top of work, housework, children etc, but be very tired.\u00a0\u00a0Other times its a monumental effort to get out of bed and carry on.\u00a0\u00a0Its effecting my mental health as I feel worried that whatever this is, is permanent.Until this illness came on, I was generally very healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I went hiking regularly, was 8.5 stone, ate well.\u00a0\u00a0I don't smoke and drink alcohol very rarely.I've put on a stone in this period of unwellness as I'm so tired, I'm not able to exercise anymore.\u00a0\u00a0Climbing the stairs leaves me breathless and needing to sit down.\u00a0\u00a0This is very unusual for me, as I would regularly hike 12 miles in a day. I love being outdoors, but even walking to the local shops leaves me exhausted.I would appreciate any advise as to who to go to next, as I have tried my local GP and endocrinologist and they are at a loss to what this is.",
