    "question": "I 've had my eyes dialated for the past 4 years each time my vision gets worst. my vision was 20/20 now its 20/30. I can no longer read without glasses unless its very large writing. I am a diabetic non insulin, diet and exercise controlled. my A 1 C is 6. My blood sugar is always well controlled. The eye doctor tells me no problems at all from diabetes in my eyes do I need to continue to get this done even though the exams show no problems from the diabetes? My eye sight is not what it use to be because of this dialation of the eyes.",
