            "answer": "I can not offer an accurate opinion regarding your diagnosis. APS could cause many of the problems you have described, and could result in similar MRI changes when compared to MS. I agree with performing a lumbar puncture. Analysis of the fluid may help to confirm or deny MS. If this testing does not solve the problem, then a second opinion at a large academic neurologic center would be recommended. Also, lupus needs to be carefully excluded. If the coumadin is failing you may need more aggressive therapy to alter your immune system, but you need to see a specialist who can review all this information first. Good luck.",
