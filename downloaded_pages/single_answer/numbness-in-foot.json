    "question": "I am a diabetic, overweight with high bp/colestrol.\u00a0\u00a0everything is under control until about a week ago.\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, last week, the middle two toes of my right foot and the ball of the foot have gone numb.\u00a0\u00a0They're not 100% numb, but it is numb just in that small area of my foot.\u00a0\u00a0The rest of my foot feels perfectly normal.\u00a0\u00a0When I walk, it feels like a painful sore, as if it is infected and full of fluid, but there is no infection.\u00a0\u00a0the toes are normal color, the ball of my foot is pink and normal with no swelling or increased temp. to the foot or the effected areas.I do have arthritis in my knees and thought I may have pinched a nerve and the feeling would come back after a few days, but it's been over a week now and i'm starting to get a little concerned.\u00a0\u00a0I have no other symtoms.\u00a0\u00a0Have you heard of two toes and the ball of the foot going numb for no reason?\u00a0\u00a0There was no trauma to the foot at all.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't seen my doctor yet.\u00a0\u00a0I was hoping to come up with something to take care of this w/o having to go to him.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
