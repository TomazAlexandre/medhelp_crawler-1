            "answer": "For some insight (creatinine, creatine) creatine is a naturally occurring amino acid that is found predominately in muscle tissue. creatine is converted to creatinine in the body system. Advanced diabetes, can result in dangerously high levels of Creatinine. This can cause dangerous conditions such as damage to the heart and kidneys, dehydration....A kidney disorder can cause high blood pressure and a heart condition can not be ruled out based on the information you have provided. Also, high b/p can cause heart or kidney malfunction.It would be difficult to know the duration of your medical problem, and the recovery would depend on other health problems, etc.Hope this helps and if you have any further questions or comments you are welcome to respond.\u00a0\u00a0Take care and thanks for your question.",

    "question": "Hi,my bp has been very high off late and was hospitalised because of it recently. my lipid profile indicated that my creatnine level was 1.68 (which is high). Also the 2D Echo showed that I have concentric Hypertrophy of left ventricle, with LVEF 60%.I want to know wether this high bp was the cause of high creatnine, or is it the other way round. Also how long does it take for the things to come back to normal, I am on medication and also excersising for weight reduction.Thanks, Divya",
