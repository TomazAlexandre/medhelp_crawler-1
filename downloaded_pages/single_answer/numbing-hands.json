            "answer": "Hello,The symptoms are suggestive of Raynaud\u2019s disease. It is a vascular disorder that affects blood flow to the extremities which include the fingers, toes, nose and ears when exposed to temperature changes or stress.Other possibilities are hypothyroidism, peripheral neuropathy,peripheral vascular disease,diabetes or thoracic outlet syndrome(due to entrapment and compression of the nerves of brachial plexus).I sincerely advise you to consult a physician and discuss these possibilities with him.Thorough investigations like thyroid profile,nerve conduction tests,MRI spine at thoracic and cervical levels,ESR, antinuclear antibody test (ABA), nailfold capillary study and\u00a0\u00a0cold stimulation test may be needed to confirm a diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted if you have any additional queries.",
