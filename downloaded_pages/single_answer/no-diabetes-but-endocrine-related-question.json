            "answer": "Hi,Based on those lab results, it seems that the dose of thyroid hormone you are taking is too high--either because your own thyroid function is returning to normal, or you have lost weight, you are absorbing more meds etc. There are a few reasons but in any case the dose is now slightly too high.You can actually have either antibody associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, it is not only the anti-TPO. Antibody levels can overlap in disease states. You may instead chose to call it Autoimmune thyroid disease.You should speak with yoru doctor about decreasing your dose of thyroid hormone slowly and rechecking your tests after about 6 weeks to see if further adjustment is needed. Taking thyroid hormone will not \"prevent\" your thyroid from recovering from the thyroiditis in terms of the inflammation etc, so if you are found to need it based on your tests then you should follow your doctor's advice about continuing it.In the meantime until your levels are stable again, I would suggest putting off any further pregnancy plans so that you can in future provide the best hormonal environment for yourself and baby, and prevent any possible complications now when levels are not quite right.Take care.",

    "question": "Hi, sorry this is not related to diabetes but I had a few questions regarding hypo/hyperthyroidism. I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's...although there were never any antibody tests performed) in Sept. 07 and put on 75mcg of Synthroid. I never told my Dr. this because I didn't know it could be a cause until recently: but I was approx. 2 months pregnant and had a miscarriage 6 months prior to being diagnosed Hypo. I recently had blood work done on my own out of curiousity and my results are listed below:T3 Uptake: 35%Thyroxine (T4): 9.4\u00a0\u00a0(normal 4.5 - 12.0)Free Thyroxine: 3.3\u00a0\u00a0(normal 1.2 - 4.9)TSH: 0.156\u00a0\u00a0(normal .350-5.500)I have read that PPT can eventually go away, It has been a year now since the pregnancy, based on the fact that my dosage has remained constant but I am suddenly Hyper, do you think it is likely that the disease is subsiding? Along with the above tests, I also had antibody tests done which resulted in:Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab: 26 (normal 0 - 34)Antithyroglobulin Ab: 534 (normal 0 - 40)It still shows that I have some antibodies, but I thought in order to have Hashi's you must have Thyroid Peroxidase Ab? And mine are within normal range....Should I stop taking Synthroid so that my thyroid has the ability to regain function on it's own and if I continue taking Synthroid will it prevent my thyroid from recovering from PPT?Thank you so much for your help, I have been trying to post in the Thyroid forum for days and it's always full. :(ps. prior to diagnosis I was a completely healthy young female.",
