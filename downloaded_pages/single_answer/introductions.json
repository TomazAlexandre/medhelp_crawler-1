    "question": "Hello, I'm Paula, and after feeling like **** for 1 1/2 years. I think I may finally have my answer. This site helped me with that. Thank you.I keep on getting this choking feeling, like no oxygen is getting to my brain. By reading this site I found out that my thyroid might be the problem. I scheduled an appointment with a Endocrinologist Christmas Eve day. She told me my TSH was a little low when my GP tested it back in July of 2007. How nice of him to never mention this little fact. When I told him thyroid problems run in my family, as with diabetes. So, now I'm confident with this doctor that she will help me. I had all my blood work done Friday the 26th, and my ultrasound of the thyroid will be this Friday. She said my right side is a little thicker that the left. My follow up appointment is Jan. 8th.Again thank you for pointing me in the right direction.",
