            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved appears to be originating from Cervical2 Vertebrae.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency or abnormal endocrine status.I think you should consult orthopaedician, and neurologist to evaluate your case.MRI scan of cervical spine is most important diagnostic tool in your case.Alternatively you can start taking Multivitamin supplements.Bye.",
