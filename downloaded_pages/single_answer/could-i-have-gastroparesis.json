    "question": "I'm Type 1 diabetic who is having some stomach problems. I was diagnosed with diabetes 6 years ago (when i was 17) and after a month of being diagnosed I started to have these stomach problems. My symptoms were: nausea (this is a big one), burning sensation, always feeling hungry, gas and bloating. I was put on nexium, prevacid and got blood tests and an x-ray done but the meds didnt work and the results for the tests came back normal. After a few months the symptoms went away on its own and stayed that way for 5 years.Now I'm having the symptoms again. I've had them for 3 months already and it's making my life miserable. I have the same symptoms as mentioned above and the doctor has given me Pantoloc, which doesn't work. I've had blood tests, been tested for ulcer and an ultrasound and everything came back normal once again. I even went to the ER last week and the docs sent me home cause they didnt think it was anything serious. They did suggest that my stomach problems could be due to gastroparesis.Now, is it possible that I have this? I mean, my sugar levels are in good control but is it possible to have gastroparesis even when your sugar levels are good? I'm waiting for an appointment with a gastroenterologist and just wanted to ask for other people's opinions and advice about this. And does anyone have any tips on how to deal with nausea? It's really debilitating and is interfering with my daily life. Thanks",
