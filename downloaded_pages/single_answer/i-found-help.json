    "question": "I logged on this site about six weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with Hasimoto.\u00a0\u00a0My TSH levels were 19.17.\u00a0\u00a0I was miserable!\u00a0\u00a0The thing that scared me the worst was the brain fog.\u00a0\u00a0I was always forgetting things.\u00a0\u00a0NO memory.\u00a0\u00a0All the other symtoms were horrible as well...no energy, itchy, bitchy, etc.\u00a0\u00a0we all know what I felt like.The doctor started me on a low dose 50 of synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0In one month my levels dropped to 10.\u00a0\u00a0I am on my way to feel like my own self again.Along with the synthroid I began drinking mangosteen juice.\u00a0\u00a0I believe without the juice I would not feel as good as I do now.\u00a0\u00a0 The doctor was also surprised by the blood results.\u00a0\u00a0I have been researching the mangosteen and have come up with amazing information.\u00a0\u00a0For anyone who would like more info contact me.\u00a0\u00a0***@****",
