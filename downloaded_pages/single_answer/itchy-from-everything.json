            "answer": "Hello,Skin conditions like psoriasis, dermatitis, lice, scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello,The past few months have been a living hell.\u00a0\u00a0First I thought I was getting hives, then it turned out we had bed bugs, to which I am apparently highly sensitive.\u00a0\u00a0We have gotten rid of the bugs, but now I am dealing with something even worse.\u00a0\u00a0Whenever I put on clothing, sit in a chair, lay in bed, basically anything that my skin comes in contact with, I get this awful, painful, burning rash.\u00a0\u00a0It's mostly on my legs, arms and lower back.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing on my face or neck or shoulders, or really my upper torso.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't matter what the material is, or where it is from.\u00a0\u00a0i.e. New clothes from a store are just as bad as freshly washed ones.\u00a0\u00a0Laying in the bathtub full of water is the only way I can get any rest or relief.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going back to my doctor on Monday, but in the meantime any help would be hugely appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0I've been using Benadryl gel which only helps for a moment, but hydrocortizone doesn't help a bit.Thanks in advance for any help!",
