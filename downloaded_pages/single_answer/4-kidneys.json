            "answer": "Hi,Just like decreasing the number of kidneys from 2 to 1 doesn\u2019t decrease the urine output, similarly increasing the kidneys from 2to 4 shouldn\u2019t increase the urine output. I\u2019ll suggest searching for some other reasons for the increased urine output. It could possibly be due diabetes mellitus and hence will suggest you to get your blood sugar checked. I\u2019ll also getting the urine examined as well as getting the kidney function tests done and consulting a urologist for the same. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "I found out in 1986 that I have 4 kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0All 4 function normally. They are all 2/3 the size of a normal kidney.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, would having 4 kidneys cause me to have to go and urinate 10 to 15 times per day?\u00a0\u00a0I drink 2 cups of coffee in the morning and then water all day long.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure this has something to do with it, but is it normal to have to use the restroom that much??\u00a0\u00a0Thank you in advance for your comments.",
