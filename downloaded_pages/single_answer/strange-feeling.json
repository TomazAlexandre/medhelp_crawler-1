            "answer": "Hi Sweet,Nerve Root Pain - nerve root pinching / irritation / compression / trapping is always associated with signs of nerve dysfunction (not working properly) such as pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness. This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your case it appears to me as compressive pathology which is causing the symptoms.If it continues then you can get a MRI done.Alternatively you can revisit the neurologist.Hope this helps.Bye.",

    "question": "For over a month now I've been have this strange pulling, creepy crawly feeling in the back of my head it doesn't hurt it's just annoying to feel that movement and pulling going on in the back of head. Yes I went to my Neurologist and of course they think it's from stress they also wanted me to get an x-ray of my neck I think they believe it's a pinched nerve but Iam afraid it could be something more do anyone have any ideas?",
