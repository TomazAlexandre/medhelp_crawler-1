            "answer": "CatskillMamala,As you may know, we are volunteers here & not medical professionals, so I'm glad to read you're going to followup with her pediatrician on Monday.Finding urine ketones can be consistent with uncontrolled diabetes as can frequent yeast infections and lethargy.\u00a0\u00a0Other things can cause those symptoms, too, however.\u00a0\u00a0You might consider buying some urine strips that test for glucose, too.\u00a0\u00a0Some ketosticks are combination sticks and give a reading for both glucose & ketones.\u00a0\u00a0If she tests with high levels of both -- then it's important for her to be seen at ER quickly because things could go from bad to worse quickly.Your vigilence & problem solving are terrific, by the way.\u00a0\u00a0If it turns out that she is diagnosed with diabetes, please contact Juvenile Diabetes Reserach Foundation www.jdrf.org and click on the link on the left side of the page under the header \"Newly Diagnosed\" Online Diabetes SUpport Team(ODST)\". ODST is a sister-initiative to our forum and they can quickly put you in touch with folks who live near you.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosis comes with hundreds of questions & concerns and having the support of not only a strong medical team, but also families who know from personal experience what the issues are ... is sooo very helpful.If you contact ODST, your request will be sent directly to someone who is moderating the ODST program right now and that person will find a volunteer who is ready & able to work with you. ODST allows for much more personal interactions, that we cannot do here on the Forum. We work closely with them, so do mention that you \"heard about\" ODST here at MedHelp/JDRF Forum.I hope that your daughter has something self-limiting, but if she does have diabetes, I\"m certain you'll get the support and information you need from JDRF.",

    "question": "My 3 year old daughter has some symptoms that I am concerned about.\u00a0\u00a0She has had constipation since infancy.\u00a0\u00a0She has a recurrent yeast infection that comes on with ANY sugar consumption.\u00a0\u00a0She has a funny smell to her breath.\u00a0\u00a0She has complained of eye pain and headaches several times over the last few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0She has been having very noticable low energy periods, excessive crying, etc. since getting a tick bite last summer.\u00a0\u00a0She was treated w/ a 6 week course of amoxycillan for Lyme Disease which I thought was causing the yeast problems.\u00a0\u00a0She has never liked very sweet foods or juice (unlike my other kids), but she is a carb junky.\u00a0\u00a0In the fall when the yeast problems started she also had many accidents and bed-wetting that I thought was caused by holding it in because it burned to pee.\u00a0\u00a0The \"accident\" problems resolved but we changed our diet for yeast at the time.\u00a0\u00a0I have not noticed excessive drinking.\u00a0\u00a0She is still breastfeeding at 3 and is really needy to nurse in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it's a family joke that she eats three breakfasts everyday.\u00a0\u00a0She also always tells me that she's tired and says \"It's so hard, Mommy.\"I finally put it all together in the last day or so that she could be diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Today's Saturday so I just bought some keto-sticks.\u00a0\u00a0She is showing moderate ketones spilling.\u00a0\u00a0She seems pretty even-keeled to me right now and I am planning to get a blood test on MOnday.\u00a0\u00a0If I notice excessive peeing or drining, I will go to the ER, but otherwise I am planning to see the DR. on Monday.Any thoughts?",
