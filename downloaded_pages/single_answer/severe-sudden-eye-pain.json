    "question": "Last visit to eye doctor was Jan 2010. I've had cateracts in both eyes removed in 2008. I've also been watched for high pressure in eyes for glucoma only the pressure no other signs of eye damage so far. Lately I've been having severe sudden eye pain in my right eye. Almost like a brain freeze when drinking something too cold to fast. Lasts only a 10-30 seconds then is gone. Hurts alot. I've had alittle blurred vision but not at the time of these attacks. I've also been loosing my balance alot and having to hold onto the wall or furniture to catch my balance or I fall. I've had lots of migraine headaches for years since 1990 but these are not associated with them. I've had regular heahaces with some of them. They are now happening more frequently and beginning to scare me. I'm trying to hold off till my next eye dr appt but would still like your oppinion. I do see an Ophtalmoligist every 6 months for my diabetes. Thanks!",
