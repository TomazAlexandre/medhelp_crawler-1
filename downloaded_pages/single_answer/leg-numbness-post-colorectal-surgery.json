            "answer": "Hi,How is your relative now?I think it is the epidural administration which could have caused the symptoms. Nerve Root Pain - nerve root pinching / irritation / compression / trapping is always associated with signs of nerve dysfunction (not working properly) such as pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness. This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae. In your relatives case it appears to me as compressive pathology or disturbance to nerve while doing procedure.Nerves regenerate, or heal, at a rate 1 millimeter/day. The only nerves that can regenerate are the nerves outside of the spinal cord, or peripheral nerves. The nerves in the spinal cord, once damaged, cannot regenerate.However, if the peripheral nerve is severely damaged or stretched it may never heal.It will approximately 12 to 24 weeks to regain normal mobility. I think you should consult physiotherapy also for leg muscle to avoid any disuse atrophy.Hope this helps.Bye.",
