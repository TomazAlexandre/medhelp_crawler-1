            "answer": "I heard another lady on here say the same thing. It must depend on your dr office or I'd call and explain your concern with your loss early on.. Ect.. I had 2 MC last year and went to my OB at 5wks pregnant.. They did HCG panel and had me come back two days later to make sure it was rising. I was also placed on Progestrone just in case my last MC were due to low progestrone levels and tested for urine culture and gestational diabetes (bc I had that with my 3yr old daughter) I'm scheduled for my 8wk ultrasound tomorrow just to make sure all is going ok. I hear your frustration, I'd definitely would call to share your concern and know it doesn't hurt to get some answers to have you feel less worrisome.",
