            "answer": "Hi,'Erectile dysfunction, sometimes called \"impotence,\" is the repeated inability to get or keep an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. Erectile dysfunction, or ED, can be a total inability to achieve erection, an inconsistent ability to do so, or a tendency to sustain only brief erections.''The etiology of ED is usually multifactorial. Organic, physiologic, endocrine, and psychogenic factors are involved in the ability to obtain and maintain erections. In general, ED is divided into organic and psychogenic impotence, but most men with organic etiologies usually have an associated psychogenic component. ''Diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease, chronic alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, vascular disease, and neurologic disease account for about 70 percent of ED cases.Smoking, being overweight, and avoiding exercise are possible causes of ED.Also, surgery (especially radical prostate and bladder surgery for cancer) can injure nerves and arteries near the penis, causing ED. Injury to the penis, spinal cord, prostate, bladder, and pelvis can lead to ED by harming nerves, smooth muscles, arteries, and fibrous tissues of the corpora cavernosa.In addition, many common medicines blood pressure drugs, antihistamines, antidepressants, tranquilizers, appetite suppressants, and cimetidine (an ulcer drug) can produce ED as a side effect.'You could read more about this at te following links -http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic3023.htmandhttp://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/impotence/index.htmLet us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "I am in my mid 30's and i am not able to get an erection on my own.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have a sex partner but sometime masturbate and have during the years.\u00a0\u00a0I visited my doctor today for a referral to see a urologist, and he told me that my erection problem would only be corrected by a urologist by either the use of a pump or by surgery, and when he told me that i got the impression from his facial expressions that those treatments were to be avoided.\u00a0\u00a0he did not give me the referral but advised me to try again with viagra, a 3rd time.\u00a0\u00a0i tried and i did not respond to it again.\u00a0\u00a0when i have had a ejaculation from masturbation in the past, I have held my penis with my thumb and middle finger and start a gentle jerkiness with it to hope it gets bigger.\u00a0\u00a0it does get bigger and eventually i will have a more fuller erection and be able to masturbate with that, but it takes a little work to get and is not very natural.\u00a0\u00a0The use of things to get me into the mood, do not help very much.\u00a0\u00a0It does require some physical manipulation.\u00a0\u00a0I hope to be sexually active with a partner in the future so if my only alternative is surgery, I would be open to that possibility so long as its not invasive and I can recover from it quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Even if a urologist had me use pumps, I would be ok with that, just so long as it was therapeutic and had the goal of being able to have an erection on my own.\u00a0\u00a0if there are things a urologist can do other than pumps or surgery, i'd be happy and thankful to hear those.",
