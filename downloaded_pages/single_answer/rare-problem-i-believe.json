It could be an allergic reaction to something, but this has been going on for years so it's time to see the Dr.",

    "question": "hey my name is kyle and i am 18 years old. since i was 13 i was getting this purple or velvet burning cuts on my upper thigh. Weird thing at first was in the beginning it would go away and come back again and now its almost always there but sometimes its doesnt bother me. But till only today i found this serious. Today it appeared on my left palm so by my observation it might be spreading. it showed up and disappeared today but the burning didnt stop for a while. the only thing i found close to these symptons was diabetes. it has no record of any of my family having diabetes. So again i am puzzled. i have no idea if i am using something that is causing this skin problem. I drink a lot of water about 8 cups of those 32 oz cups. I might know what cause that. wisdom teeth have to be pulled but the reason why i drink so much is because the bacteria getting stuck in the corners of my mouth. Well anyways i need help and i cant go to the doctors because i am shy and i want to figure this out on the internet so i can take the procautions that are necessary Please asap respond will what i have. because i have no idea if its something as simple as the shampoo i use or if i am allergic to pets im surrounded by everyday.if you need more info about this to determine what i have just ask and i will gladly share with you.",
