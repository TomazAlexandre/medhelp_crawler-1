            "answer": "I am a 41 year old female and I was diagnosed in 2003 with WPW syndrome, this is a heart defect that causes my heart rate to flucuate, skip beats, and speed up rapidly. I take atenolol daily but still have problems with my heart rate beating very fast at times. During the time my heart beats fast I get very tired and just want to sleep, I feel as though I have run a marathon.If you have not already gone through menopause then this could be caused by that and if you have, it could just be a delayed reaction. Either way, I would mention to the cardiologist about WPW and have him check for that.",

    "question": "For the past few weeks I've just not been feeling well. My mornings are the worse with feeling anxious, lightheaded, malaise, just feel old and worn out. I have high blood pressure and experience palpitations which I've been told are PVCs and not dangerous. Well, when they're happening it scares me to death, for I can feel my heart skip beats and up goes the anxiety and blood pressure. I take 3 meds to treat my blood pressure, clonidine, atacand and atenolol. Lately after taking the clonidine I find myself so tired and I've been taking this medication for 8 years. Just a week ago, I had flushing of my face and itching especially on my chin and cheeks. I felt it was an allergic reaction to makeup so I've tried not to use any if I don't have to leave the house. I am getting so tired by evening that I fall asleep watching TV. I am 58 and feel like 90. This is NOT living. Last blood work I had showed no problems. It was a basic CBC, and metabolic panel which I knew would show an increased triglyceride level which is 250. I get hot flashes sometimes too. Have issues with being constipated but blame it on my meds. I take klonopin for the anxiety but mixing that with the clonidine and its almost lights out. I've cut down my dosage of clonidine in half; I was taking 0.3 mg. I've checked my blood glucose level first thing in the morning today wondering if this could be diabetes, my husband is diabetic but my reading was 100. Any ideas? I've tried supplements such as C0Q-10, magnesium, B-12 and even a bit of iron. Nothing helps. Thanks for any input.",
