            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!\u201cHallucinations are a symptom of either a medical (e.g., epilepsy), neurological, or mental disorder. Hallucinations may be present in any of the following mental disorders: psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, shared psychotic disorder, brief psychotic disorder, substance-induced psychotic disorder), bipolar disorder, major depression with psychotic features, delirium, or dementia. Auditory hallucinations, in particular, are common in psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia.\u201d Refer: http://www.minddisorders.com/Flu-Inv/Hallucinations.htmlDepression, dementia, alcohol abuse, migraines, diabetes, abuse of certain drugs etc can also cause auditory hallucinations.It is difficult to diagnose and treat this without professional help. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My 61 year old aunt called my sister yesterday to tell her that our mother had her son (my sister's) and was going to take her to court for custody.\u00a0\u00a0She also has told her in the past month that she hears a symphony constantly playing.\u00a0\u00a0I did some online research and came up with auditory hallucinations?\u00a0\u00a0My aunt has lived alone for the majority of her adult life and lost her house that she bought and had paid off last summer to the big flood in Cedar Rapids, IA -when this hearing of music began.\u00a0\u00a0My mom is worried that she may have some more serious physical/mental problem that is causing this but has mentioned it to another family member who thinks its not a big deal.\u00a0\u00a0The likelyhood of my aunt going to a doctor to check this out is slim and she has no insurance.\u00a0\u00a0How do we approach this?",
