            "answer": "Hi there!Mildly decreased globulin levels without any other abnormalities/ symptoms may not be anything to worry about; while aside diabetes, moderately decreased levels could occur secondary to liver/ renal disease, chronic inflammations, bone marrow/ blood disorders etc. It would be best to discuss the situation in detail with your treating doctor for further investigations. After a particular cause is identified, it can be managed accordingly.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I found out I had PCOS about a year and a half ago. Since then ... well even before then... i've had plenty of health stuff going on. I just got blood drawn to get my life insurance raised at my husband's work and everything was normal except my globulin levels. My levels were low. I looked online and it said it could point to a number of things... but DIABETES kind of stood out at me. I knew with PCOS often comes insulin resistance and increased chances of diabetes. I'm really hoping I do not already have diabetes at the age of 25. I'm not excessively overweight... I have 15lbs to lose to be at a normal bmi and a healthy weight for my body size. Very frustrating. Anyone else have these levels tested? I've had a lot of bloodwork that led to my PCOS diagnosis in Nov. 2011. ... curious why this never came up.",
