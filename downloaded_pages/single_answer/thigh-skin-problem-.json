            "answer": "HiThese dark discolorations or marks on the leg, stomach and thigh are actually similar in appearance?If they do appear to be similar in terms of size, thickness, shape and character then they may be explained by a single condition. However, you have noted that one spot near the thigh exudes with discharge. This may signify the presence of a chronic skin condition. If this is the case, then you may need to have the discharge microscopically evaluated and cultured. This will help us determine what organism may be causing this.As for the other discolorations on the skin, you may need to observe this more. You may apply a mild moisturizer to keep the affected areas from drying and hence get irritated. Irritation may worsen discoloration. Hormonal imbalance present in obesity and diabetes as well as post inflammatory hyperpigmentation may actually be a differential here.What concerns me more is the area wherein a discharge has been noted. This requires further assessment.",

    "question": "I went to the general doctor two times before for moles on my leg area and neck and\u00a0\u00a0for marks on my stomach. The doctor said the moles are nothing to worry about and the skin marks were an increase in pigment. He said that they wilI go away and they did. I had to go to two general doctors because my first one did not know about the stomach marks but the second one did.I have something on my thigh that has blood or puss coming out sometimes. The area around that is darker than my other skin. I have brown skin and that is like a purple/black color. My bottom is also a little dark like that. I just want to make sure I am ok. I have to go to the clinic because I do not have insurance. The problem is they only have a heart specialist there with general doctors and not a skin specialist.Here is the pic for marks on my knee area.Here is the pic for my thigh area.",
