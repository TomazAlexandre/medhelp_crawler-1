            "answer": "Did your father gradually reduce the prednisone or was it just stopped suddenly? The reason I ask is that my doctor put me on a course of 20mg a day for a month and it almost killed me.\u00a0\u00a0Prednisone side effects include making your diabetes go nutz.\u00a0\u00a0My sugars went to 560 and I almost lost my feet and eyesight.\u00a0\u00a0I went from taking two pills a day, to eight metformin, 2 glyburide and 3 injections.\u00a0\u00a0My GERD tore my stomach to shreds, but the WORST part was I started doing things I have no recollection of doing at all.\u00a0\u00a0I started going for walks at night - no big deal, right?\u00a0\u00a0I live in Alaska and was walking barefoot through the snow!\u00a0\u00a0My husband just about had to put a leash on me!\u00a0\u00a0Then I would cry and cry.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, I said \"This is crazy!\" and I threw the prednisone in the trash.It took awhile but my memory is much improved.\u00a0\u00a0I have added natural supplements such as milk thistle, probiotics, Pau D'Arco, Liv-52 and bioflavenoids.\u00a0\u00a0My liver panels have improved a lot, my sugars are back to normal and so is my BP.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a doctor, but I CAN tell you that prescription drugs put me in this mess and nature is working just fine to get me out of it.Hope everything goes well.",

    "question": "could stopping prednisone (after 10 yrs ) cause pancreatitus, liver disease and short-term memory loss? My father seemed normal 6 months ago, but 3 or 4 months after stopping prednisone, he got pancreatitus, and even though that seemed to get better, now, about 6 weeks after the pancreatitus started (and two weeks after it seemed to start to get better...) he is showing decline.. wants to stay in bed all day doesn't want to talk or eat or clean up--very apathetic and shows severe short term memory loss that seems to get worse as day goes on. He seems very depressed (obviously, I guess) His liver enzymes are off but we haven't done a cat scan yet. metabolic workup is being done. He has copd, asthma and diabetes II so I'm thinking it's the onset of vascular dementia possibly.. Would a cat scan show vascular dementia, and could his steroid use and/or stopping the steroids be connected to his fallijng ill? If he has liver disease (he's 84 and has never been a drinker really) what is the connection with the memory loss, is it reversable? And what is usually the prognosis in such cases (if indeed there is a connection here)?This discussion is related to/posts/show/228663.",
