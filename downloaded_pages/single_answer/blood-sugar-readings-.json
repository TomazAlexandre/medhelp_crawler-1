            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.Your hemoglobin A1c was slightly elevated at 6.3 (we like to see it less than 6). A level of 6.5 or higher on two seperate occassions would indicate diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A level of 6.3 would be considered pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your blood sugars seem like they have been pretty good though.\u00a0\u00a0I think repeating the test in 3 months is a good plan.\u00a0\u00a0It is probably not necessary for you to be checking your blood sugars multiple times a day.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your doctor how often, if at all,\u00a0\u00a0he or she wants you to check your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0For the next 3 months, try being mindful of what you are eating and drinking- often dietary changes can make a big difference for pre diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this info helps.\u00a0\u00a0 Good luck.Bridget",
