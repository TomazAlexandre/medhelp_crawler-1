But other cells like neutrophils can increase when they are going after damage created by diabetes in the kidneys, etc.Here is the diabetes group:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Diabetes---Adult-Type-II/show/46Good luck to her and to you.",

    "question": "hi, i need help. my grandma hates going to the doctor, she literally has a phobia of knowing whatever her sickness might be or if she has an actual sickness, but recently when offered a free blood glucose test and bp measurement she tried it. her blood glucose level was 221, and her bp was 100/70. the community nurse who conducted the tests advised her to go to a laboratory for some tests involving an fbs and cbc also a urinalysis. after days of arguing with her she finally agreed to go the laboratory, everything were normal except her fbs is 201.1 (normal: 60-110) and her cbc shows lymphocytes of 46 (normal:25-25). now I am still in the process of convincing her to see a doctor now that we have her results for more than 3 days. what does it mean? is she a diabetic already? what type and what treatment? what does the high lymphocyte count mean? I am very concerned for her i hope you can help so that i can explain to here the severity of her problem. a reply would be really appreciated. thanks!",
