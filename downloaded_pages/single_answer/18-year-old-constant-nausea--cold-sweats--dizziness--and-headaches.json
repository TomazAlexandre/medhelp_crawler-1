            "answer": "Dear ustosverige,As you may know, we are volunteers but not medical professionals, so you will need to discuss your symptoms and patterns with a doctor.Your symptoms could be signs of many things -- from stress to some physical problem(s) like you've already outlined.\u00a0\u00a0As an exchange student, you will likely be able to get low cost medical care at the student health center at your university.\u00a0\u00a0That would be my first stop if I were you.Keep track of your symptoms by writing down what you're eating, your activities, and how you're feeling.\u00a0\u00a0A doctor will try to identify patterns.\u00a0\u00a0Your family history is also important.I hope you'll see the doctor soon and that soon after you'll begin to feel 100% again.",

But if I dont be carefull of what I eat then I can spend hours at night sittting in bed with horrible nausea, cold sweats, and headaches.\u00a0\u00a0I take peptobismal to reduce the nausea but sometimes it doesnt work and I just have to wait till it stops.\u00a0\u00a0My dad has some problems with his blood sugar and my aunt too, but I never tested for it.\u00a0\u00a0THe doctor wrote me up as lactose intolerant also before I left, but he never took a test so Im not sure If i really am or not.\u00a0\u00a0My dad also has vertigo, and almost everyday I get a spell where I just have to close my eyes and take a deep breath and after a few seconds I am ok again.I also know that my body doesnt take sugar well.\u00a0\u00a0If i eat a cookie or a cake i feel sick, and the night after I cant sleep because Im so nauseated and have a headache.Becaus Im am here its very expensive to go to a doctor, so I dont really want to go if this is just my body reacting badly to food.I try to not eat sugar so much because it makes me feel horrid, but i dont really know if thats whats wrong..I have the symptoms for Diabetes, do I? or am i just trying to find something so i can stop worrying? IM so confused and sick,,,Sincerly. with thanks!",
