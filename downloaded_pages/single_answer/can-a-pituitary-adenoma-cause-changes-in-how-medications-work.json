            "answer": "Yes.It will cause medications to not work. That should be a hint or a giant clue to doctors that something else is going on, but eh, it usually means the doctor will think the patient is non-compliant or some other reason.I have seen specifically in the case of Cushing's disease, anti-depressants, diabetes, acne and blood pressure medications not work. Other tumors may be the same, I just don't have the experience talking to the patients a great deal.It has not been studied as far as I know or can find - but heck, the meds work with the body and in this case, the body is working way against you.Taking excessive amounts will not work - it will only be toxic. The only way is to determine the source of the issue and to eradicate it.",
