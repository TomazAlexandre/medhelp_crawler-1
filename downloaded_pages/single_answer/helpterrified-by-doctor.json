            "answer": "Ok, first of all, relax. Worrying does not help anything! It is indeed puzzling that your A1C was in the prediabetic range but your daily numbers look normal. My suggestion would be to treat yourself as if you are in fact prediabetic and work to keep it that way! You can only benefit by altering your diet to a diabetes friendly lower carb foods, having regular exercise and maintaining your helthy weight. Don't continue however to lose weight if you are already at a good number. (Eat sufficient protein and fats to stay level). Beyond that I would test periodically but don't make yourself nuts because stress doesn't help diabetes or anything at all!",

    "question": "hi...im 27 year old black woman who recently had a physical by my new doctor...im tall and thin and moderately active. i have a great aunt and maybe a great grandmother who had diabetes. i do try to watch my eating habits but occasionally eat to many sweets. anyways, st the doctors office i had a fasting blood sugar of 82 and a hba1c of 5.9. the doctor informed me that my hba1c was within range but near the limit for non diabetics. she swiftly sent me out of her office on the final note that id probably be diabetic in the next ten years because of the a1c value...i was horrified and was given no further information...after telling her i suffer from severe anxiety and have taken medication for it in the past..so not the right way to say that to me! ne ways i then decided to test myself 3 times a day, morning 2hrs after meals and night time. ( i did this for a month and a half)\u00a0\u00a0i figured theyre should be some high fluctuations in my sugar to account for the borderline a1c...the strange thing was i couldnt get my sugar up even when i tried..ie.. a day at hershey park and high carb and sugar breakfast still wouldnt push it over 120 and it normally lingered around 110 after normal meals...75-85\u00a0\u00a0in the morning and 85 -99 on random testing... so this doesnt make sense to me that id be almost borderline a1c???? i still modified my diet and lost 10 more pounds consequently...please explain this to me! i called her office and they seemed very dismissive and had no interest in retesting me...so im just left worrying all the time and obsessing..not good..so any added info would be much appreciated! thank you.This discussion is related to/posts/show/695451.",
