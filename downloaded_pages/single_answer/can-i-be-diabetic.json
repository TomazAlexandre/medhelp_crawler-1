            "answer": "In the UK normal glucose ranges are 3.9 to 5.5 mmol/l. However, two things must be considered that are not mentioned in your post - if the test was performed fasting or it was an A1c test. If the test was performed fasting [8-10 hours no food or colored liquids] you would be considered prediabetic. But, if 6.1% was obtained from an A1c test it would equate to 7.1 mmol/l, you would be considered diabetic.If prediabetes, scroll down and read my comments in the thread below about what you can do to reverse this condition.Pre-DiabeticBy phatkickrI don't know about the UK, but here in the States we can purchase over the counter home glucose test meters as low as $9-12 dollars [\u00a3 5-8]. Post back here if you further questions on testing times, actual foods to look for, or for additional answers.",
