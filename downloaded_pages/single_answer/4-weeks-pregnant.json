            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.If your blood glucose is well controlled, there is probably no reason to see your OB before 8 weeks. I would make sure that when I called for the appointment, to inform the office that you are an insulin dependent diabetic. If they feel you should be seen earlier, they will set that up. I would also inform the doctor treating your diabetes. If there should be any changes to your treatment, you would want his or her input.I hope this helps.Cathy",
