            "answer": "Hi,losing weight, and eating low carb, and taking up exercise, are the best possible ways to reverse type 2 diabetes.Will it be enough to return you to nondiabetic levels (6.3 is still much higher than normal - truly normal is < 5.0)?\u00a0\u00a0We don't know. Maybe.\u00a0\u00a0But keep up the great efforts.Hba1c is an average of 3 months results, so likely if you keep up what you're doing your hba1c will drop lower over time.Your health is literally in your own hands.",

    "question": "Hi and thank you for taking the time to read this. My a1c been up and down for a year now and back in February my a1c rocketed to 6.5 from 6.3 mainly because of bad eating habits. Once I saw that score I came here and got some good advice for diet and excerise and I started right away. 2 weeks after I went to go see a surgeon for a hernia repair and they took my blood that day and my a1c dropped down to 6.3 mind you I didn't realize it dropped till I went online to check my lab work last week for other reasons. And since i started this weight loss plan I've lost nearly 30 pounds. Whoo hoo ! Now my question is do you think that drop after two weeks is accurate? And do you think it could of dropped even more after this weight loss. ?? I know it takes two readings over 6.5 to confirm diabetes so I would like to know would I be in the clear of getting diabetes if my a1c dropped even more. Thank you for reading.",
