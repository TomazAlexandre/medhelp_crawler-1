    "question": "hello everyone, it is been very hard for me to deal with my relationships. With my husband, no sexual life. With my daughter, irritability very often ( and she is only 7), how bad will it be for here and it is now... She doesn't know I'm sick. She sees me taking the medication every night, but dhe thinks it is for me to sleep well. Every night she asks me: mom, please wake up well. That breaks my heart 'cause I eish I could do it... But it so hard. I have an alcoholic addicted mom who visits from times to times. I can get along one or two days at last, but it drives me nuts to see her drunk and trying to protect my daughter as if I were a monster. She also thinks that my daughter is less smart then her cousins and she keeps calling her \"poor little girl\". I hate all this situation. By now, I am in a horrible mood and I blame mom for being sick like this. At the same time I understand I have a problem, I don't consider it as serious as having diabetes, and my doctor said so. I am on Depakote, Lamotrigine, Stelazine and Sleeping medication now. I see my dictor every 15 days fir psycotherapy, which actually helps me a lot. And despite all these, it s very hard for me not ferling like giving a hug, a kiss or even a smile to my beloved ones, when they expect me to. Anybody feeling the same way? Would you like to share ways to maybe make some of these things be at least no so hard... I'm in Brazil, so sorry for my English...",
