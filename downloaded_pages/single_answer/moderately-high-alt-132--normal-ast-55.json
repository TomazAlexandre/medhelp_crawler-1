            "answer": "If it hasn't been ordered already, you should ask for further testing re the elevated liver enzymes including testing for Hepatitis A, B and C.Of equal -- perhaps more concern concern -- should be your elevated total cholesterol and LDL, especially so given your family history, being overweight and being a smoker.Initially, these tests can be routinely handled by your primary physican, but should you test positive with Hep C or B, best to see a liver specialist (hepatologist) for further evaluation. In fact, you may want to end up with one anyway to investigate the cause of your elevated liver enzymes even if you test negative.When was the last time you had a cardiac stress test? Have you doctors talked to you about statins and/or lifestyle changes? What is your blood pressure?Get thee to a doctor (s) and find out what is going on. You probably know that whatever you find -- weight loss, exercise and stopping smoking are in the cards if you want to live a long and fruitful life. And unless you make some extraordinary changes -- or are very sensitive to dietary/exercise changes -- statins will also probably be in your future.You should know that most of us are patients here with Hep C, not doctors.All the best,-- Jim",
