            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Common causes like overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, hypothyroidism have to be ruled out in your case. Hence you must look for other causes. One is water retention due to low serum protein. This along with anemia can cause unexplained weight gain. Adrenal gland problems are the other cause. Cushing\u2019s syndrome should be looked for. The kidney function too should be assessed. Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain. Late night snacking and poor sleep too can cause weight gain. Polycystic ovary too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out by an ultrasound of abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0At your age, you must also get a complete hormonal panel done. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
