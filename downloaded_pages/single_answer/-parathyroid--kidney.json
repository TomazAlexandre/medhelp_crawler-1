    "question": "Hello! I had thyroid lobectomy 3 year ago for benign nodules. I started having muscles spasms, developed PSVT, tremors. I was always very healthy til thyroid surgery. I am now on low dose sythyroid, atenolol.I have had 24 hour urine which showed high calcium, high magnesium, high protein in urine. Was retested after all supplements/vitamins- same results.\u00a0\u00a0Also had low PTH which increased to low normal range after reducing daily calcium intake to 800 mg/ daily instead of 1200mg daily.I saw\u00a0\u00a0Endocrinologist and was referred to nephrologist. Nephro\u00a0\u00a0this is not what causes my muscle spasms, tremors,not a kidney problem. Endo says no ideas- had dexa scan /bone density which was normal so no worry.I am at a deadend..... why do I have these issues, are they related to thyroid/parathyroid? What speciality should investigate this further or should I let it go... and live with my symptoms as best as possible???I do have family hx of diabetes/ renal failure- father.Thank you for any info or direction you can help me ..",
