            "answer": "Hello,Klebsiella pneumoniae infections are usually seen in people who are predisposed to infection including the elderly, those with chronic respiratory disease, those with diabetes and alcoholics. Hospitalized patients with an indwelling urinary catheter are at higher risk of developing a UTI. Klebsiella pneumoniae may not respond to all antibiotics and can be resistant to many antibiotics. Urine culture sensitivity test is important for correct treatment. Treatment must be adjusted according to the antibiotic sensitivity of the isolated organisms. Treatment progress should be monitored regularly. Discuss your concerns with your doctor. Do write to me again.Take care and regards!",
