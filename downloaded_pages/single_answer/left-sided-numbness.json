            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.CSF leak or spinal headache usually resolves within few days or week as many of the causes of leak go away on their own after a few days. Complete bed rest or blood patches for several days are usually recommended. Therefore, I do not foresee your continuous headache even after three years is due to CSF leak. However, from the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a neurological disorder, circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

    "question": "I am a 21 yo female, relativley healthy. I am 22 weeks post partum. During my delivery, i had an epidural, which wwas placed to far into my spine, causing spinal fluid leakage, causing me a spinal headache ( you know the 1 % chance...), keeping me in the hospital for nearly 6 days. I also experienced severe lower back pain, and numbness and tingling in my legs. The did a blood patch, trying to correct it, and that didnt work. It went away after two weeks. Recently i have experienced severe tingling and numbness in my left side of my body. First it began with my foot, and then traveled up to my face, it is very painful, and sometimes can hardly walk. I also am experiencing, horrible back pain, blurred vision ( spotty), hair loss, dizziness, and what seems to be a sharp pain in the right side of my head. Ive been to the doctor, blood tests all normal. no infection or anything like that. Im waiting to get a CT of my head. Is it possible that this could still be from the epidural? Or is it something new, more serious? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, i need answers!",
