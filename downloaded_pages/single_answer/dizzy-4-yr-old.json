    "question": "I have a 4 yr old son that for the past 6 months has been complaining he is dizzy, He recently has been holding his chest while saying he is dizzy and it also sounds like he has a hard time breathing. This usually lasts for 1-5 min. and happens a few times a month. Sometimes it happens when he is very active and sometimes when he is sitting down doing nothing. He has had blood tests done for diabetes, enemia etc. I am very worried, what could this be? and why? He has another appt with our family Dr. is there anything I sould be doing in the meantime?",
