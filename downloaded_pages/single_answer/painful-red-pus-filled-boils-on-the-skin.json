            "answer": "Hi Jai ToorYou are probably having staphylococcal (it is a bacteria) infection of the skin. The reason you have one after another is because they spread by contact. The best way to prevent them from recurring is by cleaning the area well with a disinfectant and draining the pus on a cotton swab. Thereafter the area needs to be cleaned again by a disinfectant. These infections occur due to underlying skin diseases like eczema or dermatitis or due to diabetes (ruled out in your case). Antibiotic cover both orally or injectable along with local antibiotic solution or cream will be helpful. For proper antibiotic cover it will be better to get a culture sensitivity of pus and take the antibiotic that the bacteria is sensitive too. Good personal hygiene and keeping the area dry will help too.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted.",
