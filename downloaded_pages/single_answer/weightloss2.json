            "answer": "Please accept my condolences for the beautiful daughter, lost from earth, but still in heaven.\u00a0\u00a0I can't even imagine the heartache you must still be feeling. Take comfort that you will be reunited one day. You were obviously put on methadone for drug abuse 12 years ago. Even through the loss of your daughter I take it you were able to stay with the program. A testament to your positive parenting. Once a parent always a parent. I gained quite a bit of weight since going on Seroquel for a major sleep disorder, but am now on my way to weight management. I believe there is a forum here for weight loss, but i happen to use MyFitnessPal. and am doing very well. I'm following an almost strictly Vegan diet, and am following Dr. Joel Fuhrman, his book Fasting, and Eating For Health is my bible.\u00a0\u00a0In this book there are nutritional values for foods so that the RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) are followed to the tee. Also, he believes that the RDA salt consumption is probably 10X too high, and the fibre 10 -20X too low. But I believe. If you can handle whole foods nothing processed you might like his following. Anyways, you're doing a whole lot at once. I've personally reversed my diabetes, lowered my blood pressure to within a really good range, lost only 14 llbs since June 15, but it's something. I dieted hard for one month and then went to about 2500 calories for a couple of weeks, now i'm going down to 800 cals a day for another month. I don't know if you're trying to get off the methadone still and maybe the seroquel. Did you talk to your doctor about your quitting? Hope you respond. Talk to you then. Liz",
