    "question": "I have tingling and numbness over my whole body from my neck down.\u00a0\u00a0It started 8 days ago in my right hand, then went into my left hand the next day, then to my feet, then my legs and torso.\u00a0\u00a0The lack of tactile sensation never improves.\u00a0\u00a0I also have impairment in the upper right quadrant of my field of vision.My blood work came back fine on all levels including B vitamins.I had a cardiac stress test and it went fine as well although I am having a CT scan next week just to be sure.I had a brain MRI today and have a copy but my nerolgist was not working this afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0I hope to hear something tomorrow...I know it could be MS but what other possibilities are there?Any advice is greatly appreciated!",
