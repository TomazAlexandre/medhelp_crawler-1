    "question": "after eating, i feel weak, shaky, lightheaded and im full after eating a small meal.I sometimes have heart palpitations, which my dr thinks is related to anxiety. I also feel numbness in my legs(which my dr thinks is related to my fibroid),especially in the left one and also in my left arm.slight shortness of breath at times. I've had a echo done to rule out a heart valve problem since i have a heart murmer. Do you have any idea what these symptoms mean and are they connected.thanks",
