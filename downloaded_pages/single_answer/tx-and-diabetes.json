    "question": "Diabetics are generally monitored at least annually with a blood test called an HbA1c. If you are on tx and have hemolytic anemia as a result your HbA1c may be unreliable. The premature destruction of RBCs can give a false low result to the HbA1c. Many PCPs are not aware of this possibility and thus presume that\u00a0\u00a0glucose levels are good when, in fact, they may not be as they appear. So be aware of this ramification of tx and advise whoever is in charge of your diabetic care. Mike",
