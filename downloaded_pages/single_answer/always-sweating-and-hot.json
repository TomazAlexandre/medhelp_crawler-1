    "question": "I am 17 years old in my junior year of high school. For the past few years i have been always hot and always sweaty. No matter how cold it is out i can still sweat. My major problem used to be underarm sweat, however i fixed that with a prescription anti-perspirant. Now I sweat all over my body and am hot all the time. When others around me are comfortable or even cold i am hot. I'm 5'11 175 pounds. I am in very good shape. I weight lift 4 times a week. I have been doing so for the last 2 years for football. I can run a 5:45 mile. I have no health concerns such like diabetes or anything. I can be sitting in class taking notes and be boiling hot and start sweating. I know that some of my sweating is caused by being nervous about sweating. But even when I'm not nervous i sweat. I sweat on my forehead, back, chest, groin, buttocks, thighs, neck, and pretty much everywhere else. I have had my blood tested and my cholesterol and thyroid levels are fine. I take some supplements for weight lifting like creatine and whey protein. (I used to take gainers like Monster Mass and Cytogainer but have stopped taking them because i have heard that they just have useless fillers). When i hangout with my girlfriend if we are close for too long her body heat is enough to get me to start sweating and we need to separate so i can cool down. Coming in from the cold to a warm room is enough to cause me to sweat extremely. I have pale skin and and my face blushes very easily. Also, I was known to faint and overheat when i was younger. If anyone knows anything that can help me with this problem please help. It is greatly affecting my quality of life.",
