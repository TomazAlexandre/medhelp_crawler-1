            "answer": "Hello,Diabetes is associated with blisters called bullosis diabeticorum. Diabetic blisters can occur on the backs of fingers, hands, toes, feet and sometimes on legs or forearms. They heal by themselves, usually without scars, in about three weeks. You just have to take care of your blood sugar levels and bring them under control.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
