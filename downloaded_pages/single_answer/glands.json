            "answer": "Hello,What you seem to be having is anhidrosis(lack of sweating). It can be due to dehydration, sweat glands injury of the area, underactivity of the parasympathetic system and various other causes like diabetes, autonomic neuropathy, ectodermal dysplasia(rare inherited condition which affect the ectodermal skin layer which includes the skin, hair, teeth and nails), or supranuclear palsy. I suggest you to get it evaluated from a physician.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. Treatment can be started only when the diagnosis is confirmed. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
