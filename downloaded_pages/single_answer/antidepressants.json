Then they \"Find out\" that is not the case.Weight gain will contribute to developing Diabetes if you are prone genetically to develop it. If you are able to loose the weight it will be a huge help.Good luck, I am going through it too.",

    "question": "I have been on lexapro for over 6 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have gained atleast 60 pound. Two years ago I had a hysterectomy and two months later I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. I have read several forums stating that lexapro causes weigth gain. Could this have contributed to the Diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Secondly I didn't have it prior to the surgery and was wondering if this also could be a contributing factor.\u00a0\u00a0I read an article about many people developing the disease after a major surgery and know several people who have had the same problem.",
