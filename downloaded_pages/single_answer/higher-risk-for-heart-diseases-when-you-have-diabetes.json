    "question": "People with diabetes are at more risk to develop heart disease. For unknown reasons, having diabetes puts you at an increased risk of heart disease and other dis\u00adeases that are caused by blocked arteries. In fact, your risk is the same as a person without diabetes who has had one heart attack. Therefore, it is very important to minimize your other risk factors by getting plenty of exercise, keeping your weight normal, avoiding cho\u00adlesterol and fatty foods (saturated fat), and maintain\u00ading normal blood pressure. Walking is good exercise, helps in all those areas, and reduces stress.Most important, in our opinion, is that you do not smoke. If you are already smoking, join a \u201cquit smoking\u201d support group. These are available in most communities and health-care facilities. Nicotine skin patches also may help. Many of the risk factors that cause heart disease can be reduced significantly with a healthy lifestyle, and this should be your goal with or without diabetes. However, because you already have one risk factor for heart disease (diabetes), there is even more reason to reduce other risk factors.How high is my risk for heart attack with Type 2 Diabetes?Higher than you might think! One study found that people with type 2 diabetes, who have not had a heart attack, have as high a risk for a future heart attack as a person without diabetes who has already had a heart attack. In other words, your risk for a future hearth attack is the same as the risk for a person without diabetes who has known heart disease.This result proposes that risk issues for heart disease, such as smoking, high blood pressure, and high blood-cholesterol levels, should be taken care of very forcefully in people with diabetes. Some experts even recommend that people with type 2 diabetes take medication as if they already have heart disease.",
