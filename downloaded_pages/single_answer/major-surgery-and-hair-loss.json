            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Hair loss could be the side effect of any medication that you are taking. It could also be due to severe anemia. If you have changed your soap, oil or shampoo, then this could also be a cause. At times post major surgery, diabetes and hypothyroidism appear due to stress and cause hair fall. Dandruff, eczema, dermatitis are the other causes.Yes, if the cause is found, hair-fall can be treated. Please consult your doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi. A little more than 2 months ago i had cranial surgery for a ruptured aneurysm. About a week ago i began losing hair. A lot of hair from the root. It is falling out everyday. Is this a normal thing with surgery? Is it trauma to the body? Or cat scans?(i had 3 in a month). Will it all fall out at once or will it go on and on? Will i lose all my hair? Will it grow back?Please if someone could answer this I would so appreciate it.",
