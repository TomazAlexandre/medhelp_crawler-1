    "question": "I WENT TO THE EYE DR. TONIGHT. ANNUAL EXAM. LAST YEAR HE SAID MY CORNEAS WERE SWOLLEN, SO HE HAD TROUBLR GETTING MY PRESCRIPTION CORRECT. THIS MONTH I HAVE BEEN HAVING EPISODES OF DOUBLE VISION AND BLURRY VISION. HE SEEMED CONCERNED AND GAVE ME A PRESCRIPTION OF TOBRICIN\u00a0\u00a0AND DAID TO COME BACK IN 1 WEEK TO SEE IF THE SWELLING HAD GONE DOWN, AND IF THE HEMMORRHAGE WAS GONE. HE MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT DIABETES OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. I'VE BEEN TO THE DR, 2 TIMES IN A MONTH AND NO ONE MENTIONED HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. I AM 35 AND I AM NOT OVERWEIGHT. BUT, MY FATHER IS A DIABETIC. I AM WORRIED ABOUT THIS AND I AM LOOKING FOR ANSWERS. THANK YOU=It's not clear just what sort of hemorrhage you're talking about. This is really the sort of question that should be addresssed by an ophthalmologist. I don't know if MedHelp has a forum for eye diseases, though you might look on the main web page to see if there are any links.If your eye doctor is concerned about possible hypertension or diabetes, then I would have your primary doctor check you out for that. It should be pretty straightforward, and you'd know, and you wouldn't have to worry about it any more. Presence or absence of either of these in you could help your eye doctor sort out what is going on.I hope this helps. CCF MD mdf.",
