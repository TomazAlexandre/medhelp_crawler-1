            "answer": "Hello.The symptoms of tingling, numbness, pain and burning are typical of neuropathy. These are less likely to be due to a cardiac problem.You should get a neurologist's consultation and get an MRI of the cervical spine. You will also have to rule out diabetes as a potential cause of neuropathy.Regards",
