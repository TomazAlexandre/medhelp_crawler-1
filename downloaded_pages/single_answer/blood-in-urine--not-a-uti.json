    "question": "I had blood in my urine Dec 2006. I went to the doctor & it was determined to be a UTI. I was prescribed Cipro. I took it & it cleared up. Oct 2007, I had blood on my tissue after I urinated.\u00a0\u00a0The blood only appeared within 2-3 days of my period. I went to the doctor, again. The doctor said that I did not have a UTI and said to see a Urologist. The day after I went to the doctor, the blood went away. My cycle started within 2 days, so I did not follow up with a Urologist. Last week, I noticed blood on my tissue!!\u00a0\u00a0A few days later, I saw blood in my urine. I went to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0After another urinalysis, the doctor said that I did not have a UTI & that I really needed to seek the help of a Urologist.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am concerned!!
