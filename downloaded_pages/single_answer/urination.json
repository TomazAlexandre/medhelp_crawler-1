            "answer": "\"Please let me know if this is something that needs to be checked or if it is normal.\"What makes you think this is normal? Do you know of, or read somewhere, or heard of any human drinking fifteen 20oz bottles of water a day? And urinating 15 times a day?The amount of water you consume daily is extreme. What goes in must come out. You should first Google your medication side effects to see if dry mouth and/or excessive thirst are listed. Talk with your doctor about:1. Diabetes Insipidus (Central DI)2. Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus (NDI).Both are diabetes related kidney issues where the kidney is unable to conserve water.3. Diabetes Mellitus which covers both excessive urination (polyuria) and excessive thirst (polydipsia)All three can be managed with minimal medication along with proper diet and nutrition.",
