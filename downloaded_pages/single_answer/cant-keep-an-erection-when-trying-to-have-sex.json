            "answer": "Hello,There are some possibilities which can be causing erection problem. Common ones are stress and anxiety, poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, negative feelings about non performance, smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression and neurological causes. Even drugs like blood pressure medications, heart medications, some peptic ulcer medications, sleeping pills, and antidepressants may cause erectile dysfunction.You should think about the psychological causes and sometimes sessions with a psychologist help. If the symptoms persist then a urologist has to be consulted. I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
