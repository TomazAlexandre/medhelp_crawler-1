            "answer": "Dear wallykay,These are very 'medical' medical questions, and I'm afraid they're beyond the scope of a volunteer like me, who's the mom of a teenage type-1 diabetic. All I can say is that you lay out exactly what you laid out for us for your doctor. I'm not a doctor, but I have a type-2 husband and type-1 daughter, and it doesn't seem like you have diabetes or are at near risk for it-- your sugars seem normal.Good luck with the testing process... perhaps you are having a reaction to the drugs. Hopefully you'll all get it figured out.",

    "question": "I am a 53 year old black male. I have been treating hypertension with different drugs for 10 years, then 2 months ago, I felt nausea, fainting on waking up. I checked my blood pressure, it was 90/70. I also went to the bathroom and had copius urination which was colorless. Later I continued to have frequent urination (polyuria) but I noticed foams in the urine. Now my blood pressure is fluctuating, but I notice it goes down within 1-2 hours after meals and start rising again just before meals.I did glucose tolerance test, fasting was 86, then 120 after 30 minutes, 110 after 1 hour and 100 after 2 hours.Because of the polyuria, I stopped my AZT (water pill). Ocassionally, I have tingling in my toes, and blurred vision, otherwise no other sympoms of diabetes, (no hunger, thirst). My HbA1C is 6.1, just above the normal of 6 (some labs even say 7 is normal.Can my sugar level be in control of my hypertension. What tests do you recommend I discuss with my doctor?",
