            "answer": "It isn't very clear if that is what you are experiencing, but if you are going to the doctor soon it wouldn't hurt to have a test. An A1C is the best test as it shows blood sugar average over 3 months. You can actually get an A1C test kit at the drugstore and they are about 95% accurate.",

    "question": "Hi there,I'm a 23 year old person quite active in life . I started to feel very tired and digestion problems 3 years ago. I have done many test all came back normal.So the physician made his diagnose IBS. The problem wasn't that bad until I did colonoscopy in February this year after that I lost weight and only started to gain again a week ago.The symptoms are the following when I wake up I have pain in joints of my palm/finger joints and my stomach is empty completely then I eat and I become feeling better . The hunger doesn't leave me during entire day so I have to have a snack or something every hour or so. Fatigue usually comes after 11a.m. when I'm already at work. I did glucose test 3 years ago and it was normal. I went for CT scan of abdominal 2 month ago and after that I visited physician (i didn't eat anything for over 11 hours by then) he measured my blood level and it was normal again.My daily routine is following go sleep 9 p.m. wake up 5a.m.. I'm at work from 6a.m. till 6:30p.m.I spent most of my day in office as I'm purchasing manager . i do experience stress time to time. I stopped going to gym for almost 3 month that's when the symptoms start to worsen , now I do some workout at home now .Do you think I should do another glucose test?Did somebody had similar problem?",
