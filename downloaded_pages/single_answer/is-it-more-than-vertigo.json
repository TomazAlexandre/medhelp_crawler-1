            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Vertigo too is due to some cause. If you are thirsty and urinate a lot, then possibility of diabetes should be ruled out. The cause of low platelets needs to be investigated. It could be due to low production in the bone marrow. This may then be associated with anemia. The other causes of dizziness such as hypoglycemia, thyroid disorders and GERD (since you have abdominal pain) should be looked into too. Pinched cervical nerves or postural hypotension too could be a cause. Since you have abdominal pain and low platelets spleen infection, tumor or abscess should be looked into. . It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor regarding these possibilities. An ultrasound of the abdomen, blood test for anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism should be done to begin with.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Could my vertigo be connected to my low platelet count, abdominal pain, and back pain? I went to the ER a little over a month ago because I was having severe abdominal pain (on the left side, just under my rib cage) accompanied by vertigo. My blood tests showed that my platelets were low (67,000) but the doctor didn't diagnose me with anything and sent me home. Since then, my vertigo has worsened, I'm still having abdominal pain, I'm getting severe headaches (probably from the vertigo) and I'm getting pain in the left side of my lower back. I've had kidney stones before so I feel like the back pain is connected to my\u00a0\u00a0kidneys. I am always thirsty and urinate frequently. I'm not on any medications,I have endometriosis and a history of gall stones (I had my gall bladder removed). Are any of these things connected? The doctors just keep telling me I have vertigo and don't act concerned but I feel like I should be as my symptoms are getting worse and there are many of them.",
