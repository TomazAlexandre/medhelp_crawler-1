            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. However, don\u2019t worry. Even if you have diabetes, there are many things you can eat. You can drink clear soups and chicken broths. Apart from that, you can eat low sugar fruits like cucumber, guava, apple (a few slices), papaya (a few bites), carrots, and other local fruits in your area. You can eat all green vegetables (sauted, stir fries, boiled, stew form etc). Sprouts, whole grains, roasted snacks, multigrain bread, etc can keep you full. Please consult a dietician and plan out a diet chart. There are many more things you can eat based on your personal taste. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
