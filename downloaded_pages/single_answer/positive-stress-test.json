            "answer": "The way I normally think of this is a pilot who is checking over his plane before take off. An engineer comes over and says \"That engine sounds a bit strange to me\". Now the pilot just flew the plane 3000 miles and was about to do the return trip. The pilot thinks \"Well it didn't have any problems getting here for 3000 miles\". So, does the pilot get the engines checked to be sure? or does he hope everything is ok because it just flew 3000 miles? Does he trust luck and maybe crash? or does he get it checked professionally?Your heart has run for 40 years, and to ensure another 40 years is it not worth a check up if\u00a0\u00a0the Cardiologist recommends it?",

    "question": "I am 40 yrs old man, recently i done stress test as a part of regularly check up and it came out as positive. I do not have b.p. or diabetes or any other disease except bronchitis. I have also done the stress in past 3 and 6 years before and that time also I had positive stress test. But I avoided meeting cardiologist as there was any other symptoms of heart problem except the positive stress test. Now I have recently consulted general physician and he told me to consult cardiologist and he may suggest angioplasty to you. Please let me know if angioplasty is necessary in this case?",
