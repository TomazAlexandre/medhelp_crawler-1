    "question": "Diabetes Insipidus is a rare condition that occurs when the kidneys cannot conserve water as they filter toxins from the blood. As such, people with Diabetes Insipidus generally have a constant urge to urinate and frequently feel thirsty. This is not glucose-based Diabetes mellitus.The HypothalamusIn a normal body, a hormone called ADH (antidiuretic hormone) controls the amount of water that the kidneys release. ADH, also called vasopressin (VAS-oh-pres-in), is a hormone that is produced in the hypothalamus (HY-puh-thal-uh-muss) region of the brain. The pituitary (pee-TOO-ee-ter-ee) gland, which is located at the base of the brain, releases the ADH hormone in order to control the release of urine.However, when a person has Diabetes Insipidus (in-Sip-i-duh s), he or she does not have ADH (called central Diabetes Insipidus) or has kidneys that do not respond to ADH (called nephrogenic (NE-froj-e-nik) Diabetes Insipidus (in-SIP-i-duss)). As such, a patient will urinate frequently. The frequent loss of water causes the patient to be constantly thirsty.Symptoms: Excessive urination and Extreme thirstDiabetes Insipidus CausesCentral Diabetes Insipidus is almost always caused by damage to the brain in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus region, though birth defects can also cause the condition. The damage usually is the result of surgery, infection, abnormal growths, or head injuries. To reduce the cause by damage patient should take proper snacks for diabeticsClick here for: Food Gifts for Diabetics",
