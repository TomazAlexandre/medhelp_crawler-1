            "answer": "Hi,Your urologist is right in saying that most of the chronic urinary retention is due to neurological causes. The commonest are spinal cord injury & multiple sclerosis. HSV is known occasionally to produce acute urinary retention. One disease which needs to be ruled out is diabetes mellitus and hence will suggest you to get the urine/blood sugar done. You can go ahead with cystoscopy to rule out any local obstruction causing these symptoms although it seems less likely. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
