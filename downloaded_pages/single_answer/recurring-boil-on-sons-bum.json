            "answer": "Hello,Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle. In your child\u2019s case it can be due to contact with pus from a boil. Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders. So I suggest you to get your child\u2019s blood sugar levels checked.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "My 10 year old son had 3 operations 2 years ago to clean up after a recurring boil in between his bum cheeks, close to his anus.\u00a0\u00a0The aftercare wasn't brilliant, so reinfection seemed to be the culprit for having to have it done 3 times.\u00a0\u00a0However, it has now come back, in a similar place, but behind the scar tissue of the operations, slightly higher.\u00a0\u00a0He has epsom baths every night after school, we put sudocrem on the site in the morning and the evening, and I make sure his bum is wiped very cleanly with wipes when he has a number 2; still the damned thing has come back.\u00a0\u00a0We've been given antibiotics, again, but they don't seem to be doing the trick.\u00a0\u00a0He has a good diet, but maybe overdid the maple syrup on pancake day Tuesday, which is possibly why we are suffering now - we keep him away from all sweets, as it does seem to have affect it.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone any experience of a similar things and, if so, what is an effective treatment?\u00a0\u00a0He is such an active boy, this really affects him badly.",
