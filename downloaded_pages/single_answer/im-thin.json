            "answer": "Hi!Calculate your BMR (use any online calculator) and work up a diet plan with same calories as your BMR. Then eat healthy and exercise. You can eat some calories in excess of your BMR, but this should not become a habit as you may then put on more weight than required. Also, you may be genetically thin. So, exercising will help build muscle mass. Rule out the possibility of diabetes, hyperthyroidism and worms causing weight loss. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
