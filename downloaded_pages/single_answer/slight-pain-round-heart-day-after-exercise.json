            "answer": "Hi.There can be many causes of chest pain related to your heart, lungs, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, or nerves. Even exercising on full stomach can also cause some discomfort.Angina is a type of heart-related chest pain. Typically stable angina presents with mild chest discomfort precipitated by mild activity like running and walking.Chest pain can also be caused by pleurisy, pneumonia, heartburn, gastroesophageal reflux, gall stones and stomach ulcers.You should consult your doctor so that any of these can also be ruled out. The doctor may assess you based on your age, past medical history, cardiac risk factors (age, smoking, cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, family history, obesity) as well has physical examination.Tests for diabetes and raised blood cholesterol as also an ECG, exercise stress test, angiogram and echo should be performed to elicit the cause.Once you find that there are no significant medical issues, you can resume your exercise schedule, after consulting you doctor. You will benefit in the long run through a regular exercise schedule!Regards",
