            "answer": "Hi,Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong disease in which there is a high level of sugar\u00a0\u00a0in the blood. This is caused when\u00a0\u00a0fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin resulting in increased\u00a0\u00a0blood sugar. Type 2 diabetes usually occurs slowly over tim and risk factors include family history, obesity, and presence of lifestyle conditions like hypertension. On the other hand, Pravastatin is used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke and to reduce the amount of cholesterol\u00a0\u00a0and other fatty substances in the blood. It is best that you talk to your doctor about this and to discuss the management plan for type 2 diabetes. Regular monitoring of blood sugar is highly recommended. Take care and do keep us posted.",
