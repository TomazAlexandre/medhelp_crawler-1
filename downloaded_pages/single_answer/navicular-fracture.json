    "question": "Hi,My father recently injured his ankle while jogging. He is diabetic and is 58 years old, 5'9\" and weighs around 200lbs. He has diabetes for more than 20 years but managed to stay that in control by taking insulin and excercise. After the injury, he had severe pain and red swelling across his ankles. He was then given pain killers and injection at the swelling area and the red color was gone. He rested his ankle for 2 weeks and then went for his regular job. Now the swelling is even more but not in red color and it spreaded little towards knee. He got scared and then went to another doctor. The x-ray and MRi reports just came. I am pasting them below. It's been about a month from his injury and he lives in India. The first doctor did not bother to go into details and always he suggested for a surgery to remove a piece of bone and test for infections. As my father is diabetic, he wants to avoid surgery. My father will give this reports to the second doctor tomorrow. Before that, I want to check with you guys to see what exactly his problem is. Please see the report results below:-X-Ray Report says:-1. fracture navicular bone with development2. calcaneal spurMRI Report says:-Findings1> Status Diabetes2> Bones alignment is normal3> Minimal free fluid in joint space4> Soft tissue swelling around ankle and foot with adema.5> Oscuboidale noted - normal variant6> subluxated talonavicular articulation with fractures involving navicular.7> Hetrogeneous TD FBIR and T2W hypertense areas and T1 hypointense areas involving talus, anterior half of calcanuem,navicular, medial conal form and cuboidbones - s oblique o diseased - inflamation.8> Inflamation is involved in spaces of metatarsal bones.9> plantar facia is thickened and edimatous.10> Tandence arround ankle show no obvious signal changes.
