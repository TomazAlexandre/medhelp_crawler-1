            "answer": "It's always prudent to maximize on all conservative measures before considering surgical options.\u00a0\u00a0Traction, light physical therapy, and anti-inflammatory medications should be tried.\u00a0\u00a0If at the end of this, you still have significant weakness and pain, then surgery should definitely be considered. Many things fall into consideration when you're thinking about surgery: 1) nature of the herniaton-is there disc rupture/does the spine look stable/anything else wrong with the disc, etc.. 2)the activity level you have now in your lifestyle/how much are you willing to compromise/dominant hand? 3)risk of irreparable damage with postponement of surgery 4) other co-existing diseases such as diabetes which could lead to complications post-opIt's a lot to think about. To help you make a decision, I would consider talking to a neurologist who will do a formal exam and maybe an EMG that can show the degree of damage there is now.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, lay off the karate as it can certainly make things worse and take it easy. Best of luck.",

    "question": "I am a 35 year old with a c6-7 herniation. After 8 weeks of traction I have had adequate improvement in pain, but have not regained any strength or sensation (the weakness may be worse, in fact). I am now considering surgery as suggested my my neurosurgeon. If I decide that I am willing to tolerate arm weakness and exacerbations, is there any good reason for surgery? Specifically, how seriously should I consider the risk of myelopathy? Also, if I do not have surgery, and I resume activity at previous levels (including karate), will I be sorry? Could I do serious harm if I do so, or is pain going to be my main problem?Thank you so much!",
