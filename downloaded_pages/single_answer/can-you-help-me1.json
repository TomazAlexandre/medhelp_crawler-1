            "answer": "Do you feel stressed out? Did you have your thyroid checked? Or were you checked for diabetes?Having headaches and being tired all the time can easily just be from feeling overwhelmed and stressed. It can also be from a number of other possibilities like problems with your thyroid, diabetes, medication side effects, low blood pressure, migraines, or something else. You'll have to make another doctor's appointment and get checked again. If that doctor is not sure, then go for a second opinion to a new doctor and see what they can do for you. Ask your mom to make another appointment. Hope it goes well.",
