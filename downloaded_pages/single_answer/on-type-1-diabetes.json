            "answer": "It must be her diet. When I was first diagnosed with type 1 I was 7 years old. My mother was told to always give me carbohydrates to keep my sugars stable, obviously having the appropriate amount of insulin was important too. this was 16 years ago. I'm obviously an adult now and I look after myself and decide how many units of insulin to what I'm eating. Too much carbs can send your sugars flying, especially if its white bread etc. Start by cutting down the carbohydrate intake or adjust her insulin until you get it right. Type 1 is very hard to ALWAYS be in control. all sorts of factors can send your sugars flying. All diabetics are different when it comes to insulin sensitivity! For me 1 unit of insulin will take me down 2 or 3 points when other diabetics wouldn't need 4 or more units to take them down 2 points. I've even heard of diabetics that only need 1 unit to take them down 8 or more points. It will be trial an error for quite a while. It actually took me years but that was when I was a teenager and not looking after myself. You will get there. Don't freak out about a couple of highs here an there, it happens with type 1. Just start with either cutting down on carbs or adjusting insulin unit by unit. Good luck... Also, maybe you could look up insulin sensitivity to understand just how different us diabetics all are.",

    "question": "Hi, I noticed that my 14yr old daughter was losing weight, taking too much water in a day, frequent urination and excessive appetite. I used my glucometer on her and found 445mg/dl FBS. I became alarmed and took her for a lab test. Her Hb1ac was found at 14%. She was put on insulin( Mixtard 30/70) 40IU at 24units in the morning and 12units at night. She has not achieved FBS below 10mmol/l up till now. Its always within an average of 15mmol/l, and its a week now. She however doesn't exhibit any sign and she's a very active girl in the house chores.She started complaining now of diarrhea, that was after introducing her to the use of sweetener.What do you advice I should do next?",
