            "answer": "I found this: (ischemic disease can also mean white matter changes)\"\"White matter change\" is a very common finding on an MRI scan. Frequently, these changes are seen in patients who have/have had hypertension, stroke, migraine headaches, or other medical conditions.As the brain ages, we tend to see a change in appearance around the fluid filled spaces (the ventricles). These changes are thought to be the long-term effects of atherosclerosis which cause less blood flow in these brain regions. Less blood flow means that the brain tissue can be irreversibly injured, which is referred to as \"ischemic injury.\"Some MRI reports may state that \"perivascular chronic ischemic white matter disease of aging\" is seen. We do know that we see increasing amount of these changes with age and see greater amounts of change in patients who have high blood pressure and diabetes. In a sense, this is the \"end effect\" on the brain of having risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes, although not all patients with either condition have such changes. Importantly, patients with these changes do not necessarily have any neurologic problems as a result, unless the changes are very severe. These changes accumulate slowly over time and the brain is able to compensate so that no function is lost.\"It can mean minor things, or put you at increased risk of stroke.I am a bit confused on the pituitary thyroid cancer - I can understand thyroid cancer, but how would the pituitary play a role?",

    "question": "I just had a MRI of brainFindings: few scattered areas of increased T2/hyperintensity within the periventricular and predominately within the subcortical white matter which are nonespecific. This may represent early microvascular ischemic disease.Impression: noncpecific white matter lesions may represent underlying microvascular disease. Can some one translate it in plain English?I am 60 years old female, no illnesses exept, childhood diseases. Almost 5 years ago had pituari thyroid cancer. Normal blood pressure and no colesterol problems.",
