            "answer": "HI,There are a number of things that this could be, including a localized infection that may become worse. I cannot give a full list of possibilities without an examination. Your father should definitely see his doctor soon to have this examined and treated. If it is an infection, it will need aggressive treatment to ensure it does not become worse. If it is something else, he will also need to be seen anyway for a diagnosis. Please continue to encourage him to go in for an examination as soon as possible.Take care.",
