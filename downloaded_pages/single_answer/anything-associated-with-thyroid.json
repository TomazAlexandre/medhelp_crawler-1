    "question": "I went to my Endocrinologist on Wednesday and they ran a bunch of blood tests with the following results:\u00a0\u00a0I have Hashimotos Thyroiditis and also Antiphosopholipid Antibody Syndrome.TSH 1.22, Total T4 1.22, Total T4 9.60, Free T4 1.63, Free T3 2.58, my Serum Glucose was 105, and my Serum Creatinine 1.12.\u00a0\u00a0They are concerned about possible Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome which I am also concerned about so starting immediately I started on a special diet of mostly protein, keeping carbs under 100 grams per day and watching my sugar intake and also increasing my exercise more than I am now.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering would my thyroid or blood disease cause any of these levels (connected to the Metabolic Syndrome) to be abnormal?\u00a0\u00a0And also once I see weight loss from this diet I would assume possibly these levels would come down also?\u00a0\u00a0I certainly hope so I am so depressed it isn't bad enough that I have a blood disorder but also thyroid now this.Thanks for your help",
