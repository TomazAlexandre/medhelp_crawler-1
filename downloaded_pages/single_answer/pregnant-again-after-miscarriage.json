    "question": "I am 18 years old and have had Type 1 Diabetes since I was 22 months old. In my younger years my diabetes was always in control, when I was in highschool my control was very bad (forgetting injections/high BSLs) and I have ended up sick in hospital once before. In January 2009 I became pregnant and immediately took control of my diabetes. However, in April 2009 I had a miscarriage. The nurse mentioned it may have had something to do with a urninary tract infection that I had, but could've been anything. It was physically painful and even though it wasn't a planned pregnancy I was very emotional. I am working now and my diabetes (although not in complete control) is much better than a year ago. I have recently found out I am pregnant again. I'm terrified the same thing will happen again. I would be very grateful for any tips/advice from people in similar situations- diabetes control tips etc. It is easier said than done to gain complete control of this disease, but I'd do anything to make sure this works out. A doctor told me after I miscarried that there are certain ways to improve the chances the next time I became pregnant, what are these methods?",
