            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I think you have \u2018compartment syndrome\u2019. This is usually caused by increased pressure due to inflammation in a confined space as in the fascia on your plantar aspect. High blood pressure, deep vein thrombosis and diabetes should also be ruled out.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
