            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!First of all get your blood sugar tested. Generally such wounds that do not heal are called no-healing ulcers in medical term. They could be due to underlying infection, low supply of oxygen to the wound that is reducing the healing process, underlying diabetes, or due to underlying dermatitis. Wounds heal slower in smokers or alcoholics who have been drinking for a long time. Please consult your PCP or gynecologist.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
