            "answer": "HelloYou are most likely having Metrorrhagia which refers to vaginal bleeding among premenopausal women that is not synchronized with their menstrual period.Metrorrhagia can be caused by a hormonal imbalance.The type of hormonal imbalance that causes metrorrhagia can occur when hormone medications, such as birth control pills, are used improperly. Many causes of metrorrhagia are related to the cervix or uterus, including cancer, inflammation or infections, non-cancerous polyps (growths), scar tissue in the uterus (adhesions), and the growth of uterine tissue outside the uterus (endometriosis). Metrorrhagia can also be caused by miscarriage, a pregnancy that is developing in the fallopian tubes (tubal or ectopic pregnancy), the use of an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control, or chronic medical problems such as thyroid disorders, diabetes, and blood-clotting disorders. The treatment of metrorrhagia depends on the cause of the problem. Treatment may include drugs to replace hormones, antibiotics to cure infections, or other medications commonly used to treat conditions such as chronic medical problems. If the bleeding is caused by an intrauterine device (IUD), the device may need to be removed. Polyps and other types of growths are treated with surgery. Cancer may be treated with a combination of surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. Women with bleeding caused by miscarriage or tubal pregnancy need immediate medical treatment because both can cause serious complications if not treated. A procedure called a dilation and curettage (D& C) might be performed to empty the uterus of any tissue remaining after a miscarriage.Hope this information helps. You can talk to your gynecologist with this information.Refer: http://www.hmc.psu.edu/healthinfo/m/metrorrhagia.htmBest",
