            "answer": "Hi!The chances of a preterm labor depend on the cause of preterm labor in the first pregnancy. If the cause was related to the baby or position of the placenta, then it is less likely to repeat in this pregnancy. If the cause of maternal high blood pressure, diabetes or any other cause relating to poor development of the baby, then it is more likely to recur. Sometime preterm labor starts without any known cause. So, please inform your Obs and Gyn about it so that this pregnancy is monitored carefully. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
