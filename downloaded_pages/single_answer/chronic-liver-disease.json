            "answer": "I can not comment on anything other than hepatitis C and Cirrhosis. Ask your doctors if you have questions about your other health issues.DID WORKING THAT MUCH CAUSE ALL THIS TO HAPPEN ?No. The hepatitis C virus damages the liver over time as it replicates in the liver this creates fibrosis and then after 20-40 years cirrhosis (scaring of the liver). If you were also drinking alcohol or taking drugs that are toxic to the liver that could have sped up the process. But that is what hepatitis C can do in about 20% of people that are chronically infected. Working has nothing to do with liver damage unless you were working with toxins.I have also worked at a waste disposal plant at one time. While it can be nasty stuff to be around especially in the heat. It did not give you hepatitis C. Hepatitis C is a blood to blood disease. Hepatitis A can be gotten from sewage as it can be in feces. I was working in manholes near the sewage intake screws as I was involved in mapping out the electrical system at the plant and designing the SCADA computer system. I never was infected by hepatitis A while working there.I was more worried about the chlorine leak! ;-)I hope you are seeing good doctors at a transplant center and they are taking care of you.Cheers!Hector",
