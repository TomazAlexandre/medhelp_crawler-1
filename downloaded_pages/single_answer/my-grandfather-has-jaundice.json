    "question": "My grandfather has liver cancer for eight years. I didn't know my grandfather had cirrhosis with portal hypertension. His primary doctor prescribed Pravastatin tab 40 mg and Losartan potassium tab 25mg. He\u00a0\u00a0has been taking this medication for about five months. He complained about muscles around his leg hurting ,started losing appetite , feeling tired and weak. Then his face complexion started turning yellow,started having diarrhea, and his urine color turning dark brown.I have checked side effects Pravastatin and he has most of side effects from that medicine but doctor is saying that it's because he\u00a0\u00a0has liver cancer.\u00a0\u00a0I don't understand why his alpha fetoprotein went from 4000ng to 60000.0 ng\u00a0\u00a0within two months. I guess my question is\u00a0\u00a0that can these medication affect\u00a0\u00a0his liver cancer and his bilirubin which is 41.8 ?Doctor is saying that his bilirubin is so high that they cant' do any treatment for his cancer? I\u00a0\u00a0asked\u00a0\u00a0the doctor what can cause bilirubin to reach 41.8 and he told me it's because of his liver cancer . When I searched it online is that bilirubin number can go up if you take medication like Pravastatin. Pravastatin is not recommended to patients to liver problems because it can cause liver damage. Also patients with who has diabetes, cirrhosis\u00a0\u00a0and hypertension.",
