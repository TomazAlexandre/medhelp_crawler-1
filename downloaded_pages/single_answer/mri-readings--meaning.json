            "answer": "Hi.You need not change the MD. Just get your MRI plates evaluate and reported by a Neurologist, or another Radiologist. A second opinion helps.A hyperintensity on the T2 does not necessarily mean any pathology/lesion. You need to rule out Hypertention, Diabetes and vasculitis.RegardsDrAbhijeetMD",

    "question": "My Family MD suggested a Brain MRI & angiography as well as doppler studies after I had an episode with visual flashes of lights in my left eye. I also had an Opth eval that revealed no retinal tears or holes.. the MRI report is back but my family MD is not exactly sure what the radiologist is saying, any help would be appreciated before scheduling another apt with a specialist....the MRI says \" A small area of T2 hyperintensity in the left ventricle periatrialarea, which is of uncertain etiology. Patients age(65)makes a demyelinating process in this area less likely , please coorelate clinically\"\u00a0\u00a0patchy areas indicatiog small vessel disease.....Is this something that we should worry about or see another MD...what does it mean..thank you. bob42",
