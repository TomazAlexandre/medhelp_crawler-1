            "answer": "Hi.Based on your clinical presentation, it is, indeed, a possibility that alcoholic neuropathy is causing your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0However, your symptoms are non-specific and could also be caused by other conditions. It would be important for you to consult a physician to properly assess your symptoms and perform some diagnostic procedures.You should be tested for elevated liver enzymes (which is present in alcoholic neuropathy), as well as screen for diabetes, renal insufficiency (creatinine levels), vitamin insufficiency, heavy metal toxicity, etc.Some other tests that could be performed include nerve conduction tests as well as needle electromyography.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I am scared out of my mind right now and could use some sort of clarification.\u00a0\u00a0I have been a pretty heavy drinker in the past...moreso during football season.\u00a0\u00a0Over the Thanksgiving holiday we had probably too much wine, then I drank some whiskey on that Saturday, and some more on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0I usually don't drink that much, but it's just how things worked out I suppose.\u00a0\u00a0I am 33/M with no history of any neurological disorders in my family.I woke up this past Tuesday with a numbness in my left hand going from the top of my left hand to my pointer finger.\u00a0\u00a0I figured I just fell asleep on it, which is what the doctor stated.\u00a0\u00a0Come that evening I was running a bath and I thought I felt light headed, so I hopped in the bath and felt better.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I felt burning sensations in my forearms and feet, and some weakness in my legs, though today they feel better.\u00a0\u00a0The burning is indiscriminate, so it'll come and go without any sort of pattern.\u00a0\u00a0I've obviously scared myself by going online and reading plenty of things abotu what it could be, but considering my drinking habits, alcohol myopathy or alcoholic neuropathy is a definite possibility.I have never had anything like this happen to me beofre from a medical standpoint.\u00a0\u00a0I am not overweight, I eat right, and I work out 5 days a week.\u00a0\u00a0I even worked out today and actually felt better.\u00a0\u00a0I am a smoker, though I don't think that has anything to do with this.\u00a0\u00a0If someone could provide any sort of insight into this it is greatly appreciated.",
