    "question": "This is about my brother. He is 19 and a half years old. Weight 70kg, height 5 feet 9 inches.Last month, he had fever of 102 degrees. The next day, he felt a little weakness in his legs and at night, it increased so much, that he fell on the ground while walking, unable to get up. I had to pick him up. He said the weakness was only in the legs. He felt pain in thighs, while applying pressure to get up. Also wasn't able to apply enough pressure to get up.We immediately went to the hospital, the doctor just gave him a saline, his BP was 138/90 and fever was 98 degrees. The other day, the doctor did complete blood count and everything was normal, except, hemoglobin was 12.9.We repeated the blood test 2 days later, now the hemoglobin was 14.2 and bp again was the same. Doctor said it could be because of the hb levels.What could have caused this? It's been a month to this incident and he showed no such symptoms again. The weakness was only in the legs. Is it something to worry about?",
