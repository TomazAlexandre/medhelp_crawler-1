            "answer": "Hello,Exposure to paint fumes is unlikely to cause the MRI findings that you describe.In terms of determining the cause and effect relationship of environmental exposures and MS, that is a very challenging task. There is much that we do not know about MS.In fact, there are other forums on Medhelp that may offer you greater expertise for your questions about MS.Conditions that can mimic MS:Central Nervous System (CNS) infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I)CNS inflammatory condition (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome)CNS microvascular disease (e.g., disease caused by hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, CADASIL)Genetic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy, hereditary myelopathy, mitochondrial disease)Structural or compressive condition of the brain and spinal cord (e.g., cervical spondylosis, tumor, herniated disc, Chiari\u2019s malformation) Vitamin B12 deficiencyhttp://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/1115/p1935.html~\u2022~ Dr. ParksThis answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical or legal advice.

    "question": "I had an MRI that shows white spots in my brain my doctor thinks that I have MS but I was wondering if long term exposure to paint fumes at work could be the reason for the MRI finding? Or could the paint fumes be the reason for the white spots. Or could the paint fumes be the cause of me developing MS?",
