            "answer": "Hi There,I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes around 3 months into my pregnancy. Keep an eye on what your carbohydrate in take is - as it is the carbs turning into sugar that is the issue. Always eat breakfast, lunch & dinner - ensuring to snack in between. With meals try to eat plenty of non starchy vegies to keep you full as well as protein & carbs. Do not cut out pasta & potatoes etc baby still needs to grow & mumma needs her energy. Keep walking, swimming etc etc. Hopefully you will not need insulin like i have & can keep it diet controlled. There are chances baby can get top heavy resulting in early c-section, however i am 35 weeks and baby is on track. Hope this helps!!",
