            "answer": "Hi,It is tough to determine what the pain is coming from, not being able to examine you and review your history. But if it is from Diabetes and a form of neuropathy, you should be able to get started on some medications to help ease/stop the pain. You certainly should not be in this degree of discomfort all the time. It is more likely to be neuropathy if your diabetes has not been well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0Please ask your doctor for a referral to a neurologist for an evaluation, and you can try over the counter Capsaicin cream in the meantime. Some of my patients swear by it. Take care.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes in 2002. In the past five years, I've experienced many ups and downs with heart problems, leg cramps and now kidney stones. I just posted a question about my left arm burning with swelling from the wrist and thumb. I placed a couple of ice cubes in a bag within a napkin to alleviate the swelling and burning; it just turned red and the tightness seem to be worse. I am also experiencing severe leg pains especially when I walk down the stairs or getting out of a car. At night, the pain can worsen to the point of waking me up and I just rub my legs until I pass out. I've talked to my primary about the leg pains and was told to loose weight. Well, I've lost a few pounds and the pain is still there. I've taken alleve, motrin, aspirin and ice cubes for the swelling. As of last week (9/30/07), I went to ER because of bleeding in the urine; they diagnosed me having kidney stones, UTI and hematuria. They gave me some Cipro, shot me with some pain medications and sent me home telling me to follow up with a urologist. I did. He gave me some flomax, which sends me to the bathroom every 2 hours but the stones have not passed. I don't feel anymore pain in my back however this week I feel tightness and burning in my left arm. I am truly at my wits end trying to feel better and can't. What do you suggest?",
