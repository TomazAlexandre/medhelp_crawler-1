            "answer": "Hi, this could be nerve compression, neuropathy etc. Investigations like MRI spine would lead to exact diagnosis due to neuropathy. Sometimes nerve compression at lower spine level leads to weakness in leg along with pain. Sciatica is other possibility.As your job involves prolonged sitting, which is again a predisposing condition for lumbar spondylosis.",

    "question": "Problem:I experience pain in my right leg, primarily in calf area, and sometimes in hip too for about 6 months. Left leg is fine, sometimes I would get pain in left leg but it goes away fairly quickly. About 6 months ago I used to have frequent leg cramps only in my right leg but they it stopped. When I lay I usually don't feel any pain but feel little bit of numbness in my right leg. I don't have any extreme pains so far, everything is mild. I would stay I experience numbness and tiredness in my right leg almost everytime when I don't walk or stay.About me:I'm 25 yrs old working in computer industry, and I sit near computer for 8 hrs 5 times per week. I walk for 5 minutes every hour. I weight 240 lbs which is 40 lbs above my healthy weight (I'm 6'4\").Question:Could you please advice me of possible health related problems I have ? I went to my Internal Medicine doctor last week and he checked my circulation externally (he put his finger somewhere on my foot) and said it was fine. He advised me to drink club soda or something with potassium, he also thought that it may be dehydration. My doctor also advised to perform a blood test to see if I have diabetes However, my concern is that why would my left leg feel fine while right leg gets pain ? Shouldn't dehydration, diabetes or lack of potassium affect both legs ? I haven't had any trauma injuries in like 15 years. I rarely get back pain but it does happen.Also, from time to time I would feel burning and stinging sensation in my right leg (sometimes in left leg too).I'm very afraid that I might have Deep Vein Thrombosis which is a very serious condition.Please help, thanks.",
