    "question": "I'm not sure if I'm in the right place, but hopefully I can get a sense of direction here. I am a 38 y/o female with high bad cholesterol, low good cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, MS, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalga, migrains, among other immune system disorders (not HIV) Recently my opthomologist found that I have swelling and\u00a0\u00a0bleeding behind both eyes, all the major causes have been ruled out and I was told that basically, he couldn't tell me what it was, but could tell me what it wasn't. over a 3 week period, the swelling worsened, the veins in my eyes have shrunk more, and the bleeding is worse.OK, now the question, I have had (at times) severe and constant pain and soreness in the side of my neck and going into my jaw and ear on the right side. Could this possibly be Carotid Artery Disease? I'm going to see a retina specialist next week and my neuro the next week. Am I heading in the right direction with docs?",
