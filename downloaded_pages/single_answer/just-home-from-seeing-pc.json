    "question": "What a long day... I must remember to never...NEVER...schedule appointments at the VA 2 days in a row.I didn't get to see any deer on the way up and it was after dark for the trip home.. But I sort of saw 6 deer barely.MY PC was running 1.5 hours behind schedule so that added to the wear me out factor.She figures that the itchy ear is probably allergies and put me on Zyrtec daily. She was going to also look at my ear but we both forgot about it so I don't know if I should have been on a antibiotic as well.For my hurting big toe she was just guessing and trying to blame it on my diet ( gout? ). Asked if I had changed my diet lately ( Yes due to diabetes) Most of the change was not drinking 6 cans of soda a day and instead drinking decaf coffee.Since she couldn't blame it on the caffeine she then tried to blame it on withdrawal from caffeine. But I was drinking soda that had no caffeine in it. So finally she just said cut down on the coffee and see if it gets better. I'm only drinking 4 cups of coffee each day.She also switched my Thyroid medication to a slightly higher dose and\u00a0\u00a0 my cholesterol to a different one as my shrink had suggested.I also had to make another stop at the lab as yesterday when they did the lab work they didn't do my A1C as my PC had ordered. I don't understand why they took 2 vials of blood today for just 1 test. :)I suspect with the way I feel right now I'll probably sleep all weekend...There goes my household chores schedule down the drain..FURTHER that is..I'm only about 1 week behind already.Dennis",
