    "question": "Ok, I was diagnosed with diabetes when i was little, about 3yrs old, but the doctor didn't tell my mom which type i was and no one can find the one file that the diagnosis is in. So far i have not had too many problems with it, i keep my blood sugar under control with diet and exercise, and everytime i ask my recent doctor to test me to get it in my current records, nothing shows up on my blood work, still not the problem. My problem is i can keep my sugar under control a majority of the time, but at random times my sugar will spike, or i guess that's what's happening. It usually happens when i get severe cramps during my menstrual cycle, which isn't that often. but i have excruciating pain in my stomach, and then i get nauseous, and then i get hot and clamy and i'm very weak. This will usually last anywhere from 5-20 min. I have told my doctor, but she hasn't really told me anything useful. All i want to know is whether or not this is caused by diabetes or if\u00a0\u00a0its caused by something else i should be looking into. like i said this only occurs when i have severe cramps during my menstrual cycle, any other time i don't have any problems.",
