            "answer": "Hi!Since your son in law had colonoscopy, I assume he has abdominal pain. Other than IBS or spastic colon he could be suffering from Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, diabetes, food intolerance, malabsorption syndromes, constipation, gallbladder and liver problems, pancreatic dysfunction, or taking a diet rich in sulfites. Cancers of the gut too could be a cause. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Take care!",
