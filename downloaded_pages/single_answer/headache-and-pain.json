    "question": "I am a 32 yr old female and a couple of weeks ago the back of my head was a bit sore for several days but I hadn't hit it or anything.\u00a0\u00a0It finally went away but I started having a headache not a bad headache (just kind of annoying) frequently.\u00a0\u00a0I have some intermittent pain that goes across my forehead.\u00a0\u00a0But I seem to forget simple things, for instance I was showering and I couldn't remember if I had washed my hair or not or I packed a bag of clothes for my daughter and I couldn't remember what I put in the bag to match socks to it.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like I lose my train of thought sometimes when I speak and can't think of words.\u00a0\u00a0Not too often but more often than usual.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if I am just paranoid and that is happening or not.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if you had any thoughts on this?\u00a0\u00a0Any help would be great.",
