    "question": "Researchers Isolate Genes That Battle Hepatitis C VirusHAIFA, ISRAEL -- July 17, 2007 -- Joint research by Dr. Leonid Brodsky, ofthe Institute of Evolution of the University of Haifa, and Dr. MiltonTaylor, of Indiana University, led to the discovery of a mathematical methodwhich can identify which genes in our bodies conduct the battle against thevarious viruses that attack us. In their research, they identified 37 genesout of 22,000 possible genes which fight the hepatitis C virus.\"When we know which genes are responsible for fighting the viruses whichattack our liver, we will be able to look for the medications which willactivate these genes most favorably,\" said Dr. Brodsky. The team conductedclinical trials, supported by the Health National Institute of Diabetes andDigestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the US National Institutes ofHealth (NIH), which included 400 patients at eight different centers in theUnited States.The results will be published in the journal PLOS ONE.The hepatitis C virus, found mostly among many patients who have had ablood transfusion or who share needles, attacks the liver and in extremecases can cause cancer of the liver. At present, there is one well knowmedication, interferon, used to treat the virus; however, while somepatients respond to the treatment with interferon, others do not. In thisresearch, the clinical study was combined with the mathematical modeldeveloped by Dr. Brodsky. The study identified 37 genes which are key forpatient response to treatment.\"In the specific case of hepatitis C, we have now isolated the genes thatshow which patients will respond to treatment. Until now, all patientsreceived treatment for an extended period of time without knowing whether ornot they would respond. In the future, we hope to find other medicationsthat will be more effective in activating all of the 37 genes.\" summarizedDr. Brodsky.He further explained that this mathematical model is not limited toidentifying the genes which fight viruses that attack the liver. It can alsobe applied further in the fields of medicine, biology and agriculture.SOURCE: University of HaifaRon",
