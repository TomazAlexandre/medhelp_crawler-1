    "question": "http://www.****: more than just an antiviralProteins such as interferons and interleukins are known as cytokines. Interferon (IFN) has a broad range of effects; it can affect anti-cancer cells, antibody producing B-cells and also cause the production of other cytokines. As IFN can affect many cells in a variety of ways, dysfunction within the IFN system may cause disturbances in other parts of the immune system. There are reports of disturbances in immune function with several autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis B, diabetes, immune deficiencies, multiple sclerosis and Lupus (SLE: systemic lupus erythematosus).Defects of the IFN system in these disorders have been noted to involve both IFN alpha and gamma. Often the highest levels of IFN in the blood are found when the severe episodes of autoimmune diseases occur. In experiments with mice who have an autoimmune disorder, injections of IFN seem to worsen the disorder and shorten lifespan. Thus, it is even possible that IFN itself may be the cause of some of the immune dysfunction in autoimmune disorders. This may also be the case in lupus. The defects in the immune system of people with Lupus include: (1) increased blood levels of IFN alpha; (2) a decreased sensitivity to the effects of IFN; and (3) a reduced ability to produce IFN.1: J Okla State Med Assoc. 1994 May;87(5):228-30.LinksRheumatoid arthritis: a complication of interferon therapy.Nadir F, Fagiuoli S, Wright HI, Nadir A, Hopp E, Gavaler J, Van Thiel DH.Oklahoma Transplantation Institute, Baptist Medical Center of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City 73112.A case report of rheumatoid arthritis developing during alpha-interferon therapy of chronic hepatitis C is reported. The rheumatoid arthritis was severe, being non-responsive to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and persisted despite discontinuation of the interferon therapy. The literature relative to this case suggesting an association between rheumatoid arthritis and interferon therapy is presented. This case suggests that interferon therapy may precipitate subclinical rheumatoid arthritis in an individual without pre-existing clinical arthritis.PMID: 8051581 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]http://****N.
