            "answer": "Hi!Commonest cause of chronic nausea and vomiting is acidity. Take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Chronic hepatitis or chronic infection of the gall bladder are the other possibilities. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done. Keep a food diary and see if there is a co-relation between what you eat and symptoms that appear. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I'm 17 years old, and I was vomiting for 2 weeks straight, I could eat something light and be fine.. But, once I ate a meal I would throw it up. I had a bunch of test done and my doctor said it was a BUG?? THAT LAST 2 WEEKS? Yeah, right. Then I called and schedule a ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis, I found out I have several cyst. I hadn't threw up in about a week at that time.. Until,\u00a0\u00a0tonight! I ate a salad for dinner and threw it up, I also have low blood pressure. But I took it tonight and it's 116/99. I'm not diabetic or anything, I am not overweight. I'm 5'8 and weigh 140. I don't know what's going on.. I'm defiantly not pregnant. Also yesterday night I was laughing with my boyfriend and I got in his truck to leave the store and I got a sharp pain in my temple area, did not make me sick.. It just hurt really bad, I've never experienced pain there before.. I don't know if it has something to do with it as well or not. It only lasted a few seconds and went away but then came back and did that about 4 times. If anyone has advice please let me know.. I really wanna stop throwing up and feel better. -Thank you!",
