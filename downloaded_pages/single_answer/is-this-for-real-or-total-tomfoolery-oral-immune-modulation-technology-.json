    "question": "Immuron To Acquire Intellectual Property from Hadassah Medical CenterImmuron introduces an Oral Immune Modulation technology acquired from Hadassah. Technology could yield within 2-3 years an all- natural, side effect free approach to diseases including Metabolic Syndrome, Hepatitis C and Type II Diabetes.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEPRLog (Press Release) \u2013 Apr 19, 2009 \u2013 NEW YORK and MELBOURNE. Immuron (ASX: IMC), a biopharmaceutical company, today announced an agreement to acquire a novel Oral Immune Modulation technology from Hadasit, the commercialization arm of Hadassah Medical Center in Israel.The combination of oral immune modulation with Immuron\u2019s existing oral protein and antibody technology could yield a convenient, all- natural, side effect free approach to address serious diseases which have multi-billion dollars markets, including Metabolic Syndrome, Hepatitis C and Type II Diabetes.Hadassah Medical Center scientists have demonstrated that their oral immune modulation approach, used in combination with Immuron\u2019s own dairy\u00a0\u00a0derived antibodies and other proteins, can directly affect the activity level of regulatory T\u00a0\u00a0cells, a type of immune cell known to have profound\u00a0\u00a0effects in controlling the inflammation in many diseases. This novel approach has shown positive effects in several validated animal models of human disease, including type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome.Immuron will focus its initial clinical development effort with this platform technology on three major diseases having inadequate medical therapy now: Metabolic Syndrome, chronic Hepatitis C (HCV) and Liver Cancer (hepatoma).\u00a0\u00a0These conditions represent major pharmaceutical market targets in industrial and developing countries, and can have severe consequences for affected patients.Immuron intends to initiate clinical trials for metabolic syndrome and HCV shortly after the acquisition. Given that the products are intended to be marketed as a Medical Food in the United States (and under similar classifications in other countries), it is expected that Immuron can introduce commercial products for some indications shortly after such trials, potentially within 2-3 years.The new platform technology will also provide an additional layer of patent protection to strengthen the existing Immuron pipeline products (which target Traveller\u2019s Diarrhea, HIV/AIDS immune depletion, Mucositis and Influenza).The Metabolic Syndrome is defined as a combination of abdominal obesity, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is associated with a constellation of common clinical conditions, including type II diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia. It is estimated that up to 25% of the western population have manifestations of this disorder. An analysis by Medco Heath solutions claimed that the average yearly US pharmacy cost of treating adult patients with Metabolic Syndrome exceeds $4,000 per patient - more than four times the average annual drug spend for all other patients.\u00a0\u00a0With more than 45 million Americans affected by metabolic syndrome the target market is large.Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a condtion which considerably overlaps Metabolic Syndrome at the immunological level, and is one stage on the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. It is estimated that 8.6 million obese adult Americans may have NASH and about 30.1 million may have the milder steatosis. Since no effective medical therapy is currently available for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, Immuron will also address this clinical target.Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection affects about 2-3% of the world\u2019s population (170 million people) and in the USA alone between 3-4 million people have chronic HCV infection. Patients with chronic HCV infection are at high risk for developing cirrhosis of the liver, end stage liver disease, or cancer. There are emerging immunological linkages between Hepatitis C and type II diabetes.In addition to the acquired Intellectual Property, Hadasit will provide discounted clinical and laboratory services to Immuron, providing Immuron with efficiencies in its cost structure for human clinical trials.\u00a0\u00a0In return, Hadasit shall be issued 19.99% of Immuron\u2019s equity at the time of the approval of the transaction by Immuron\u2019s shareholders, as well as royalty on selected Immuron products.\u00a0\u00a0A special meeting of Immuron\u2019s shareholders will be called during May this year to approve this share allocation.As part of its due diligence, Immuron commissioned Biocomm Squared (Biocomm2), to assess the scientific and economic foundation of Hadasit\u2019s Intellectual Property (IP). The full report prepared by Biocomm2has been lodged at ASX in conjunction with this announcement and is available on Immuron\u2019s web site: http://www.immuron.comProfessor Yaron Ilan from Hadassah Medical Center, a recognized world expert on oral immune modulation, will become the Medical Director of Immuron. Prof. Ilan will continue to serve simultaneously as the Director of the Department of Medicine A and the Deputy Dean of the Hebrew University-Hadassah Faculty of Medicine.Dr. Zeil Rosenberg, CEO of Immuron, noted \u201cThis transaction marks a turning point for Immuron in its quest to lay a firm scientific foundation for its own technology to address large unmet medical needs\u201dDr. Rafi Hofstein, CEO of Hadasit noted \u201c Hadasit is happy that its discoveries can move so quickly into commercial partnership. Our world class clinical experts are ready and able to get the high quality clinical data needed to bring this biotechnology innovation to patients.\u201dDr. Oren Fuerst, Head of Business Development at Immuron noted \u201c The Hadassit technology\u00a0\u00a0provides Immuron with the ability to address several of the largest markets in the healthcare sector- Metabolic Syndrome, Diabetes, Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B and HIV. This transaction can generate large value for shareholders and helps position the company for profitable commercial partnerships with large pharmaceutical and consumer health companies .\u201dAbout ImmuronImmuron Limited (www.immuron.com) (IMC.AX ; OTCQX: IMROY) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on oral immunotherapy using colostrum-derived health products.
