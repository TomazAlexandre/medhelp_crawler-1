            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are exercising too much and not having enough water and electrolytes, then this could be the most important cause for nausea and fatigue. Apart from this stress, anemia, diabetes should be looked into as all can change the effect of exercise on the body. GERD or gastric reflux with acidity too could be another cause.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Drink plenty of fluids and slowly build up your exercise level. If this does not help, consult a doctor to rule out the other mentioned conditions. Take care!",
