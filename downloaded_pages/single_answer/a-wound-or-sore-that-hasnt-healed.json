            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!No a similar lesion cannot appear by just thinking. You must first and foremost rule out diabetes and peripheral artery disease as the cause of non healing scab. Possibility of eczema, psoriasis and fungal infection too should be looked into as these can also cause bilateral lesions.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please consult a skin specialist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Can a person think a sore to appear or can a sore that hasnt healed on one part of the body appear on another part like a mirror image just by thinking it?I have a sore or wound on my right ankle, its about 3 inches in diameter but started out the size of a mosquito bite. I believe it came from a spider bite almost a year ago. I've been giving topical medications and oral medications and nothing is working. It itches so bad that I cant stop myself from scratching it until it bleeds and hurts.\u00a0\u00a0I even cut off my finger nails and that didnt work. Recently there was a similar small patch on my left leg and then again the itching and scabbing and bleeding now its the size of a quater but started out the size of a ink pen blotch.my children are afraid that I'm goin to have to get my ankles cut off!",
