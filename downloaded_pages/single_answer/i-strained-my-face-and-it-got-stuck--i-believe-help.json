    "question": "About 3 months ago I was experiencing severe stress over my finances. It was to the point that one day I guess I strained hard. A facial strain. Forehead, bridge of my nose, jaws etc. Well this strain clinch apparently has remained instead of retracting to normal. As if it got stuck. Immediately afterward i had distorted vision etc. It has set off severe to mild panic attacks for that long. At first there was severe pressure between my eyes and and between my jaws. I was yawning about 3 weeks ago and the one between the jaws poped out. It made a crunching sound and it was gone. The one between my eyes remains. Its not a sinus infection. The pain is varies from moderate to severe depending on rest and stress. I can feel it sorta popping. I really just feels like it is stuck.Does anyone have a clue as to what this might be? A formal term?If so, how do I get rid of it?",
