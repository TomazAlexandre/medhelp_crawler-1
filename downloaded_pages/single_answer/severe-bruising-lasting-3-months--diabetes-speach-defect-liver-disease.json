    "question": "2 yrs. ago I had my teeth pulled and a denture put in, my face was pitch black and my eyes underneath were deep red. This bruising lasted 3 months, my speech began to be slurred and I knew what I wanted to say but words were hard to come out and be understandable. In 4 months I developed diabetes and in one year had to have 3 fissure operations. This month I found out I have liver scarring, non alocholic ciroshis of the liver.\u00a0\u00a0Found out the the anesthesia used was outdated because of the side effects. No one knows what happened and my speech is worse then ever, I used to be a public speaker now I very seldom speak. One my first hemmoriod operation, I was given no anesthic, my leg was tied to the side of the bed, they asked if anyone could speak for me, and I was discharged covered in blood the hospital was too busy to clean me so they gave my daughter and sister-in-law some cloths to clean me up",
