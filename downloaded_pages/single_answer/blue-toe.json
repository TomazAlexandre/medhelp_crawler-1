            "answer": "HiBlue toes are generally the result of poor blood supply as in Raynaud\u2019s disease. If you are a smoker there is a chance that you have Buerger\u2019s disease. This can cause soreness and discoloration of toes. Peripheral vascular disease causing small blood vessels of toes to block can also be the cause. The commonest cause of bluish discolored toes is gangrene and Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Buerger\u2019s disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, connective tissue disorders etc also cause discoloration with fever. Dopplar studies have ruled out a vascular phenomenon. So the other causes will have to be investigated. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
