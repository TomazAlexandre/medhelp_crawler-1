            "answer": "Hi,first things first.your A1C is too high.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally it should be < 6.5.\u00a0\u00a0Are you on medication for this?\u00a0\u00a0You need to work with your doctor to agressively manage the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This means getting to and maintaining optimal weight, exercise, lower carb diet, and medications as necessary.Did the doctors test any other thyroid tests than AntiTPO? This test can't tell us much if it is onlly tested by itself.\u00a0\u00a0It simply means that there are some antithyroid antibodies present.Next step, if it hasn't been done already should be a fully thyroid panel, at least including TSH, FT3 and FT4.\u00a0\u00a0With these tests your thyroid status can be better evaluated.\u00a0\u00a0If you have these results already please post them along with the reference range, and then we can better comment / advise.hope this helps.",
