    "question": "Hi,Past 3 months have been difficult for me, it all started with extreme pressure on each side of my head, which lasted about a day or 2 and then went away.Since then, I've had this annoying problem with my eyes. After football training, my eyes struggle to focus on anything close to me (within arms length) I've had my eyes checked, which came back fine. It takes about 20-30 mins for my eyes to go back to normal.",
