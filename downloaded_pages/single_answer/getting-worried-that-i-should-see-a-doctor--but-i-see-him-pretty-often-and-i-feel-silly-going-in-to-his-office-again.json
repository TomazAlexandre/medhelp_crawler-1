            "answer": "Were I you, I'd go in to the doctor again. You are young and it's probably nothing, but since it is a new symptom you should have it checked out, if just to give you some peace of mind. Your rx could be affecting the overall picture, not up on progesterone so I don't know. It's always a good idea to have the doc try to determine why you are suddenly having tachycardia.Hope you feel better soon.Congratulations on nursing school!!",

    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I have been experiencing something in my chest over the last few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I never thought it was much more than sleeping in the wrong position until I was at the hospital for nursing school last week and clipped an SpO2 monitor to my finger.\u00a0\u00a0My SpO2 is always 96-100%, but my heart rate was 132bpm.\u00a0\u00a0I checked it again later the same day and several times over the next couple of days.\u00a0\u00a0My HR varied from 107-135 until yesterday when it was back down to 88.\u00a0\u00a0Today the pain is back and is a little worse than before.\u00a0\u00a0Before I would rate it a 1-2/10 tonight I would say a 3/10.\u00a0\u00a0It originates from between the top of my left breast and the corner of my arm pit.\u00a0\u00a0I have felt it a little in the front side of my shoulder and now up the left side of my neck.\u00a0\u00a0It's not bad pain, but enough that I'm starting to worry.\u00a0\u00a0The HR is what worries me the most.\u00a0\u00a0Here's my history:28 year old Caucasian Female, 5'5\" and 230lbs. Sever High triglycerides of 1500 that were brought down to 750 with diet control and Tricor, then brought down to 350 with the addition of 4G of Omacor a day (My father and older brother have the exact same lipid problem - both had 1500 when 1st tested and are both at 750 on Tricor but have not tried Omacor yet).\u00a0\u00a0I also take Glucaphage to treat insulin resistance related to my PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome).\u00a0\u00a0I do NOT have diabetes, however I do have family history (paternal aunt and grandfather) so I know I am at pretty high risk.\u00a0\u00a0I had rheumatic fever when I was 6 years old and had a heart murmur as a result that has been undetectable for 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0An Echo was done a little over a year ago to rull out heart issues when\u00a0\u00a0complained of waking up gasping for air.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea and have a CPAP machine I used only frequently until recently when my husband began complaining daily about my snoring, so I'm trying to use it more now so he can sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I was told the Echo showed mild left ventricular enlargement but was told there was no known reason and it was no big deal and wouldn't cause me any trouble in the future.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, and since I have an extremely irregular menstral cycle I am currently taking Progesterone to cause withdrawal mestration (this was prescribed by my OB/GYN when I complained of pain and pressure during intercourse and an ultrasound showe no cysts or growths - I will take it 3 months in a row, this is my 2nd month.\u00a0\u00a0The pain and pressure have greatly reduced after just having one menstral cycle).I've been at my doctors office so often over the last two years that they all know my voice when I call due to the huge series of exams, vaccines, and titers required for nursing school as well as for treatment of my high triglycerides.\u00a0\u00a0I feel silly going in yet again.",
