    "question": "Chemo dosing key to ovarian cancer survival in obese womenMonday, January 05, 2009DAVE PARKSNews staff writerAdjusting chemotherapy doses so they are consistent with body weight appears to eliminate higher death rates that have been found among obese women with ovarian cancer, according to a new UAB study.The study compared survival rates between obese and non-obese women with ovarian cancer.Earlier studies had found that obese women with ovarian cancer were likely to have shorter survival times than non-obese patients with a similar type and stage of ovarian cancer.The new study, which is being published in journal Gynocology Oncology, found no statistical difference between obese and non-obese patients who underwent similar surgeries and were given chemotherapy based on their body weight.\"Often chemotherapy dosing is calculated using ideal body weight as a guide,\" said Dr. Kellie Matthews, an OB/GYN at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and lead author of the study. \"We found using actual body weight works best, and it wipes away much of the difference in survival rates between obese and non-obese patients.\"Researchers looked at records from 304 patients diagnosed with an aggressive form of epithelial ovarian cancer, and showed that when actual body weight was used in chemotherapy dosing the overall survival was 40 months for non-obese patients and 47 months for obese patients - statistically identical rates when considering the relatively small size of the study.However, doctors warned that obesity still puts women at increased risk for complications related to cancer surgery.Obese women are likely to have greater blood loss and more difficulty in healing incisions. Research also shows obese women are more likely to have other health problems, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease that may affect cancer treatment.The study was the product of a collaboration between UAB's Division of Gynecologic Oncology, the Division of Hematology/Oncology and the University of South Alabama's Mitchell Cancer Institute in Mobile.Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer among U.S. women, and it causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 20,095 women in the United States were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2004, and 14,716 women died from the disease. More than $2.2 billion is spent each year in the United States on the treatment of ovarian cancer.",
