    "question": "I have been \"borderline\" Hypoglycemic for years now. I am 28. Lately I have been having more \"episodes\". My fasting glucose is normally between 70-85. But yesterday it was 60. I have severe symptoms with these glucose drops. After my meals my glucose reading go between 120-155, depending on my meal. I have really started learning what to eat and have changed my meals somewhat. No candy bars, cokes, etc. I had a 4 hour Glucose Tolerance Test and the fasting results was 85. First hour was 167, second was 107, third was 97, fourth was 67. My doctor seemed to not be concerned but I am. Is this abnormal? I know my ups and downs are causing me to have hypo symptoms even in normal ranges. I am tired all of the time and hungry. I am not over weight and I am overall pretty healthy. Do I need a second opinion or is this normal results? Thanks!",
