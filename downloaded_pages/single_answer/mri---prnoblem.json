            "answer": "Hi!A 3mm saccular aneurysm in the internal carotid artery usually requires a wait and watch policy. Usually aneurysms 1cm and above in size are taken up for surgery. The small vessel disease could be due to diabetes, high cholesterol, hyperlipidemia or thyroid disorders. This along with MS can cause brain atrophy. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
