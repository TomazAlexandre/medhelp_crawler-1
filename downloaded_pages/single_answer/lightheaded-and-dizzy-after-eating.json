    "question": "I was wondering if i had diabetes possibly? and if not what else could be wrong? After i eat i get really dizzy or lightheaded..sometimes i get a headache too. and one day i didnt eat until\u00a0\u00a04 pm and felt like i was gonna pass out. I take Ambilify for bi-polar disorder. and it can cause you to be diabetic, im 16 and have had a child from wich i gained 50 lbs. so i am about 50 lbs overwieght now. wich increases the chance for diabetes...i took a blood test wich i assume came back normal since the doctor didnt call. so is what im describing the symtoms of diabtes or something else?",
