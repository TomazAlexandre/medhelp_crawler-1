            "answer": "Hello,This feeling of pins and needles sensations that you are having are called Paresthesia. Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "Im 20 year old male. NO RASH. No inflammation. Just itching all over. More like pins and needles. Have had all blood work done and all normal. The itching comes with burning sensations as well. I have been to the doctor several times. Eventually they said it was from anxiety and/or depression. I had a bad reaction after one pill of anti-depressant celexa and was given xanax to take instead to help. Xanax doesnt do much except calms the nerves but it doesnt go away. I dont feel depressed or anxiety at all! I stopped taking xanax. I went out of town last week to chicago and the whole wee i was up there i didnt have these symptoms at all. Why not? I have horrible posture. Could it be a pinched nerve?",
