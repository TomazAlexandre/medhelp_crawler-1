It is also common during the winters when one tends to sweat less and thus our body tries to compensate by making more urine. The second possibility is of a urinary tract infection.However, it\u2019s also a sign of Diabetes mellitus and will thus suggest you to get his blood sugar checked. It is usually associated with other symptoms also like excessive hunger & excessive thirst. Please get the urine analysis done as there\u2019s another condition called diabetes inspidus in which the urine is not properly concentrated and thus more dilute urine is passed.I suggest you to consult a physician for this. I sincerely hope this information helps. Take care.",
