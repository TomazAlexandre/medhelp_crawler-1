    "question": "I am a 15 year old teen girl and was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes a year and 3 months ago and I am still in the \"honeymoon\" period(this is the time after diagnosage when the pancreas still produces some insulin). I have been told the average honeymoon period lasts 6 months to a year after being diagnosed. Right now I am not taking any Humalog (fast acting insulin) at all and I only take 4 units of Humalin(long acting) in the morning and 1 unit of Humalin at night. Most people usually end up taking as many units a day as half their body weight. I still end up low in the day sometimes and I do not understand how that is possible on this low amount of insulin. I do moderate weight training on a daily basis ( mostly ab workouts) but not alot of cardio or enough to make up for that much insulin. Plus sometimes I end up eating more than required and my weight fluxuates a few pounds although I am usually thin.Also, about a month after diagnosage I went to acupunture and still to this day continue to go once a month and we hope to see if this prolongs the honeymoon period.I wonder if this low dose of insulin is normal in the first year, if the acupunture helped, or if anyone else has tried acupunture to decrease insulin resistance.",
