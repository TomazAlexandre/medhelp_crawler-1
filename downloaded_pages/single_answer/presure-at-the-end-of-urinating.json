            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. I think it is over active bladder in your case causing frequency, urgency and over flow incontinence.Also, pain in the back right hypochondrial region needs to be evaluated. An ultrasound abdomen can rule out conditions if any like nephritis, pancreatitis, renal stones etc. Do you have any other medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension etc? It would be better to get evaluated for diabetes, as this can cause increased frequency. It is advised to maintain a intake and out put diary to help in ruling out excess intake.Consult a urologist for further assistance.Best.",

    "question": "Hello, I am a healthy 36 yr. old female. However lately I have been having really bad presure to go urinate then just a little will come out. It is worse when I lay down. I do not get a full night sleep because of this. At times it is so bad I do not know if I will make it to the bathroom in time.There is presure all day to go to the bathroom and when I do go right before the end I will get a strong presure feeling. The color is either almost clear to a very light color yellow. There is no odor to it. I am not sure what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0In addition I just noticed tonight that my back is hurting right under my right rib cage on the side towards the back. I am not sure if this has anything to do with it though.K.",
