            "answer": "Hi!Yes, if your doctor has put you on Victoza then please continue it as long as your doctor prescribes it. You will need to keep a tab on your blood sugar levels. Yes, it has caused cancer in animal studies, but the dose was much higher than normally prescribed for humans. So, it should be safe as the dose in humans is much less and it has been approved for use in diabetes\u2014which means it was found safe for use in humans. However, please voice your concerns with your treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
