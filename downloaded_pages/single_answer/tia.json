            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth, dental caries, etc\u00a0\u00a0can all cause facial weakness and pain. Since you had fever, these possibilities should be looked into.Hemi facial weakness is also seen in Bell\u2019s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia where a spasm may cause weakness, or due to acoustic neuroma which is a benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve.Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
