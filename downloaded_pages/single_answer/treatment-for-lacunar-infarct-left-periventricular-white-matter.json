            "answer": "Hi there!There is little that can be done to treat chronic infarcts, while management is aimed to prevent such episodes in future. Aside the blood thinning agents and regular monitoring of blood coagulability; the hypertension and the diabetes would need to be strictly controlled, since these can be compounding factors in the condition. For the vertigo, it is advised to consult an ENT specialist or a neurologist for a detailed evaluation and suggestion of an appropriate management plan.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
