            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!One possibility is poor sleep pattern. This could be due to several reasons and they need to be investigated. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
