            "answer": "Worrying never did anyone any good! It is not necessarily true that she will get diabetes if your husband has it. I don't know exact statistics but you could do a search. The symptoms to watch for are increased thirst and urination, excessive hunger and weight loss. If you become concerned you can have her doctor do a blood test. Provide healthy foods and limit sugar which I'm sure you do due to your husband's diabetes, and just enjoy your daughter!",
