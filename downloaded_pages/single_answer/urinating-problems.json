            "answer": "Needless to say, this is an uncommon problem in adults. I fully empathize with you and ask you to seek medical help immediately from your doctor.The reasons could be stress, functionally small bladder, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, urinary bladder wall instability, UTI, stones and neurological problems.I think you should discuss this with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. You will need to undergo a few tests to reach a diagnosis. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Its been two years now and still happening where ive been constantly living in fear that i am going to wet myself in public around friends and well anywhere i go. I always have the urge when im nervous at work or with people i dont know. I find that when im at home or by myself i feel fine i dont have any urge, but any other time im always going to the toilet. I dont know if this is a problem with myself or if im just making this up in my head. Ive been to the doctor awhile ago and there was nothing wrong with me. At night and lately i dont know if its getting worse i feel pressure on my bladder, where i try not to think about it but when i do i seem to be going to the toilet every 15mins and then nothing happens. I would like to know how i can be fixed as its stoping me from doing normal day things like going for a walk or going out to dinner or even going to a friends. Ive not told anyone my problem as i am really embaressed, but would like to move on in my life as im only 23yrs old.",
