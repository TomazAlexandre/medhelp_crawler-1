    "question": "Hi I am 27 years old and went in to the dr regarding several concerns.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I may have developed diabetes as I was gestationally diabetic and am more prone to getting diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My dr did a whole blood work and I came back as having eleveated ALP levels.\u00a0\u00a0I believe they were either 165 or 195.\u00a0\u00a0He stated that he wanted to wait a month and retest me.\u00a0\u00a0I did that and the levels came back elevated again but not as high.\u00a0\u00a0(He didn't give me the level.)\u00a0\u00a0He would like to wait two more months and run the test again.\u00a0\u00a0I was just wondering if this is something that I should consult someone else about or if I should just wait two months to see what happens.\u00a0\u00a0My dr stated that he couldn't remember what this enzyme does so I don't have a lot of faith in him right now.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any and all feedback especially from a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!Charlene",
