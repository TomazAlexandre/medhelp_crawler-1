    "question": "I am around 43 years old. I was diabetic but now under control. Over the past few months, I have noticed that my penis skin has developed a dry texture. But most importantly, the rim of the penis foreskin, develops a white layer in the morning. Also it is difficult to pull the foreskin completely back. This has begun to happen everyday in the morning. I wash the white layer on the foreaskin and on the penis head (after peeling the foreskin back). However, the penis foresking at the tip has developed\u00a0\u00a0a few cracks which gives an irritating sensation\u00a0\u00a0on and off.Can please somebody explain to me the reasons and allay my fears that I have developed some infection?",
