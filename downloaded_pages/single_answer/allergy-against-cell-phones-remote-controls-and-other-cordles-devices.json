            "answer": "I am very sorry to hear of your Mother\u2019s chronic pain.\u00a0\u00a0You mention that the pain begins in her back and that may be a clue that much, if not all, of her pain is secondary to pressure on a number of nerves, the pressure caused by arthritis of the spine or by a damaged disc.\u00a0\u00a0Many good arthritis drugs are now available and worth a try, some less irritating to the stomach than others.But pain has many causes and a very common cause is diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to ask her doctor to check on this.\u00a0\u00a0If the nerve irritation is from diabetes, treatment of it might relieve the pain.You said she has the pain at night and it prevents deep sleep.\u00a0\u00a0One way to prevent this is for her to find a comfortable position and then set up a number of\u00a0\u00a0pillows to try to keep her in that position.\u00a0\u00a0Also, there are devices, such as one called TENS, that are said to relieve pain by electrical stimulation.To answer your question, I very much doubt that her feeling of skin stretching when she holds the phone or TV devices is due to batteries.\u00a0\u00a0Much more likely to be coming from already inflamed or irritated nerves.I wish I could be more helpful.",

    "question": "Hello,I am writing this on behalf of my mother who is 70 years old.She is chronically suffering from pain all over her body.The pain travels from one part to another and often prevents her from deep sleep.She could not find any remedy with the doctors in Turkey.The pain initially stem from her back but this is also very difficult to understand.She is at this state for the last 5 years.Recently she has developed some sort of allergy, where she says her skin feels like strecthing when she holds a cellular phone,cordless phone or the TV remote control. I am suspecting this from the batteries is this possible?I would be so so grateful if someone can give advise on these two problems for my poor mother.God bless you.",
