            "answer": "Hi!Some women lose weight during first trimester in pregnancy. This could be due to nausea, loss of appetite or due to vomiting. However, if you do not have morning sickness or aversions to certain food types, then weight loss could be due to diabetes, hyperthyroidism or any chronic infection. Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your gynecologist regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
