            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This night time nausea, burping, bloated stomach etc could be due to heavy meal at night. You could also be having acidity and gastric reflux. Take omeprazole empty stomach in morning and antacid gel after meals. Reduce the portion of meal size. Eat small frequent meals. In the evening eat early supper and move around the house or stroll outside. At late night you can take a light snack.Try these tips and see if they help. Else consult your PCP. You may also need to check for diabetes, hypothyroidism, liver problems.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been feeling nauseous now for the last week. It starts around 9:30-10 at night and gets better when I don't move. I also get really tired during this time. If I don't lay down I burp a lot and have a bloated stomach. Does anyone know how to make it stop/what it is?",
