            "answer": "Hi!What you have is probably postural hypotension. The blood pressure falls when a person stands from a sitting position or gets up from a lying down position and causes dizziness. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated or uncontrolled diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. So, yes, exposure to cold or stress or any of these causes could be the reason you are dizzy when you stand up suddenly. Please discuss this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "A couple of things:The other day, I was at work and I noticed that my middle finger felt a little funny. I looked down and it was white. Now it was a little chilly, but not freezing. After a few minutes, the color returned to my finger and I was fine.Today, after sitting for a little while, I stood up. I must have stood up too fast, because I suddenly felt dizzy and lightheaded. I've had this happen before whenever I've stood up too fast, so I figured I would just stand for a minute until it passed. As I was standing there everything went black and next thing I know, I'm on the floor. I don't remember falling to the floor and as I came to, I could feel my legs shaking. I have never had this happen before.Could the two possibly be related?",
