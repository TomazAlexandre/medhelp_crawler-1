Otherwise unexplained carpal tunnel syndrome is on rare occasions the first clue to someone having diabetes. On rare occasions, neuropathy can PRECEDE the clinical diagnosis of diabetes and/or be disproprtionately severe to the degree of apparent diabetes. A fasting blood sugar of 190 is certainly well above the normal limit of 110-120, depending on your local lab's range of normal values. Control of diabetes has been shown to be helpful to persons with daibetes in a recent alrge trial called the DCCT (Diabetes Complication and Control Trial). There is a simple blood test called a hemoglobin A1C test that will show how severe or mild your husband's diabetes (if indeed he even has it) has been over the past few months. All this having been said, it also sounds as if your husband is suffering from a serious chronic pain problem far above and beyond any degree of underlying neurological or other disease that might also be present, and that from your description of things it sounds like there is a MAJOR psychiatric or psychological component to your husband's complaints that needs to be addressed FAST. No surgery, test, or medical label will fix this part of things. By the way, the lack of major improvement in your husband's symptoms is not surprising, since diabetes related carpal tunnel syndrome (or apparent carpal tunnel syndrome) does not usually respond well electrically or clinically to such surgeries, and psychiatric pain syndromes will usually worsen after such surgeries, since they provide additonal minor physical stimuli which are greatly magnified into grossly disproportionate degrees of pain by the affected indiviual's mind. At any rate, I would suggest the hemoglobin A1c test, controlling the diabetes , and seeing a PAIN MANAGEMENT PROGRAM PSYCHIATRIST ASAP!!! Otherwise your husband will pain his life away, perceiving and reporting every penny's worth of pain as a dollar's worth, never getting on with his life. I hope this information ishelpful to you and that your husband is willing to get the help he needs.",
