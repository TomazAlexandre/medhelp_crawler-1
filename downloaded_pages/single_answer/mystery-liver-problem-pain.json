            "answer": "Greetings Bruce,Sounds like the first problem was a diabetic type response to something:\u00a0\u00a0Have you been referred to an endocronologist? (just curious) and a multiple organ type problem might be explained by something like cryoglobulinimia, sarcoidosis, etc....Kinda rare stuff, but diseases that make the afflicted feel pretty crummy for certain....Keep on keepin on, and read read read (with an open mind) theres a lot of good (and sadly some mis and bad) info on the webJack",

    "question": "I have been through living hell the last three weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I have racked up almost $150,000 in medical bills yet no one has figured out what is wrong with me.Right to the point:Started off with extreme thirst, frequent peeing and retention.\u00a0\u00a0Back pain under right shoulder blade in one spot, and also under right rib cage that radiates to the back. The pain hurts worse when i breathe in.\u00a0\u00a0Its a very bad pressure discomfort.I have had every test known to mankind including:\u00a0\u00a0MRI of back and spine, Stomache scope, kidney MRI, Liver MRI, nuclear testing, multiple blood screening.I have seen every type of doctor except a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0My family doctor of 17 years has basically told me he is lost.The pain was also in my gallblatter area, but I had that removed last Saturday as it was part of this general discomfort.\u00a0\u00a0They did lab work on the gallblatter to find out it was inflamed, but not diseased.\u00a0\u00a0All doctors agree that whatever this is going on, was also causing discomfort.\u00a0\u00a0Half of them say its muscular skeletel, the others say its not.\u00a0\u00a0Someone thought Shingles, but i have no other symptoms except the pressure and discomfort.I am a 42 year old guy, 5'10 170, work out every day until 3 weeks ago when my life fell apart.\u00a0\u00a0As I type this I can feel pressure under my right rib cage and also pain in about a 3 by 3 area under my rib cage.It is NOT diabetes, pancreatitits, gallblatter (anymore), muscle tear, bulging disc, reflux, injury.\u00a0\u00a0However I do feel like someone beat the **** out of me with a bat yesterday and i just work up from a mugging. But its been three weeks now.Does anyone have any clue on what the heck is happening to me and why i have so much discomfort?bruce",
