            "answer": "Hello,What you seem to be having is called premature ejaculation. Common causes causing such symptoms are stress and anxiety,poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, negative feelings about non performance smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, testicular, spinal and neurological causes.The treatment of premature ejaculation is having a psychological session with the couple, stop-start or squeeze-pause techniques, desensitizing creams and SRRI(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) in severe cases. My sincere advice is to consult a urologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
