    "question": "6 months ago my wife cheated on me.\u00a0\u00a0It was a one time thing with a friend of hers while they were both incredibly drunk and from what she told me the incident lasted only a few seconds and moments after penetration she ran out of the room crying over what she had done.\u00a0\u00a0After 12 years of marriage I can honestly say that I believe her that this is what happened because she has never lied to me before.\u00a0\u00a0Since then she has ceased all forms of communication with him and we have done the best to repair our marriage but I have developed a problem which I can't overcome.She is a beautiful woman and I love her to pieces but since the incident I can't maintain an erection during intercourse or any form of contact.\u00a0\u00a0I can obtain an erection with no problems but just prior to ejaculation I will lose my erection and it won't come back no matter how much we try.\u00a0\u00a0If I leave the room and she is not around my erection will return and I can \"finish\".\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid that this will continue to happen and will create a problem for us.\u00a0\u00a0At the moment I have made excuses to my wife that I just have not been feeling well and have made changes to my diet to improve the situation.\u00a0\u00a0I am very scared that I will not overcome this have no idea what to do.How do I clear my head and just make things go back to normal?\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to leave my wife. I just want our life back.",
