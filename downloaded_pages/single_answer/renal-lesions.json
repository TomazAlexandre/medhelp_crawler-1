    "question": "I had a CAT scan showed a couple of subcentimeter low attenuation renal lesions too small to accurately characterize they said but probably cysts and unchanged.\u00a0\u00a0I was told before they were cyst by this doctor. I just picked up my records and had a CAT scan due to pain and incontinence problems I suffer from diabetes type 2. Should I be concerned. I have had a kidney blood test I think and it was fine. It states my bladder is decompressed and can't be evaluated due to that. What does that mean?? HELP!",
