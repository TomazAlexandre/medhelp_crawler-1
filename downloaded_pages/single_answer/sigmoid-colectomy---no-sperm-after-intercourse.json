            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include injury to the genitor-urinary tract or causes for ejaculatory dysfunction such as psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. I would suggest considering an evaluation by a urologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
