            "answer": "Fishy odor is most often caused by bacterial vaginosis. Think of it like a yeast infection but it's bacteria that are growing out of control instead of yeast.If you are getting these repeatedly even after treatment, I can only offer some ideas for why it is turning up again.It is very possible that your partners are reinfecting you. A bacteria that doesn't bother them at all could be an irritant to you. Although BV isn't technically a sexually transmitted disease, your partners could still be the source of the problem, and not just by penetration, but also possibly from oral sex too because there are lots of bacteria that live in the mouth.It is also possible that a sex toy that isn't cleaned completely could be carrying bacteria and reinfecting you.The other question I would ask is whether or not they are taking a swab and sending it for tests to determine exactly what type of bacterium is causing the infection. Depending on what it is, you may not be getting the right antibiotic.And of course antibiotics work best when taken as directed, for the entire length of the prescription and without drinking alcohol. If you're just getting a shot, perhaps you need to follow up with doses taken orally.There are also bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. It may be difficult to find a doctor who is knowledgeable about this possibility, but perhaps if you find out exactly what type of bacteria is causing the infection, you can also learn about treatments for persistent forms of that bacteria.And lastly, do you have an underlying health factor that would make you more susceptible to infection. For instance, hormone imbalances, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases could all make you more likely to get an infection or not be able to get rid of a persistent one.Sorry, I don't know much about the Mirena IUD and whether or not this is adding to the problem. From what I've read, an IUD in conjunction with another infection could raise your risk for pelvic inflammatory disease but I don't know if it could be adding to your risk of getting the infection in the first place.Bacterial vaginitis can also cause burning and itching depending on the type of bacteria that is causing the problem.Of course, I haven't stated the obvious, that having sex with multiple partners could also put you at risk for sexually transmitted diseases. Condoms would also keep your partner from reinfecting you.I wish you the best of luck getting this taken care of. And if your doctor is just giving you a shot and sending you on your way, I would recommend pushing for more in-depth medical treatment or finding a different doctor.",

    "question": "I have vaginal swelling and itching really bad in my lower area right outside of the opening of my vagina, I had this before and the doctor diagnosised me with vaginitis. It has been several months since this has happen to me. I am using the Mirena IUD and I am wondering should I have had the Mirena removed when this first happen? Also when I'm not having this problem, I have a really bad discharge that smells fishy.I do have have multiple sex partners, and everytime I go to the doctor they just give me a shot of antibiotics (Penicilin)\u00a0\u00a0Do you know why this is happening?",
