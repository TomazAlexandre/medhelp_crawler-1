    "question": "This is a complicated question... my mother has brain cancer and has undergone radiation and chemo.\u00a0\u00a0The steroid (decadron) that she needed to take has brought on muscle deterioration as well as diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She has slowly lost the use of her right hand and has extreme weakness in her right leg.\u00a0\u00a0Her right foot is often swollen.\u00a0\u00a0Frankly her doctors are saying they don't know what it is... \"could be the tumor or the chemo.. just dont know\".\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if it could be neuropathy or another compication from the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0When we first learned of her diabetes in June, she could not walk or use the right arm.\u00a0\u00a0That cleared up when the sugar got under control.\u00a0\u00a0However, the insulin does was lowered so much due to low AM readings, that her daytime sugars are kind of high again.\u00a0\u00a0Could these issues be due to the diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Anyone ever have this?\u00a0\u00a0If so, could it be reversed?",
