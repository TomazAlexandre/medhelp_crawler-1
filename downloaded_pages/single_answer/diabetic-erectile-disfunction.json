    "question": "Hello, I hope you can help.My close friend and I (63/59) both have Type II Diabetes. whilst mine is well controlled his is not always. He has erectile disfunction which is causing him problems mentally, as he no longer feels he is a man!\u00a0\u00a0As a result he drinks, sometimes excessively. It is preventing us being as close as we would wish to be, as he shies away from close contact, fearing sexual activity.I believe this can be managed with the help of drugs to enable him to have successful erections when he wants them?Could you please advise what would be required and of course the cost? Currently as a diabetic his medicines are free.Thanking you in advanceM",
