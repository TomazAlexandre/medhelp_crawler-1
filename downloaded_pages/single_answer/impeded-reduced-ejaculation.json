            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Ejaculation is a complex process and it occurs due to coordination of a number of factors like muscles, hormones, blood vessels, nerves and emotional factors.Do you have any medical conditions for which you are taking medicines? Because certain medical conditions like hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, depression, anxiety, stress can all lead to some degree of ED. Also with age there is some change in erectile function.Vitamin C has no effect on ejaculation. I would suggest that you get a prostrate examination done, because certain infections to the prostrate can lead to the change in consistency and amount of seminal fluid ejaculated.Consult a urologist for further assistance.Take care",

    "question": "Over the past 2 to 3 months I have noticed a reduction in the amount of seminal fluids after ejaculating. This is accompanied by a feeling of not having a full orgasm. My penis does not have the firmness that it once had but it is stiff enough to make love.Difficult to describe my feeling after making love but I just know it is not as before.I cannot say if it is related to age (I am about 47 yrs old).\u00a0\u00a0What I know for sure is that just before this period of dissatisfaction I had the best of ejaculation (though over a relatively short time) and that the consistency of the seminal fluid was less viscous than I am currently producing. Also the amount of seminal fluid was far greater than is the case now.The only changes to my life style that I can readily identify is that I taking vitamin c daily. I consider myself healthy and not stressed. In fact I use sex as a form of stress relief. So having good sex is very important to me. Now I am not sure.Kweison",
