This can also be caused by other conditions such as Bell's palsy\u00a0\u00a0which is a form of temporary facial paralysis resulting from damage or trauma to one of the facial nerves. With a problem with your optic nerve, this may also be possible. The symptoms of Bell's palsy usually begin suddenly and range in severity from mild weakness to total paralysis.It may also present with twitching, weakness, or paralysis, drooping eyelid or corner of the mouth, drooling, dry eye or mouth, impairment of taste, and excessive tearing in the eye. Have this evaluated by your doctor for proper diagnosis. Take care and regards.",
