            "answer": "Diabetic neuropathy which might account for those symptoms usually occurs after many years of prolonged high blood sugars. Have you ever had your blood sugar teted. If you have had normal blood sugar readings in the recent past neuropathy isn't too likely. More common symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination and increased thirst and sometimes hunger. Your changes in consuming sugar can only be an improvement in your health even if you don't have diabetes!

    "question": "Hi, I have been feeling weird lately. I havent seen a doctor yet becasue I am still trying to find one. I use to be military but now that I am not I have to figure out how to live as a civilian. Anyway, I have been having the jitters, my legs and arms will have a tingling feeling and I feel like my skin is twiching. I know that may sound crazy but I read that could be a sign of diabetes. I have also been feeling tired but I run and I workout. I have stopped eating so much sugar but does anyone have any other suggestions. I wonder if its just in my head because I read a lot about health.",
