            "answer": "The answer right now is no. Type 1 diabetics produce very little or no insulin on their own and we need insulin to live. But they are currently working on many different areas of research and treatment for diabetes and your daughter being only 6 months old I would have lots of hope that they will find something. If you read a little about diabetes history you will see how far it's come and how lucky we are to have diabetes now (if you can call it lucky) instead of 75 years ago. I will hope in your daughter's lifetime she will be saying, \"I used to have diabetes...before they found the cure.\"",
