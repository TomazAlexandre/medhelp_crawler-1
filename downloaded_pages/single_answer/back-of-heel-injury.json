            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!It is difficult to comment without examining. Assuming you have athlete\u2019s foot, then it is caused by a parasitic fungus that may you may have contacted by wearing an infected person\u2019s shoe wear. It can also come from a fungal infection under your own toe nail or groin area. You can go through this link to understand more about this and its prevention: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlete's_footI think you should discuss this with your doctor and first confirm the diagnosis. It could also be contact dermatitis in reaction to the material of the wheel that hit your heel. It could also be a non healing ulcer if you have diabetes or if you are a smoker.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
