    "question": "Oct 11, 2008 09:11AM in the Interventional Cardiology Expert ForumI had a stress test, blood work, EKg's basically every test. All my test passed. They just wanted to do an Angiogram to see if there were any problems. That is when they found the blockages. My Dr,s were shocked to find them. I had 1 stent put in, and an Angioplasty in the other due to I need a 2 mm stent that is drug eluding, but it is currently not availiab... Since then 11/04 , the stent is now offered. My symptoms have improved, and I feel no pain. Is it wise to still have the stent placed?Repeat AngiogramsOct 10, 2008 02:33PM in the Interventional Cardiology Expert ForumI had a stent and angioplasty 4 months ago. Since then I have pain in in the middle of my back. They would like to do a repeat angiogram. Can this cause scar tissue and or cause any further damage to the heart or vessels? I am 37yrs old with Diabetes of 33 years. No high BP and kidney function is well.",
