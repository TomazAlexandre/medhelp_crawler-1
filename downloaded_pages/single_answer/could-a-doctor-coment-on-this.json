            "answer": "Hello,It looks like nerve compression to me. Other than that, the tingling you feel at the tip of penis can be due to an allergic reaction (say to body lotions, condoms, soaps etc) or it can be a skin condition like eczema, dermatitis etc or it can be a fungal infection. Other than that it can be due to diabetes, a simple bacterial infection or balanitis. ). If all these are ruled out then a peripheral artery disease (by dopplar ultrasound) and a peripheral nerve disease will have to be looked into.I suggest you to abstain from intercourse and masturbation for some days and if the symptoms persist then please get it evaluated from a urologist.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "While i was masturbating and ejaculating suddenly i felt a pain after i pull my penis a little too far to the right. that was a day a go and since then i have been feeling a sourness to my penis. Did i strain or fractured my penis? The pain was not excruciating at the time, but there was some pain. Now some times i feel like a tingling on the head of the penis. I also feel some numbness, as if it is falling a sleep. Will a strain heal on its own, or is it a minor fracture. will a minor trauma heal on its own?",
