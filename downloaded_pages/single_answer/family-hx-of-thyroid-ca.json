            "answer": "Yes, you should go to an endo who specializes in thyroid, not diabetes, as many of them do. Call the endo's office and ask the staff how many thyroid patients the endo treats.Your nodules aren't very big. Once you get above a few centimeters, then worry. I don't know if they can biopsy nodules that small. I think once they get below 8 mm, it gets tricky. I have four nodules about your size. They were much bigger before I was diagnosed with Hashi and got proper thyroid hormone medication.I highly suggest you request the following antibody tests to determine if Hashimoto's is causing these nodules: TGab and TPOab.Next, get the TSH, FT3 and FT4 blood tests to determine your current thyroid levels.About 30 percent of thyroid cancer patients have Hashimoto's. The reason, I believe, that number is so high, is because doctors do not diagnose and treat Hashimoto's and the nodules grow out of control and become malignant. Hashimoto's can be hereditary. Hashi and thyroid cancer run on both sides of my family.Do you have any hypo/Hashi symptoms? Tired, wired, constipated, diarrhea, dry skin, eyes, nails, anxiety, depression, brain fog, heart palps, ear pain/throbbing, GERD, Heartburn, lower leg weakness, rashes, etc...Take care....:) Tamra",

    "question": "Let me just start off by saying that thyroid cancer runs in my family. It was discovered during a exam that I have nodules on my thyroid so I went for an US after waiting a month to get in. The results came back:FINDINGS: Right lobe measures 5.0 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm. Left lobe measures 5.4 x 2.0 x 1.4 cm. the isthmus measures 3 mm. The thyroid exchotexture is mildly heterogeneous. Two adjacent hypoechogenicities are found in teh right midpole, each measuring 3 x 2 x 1 and 3 x 1 x 3 mm. Two cysts are found in the left lobe: 4mm in the midpole and 2mm in the lower pole.I don't know what to make of this. What does all of this mean for me in terms of next steps to be taken and is there even more cause for concern of cancer? I have requested from my primary care doctor a referral to see an Endocrinologist.",
