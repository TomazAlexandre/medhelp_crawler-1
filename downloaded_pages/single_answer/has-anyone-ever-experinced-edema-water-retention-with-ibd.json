    "question": "I've recently been diagnosed with nonspecific colitis throughout most of my colon and also a diagnosis of chronic erosive gastritis. I've been carrying around about 20-30 pounds of generalized pitting edema for several years and screened extensively for usual causes like heart, liver, kidney diseases and protein deficiency, as well as thyroid, diabetes, etc but everything turns up normal.My docs are completely stumped and it's beginning to freak me out that no cause is found. Anyone ever hear of fluid retention with IBD/colitis or crohn's disease?I'm not taking any meds at the moment, either",
