    "question": "I am a 37 yr old female with a problem that I can not understand or make my husband understand.. I started having sex at the age of 17 with my husband.He was the first for me and only person I have ever had sex with. My problem is that I have never had any interest in sex. I could go without it for the rest of my life and it would have no negative effect on me but my husband feels differently of course. I only have one memory of ever feeling the least bit \"horny\" and I was pregnant. It only happened once in the whole 9 months. I do have diabetes, although I can't imagine what that would have to do with it, but feel it may be of some pertinence. I have tried all kinds of things to help,(toys, creams, gels, pills, porn. etc.. ) nothing is working.. If there is something that I am missing please tell me.. Thank you for any help that you may be able to give me.",
