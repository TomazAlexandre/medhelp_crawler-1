            "answer": "Hi,Those blood sugar levels are quite high and truly can cause harm(and possible death) if you do not have some kind of medical treatment in the near future. The public health clinics can often offer treatment at much reduced costs compared to standard hospitals etc. Many cities have free clinics as well where medical students can see you under supervision. There are some inexpensive medications that can be used for diabetes, including insulin which can be bought in any drug store as generics. Please try to seek out one of the mentioned clinics in your area so that you can get started on treatment soon.Take care.",
