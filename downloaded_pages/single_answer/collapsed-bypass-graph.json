            "answer": "I've just experienced the same situation as your husband, except all three graphs failed, which was the mammary artery and two veins.\u00a0\u00a0I had the surgery two years ago, and there is no chance of opening the bypass vessels.\u00a0\u00a0I was told before the bypass procedure that I wasn't a good candidate due to the structure of my native arteries and other factors, but I elected to give it a shot.It appears your husband's EF is dropping, and that is troublesome, I'm sure.\u00a0\u00a045% is still pretty good, but given the change it would worry me, too.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure you know about the need to adopt a heart-healthy diet of low saturated fat, weight should be within BMI guidelines, diabetes should be controlled and above all exercise is vital.My situation is pretty dire with a EF below 20%, it dropped from 42% at the time of the procedure,\u00a0\u00a0but had a recent angiogram that successfully stented my native arteries, and I'm going through heart rehab.\u00a0\u00a0I can be more specific if you wish to email my using the 'message' feature of this board as to the procedure that was employed to open them, it succeeded when two previous procedures failed. I have reasons not to make my ideas public.\u00a0\u00a0Again, hope to hear from you.",

    "question": "My husband had quadruple bypass one year ago. Recent pain prompted another heart cath, which showed one of graphs had collapsed (SVG) that connected at branch of OM. Also, long blockage in LCA AD had increased from 50% last year to 60% this time. Left ventricle pressure is 139. Ejection fraction is 45%. It was 65% and pressure was 115 last year during heart cath that resulted in need for quad bypass surgery. Other graphs that are still in place are the radial going around a 90% blockage in RCA (that blockage now at 100%); a Lima graph connecting at lower part of AD; and another SVG along the PD. What are some of next step options? He is 53 years old",
