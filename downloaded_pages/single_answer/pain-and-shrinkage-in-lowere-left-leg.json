We know about pain and can relate!Have you consulted a physician in the past three years? Do you have diabetes? Have you been diagnosed with PAD (Peripheral Vascular Disease)? Those are two possible causes for pain and diminished circulation.I would suggest that you consult your PCP.... and so do soon. He/She can then make an initial diagnoses and refer you to the proper Specialist. I hope you'll keep in touch and let us know how you are doing.Best of Luck and Take Care,~Tuck",
