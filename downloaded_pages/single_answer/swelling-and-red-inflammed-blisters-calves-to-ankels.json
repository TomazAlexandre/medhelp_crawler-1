            "answer": "The most common rash in the locations you describe is called stasis dermatitis, a kind of eczema related to circulation.\u00a0\u00a0Topical cortisone creams work best.\u00a0\u00a0However, you also mention water blisters.\u00a0\u00a0This raises the possibility of infection. If your doctors haven't already done so, they might consider taking a bacterial culture and prescribing antibiotics against staph germs.Either or both of these problems are not related to diabetes necessarily.\u00a0\u00a0They are quite treatable.\u00a0\u00a0I'd look to rule out infection right away though, unless that's already been done.Best.Dr. Rockoff",
