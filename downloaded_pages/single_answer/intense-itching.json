            "answer": "Hi there,The few common causes of itchy sores all over body are allergies,dermatitis,urticaria or hives,scabies,pityriasis rosea. Itching all over the body can be found in allergies, viral infection, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods.You\u00a0\u00a0may take an antihistamine like Benadryl for relief in symptoms. Application of calamine lotion may provide a soothing effect.For mild-moderate symptoms a weak steroid may be used, whilst more severe cases require a higher-potency steroid. This is merely an advice and not a substitute for clinical examination. Consult an experienced dermatologist. Keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",

    "question": "My whole body itches. At first it started on my inner thighs. I would get these itchy round bruises...Then my lower abs and my growing area started itching. Wasn't getting any rashes or anything like that. Beside the bruises on my inner thighs. Now I have these little red bumpson my penis that itch like crazy.\u00a0\u00a0At times it seems like the skin on my penis is dried out. Maybe from all the scratching?. But now its my whole body that itches. Only place that doesn't itch is my face. Does anyone have any idea? Thanks for your time.\u00a0\u00a0Oh yea I have this cream called Triamcinolone Acetonide But not sure if its safe for Me to use it.",
