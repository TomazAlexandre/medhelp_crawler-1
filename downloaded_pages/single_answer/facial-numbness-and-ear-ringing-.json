            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Fluid in the mastoid air cells and ringing could indicate problems in the middle ear. This is more so as there is ear fullness. An ENT examination will help confirm this. The Numbness may be due to TIA. For TIA therapy is focused on improving the blood flow and controlling any risk factors like diabetes and hypertension.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "8 weeks ago I suddenly developed ringing in my right ear with facial numbness in right cheek, around ear, neck and top of shoulder. Even my head has a strange sensation. My hearing is very sensitive and my ear feels full. I've seen a neurologist, I had right side weakness in arm and leg.\u00a0\u00a0he ordered MRI, CT scan, mra, blood tests, sent me to a cardiologist for tests, ENT also. Everything came back ok except for blood test showed high BUN and protein C. And scans show fluid in a mastoid air cell. Doctor says its ok though. He keeps saying TIA but the symptoms haven't gone away and all he's really doing is having me take a baby aspirin daily. I can't stand the ringing and numbness. Anyone else experience this? Ideas? Thank you!",
