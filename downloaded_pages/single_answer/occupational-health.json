There are a lot of factors to consider in evaluating the risk such as your medical history, the cell line used,\u00a0\u00a0age, gender, race, family history or presence of other underlying conditions such as diabetes. You may benefit from direct evaluation by your doctor as well as\u00a0\u00a0diagnostic tests to help with the evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am a researcher currently working on pancreatic cancer. While I was injecting a mouse with a suspension of pancreatic cancer cell line(originating from mice), I accidentally injured my abdomen (subcutaneous tissue) with the needle. The mice we use are sterile, but will by any chance i may be at risk? can those cancer cells drived from mice grow into humans? If the cell line was from humans, would it be a risk? Should i do anything? I am otherwise healthy.",
