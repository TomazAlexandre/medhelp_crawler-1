            "answer": "A LBBB is an electrical problem with the never bundle on the left side of your heart. Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a cardiac conduction abnormality seen on the EKG.\u00a0\u00a0In this condition, activation of the left ventricle is delayed, which results in the left ventricle contracting later than the right ventricle. Left bundle branch block can mask the ECG signature of acute or chronic myocardial ischemia or infarction. But LBBB can also produce ECG abnormalities that simulate acute myocardial ischemia, such as ST-segment elevations and loss of R-wave progression.Presence of LBBB needs a work up to rule out underlying heart disease. An echocardiography is one of the tests, which you must undergo. It will reveal any weakness of the heart muscle. A 24 hours ECG monitoring (Holter monitoring) to look for any intermittent abnormality of heart beat like a very slow rate or fast rate is also a relevant test. Based upon this evaluation, more detailed tests, if necessary can be done.There is no particular medicine to treat LBBB. The treatment is directed against any underlying problem. If everything turns out as normal then only an annual ECG is advised.Good luck with you knee surgery, I had mine last Tuesday, glad it's done. I can already feel the difference.I hope this helps.Jon",

    "question": "I recently had an ECG as part of a pre-admission test for a total knee replacement. My family doctor called me two days after the ECG and said he couldn't clear me for the procedure until I saw a cardiologist. He said this last ECG showed a difference from from previous one (several years ago) and that I have a Left Branch Bundle Block. He explained, generally, what that means but it left me very concerned. I didn't help myself by going on line and reading several definitions of LBBB. Does this mean that I have some type of hart disease? I am a 54yo male, overweight (255 lbs) with hypertension (controlled with Hyzaar) and Type 2 Diabetes (glucose pretty well controlled).",
