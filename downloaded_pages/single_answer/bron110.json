            "answer": "Glucose [blood sugar] have three distinct test measurements units - mg/dl, mmol/l [Europe], and A1c in percentage [%]. If your \"22\" is the result of an mmol/l measurement it is extremely high and out of control. If it is an A1c result it is extremely high and out of control. Google 'side effects diabetes type 2' and educate yourself on diabetes. You need to have a serious discussion with your doctor on how to control and manage your diabetes or you will experience one or more of those side effects. Do not rely on medication alone, read other post on this forum for lifestyle suggestions - what to eat, what not to eat, etc - and start lowering your glucose [blood sugar] level today. Good luck",
