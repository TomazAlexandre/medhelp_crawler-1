    "question": "Im 23 years old and have always been a daddys girl. My dad found out he had small cell lung cancer that had spread to his bones and spine. He started chemo right away, after his first round of chemo, it shrunk but he had complications from the chemo, his white blood cell count was way down he got diabetes from the tumor and his sugar levels were 500 plus so they put him in the hospital. He got every side effect that you could get from chemo plus the rare ones that 1 out of probably a million would get. He was dying, but they found out that he had 2 infections in his blood. They treated him very fast and\u00a0\u00a0it worked. He was in the hospital for a month then nursing home for transitional care for a week. This entire time I stayed with him every night, i slept in the hospital room, i slept in the nursing room. Then I took him home, and moved in with him. I gave him his meds, i cooked his meals, I help him get out of the shower, i helped him get up from his chair, then his doctor started him on chemo again but they said it wasnt as strong and it wouldnt effect him like the last round did, from that point on things went down hill, he got really weak again, he wasnt eating again, he was getting all the same side effects as the last time. So then they found out that his white blood cell was down again so he had to go in to the hospital to get a blood transfusion, this was on a thursday, well they checked him into the hospital, the next day i was making a decision to put him on breathing machines or not, i didnt. So they didnt do anything for him but give him pain meds and make him comfortable, that friday he went into a coma and past away the following tuesday. Nov 20th 2007. It was 3 months. I know most people on here are asking about medical problems, but now I am lost, I know there are stages of grief, i am well educated on it. It has only been 3 months, but the though of the cancer and all the effects it had on him are taking over my mind. The bad thoughts. The bad memories. What I'm getting at is I really think I need counseling. I am living in the duluth mn/ superior wisconsin area and so not have insurance. Does anybody know where I could go to get help?",
