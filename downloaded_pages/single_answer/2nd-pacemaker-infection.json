            "answer": "Hello. There are several risk factors for a device pocket infection like diabetes mellitus, advanced patient age, hematoma at the time of insertion, chronic immunosuppression, heart failure or renal dysfunction. In a patient with recurrent pocket infection I would probably try to rule out an allergy to one of the materials of the device. The materials differ between brands and models but some of the components include polyurethane, silastic, titanium, polychloroparaxylene (parylene), and nickel. There are case reports in the literature of device allergy where they studied the patient with specific allergy tests for the materials of the devices used. In one case they implanted a custom made device completely coated with silicone to avoid exposure of parylene, which was the component associated to the allergy and inflammation. About the implant site, pacemakers are sometimes implanted in the upper abdomen when both subclavians are not an option.Good luck.",
