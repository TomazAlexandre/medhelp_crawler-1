    "question": "A little bit of background first: I'm 30 and over-weight. (5'6 275 lbs. Size 24) The weight first started with pregancy, 3 of them in 4 years. It stayed at 220 for 5 years and then started to increase again. From 2001 to Now I have steadily gained the last 55 lbs.Up until very recently I have been lucky enough to evade the normal problems that coincide with obesity. i.e. high blood pressure, diabetes, etc.I have not menstruated now for more than 2 months, (I had a Tubal Ligation after the 3rd child- not pregnant;) and in the last week my feet and ankles have noticably increased in size. I have made a Dr.s appointment, but would like the opinions of others as well.I have never felt that my eating habits were abnormal, but recently I have been checking around about what \"normal\" portion sizes are and am trying to compare them to my own. I have decided that I must be somewhat of an emotional eater, but am wondering what is hapening to my feet and where my period went off to.Any ideas?",
