            "answer": "I too just recently had balanitis 2 weeks ago. As you I have no diabetes and also practice good hygiene. Eventhough things with me cleared really fast, I'm puzzeled as to what might have caused it. I do have a neurological condition and currently have a suprapubic catheter due to a fistuala. My GP thought that it might have been caused by an infection of the supra pubic catheter. I'm 1 month shy of 45 and only have my wife as my partner. I'm at home with her so I know that she is not the cause either.Things would have to get really bad before I would even consider circumcision. Perhaps you need to be on a longer course of antibiotics. One thing that I'm not sure of is the fact that being on antibiotics can cause candida (yeast). This again can cause balanitis.For treatment I was given APO-cephalex 500mg 1tab 4@day for 2 weeks. Taro-Mupirocin 2% to apply to the foreskin glans and penis shaft. I also used Canesten cream on my own to combat possible yeast since I did not get a cause for the balanitis.So far things seem to be OK exept for some minor tightness of the foreskin. Like I said I'll thry anything before sacrificing my foreskin. I like things left the way that I was born.Good luckGod bless,Ron",

    "question": "I have had balinitus twice now within 2 months, i have no other sexual partners, and do not sleep around, the first time i had a bad swelling just under the bell end, i thought it was an enlarged vein, Doctor said was a lymph gland, i took Flucnazole and with cream it cleared up, 4 weeks later it kicks of again, and i also now have a swelling type lump where my penis exits my body.the full length of my penis is swollen, itchy at the end. Tests on urine ok, no protein, or blood, diabetes tests are fine, I have to go to a speacialist now, but am concerned as my doctor was not sure whats going on.
