Also, diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy and affect the digestive system, leading to problems with digestion and elimination.\u00a0\u00a0Besides good glycemic control, medications such as cisapride a prokinetic agent are given to promote emptying. Other causes for your symptoms could be infections like amoebiasis and malabsorption. This can be detected by a stool examination.
