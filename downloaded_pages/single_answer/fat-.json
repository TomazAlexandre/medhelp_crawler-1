    "question": "This is probably the most random question but earlier I was eating veggies && dip && on the dip container it said 80 calories and 40 from fat which got me thinking , when your baby starts to accumulate fat does it get its fat from the foods you eat or is it just a natural occurrence ? Such as , I ate something with 40 calories of fat, so do those 40 calories go to the baby && help with the fat layers ? Or is the fat build up just something that happens as the baby grows ?",
