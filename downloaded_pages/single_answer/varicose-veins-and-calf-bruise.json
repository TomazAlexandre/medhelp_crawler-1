            "answer": "Hi!Varicose veins develop in people who have diabetes and persist due to damage to the blood vessel. You need to raise your legs whenever you sit down for long. If you need to walk then you need to wear specially designed compression stockings. Do not stand at one place for a long time. If you need to, then keep moving your legs. Avoid weight gain and eat healthy. Keep a strict check on your diabetes. Please discuss with your diabetologist. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
