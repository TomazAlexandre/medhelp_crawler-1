Zorcor\u00a0\u00a080mg/dayI felt that the dosage of zorcor 80mg was a bit high, I was expecting to start on a small dose and then increase if necessary, I would like to know if the dosage is appropriate and also for my followup (after 6 weeks) he instructed AST, SGOT fasting lipid panel but he has not asked for CPK or my blood picture but the instructions given to me along with the medication clearly states that these tests(cpk,blood) need to be done so are these tests essential or can i skip them\u00a0\u00a0?.... Do i need to have my sr.creatinine tested ?Thank You",
