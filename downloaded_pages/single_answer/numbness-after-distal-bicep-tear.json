            "answer": "Hi!The numbness could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar nerve at the elbow level or even at the wrist. Once a nerve is compressed, it can cause pain or numbness anywhere along its path.\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause numbness of little and ring finger. In your case the possible site of pinched nerve could be the elbow because of distal bicep tear. Please consult a neurologist. Take care!",
