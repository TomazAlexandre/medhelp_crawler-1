    "question": "I visited a\u00a0\u00a0dermatologist a few months ago regarding thick, dark skin under my armpits, neck and in my inner thighs. I am a 22 year old male. I am about 100 lbs overweight and have had issues dealing with darkened skin for as long as I can remember. The dermatologist quickly diagnosed my condition as Acanthosis Nigricans. I have not always been obese but have had this disorder for a very long time (even before being overweight). He suggested that I lose some weight and that the symptoms might improve.\u00a0\u00a0I have a feeling this disorder might be genetic as I have a history of diabetes in my family. I have been tested for diabetes and appear to be diabetes's free at the moment. One of my main continuing concerns however,\u00a0\u00a0is a a very foul smell that comes from my groin area. My dermatologist told me that it was the result of my skin being thicker and rougher in that area which causes exessive bacterial growth which in turn causes a fowl smell. The dermatologist prescribed clindamycin phosphate in the form of a liquid that i could roll on my inner thigh to control the smell. I've used this with no improvement. He also recomended an acne medication? I dont recall the name for it, but said that it might improve my neck and under armpit area but that it would be too strong for my inner thights. I am concerned about the darkening skin but that I can live with. The odor is very offensive and makes me self conscious. Is there anything else I can take to inhibit bacterial growth? I am a college student with no health insurance so trips to the dermatologist don't come often for me. I would appreciate any advice on this matter..please help",
