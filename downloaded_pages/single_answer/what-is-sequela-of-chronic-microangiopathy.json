These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.So, please get your blood pressure checked. You could be suffering from postural hypotension. Pinched nerves in neck and ear problems can also cause dizziness on getting up from bed.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps.
