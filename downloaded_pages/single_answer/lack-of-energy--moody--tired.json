            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms you have could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to low blood pressure or sleep disturbances or disorders. Please consult your PCP and run blood tests to rule out anemia, diabetes and hypothyroidism. Also get your blood pressure checked. If all these are found to be ok, then sleep disorders would need to be looked into.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "For awhile I've noticed that I have low energy, I'm usually tired, regardless of how much sleep I get. Without interruption, I can sleep 12+ hours, easy. But lately I've only been getting about 7. Sometimes during the day I can be doing something, and then all of a sudden I'll be hit with this wave of exhaustion.My memory is pretty bad. I have a hard time caring about things, and I've lost interest in a lot of what I used to do. I have to actively push myself to do things I used to love (although, with some things I still get lost in it like I used too). Sometimes, I really don't feel like I FEEL anything. And the only time I DO is when I'm irritated or annoyed.I have two friends that think this may be an issue, and something I should get checked out.I'm always thinking \"This is how I should feel\" or \"This is what I should want to do.\"But half the time, I don't really feel that way anymore. And sometimes, when I get mad or upset I start crying and I don't know why I do that. I never used to, it just started happening in the past two or three years, maybe.And this could be completely normal, I know I've had someone mention it was, but sometimes when I get up and stretch, I feel instantly dizzy and light-headed, like I should immediately sit back down. I think I've only fallen once, although usually I stumble.And my toes are often cold. Which is also fairly normal, I think.",
