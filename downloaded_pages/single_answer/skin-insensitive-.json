            "answer": "Hi,It is good that leprosy has been ruled out by your doctor. Paresthesia is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or numbness of a person's skin with no apparent long-term physical effect. The manifestation of parasthesia may be transient or chronic. Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.This is often the result of poor circulation in the limbs, which may be caused by atherosclerosis or the build up of plaque on artery walls. Without a proper supply of blood and nutrients, nerve cells can no longer adequately send signals to the brain. This\u00a0\u00a0can also be a symptom of vitamin deficiency and malnutrition, as well as metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism.It would be best to have it evaluated by your neurologist. Completemedicalhistory and phyical and neurological examination must be done to reach a diagnosis. A CT scan is often used as a diagnostic tool. Medications usually depends on the underlying cause.Take care and keep us posted.",
