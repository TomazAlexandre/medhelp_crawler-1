            "answer": "It is good she is active; however, it has to be on a daily basis. It is recommend increasing children's physical activities (play, dance, sports) to lose weight, and not lower calorie intake due to the need of calories for growth which you are doing. For her age she needs approximately 1800 calories per day to grow. Limit time in front of the TV or non-active-video games. There have been studies showing the longer the length of time a child sit in front of the TV, the greater the weight gain. Here are some additional ideas: Limit high sugar drinks/snacks, and try replacing with low fat milk/yogurt, fruit, and air popped popcorn, or low-fat cheese. Additional suggestions: cook only low fat meats (chicken, fish, loin of pork) or non-meat sources (soy products, nuts), low fat vegetarian combinations (rice & beans, pasta & beans, low fat cheese & pasta), fat free or low fat dairy products (skim milk, 1% milk, low fat cheese, low fat yogurts, low fat soy milk/yogurt), use plant oils, non trans-fat margarines, and eat a lot of fruits, salads, and vegetables. Eat daily high fiber breads and cereals (oatmeal) and limit \u2018junk\u2019 foods. Hoped that helped you.",

    "question": "I had gestational diabetes during pregnancy and several months after giving birth I was diagnosed with DM1.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is almost 7 and is 80 lbs and 49\" tall.\u00a0\u00a0She is between the 75-90th percentile for height and over 95 th percentile for weight.\u00a0\u00a0We are very healthy eaters and limit sugar, carbs and calories in our diets.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is active and runs, plays, dances and does other actives each day.\u00a0\u00a0When she gets hungry it comes on quickly and is accompanied by irritability.\u00a0\u00a0I would say she does eat more than other children, and actually finishes her meals, where other children her age barely eat and are forced by their parents to finish their meals. When she gets irritable I've checked her blood glucose levels and I've not actually found them to be low (not below 90).\u00a0\u00a0I have also checked her blood sugar levels randomly during the day(because she wants to do what mom does) and I've had readings up to 120 mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried a morning fasting reading before and she was around 95. She has had a thyroid test (blood drawn) and the results were within normal levels.\u00a0\u00a0Last year I had the doctor check her for diabetes as well and was told they were in normal levels.\u00a0\u00a0I've tracked every calorie she eats for a month straight and generally she eats between 1000-1200 calories a day.\u00a0\u00a0I am at a loss as to why she is over the 95th percentile for weight!\u00a0\u00a0What else should I have the doctor check for?\u00a0\u00a0Or what should I be doing differently for her?\u00a0\u00a0Is this some how related to my gestational/DM1?\u00a0\u00a0Is it metabolim related?Thank you!",
