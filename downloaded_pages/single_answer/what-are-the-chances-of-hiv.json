            "answer": "If you want the doc to answer you should go to the expert forum.\u00a0\u00a0However, there are several experts in here as well - just not Dr's.Anyway - Don't use symptoms to determine if you have HIV.\u00a0\u00a0All of the symptoms you mention and others that may occur as a result of HIV are much more common with other viruses.\u00a0\u00a0If you look at any of the previous posts and answers the doc and experts would suggest that you do need to test simply based on the fact that you had unprotected sex.\u00a0\u00a0The risk is low but you should get tested 13 weeks after Sept 29th and if I do my math correctly that would be December 29th.\u00a0\u00a0However, you are now at the 8-9 week point and according to the Doc's that is 98-99% accurate if you get\u00a0\u00a0a standard blood antibody test.\u00a0\u00a0This may help your anxiety in the short term.Check out this post which was answered to my by Dr. HHH:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/697396.; Again - the odds of infection are very low and the odds of a woman passing it to a man through vaginal sex is low.\u00a0\u00a0This combined means the risk is extremely low but you should still be tested to remove all doubts.BTW - were you ever actually diagnosed by a Dr. with Thrush?",

    "question": "Dear DocI am a diabetic for last 6 years on Oral hypoglycemics fairly well controlled. I had single vaginal penetrative sex with a woman lasting for 5 mins max on 29th sept. The woman said she was clean however had a foul smelling discharge. I developed uretherites (perhaps gonococcal) after about 2 - 3 weeks for which I took single dose Azithromycin (2gms).The symptoms of uretherites subsided in next 4 - 5 days. I also noticed some ulcers on my penis (red patches)\u00a0\u00a0which flared over next 2 weeks and have almost disappered\u00a0\u00a0now by applying some antifungal cream as well as two applications of acyclovir cream. I also suffered from oral thrush, mild fever associated with headache and body pains. I am wondering did I have herpes too?\u00a0\u00a0or if my symptoms are due to Acute HIV infection. also weather the rash on my penis is due to fungal infection or herpes?? or could this be due to diabetes??\u00a0\u00a0Do I need to get tested for HIV. Kindly advice.",
