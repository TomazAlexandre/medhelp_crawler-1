    "question": "My daughter is 7yrs old and was diagnosed with Juvenile diabetes at 18months. She started the Insulin Pump but struggled to keep her A1c down so we put her back on Lantus. She had been put on to high of a dose so we had alot of lows like 50 or lower and she was vomiting so anything she ate or drank she threw back up. 2:30 am I took her to E.R and doctor refused to treat and monitor her so I requested angrily he sign us out so I could take her to another local hospital. Once released I took her to another hospital where they treated her with IV ran blood work and urine and kept us overnight. 3 weeks later I recieve a phone call from Child Protective Services stating the hospital that refused to help my daughter had mamde a complaint to CPS about how distraught I was and that they feared for my little girl's wefare. there is alot more to this story but would like some input.ThanksJ Albee",
