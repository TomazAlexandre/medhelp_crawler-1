    "question": "Earlier this week after going for a short walk I started getting an extremely sharp stabbing pain in my upper abdomen. It would at times radiate to my back. Since then I have gotten this pain off and on (about 3 days or so) lasting about about 20 seconds or so. I haven't experienced any spotting or bleeding. Blood pressure was good. I actually started experiencing nausea and vomiting this evening. Don't know if it is related of not to the pain. Note, I do have gestational diabetes. I have a doc appointment tomorrow so I will talk to her about it then. But what do you think? Anyone else experience this?",
