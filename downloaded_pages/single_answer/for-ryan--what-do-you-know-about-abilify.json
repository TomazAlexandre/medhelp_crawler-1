    "question": "Hey Ryan,My psychiatrist wants me to take Abilify. I am a little unsure about this drug. I know it has been around for about 10 years. It can cause muscle twiching / stiffness (which could be permanent) possibly diabetes. He wants me to start with 2mg then go to 5mg. I tried the 2mg once. I didn't seem to have any problems. I was a little skiddish about taking it and only took it once.You seem to have a lot of knowleged about medications. What have you read about Abilify? Do I need to be so cautious? I am sure my anxiety is playing a part in this but I can't stop questioning it. I just don't want to be one of the unlucky ones who ends up with diabetes or permanent muscle twiching. I know this all sounds silly but your insight is much appreciated.Thank you,Mary",
