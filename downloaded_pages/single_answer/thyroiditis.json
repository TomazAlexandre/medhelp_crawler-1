    "question": "A year ago I awoke up one morning and my face felt weird. I went to the mirror and found both eyes swollen almost shut and my upper lip swollen 3 times normal .I also was severily broken out with hives all over my body. Saw my endo doctor, and he was convinced It was an allergic reaction of some short and sent me home with a steroid pack to take and keep the hives undercontrol. However, this Doctor an Endocrinologist and prepared me for the influxf of higher bloodsugar levels due to now taken the streriod and beginnin type 1 insulin dependant deabetic. Already being a type 1 diabetic adding steriods has risen my boold sugars quit a bit.Now my endocrinologist has not gotten the hives and facial swelling under controll, and ever though all other doctors just rub their heads, this happens around the same time of the month from 1 week to two days before by menses. I found an allergerist and hid first thouhgt of what this is is thyroiditis. He began me on doxepin and steriods and zantac and his way has helped, but over the past 7 mths I have gained 30 lbs. Long talk with dr, and he took me off doxepin and placed me on hydroxizine and we are still testing this out.My main question is my endroconlogist does not believe that having high thyroid antibodies indicates much and escecially thyroiditis. I am puzzled, my endocrin doctor had been my physican more 11 years and has always keept me in line health. Now the allergist conflicts him and I feel caught in the middle.My endo dr. changed my synthroid to armour thyroid 2=10 150, because he believed I was getting too much thyroid meds. My alllergist changed my meds from doxepin to hydroxizine.Now my\u00a0\u00a0blood work from allergist Peroxidase now 1046, was 622\u00a0\u00a0 Antithyroglobulin now 85, was 53. In speaking with endrocrin doctor says my thyroid range is now normal, but I do not have any numbers to give here, other than it was just under the normal range last month.Can you confirm or deni between the two doctors. I also, have TYPE 1 Diabetes (well controlled) using Insulin Pump, Pernicious Anemia 1CC injection a month, Armour Thyroid 150, Zantac 300mg twice a day,\u00a0\u00a0Hydroxizine75 mg. Hydrocodone 10/325 as needed for back pain (I take 3-4 a day), Ambien CR If I do not take something to sleep, then I don't at all. Do have some memory blanks if I do not take this right as I go to bed.Still have muscle, bone and joint pain, severe nausea, headaches.Any suggestions of where to go next would be invailable as I am in the process of seeking a third doctor and look for a thrid opinion.What are you opinons with information given.Currently with all this,",
