            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine your husband obtain a history and view his imaging, I can not tell you what the exact cause or implications of the imaging findings are. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.The MRI report states that there is a very small area of increased signal on the left part of the brain. In general, areas of increased signal have many many causes including but not limited to a small normal but calcified vessel, diseased small blood vessels of the brain (due to hypertension, smoking, cholesterol, diabetes), migraine, MS, vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) and others. However, one single small area is unlikely to be of any consequence or significance. The findings on imaging always have to be correlated with the clinical picture (why the MRI was done in the first place, the patient's history, the physical examination), but if there really is just one tiny area of increased signal, often in such cases, no further testing or imaging is necessary. If the patient has increased risk factors for vascular disease (hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking etc) interventions to improve/minimize these risk factors are indicated.Based on the report you provide above, the findings do not appear to be alarming or of great concern, but again I can not comment definitively without being able to examine your husband and obtain a history. It sounds like you are on the right track with plans for evaluation by a neurologist.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "My husband (40 yrs old) had an abnormal mri done, and we are freaking out we dont have an appt with the neurologist until march 9th the primary doc said nothing just told us to go to the neuro. My husband took the results to his chiropractor and he said they are just going to want to rule things out. I started looking up some of the stuff and now I am really scared!!! this is what it says:Impression:\u00a0\u00a0solitary tiny focus of hyperintense signal in the left frontoparietal white matter tracts compatible with either chronic small vessel white matter ischemic disease, gliosis, or demyelinization process. further corelation clinically is suggested.We are so scared please help.",
