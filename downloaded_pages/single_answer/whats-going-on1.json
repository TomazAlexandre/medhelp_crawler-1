            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!If there is pain in right shoulder, it means that the right diaphragm is being irritated. Burning in upper stomach usually due to acidity, GERD or reflux disease or hiatal hernia can all cause right diaphragm irritation. Heavy meals or acidity that cause distension of the duodenum or any cause for distension of the small intestine can cause referred pain/burning to shoulder. In your case it could be acidity. Generally diaphragmatic irritation can lead to frequent hiccups or even burps. Liver and gall bladder problems too can irritate the right diaphragm. An abdominal CT is required. Please consult a gastroenterologist regarding this. There is a possibility that you have GERD with IBS or Celiac disease or Crohn\u2019s.Also painful intercourse can be due to emotional factors. If that is not the case then PID or pelvic inflammatory disease, cysts in ovary (as you probably have), uterine fibroid and endometriosis too should be ruled out. Consult your gynecologist regarding this.Also in the presence of all the symptoms you mentioned, it would be wise to rule out thyroid problems and diabetes.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
