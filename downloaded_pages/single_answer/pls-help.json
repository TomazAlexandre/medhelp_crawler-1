            "answer": "Hi.Prednisolone can indeed cause symptoms of fasciculations and tremors, especially if taken regularly for a long period of time.I haven't come across any literature that would suggest an association between prednisolone and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.While your symptoms may be present in cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, it would be premature to say that you are definitely afflicted with this condition. ALS is uncommon before the age of 40 and usually affects males more than females. It seems unlikely that you have this condition.Aside from a drug adverse reaction, other conditions that could possibly present with those symptoms include vitamin and mineral deficiencies, diabetes, and other endocrine disorders.Some tests that could be done to determine if ALS may be present or not include electromyography (EMG) or muscle biopsy.You should talk to your doctor about all these to help in relieving your worries and depression.Good luck.",
