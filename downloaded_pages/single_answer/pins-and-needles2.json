            "answer": "Hi.Pins and needles (tingling) sensation is typical of a peripheral neuropathy. Here, he nerve is irritated and gives rise to the paresthesia. Neuropathy can be caused by diabetes, injury to the nerve itself, compression of the nerve or the nerve root at the spine, vitamin deficiency, demyelination etc. I didn't want to confuse you, but I did!If you have these symptoms coming on recently, I would suggest you do the routine blood work for hemoglobin, blood sugar and vitamin B12. And you should also visit your physician for this. If necessary, he may refer you to a Neurologist.Regards",
