            "answer": "Hi, the most probable cause for the odd sensation could be neuropathy, a disorder of the nerves. Diabetes Mellitus can cause neuropathy. Other causes like vitamin deficiencies, alcohol consumption and certain medications can cause neuropathy. It could also be due to hypoglycemia, heart problems, fever, stress, low blood pressure and anxiety. Please consult your primary care physician who will do an initial clinical assessment and then may refer you to a neurologist. Investigations like blood tests and MRI will help to arrive at a diagnosis for appropriate therapy. Regards.",
