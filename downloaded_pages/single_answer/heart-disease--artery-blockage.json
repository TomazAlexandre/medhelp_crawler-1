            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.As I gather the valve was repaired, but the problems have recurred, so now the condition needs a valve replacement. Management of multivessel disease is usually CABG or coronary artery bypass grafting. So, I gather the\u00a0\u00a0valve replacement and the CABG surgery are planned together. Prognosis will depend on the viable myocardium and co morbid conditions like diabetes and also the ejection fraction, which\u00a0\u00a0is a useful measure of left ventricular performance. The normal range is 63-77% for males and 55-75% for females. Please discuss all the probabilities with your doctor prior to surgery.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
