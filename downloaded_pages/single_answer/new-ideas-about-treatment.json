    "question": "Hello everybody, I think that other medical problems and family history (genetic predisposition) have significant influence on how our treatment will affect us.Looks like those who have history of Type 2 Diabetes in a family have higher risk of developing this as a side effect or psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and more significant abdominal pain if you were diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome prior treatment, etc.Basically during immune stimulating with peg+riba all chronic or inherited diseases can exacerbate during treatment.So, my suggestions is that it is really matter add our PMH (past medical history ) and family history\u00a0\u00a0when we describing our conditions.What do you think? Should we think about other co morbid conditions prior treatment and expected side effects and be ready for that? Should we be on low sugar diet prior treatmnet if high risk diabetes?I am very new here and I will update you about my side effects as I am going through treatment. May be it would be helpful to someone with similar medical and inherited problems during treatment\u00a0\u00a0to predict what is going to happened to them + all other individual sides.I will be happy to hear any opinion, even critics.Kisses, Nency",
