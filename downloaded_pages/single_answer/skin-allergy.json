            "answer": "Hello,The swelling of skin which you are having even on touching is due to a phenomenon called dermographism. The exact mechanism of dermographism remains uncertain. Trauma may release an antigen that interacts with the membrane-bound immunoglobulin E of mast cells, which release inflammatory mediators, particularly histamine, into the tissues. This causes small blood vessels to leak, allowing fluid to accumulate in the skin.The itching of skin may be due to hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods. It can be treated by antihistamines or cromoglicate and sometimes steroids, as they prevent the histamine from causing the reaction. As the underlying cause of dermographism is not known, it can last for many years without relief.I think that you should consult an allergist and get yourself evaluated for this.Hope it helps .Take care and pls do keep us posted in case you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
