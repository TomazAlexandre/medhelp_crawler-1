            "answer": "HiYou may need to change your soap or body wash to more organic or hypoallergenic ones. I would recommend Aveeno or Cetaphil when moisturizing or washing the body. These cleansers are mild and bland. Avoid scented and colored body wash as these may contain more abrasive ingredients. You may also need to have a complete work up done here. I suggest that a consult with your internist may also help you. Blood sugar levels may need to be determined. A complete blood count may also help ascertain if an infection is present or not.Recurrent fungal infections may suggest that an underlying disease process may be present(eg Diabetes and allergies).If this is he case, the condition has to be addressed first. Antifungals and topical corticosteroids given during flare ups are needed to control the skin condition.",

    "question": "Hi , I have itching in my body since i had an allergy episode to some food in tins I bought in a delicatessen one year ago. I was taking antistamine for several months but the itching still coming and going all the time since i stopped taking it. The itching is in all the body and if I scratch the skin a red mark will be there for weeks until the skin regenerate.3 months ago I had some kind of skin infection on my pennies, was itching a lot and the skin in the foreskin started to break ..... the look was like the skin was cut in various areas and was very painful.... on the top of that the skin in my penis was changing and regenerating it self.... a bacterial test in the GU clinic came\u00a0\u00a0positive in staphylococcus and Candida. I was prescribed Canesten cream and Erythroped tablets for a week.... the problem disappeared for a while but after 3 months all started over again this time even worse.....My skin i general have been very sensitive lately including the itching i described before, the doctors don\u2019t know what is causing me this episodes of staphylococcus and Candida and I have the impression that the problem could be other ...like an allergy to something I use or eat and is damaging and debilitating my skin.What do you think could be? and what action you recommend me to take?",
