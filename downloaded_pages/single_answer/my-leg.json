            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The various causes of cold leg are atherosclerosis, deep vein thrombosis, Leriche syndrome (block in abdominal aorta and/or main leg artery), limb ischaemia (low oxygen to limbs), sciatica, spondylitis of lower vertebrae and peripheral vascular disease (arteries of limbs are involved). A color Doppler test will rule out the possibility of involvement of an artery or vein and its blockage by a clot. MRI of llower spine may be required. Paresthesias or abnormal sensations of cold in this case can also be due to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme's or lupus should also be ruled out.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
