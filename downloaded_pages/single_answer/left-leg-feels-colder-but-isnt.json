            "answer": "Hi!The feeling that one leg is colder can be due to paresthesia (nervous cause of an abnormal sensation) or a pinched nerve. Paresthesia is caused by diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s lupus, vitamin B 12 deficiencies etc. Pinched nerves can also cause similar symptoms. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "My left leg feels colder, but when I touch my legs, they feel about the same temperature to me (both cold due to the AC). I also have pain in my left leg, mainly my anterior thigh and buttock right now (presumably due to sciatica or piriformis). Can pain cause heightened sensations? i.e. Does my left leg feel colder because it is in pain?",
