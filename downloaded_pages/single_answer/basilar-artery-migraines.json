            "answer": "Hi!Yes there are! There are three preventative supplements that have all been proven effective in clinical trials! But... I don't know how they work with diabetes and so it could be dangerous for you to start them without first checking with your doctor or diabetes specialist. I will look into it for you as well and get back to you if I find anything out.The three supplements are:Magnesium citrate (other forms of Magnesium are good too) @ 400mg a dayB2 @ 400 mg a dayCoQ10 @ 300 mg a dayI think, off the top of my head, the Vitamin B2 is the one that is the safest to take as far as other health conditions and other medications go. I believe that it does not have any other interactions with other medications and health conditions. But, you should ask your pharmacist or doctor to make sure before you start.I know for a fact that both the Magnesium and CoQ10 are very dangerous to take with some medical conditions and with some medications but I just forget which ones off the top of my head. So, please don't start taking either of these without asking your diabetes doctor first.Thanks! :)",

    "question": "I have been getting migraines since 1989. I was diagnosed as having basilar artery migraines in 1990 by a Neuro in Charlotsville, Va.. I was on imitrex for over 5 years but now cannot take it due to a heart condition it started. I take Zoomig nasal spray but that does not work all the time. My neurologist just retired for medical reasons and i had to find a new neuro. My old neuro has me on all kinds of preventive meds for migraines that i have been on for years and they do not seem to be working at all, cause i get a migraine once a week and it usually lasts about 3 to 4 days. I normally get an aura before the pain really hits, then after that i become sensitive to light and sound and i vomitt and pass out. I am a diabetic and every time i get a migraine my blood sugar goes up between 400 to 500. Right now i am waiting to get in to see a pain managment doc. Due to the fact that the new neuro i am seeing does not like to prescribe narcotics. My last neuro has had me on demerol shots, percocets. stadoly, and dilaudids. He would switch me around with these ever few months. I give myself touradol shots and phenegren shots for the nausea now. But since i have no narcotics to knock out the pain i have been taking excedrine migraine daily, i go through a bottle of this every 2 days. I know this is not good for my stomach but i try to knock out the pain. I also am at the er about every other week. I have even tried the botox injections with no luck. Is there any alternative meds out there for migraine pain? I take amitriptyline nightly, verapamil daily, besides a pill for my stomach, it is a generic for aciphex. But i am very interested in any new meds for migraine pain or preventive meds. Thanks so much...joyw540",
