            "answer": "Did the Vet say anything else about his other organs? The reason why I'm asking is because excessive thirst is a sign of diabetes. My dog was just diagnosed 10 days ago and has been on phenobarbital for 2 years. He started acting delusional sometimes but not for very long then he would be back to his old self. He was eating and drinking a lot so when I took him to the vet they did blood work for diabetes and he indeed had it. His sugar level was 511. I don't want to scare anyone, I just wished I would have gotten my vet to do a complete blood test because more than likely he doesn't need the phenobarbital. Sorry I didn't answer your question about the herbal remedy..",

    "question": "My dog Otis has been on phenobarbital for 7yrs now. He has always been thirsty but has no other side effects. He recently had his liver levels checked and now after 7 yrs are showing liver damage. The vet wants me to ween him off of the phenobarbital. I was wondering what kinds of herbal remedy can you give your dog?\u00a0\u00a0And does it keep your dog from having seizures? All I know is Otis only has a seizure now if he manages to spit out a pill. The phenobarbital has worked great for the last 7 yrs and I am worried with out it all he will do is sieze.",
