Indeed your problem could be explained by prostatitis and its consequences. Prostatitis requires long term treatment\u00a0\u00a0and often several courses are needed to completely eradicate the problem. In diabetics it even takes longer. However the pain along the leg is concerning. Patients with prostatitis do complain of pain around the perineum and medial aspect of the thigh. If your pain is along the back of the thigh with radiation\u00a0\u00a0to the calf and the foot, it must be evaluated to exclude a pinched nerve. However if you get this symptom only when you get the perineal pain it is probably related to prostatitis. Sometimes prostatic massage and examination of the prostatic secretion help in conclusively proving whether one has prostatitis or not. Even in the absence of\u00a0\u00a0infection one can get prostate pain -- prostatodynia. Overall\u00a0\u00a0prostatitis is a recurring problem, and one may have to take several courses of antibiotics. <<Just thought I would update you on my progress.\u00a0\u00a0SInce I posted this, the perineal pain has subsided greatly, with only brief episodes of slight pain with no radiation to the calf and foot.\u00a0\u00a0It appears as if my bout of prostatis is\u00a0\u00a0almost completely (knock on wood) resolved--six months later!Thanks for your response, and take care,David",
