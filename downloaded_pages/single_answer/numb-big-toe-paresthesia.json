            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You must seriously consider gout. This is due to high uric acid in the body that gets accumulated in the joints. Gout usually attacks the big toe (approximately 75 percent of first attacks). If all infection and injury are ruled out, and rheumatoid factor is normal, then isolated sore toe is considered to be due to gout even in presence of normal uric acid levels. The only confirmed diagnosis is finding the presence of uric acid crystals in the joint fluid. Most doctors do not resort to this and start treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs). Usually patients respond to it. Another medication, colchicine, is very effective in gout.Another possibility is Chondrocalcinosis which is similar to gout but caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate rather than uric acid. The third possibility is rheumatoid arthritis. This can be diagnosed by positive RF and ANA.Numbness can be due to pinched nerve, poor circulation, faulty foot wear, diabetic neuropathy, leprosy, nerve injury, multiple sclerosis and frost bite. This needs to be investigated before a final cause can be pin pointed.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
