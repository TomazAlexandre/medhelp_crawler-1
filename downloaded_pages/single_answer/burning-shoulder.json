            "answer": "Hello,The first possibility that needs to be evaluated is brachial neuritis. A brachial plexus injury occurs when the nerves that connect your arm and spinal cord get stretched or torn.This can cause pain and numbness.The other possibilities are of nerve entrapment,vit B12 deficiency and diabetes.Get your blood sugar evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.Also get a MRI of the shoulder and nerve conduction studies done to confirm the diagnosis.Pls consult a neurologist for that.I hope that helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.Kind regards.",

    "question": "I recently broke my neck but it did not require surgery. It has healed fine. Now I have a burning of the skin below my neck, between my shoulder blades. It hurts to touch the skin with my hand or lean back in a chair. There is some tingling but no numbness. I have been thinking about going to a chiropractor.What could cause this and would I benefit from going to a chiropractor?Thanks",
