            "answer": "I have no idea if your discharge is related to a GBS infection or not. The bad odor is indicative of a bacterial infection though GBS infections are also know for their itch though I'm sure everyone is different.Yep, there is very little information available online about group b strep infections vs. colonization. Massive overgrowth means that something is out of balance so something else is definitely going on. A pap smear wouldn't necessarily help because they are used mainly for looking for cervical cancer.To be on the safe side, get yourself tested for all STDs/STIs so you can rule them out. Otherwise, an overgrowth of GBS could be a symptom of other health problems that affect your immune system, allowing GBS to grow out of control. Diabetes, vascular problems, cancer and HIV are the most common underlying factors related to GBS infection though other hormone imbalances may also compromise you. And don't forget to look into the possibility of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease.If your overgrowth does not clear up with a single treatment with antibiotics (for both you and your partner), you may have a great deal of difficulty finding a doctor who can help as infections are rare and even OB/GYNs can lack the knowledge or creative thinking required to deal with an infection.My best advice for finding more information is to add more key words when doing your internet searches. The most comprehensive article I have found is by Sharat K Narayanan at eMedicine.\u00a0\u00a0http://www.emedicine.com/Med/topic2185.htmBest of luck.",

    "question": "The past two times I have had intercourse with my fiance, there was a pinkish/brownish discharge (very malodorous), upon completion.\u00a0\u00a0I have never experienced anything like this before.\u00a0\u00a0I have no discharge, odor, etc... at any other time... Intercourse is not uncomfortable in any way.\u00a0\u00a0I went to see my GYN... and was diagnosed with having a \"heavy growth\" of Strep B.\u00a0\u00a0Would these symptoms be consistent with such a diagnosis or may there be something else going on? I just had my annual pap smear done last week and it came back negative. Will antibiotics clear up the symptoms I am experiencing?
