            "answer": "HI and thanks for using the forum.First, you should talk with your doctor about whether he or she wants you to abstain from alcohol and tylenol use during the next 4 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0These certainly can cause changes in your AST/ALT levels.\u00a0\u00a0There are many possible causes for elevated AST and ALT.\u00a0\u00a0The most common cause is probably fatty liver- which can be caused by alcohol use, diabetes and obesity.\u00a0\u00a0Repeating the lab work will help your doctor to see if these results were only a temporary elevation that resolved or if the enzymes are truly elevated.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't think that you should be worried about your history of Melanoma- it was caught early and removed.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this info helps you, feel free to respond back if you have more questions.\u00a0\u00a0I will try to be as helpful as I can.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.Bridget",

    "question": "Hello,My lab work came back with elevated liver enzymes:AST = 52ALT= 145I was told all other levels were good.I had been taking tylenol on a daily basis for back pain but never more than the recommended dosage. I also socially drink, 1-2x a week. Could this have any affect on the lab results? My Dr. has scheduled another test but wants to wait 4 weeks.In Sept. 2007 I had a Stage 1a Melanoma removed but the doctors say they caught it early and I would be fine. I hope there is no metastasis from this.",
