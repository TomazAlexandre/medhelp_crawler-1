    "question": "Well, I must be doing something right. I'm just not sure what.When I was at doc's office last week I asked the PA for the results of my ALT/AST taken a couple weeks ago. 19 and 22. I haven't seen #s like that for six years, during that first year post-tx. At one year post I started taking a lot of different meds for hypertension, insomnia, etc. etc. My ALT/AST crept up to the high end of normal range and have stayed there rock steady for the last five. I always assumed this might be part of the price I had to pay to keep cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, and so forth in check.During this time I also had the chance to ask HepatitisResearcher what supplement would be specifically useful to counteract the effects of occupational exposure to toxins (I know - another probable factor in my consistently high end of normal range liver enzymes.). He suggested n-acetylcysteine (NAC). I took it and considered it good insurance even if I didn't see any obvious changes in my blood values.I recently started taking a different form of NAC (CerefolinNAC) for an entirely different reason related to my peripheral neuropathy. This is the only recent change I've made that I can think might cause a change in these values, but before I start jumping to conclusions (my favorite form of exercise!) it would be great to have HRs input on what he thinks of this situation.I think a couple people on this forum still have contact with him and if the question could be passed along or if I could get a way to make a bona fide appt. with him I'd be grateful.Thanks.",
