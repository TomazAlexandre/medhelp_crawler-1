    "question": "hi, im wondering if anyone can help me. Im diabetic (26 yrs of type 1) and have started losing vision in my right eye over the last few weeks. i have small bleeds in my retina, but nothing really to suggest the amount of blurred vision i now have. My doctor or optician have no answers and im waiting to be seen in hospital in 6 weeks time. My concern is ill be totally blind in that eye by then. Does anyone have any ideas? Im scared i have a brain tumour or something thats causing this.Thanks",
