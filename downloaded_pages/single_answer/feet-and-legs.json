            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!There are a few possibilities like hypothyroidism, peripheral neuropathy like in diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, Reynaud\u2019s phenomenon and very cold external temperatures. Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
