            "answer": "HHi,Thank you for writing in on behalf of your son.The symptoms of diabetes can vary a great deal and sometimes may not be \"classic\", so I do think your son should have either a fasting glucose or an oral glucose tolerance test(a 2 hour test) done to see if he has diabetes or even a milder form of glucose intolerance.\u00a0\u00a0The high blood pressure can certainly contribute to his fatigue so that should be treated. From a hormonal side, I think he should also be checked for thyroid problems and possibly Cushings syndrome(but the latter may depend somewhat on his physical examination findings as well.) A thorough history obtained by his doctor may give suggestions of other possible diagnoses. He should speak with his doctor about those I listed, as well as possible sleep apnea or a neurological condition that may cause some of the symptoms. Overall I do agree he should have a good physical exam and be seen by his physician soon.Take care and all the best to you and your son.",
