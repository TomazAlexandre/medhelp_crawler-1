    "question": "My 85-yr-old mother saw her Ophthalmologist on SEPT 2.\u00a0\u00a0I had noticed a distinct difference between her left & right eye a few days before & she'd been complaining about her right eye, despite just having gotten new glasses.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor said the right eye was very bad & said there was pressure from behind the eye.\u00a0\u00a0He gave her a script to see her PCP and wanted her blood pressure checked, as well as testing for diabetes.While she was happy to accept an appt for SEPT 11, I was not.\u00a0\u00a0Her appt is now for SEPT 4 and I will be going to that appt with her.\u00a0\u00a0Though not sure you will be able to respond prior to that, would like to know what questions I should be asking her PCP and/or Ophthalmologist.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
