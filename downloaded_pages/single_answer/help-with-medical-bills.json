    "question": "I know that this particular site is for problems with diabetes, but I couldn't help but notice, the question about help with medical bills as well as maybe a tax write-off? I was in a terrible car accident on may 22nd,2008. My right ankle was dislocated(completely turned the wrong way) leaving me with a compound fracture(bone sticking out) as well as a broken tibia, fibia and my knee-cap was torn off completely. I had 5 surgeries total, they inserted a metal plate, rod as well as 6 screws in my ankle and 2 more in the middle and top of my lower right leg(8screws total). Now, I know this is off the diabetes subject, but I also have medical bills over or around 175,000.00 dollars. How do you write them off on your taxes? does it matter if I have a lawsuit going as well as a lawyer? What kind of help is there for people in my situation?",
