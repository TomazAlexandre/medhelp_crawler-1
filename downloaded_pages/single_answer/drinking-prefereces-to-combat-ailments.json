            "answer": "Hi!An obese person who also has diabetes and has undergone CABG should avoid coffee. Decaffeinated version can be taken after consulting your doctor. If your wife does not like green tea, she can take normal tea without milk or sugar or she can take tea with small amount of skimmed milk with no sugar. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
