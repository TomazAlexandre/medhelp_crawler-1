            "answer": "Dear Armando,There could be any number of reasons for a cut on the penis and most of them unrelated to diabetes. Diabetes normally affects the penis with neuropathy making erections impossible, but this can be fixed surgically with an implant. The fact that you felt pain from the cut would suggest that this may not be the case, also the fact that you were making love. Usually most cuts appear on the penis from getting it stuck in the zipper which you may not have felt when it happened or from a fingernail during lovemaking. But if you are diabetic you want to treat it with an antibacterial since diabetes and infections don't go together. If i were you i'd bring up the cut with my doctor just to see that it isn't something to cause concern.Good luck, bret",
