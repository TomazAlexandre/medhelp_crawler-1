            "answer": "Hi there;What I can tell you is this. I have GERD myself and IBS and its no good feeling either. Gastritis is this the inflammation in the lining of your stomach. So yes, GERD will and can have something to do with it. GERD is considered esophogael reflux and whatever that doesn't and cannot digest it puts more acid in the stomach than it can bare. So the lining becomes irritated and other findings can be seen when performing an EGD, and Barrets Esophagus is either benign or malignant? In your case, I don't kow. This is only a simple guide to help no real medical attention. Please advise your Gastro dr of ongoing problems. Why didn't the dr tell you this? Make sure you seek medical attention if you feel that something isn't working for you. I hope this helps.Moni",

    "question": "Today I had an endoscopy with the findings of gastritis, stomach polyps and Barrett\u2019s Esophagus.\u00a0\u00a0My\u00a0\u00a0gastric problems started when I was 34 years old with a duodenal ulcer. I am now 60.\u00a0\u00a0I have been taking medications (PPI\u2019s, and H2Antagonists) for it ever since and have had numerous endoscopies.\u00a0\u00a0My problem is that I don\u2019t understand my diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I have GERD and that I\u2019m sure is the cause of the Barrett\u2019s Esophagus.\u00a0\u00a0I have been told that I probably have gastroparesis. The reason which that could be possible is because I used to take Propulsid since I had the ulcer and now I feel horrible if I don\u2019t take Domperidone which I get from Canada.\u00a0\u00a0Besides my gastric problems I am pretty healthy and do not have diabetes (a cause for gastroparesis).\u00a0\u00a0Is there a relation between gastritis and GERD? If not, I don\u2019t understand why I have gastritis since I don\u2019t have any of the causes for it.\u00a0\u00a0Should I have tests done to make sure that I do have gastroparesis?\u00a0\u00a0Could gastroparesis be the sole reason why I have gastritis? If it it is not gastroparesis, why do have gastritis? I want to do whatever it takes to get my gastric problems under control but I really don\u2019t know what to do since my diet is not bad and I am only about 10 lbs overweight.",
