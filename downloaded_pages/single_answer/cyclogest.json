I also had a miscarriage on 31 August.I also suffer from polycyctic ovaries and type 2 diabetes so I am also on metformin as well as baby aspirin 81 mg daily.A friend of mine had 4 miscarriages and delivered a bouncy healthy boy with the aid of Cyclogest.Congratulations, you will have a baby. Since they have seen the baby's heartbeat the chances of a miscarriage are very low.Enjoy every minute of it.I will have my scan next week and yes, I am nervous!",
