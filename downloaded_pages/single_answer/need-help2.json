            "answer": "Most people who have hypothyroidism have Hashimoto's disease.Have you had antibody tests run to confirm or rule out Hashimoto's?Hashimoto's is an autoimmune disease that produces antibodies that attack your thyroid. How quickly your thyroid succumbs to the antibodies depends on the number of antibodies, and the condition of the thyroid.It can be a very gradual decline over years with small increases of meds to take up the slack. Or it can be a relatively quick decline if your antibody count is extremely high.There are other causes (I would guess), but Hashimoto's is the most common form of hypothyroidism.I don't know how a developing thyroid problem would affect a person with Diabetes. You might try Googling thyroid and diabetes and see what you find.People with Hashimoto's are succeptible to other autoimmune diseases like diabetes, lupus, and most any autoimmune disease. Not that you will get all sorts of diseases, but you are at greater risk of developing an autoimmune disease if you already have an autoimmune disease.People with thyroid diseases often experience anxiety and/or depression. Medication to address those problems is often perscribed. How thyroid disease can affect existing mental problems is not a subject I know anything about.Hope this helps.",
