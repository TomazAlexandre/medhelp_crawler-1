    "question": "My daughter is 7 and for some time, she's had a spot of skin on her neck that looks dirty.\u00a0\u00a0She bathes every single day, so it seems unlikely to be dirt, and scrubbing doesn't remove it.\u00a0\u00a0She is a very healthy, active kid and I see no signs of diabetes or any other weird symptoms.What is this?\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, when I take her to a doctor, are they going to do a bunch of expensive tests just to pay for their machines when all we need is some prescription cream?",
