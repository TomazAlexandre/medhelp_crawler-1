            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!It sounds like chronic fatigue syndrome. This manifests with widespread myalgia and arthralgia, cognitive difficulties, chronic mental and physical exhaustion, headaches and concentration difficulty and memory problems.Other possibilities are anemia, hypothyroidism, disorders of the hypothalamus,psychiatric and breathing disorders.Another possibility is hepatic encephalopathy. We have a similar discussion on MedHelp that may interest you. Refer:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/hepatitis/archive/328.htmlHypertension, diabetes, strokes or\u00a0\u00a0transient ischemic attacks too should be looked into. I know you were evaluated for TIA. However it is often missed if CT scan or MRI is not done within ideally an hour of the episode. The symptoms do look like TIA. Hence all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
