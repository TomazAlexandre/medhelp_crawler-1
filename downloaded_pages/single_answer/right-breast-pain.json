            "answer": "Hi!The pain could be due to muscle pull, pinched nerve or peripheral artery disease. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, chemical burns due to any deo or lotions you use, peripheral nerve compression are the other possibilities.If you can feel a lump, then this pain can be due to a swollen lymph node, in response to fungal infection or sweat dermatitis or infection of hair follicles.The other possibilities are liver infection, pancreatitis, or a gall bladder problem. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have a sharp pinching pain on the right breast, close to my armpit, I have had it for two days, now today is day 3. It isn't any worse just getting very annoying. I have tried stretching it, I have tried rubbing it out. It doesn't hurt if I touch it just the constant pinching feeling. I have an over active fat tissue in the other breast and this isn't the same pinching feeling. There is no lump or anything that I can feel.",
