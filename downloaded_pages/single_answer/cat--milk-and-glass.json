            "answer": "Is there a reason other than lactose intolerance that your cat is not allowed to drink milk?If lactose intolerance is the only reason than I would encourage him to drink as much LACTAID milk as he desires.\u00a0\u00a0Milk had been a food staple of cats for centuries.\u00a0\u00a0It was eliminated from cat's dietary regimen due to the fact that it was found to cause lactose intolerance in susceptible cats and thus diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0It can also cause IBD in susceptible cats, and in diabetic cats it does supple a small amount of sugar.Other than the possibilities listed above, milk from any species supplies necessary liquid, Calcium, Vitamin D, and Protein.\u00a0\u00a0Indoor only cats may not get enough Vitamin D from their diets, and many cats do not drink enough liquids at all, simply because they don't like the taste of water, or because the area in their brain that controls thirst doesn't tell them that they need to drink.\u00a0\u00a0And, your cat may simply love the taste of milk!If your cat is lactose intolerant he can still have milk in which the lactose is already digested, such as LACTAID milk or equivalent.\u00a0\u00a0If your cat has diabetes, than a small adjustment to his insulin or other medication can be made, if necessary.If your cat does however have IBD or IBS or a known or suspected dairy allergy than there are ways of still giving him milk, such as giving him a tiny amount and gradually increasing the amount over time to tolerance, or you may simply have to be diligent in keeping the milk in the refrigerator.Please use Organic Milk if possible.",

    "question": "Okay, I have a 9 year old cat who is obsessed with milk, to the point that he has attempted drinking it after knocking a glass off the kitchen table. It may be possible that he swallowed small shards. (I learnt this 'news' recently.) That was 3 months ago and while he has shown signs of abdomenal swelling, this mostly occurs after drinking illegal milk-- he is tabooed from it!My questions are:1) What vitamin or mineral draws a cat to milk-- he has daily vitamin tablets, so I am really curious about why a substance that obviously causes him diarhoea is so appealling for him.2) If he did swallow glass, what symptoms should I be seeing at this stage?Thanks for any feedback.",
