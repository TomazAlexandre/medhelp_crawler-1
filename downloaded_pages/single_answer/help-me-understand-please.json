            "answer": "Hi,The MRI finding shows a hypodensity in the brain or a spot in the white matter of brain which is most likely due to blockade of small blood vessel in the brain.However other causes like chronic headache, migraine, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, need to be ruled out.From your symptoms it does appear you have suffered from TIA or those symptoms could have been due to excessive anxiety, fatigue and stress.I would suggest you to keep your cholesterol levels under control by dietary modifications and exercise to prevent stroke in future.Take care!",

    "question": "I had what is likely a stroke. My Cholesteral and triglycerides are high, Blood pressure normal. I woke up Christmas morning with slightly labored speech and a sense of being a bit overwhelmed with to much activity around me. Mt CT scan(noncontrasting) findings: aproximately 1-cm rounded hypodensity in right corona radiata extending down toward the right basal ganglia. Intracranial CT\u00a0\u00a0findings are otherwise unremarkable. Osseous structures are intact.Impression: Abnormal right deep brain hypoattenuation, this white matter disease may be related to small vessel infarct, subacute or chronic, without hemorrhage. Other forms of white matter disease cannot be ruled out.I am 55 and have always been in pretty good shape and youthful. I'm raising my children alone and really want to know what I may be up against. Can you help clarify in laymen terms?Thank you,RichThis discussion is related to/posts/show/293864.",
