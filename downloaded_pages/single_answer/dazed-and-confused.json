    "question": "HiI am a 36 yr old male who for the last 6 -8 yrs has been intermittently suffering from a burning sensation at the tip of my penis, aching testicles and occasional kidney/back pain. I have been\u00a0\u00a0to urologists, doctors, been tested for std's and HIV too many times to count and treated for candida and chlamydia 5 times with no success. (Treated for chlamydia without ever having it). Have discovered I'm\u00a0\u00a0allergic to condoms and nylon underwear and still can\u00a0\u00a0not resolve this issue. Some think it could be food related or diabetes. Any one have an idea?",
