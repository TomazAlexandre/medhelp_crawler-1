    "question": "Hello, I just join this\u00a0\u00a0forum today because I need support and\u00a0\u00a0education . I went to the ER for diabetes complication on March 11, 2014\u00a0\u00a0but the doctor also check my body and after\u00a0\u00a0 feeling my\u00a0\u00a0stomach and\u00a0\u00a0ultrasound, she\u00a0\u00a0 found\u00a0\u00a0an ovary cyst/mass and 3 fibroid.. The\u00a0\u00a0doctor said it could be\u00a0\u00a0cancer, their is fluid in one of my ovary, total hysterectomy .The doctors was\u00a0\u00a0throwing so many things at me , my mind was\u00a0\u00a0gone after hearing the word\u00a0\u00a0cancer.About me,I'm 44 years old, I have never had any children. I\u00a0\u00a0believe my diabetes\u00a0\u00a0 is feeding my cyst and fibroid. I also\u00a0\u00a0still have my\u00a0\u00a0period,no pain. My\u00a0\u00a0stomach does look like I'm pregnant. I do not know what to thing or feel anymore. All I keep thinking is cancer",
