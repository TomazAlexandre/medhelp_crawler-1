    "question": "Ms. BB- I, also, disagree-When connective tissue breaks down, one ceases moving ( and we know that leads to obesity, Type II diabetes,etc), but it also means that the connective tissue holding your organs in place is totally compromised, as well.Keep up with blood work, meds, get exercise, and you will maintain a healthy life span.\u00a0\u00a0If you give up on those things you risk a great deal more.And yes- the suicide risk is high- so keep your pain managed and a good support group around you!Blessings xoxoThis discussion is related to/posts/show/1210684.",
