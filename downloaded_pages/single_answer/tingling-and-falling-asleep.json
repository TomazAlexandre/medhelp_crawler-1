            "answer": "Hi kim,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved appears to be originating from lower back Vertebrae.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your case I feel it is compressive pathology which is causing symptoms.I think you should consult a physician to evaluate your case.If required you can get a MRI scan done of your lower back.It is premature and too early to comment about MS.Your symptomatology as of now does not sound like you are having MS.There are definitive guidelines, on which the diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis is based. There are definitive lesions (suggestive of MS) on MRI also.Once internationally accepted criteria\u2019s are satisfied, then diagnosis of multiple Sclerosis can be made.I think you should consult Neurologist ASAP.Follow the instruction of your neurologist.Hope this helps.Bye.",
