My new dr put me on a pill at night to help control my morning numbers. I'm so nervous about this. He told me gd can cause still birth, big babies, and diabetes later in life. I'm so scared I can't lose another baby and I want a unmedicated vag delivery.\u00a0\u00a0Pray for me and my lil girl.\u00a0\u00a0Has any one else ever goneed thru this. Stories please",
