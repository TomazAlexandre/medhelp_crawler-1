    "question": "I drink a REALISTIC average of 7-10 drink a week. Some days none some days 2 or occasionally more. Several months ago I started experience paresthesia. I know \"heavy intake\" of alcohol can cause this. I also have auto immune issues which are more likely the culprit, but I was wondering if my consumption is considered heavy. I never thought I had a problem as I often leave beer or wine unfinished. I stopped for over a month at the onset of the paresthesia with no problem but no change in my paresthia. I do enjoy it and don't think I have a problem. Is really\u00a0\u00a0this amount considered heavy consumption?",
