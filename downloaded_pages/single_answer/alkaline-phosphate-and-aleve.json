            "answer": "I can't find any conclusive evidence that Aleve, or Naproxen Sodium elevates alk phos levels. There is a significant elevation of total alk phos levels in diabetic patients, due to the meds. I would recommend you have your GGT level tested. If this is elevated then the elevated alk phos level could be coming from the biliary tract, and you should be evaluated for gallstones, etc. There is another possibility and it is called, benign transient hyperphosphatasemia. These is when the alk phos becomes elevated for an uncertain reason and remains elevated for 8-12 weeks then returns to normal.Hope this is helpful",
