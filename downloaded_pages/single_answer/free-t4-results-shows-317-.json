    "question": "I am requesting for help with an issue with my mother. Thank you in advance for the cooperation and help.She has got symptoms of fatigue, pain in the right side of the thyroid gland and loss of weight. Also there is a slight swelling kind of bulge on that area. She had conducted a TSH thyroid test an year ago wherein the blood levels were normal. However the pain increased and became unbearable so i consulted a general practitioner who prescribed mild antibiotics diagnosing it as infection. It did not do any good .So she consulted an ENT who further referred me to have anti-biotics to cure the infection. After about 10 days, the symptoms still persists. The Doctor also told her to take a Radio isotope test after about 3 months. Since she said that,she had a fear and she went for a free T4 test even though the doctor never prescribed me to. Unfortunately, my T4 shows a result of 31.7 pmol..She also has hypertension and is taking pills for that. She was diagnosed with Diabetes and had taken pills for about 5 months But not anymore as she has been able to control the levels through exercise and strict diet.Could anyone please tell me the diagnosis or how dangerous it is. Because this has really created a fear\u00a0\u00a0psychosis in her.",
