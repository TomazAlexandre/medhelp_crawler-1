            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A generalized tingling sensation can be due to due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Fibromyalgia is another possibility. Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency too should be looked into. This would need a comprehensive investigation. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "I have a tingling sensation throughout my entire body including my vagina. When the tingling gets intense enough I have to masterbate or have my fiance give me an orgasm. I can wrap other joints up really tight to ease the tingling sensations everywhere else. Yesterday I noticed that my left foot was swolen but it had gone down today. Do you know what causes these sensations? They drive me crazy.",
