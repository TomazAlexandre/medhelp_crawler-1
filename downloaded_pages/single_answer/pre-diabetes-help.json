            "answer": "Losing weight is good but it does not necessarily lowers your A1C. You should consider restricting the intake of carbs during meals and snacks. And of course exercise always helps fight insulin resistance and reduce your weight if necessary!For me the first step was eliminating sugar from my coffee ( though in my case it was not enough-my A1C was 11.7)You can replace it with artificial sweeteners though it is not recommended by everyone!You can always switch from white bread to whole wheat bread. Same with pasta!In any case your intake of carbs should be moderate.Your numbers might classify you as prediabetic however making some changes in your life style could prevent you fron going to the next level!Even if you ever do, do not dispare! Talk with your doctor, a nutritionist and your family. It needs support but it can be managed!",
