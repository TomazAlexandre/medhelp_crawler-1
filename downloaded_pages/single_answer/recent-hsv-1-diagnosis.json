            "answer": "No reason to think you're going to give yourself ocular herpes. Remember, about 60% of the adult population has oral herpes (HSV1), and it's safe to say that there isn't an epidemic of ocular herpes (as a matter of fact, I know no one in my entire life who's had it, do you?)... I have genital HSV1 (confirmed with a swab/culture), and I never ever even think about my genital herpes. If I have an OB and touch myself, I wash my hands (as I always do anyway!) And even then, autoinoculation is rare.That aside, you have no way of knowing your HSV1 is genital without a swab/culture of symptoms. The only thing you can do is be seen as soon as you are symptomatic for a swab/culture.As to our overall health in general, unrelated to herpes (as there's no proven correlation to stress/diet, etc when it comes to herpes OBs), we all should try to eat right, exercise, etc. for better reasons than herpes (diabetes, heart disease).\u00a0\u00a0For the vast majority of tens of millions of folks with herpes, it's a mere skin condition with no \"complications\". Avoiding cigarettes? How about doing that so you don't get cancer or heart disease!",

    "question": "I recently was diagnosed with a blood test for HSV 1.\u00a0\u00a0I believe it is the HSV 1 genital due to not remembering ever having a cold sore on my mouth.\u00a0\u00a0I did have an issue years ago when I was treated for genital herpes but never had a blood test or swab test at the time.\u00a0\u00a0I had what I believed to be an outbreak recently and that is why I went for a blood test.My question is how likely am I to have ocular herpes from HSV 1 in the genital area?\u00a0\u00a0My second question is what can I do to build my immune system up to avoid having future outbreaks?\u00a0\u00a0My third question is what is my prognosis for the future in regards to health complications if I take care of myself by avoiding alcohol, cigarettes, and taking vitamins with exercise?Thank you.",
