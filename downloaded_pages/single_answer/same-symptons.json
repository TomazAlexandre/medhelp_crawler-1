            "answer": "Does your sweating happen primarily when you eat?\u00a0\u00a0If so, it is called gustatory hyperhydrosis.\u00a0\u00a0This is different than a vasovagal response, which usually includes a racing heart and possible fainting. Sweating is secondary to the racing heart.This website has a good description of gustatory hyperhidrosis.http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/men/sweating-odor/sweat-when-i-eat.htmThere are a few different reasons why we sweat when we eat, although researchers haven't yet pinned down a tried-and-true cause. But they have found two types of triggers for gustatory sweating: physiologic and nonphysiologic.Physiologic reasons for sweating when we eat include hot temperatures, hot foods and spicy foods -- things that raise your body temperature enough to signal the sympathetic nervous system to turn down the heat.Nonphysiologic reasons for gustatory sweating include medical causes such as Parkinson's disease, nerve damage associated with diabetes, viruses that have neurologic complications including herpes zoster (also known as shingles) and nerve damage from surgery -- things that cause the nervous system to have a communication breakdown.One of the most common reasons people have nervous system problems is diabetes -- uncontrolled blood sugar levels leave diabetics at an increased risk for nerve damage if their disease isn't kept under control. Frey's syndrome, a condition that can occur after surgery if nerve endings have been damaged near the parotid glands (glands in our face that produce saliva), is also a common cause of gustatory sweating. Whether due to injury or disease, if a sweat nerve is mistaken for a salivary nerve, when the brain signals it's time to salivate, we'll sweat instead.",
