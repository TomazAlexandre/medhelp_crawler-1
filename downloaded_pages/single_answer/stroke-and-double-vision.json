    "question": "My daughter suffered a stroke three weeks ago which affected the left side of her body and her vision. She is receiving physical therapy which is helping with her ability to walk again. Very good progress made in that area as she is walking on her own again . Her vision however has not improved. She sees double and it is easy to understand why since her eyes are not properly aligned. One eye is lower than the other. She has an eye Dr. appointment coming up, but I was wondering if you can tell me if there is therapy or surgery available to resolve the eye alignment and double vision issue. BTW, she did not loose any of her vision (peripheral). I have read some previous postings and it seems that it can go either way. For some people double vision resolved in time and for others it did not. Finally,\u00a0\u00a0if surgery is required, could you please tell me the name of the procedure and the type of specialist that performs this procedure.Thank you.",
