            "answer": "Hi,It is possible that although in the past your fasting sugars were normal, your post-glucose numbers were high enough to do some damage.\u00a0\u00a0Also, cnosider that some of your complications may not all be due to diabetes, so discuss that more with your doctor.The glucose numbers you gave are very good, so I do not think you need an Endocrinologist for glucose control. But you may consider checking your blood sugars a few other times during the day and definitely if you wake up in a sweat. It would be very unusual to have glucose numbers low enough to cause sweats when you are not on medication, unless something else has gone awry. You shoud be evaluated(possibly first by your primary doctor) for the cause of those night sweats.Hope this helps,take care.",

    "question": "I am a 51 year old male diagnosed with T2 in late June through an OGTT.\u00a0\u00a0 Both the one hour and two hour ranges were over 200.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes was first suspected about 10 years ago but my fasting blood numbers and A1C were always borderline.\u00a0\u00a0Since the T2 diagnose I have also been diagnosed with a number of complications including the beginning of a cataract and neuropathy in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0I have also suffered from various temporary neuralgias over the years. Mainly the neuralgias imitated shingles but there was never any blistering.\u00a0\u00a0 Emergency gall bladder surgery two years ago may also have been a complication since I suffered no pain until peritonitis developed.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t understand why I am experiencing so many complications if my blood sugar was never all that high.\u00a0\u00a0I am overweight but never obese I am treating my diabetes only through diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve dropped 20 pounds and am only 7 pounds above the normal range for my height (5\u20193\u201d).\u00a0\u00a0My last A1C was in the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0I test twice a day once in morning and once before dinner.\u00a0\u00a0My morning count is usually somewhere around 110 and my evening range is between 75 and 90.\u00a0\u00a0Night sweats were also an issue.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible I was having hypoglycemic reactions even if I\u2019m not on medication?\u00a0\u00a0Should I see an endocrinologist and if so what tests should I request?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time.",
