    "question": "HelloLet me tell you that I have type II diabetes which has been controlled by diet and exercise. However a few months ago my blood sugars starting spiking over 200. I immediately made an appt. to see an Endocrinologist (Diabetic). After giving my history and blood work I was advised my thyroid wasn't working, my thyroid antibodies were \"off the charts\" and my pituitary gland also was not working. I was started on 88mcg of thyroid med and went for a cranial mri to rule out pituitary tumor. We did rule that out. Three months after my first visit my thyroid med was bumped to 122mcg. I'm getting ready to go back again for more blood work and follow up. I don't know what I'm expecting, but I don't feel any better then the day I walked into his office. Although my diabetes is now controlled with oral meds so that is much better. After saying all of that, I'm wondering if I should find an Endo that specializes in Thyroid or is it safe to stay with the Diabetic Endo?? Any advise would help.",
