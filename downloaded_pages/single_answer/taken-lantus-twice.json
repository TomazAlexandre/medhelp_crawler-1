            "answer": "Lantus is a long-acting insulin so you should be fine. It will be released into your bloodstream over the next 24 hours so you should test frequently during that time. If your numbers are running low you can eat extra carbs and take less bolus insulin. If you drop below 60 you will want to take a fast-acting carb like glucose tablets or orange juice, then continue to monitor to make sure it gets up into a safe range and doesn't drop again. Let us know how you do. If you want, send me a private message and I will give you the urls of a couple other diabetes websites where you will get a respond almost instantly if you post this kind of question in the future.Zoe",
