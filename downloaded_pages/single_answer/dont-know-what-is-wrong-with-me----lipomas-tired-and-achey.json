            "answer": "Hi!For the lumps under the skin: An autoimmune condition called granuloma annulare is a possibility and hence immunoglobulins and other tests for autoimmune disorders of which rheumatoid arthritis too is one should be looked into. Sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, pseudorheumatoid disease, foreign body granulomas, leprosies, leishmaniasis (parasitic disease caused by bite of sand fly), lupus, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and deep fungal infections should also be looked into.\u00a0\u00a0Severe anemia could be another cause.The chronic diarrhea which you are having can also cause fatigue. Chronic diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc. If celiac, Crohn\u2019s and other problems have been ruled out then lactose intolerance and IBS are the possibilities. Gas in stomach, burping, diarrhea all go in favor of IBS. Pancreatic enzyme disorders, liver dysfunction, HIV, cancer of the gut, and infections by parasites other than giardia can all cause persisting diarrhea. Lyme and lupus are other possibilities that present this way. Please discuss this with your doctor (GI doctor).Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "For about two months now I have been ill not in a way that a physician would say I am ill -- I have no fever blood count has been dropping (white blood cells) but still within the normal limits, stool sample normal, slight rise in the ast alt but all other liver functions normal. I feel like poop. I'm tired and almost every day around 4 - 6 PM I cannot move forward with the rest of my day and that is with me resting all day with minimal activity.I had a sinus infection that a doctor kept saying was a virus but then when I saw another doctor a month later she said \"Oh my you have a pretty bad sinus infection\".\u00a0\u00a0She gave me a z pack and I felt better but then by the end of it I felt sick again. Doctor checked my blood and said \"You don't have an infection\" so I was back at square one again.I have these elongated muscular areas on either side of by waist ... not on the front of my abdomen just on my sides of waist.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like elongated muscle but under it you can feel these moveable almost slick roundish balls.\u00a0\u00a0They do not stick out of my waist so you can't see them by your eye but you can feel them.\u00a0\u00a0I found them because that area (not the slick balls but the muscle area) felt painful so when I had a zinger of pain I would reach over to comfort that area and that is how I located the first ones.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure how long they have been there -- they almost seem to bother me more when I am more active and the area feels almost inflamed.\u00a0\u00a0It is on both sides. So I have been resting for weeks thinking it / or I will feel better.\u00a0\u00a0Tonight I walked around the mall with my husband and I was quickly tired and felt more pain again.\u00a0\u00a0It is like I am imprisioned to do nothing because of the pain.I asked my doctor if they could be Lipomas.\u00a0\u00a0She said yes but said there is nothing I can do for them and said they wouldn't show up on any imagining so she has decided not too look more into them.I am frustrated... I have tried switching doctors but all the doctors in my area are linked with that EPIC System so one just reads what the other docs (even from other centers) have written and then I am just looked at like I am crazy.\u00a0\u00a0YOU CAN FEEL THESE.\u00a0\u00a0All my family and friends have felt them, but for whatever reason medical doctors seem to look at me like I am crazy even after my husband holds one in his fingers has them touch one they will say -- yes I can feel them but Lipomas don't hurt.\u00a0\u00a0Well these hurt.\u00a0\u00a0Not the balls themselves but the areas they are rubbing on do.Would Lipomas make me feel fluish for so long?\u00a0\u00a0I am desperate.\u00a0\u00a0I'm tired of repeating myself and getting no where.\u00a0\u00a0My immune system seems to be very low right now.\u00a0\u00a0No one else in my family is sick but me for months.In the last two months I have hadDiarrhea -- on and off at times (rarely) there is undigested food in my stoolEar ache and Vertigo -- this was for about a month and a half, seemed better after the zpackachy body all the timetiredpain in abdomen area from those slimy lipoma thingsitch in vaginal area but all test have proved to be normaleczema and rash -- never had these before but they are in small areas of my body.
