    "question": "I have had my fasting blood sugar levels tested over several consecutive weeks as part of a medical study into diabetes and NAFLD. I have neither but was used as part of the control group. Each time my fasting blood sugar levels were below 5 mmol.However during this same period I had my fasting blood sugar level take as part of a general health check and this time the results were 7.9 mmoL.\u00a0\u00a0The day before this test I had used Viagra and two days before the test taken some amyl nitrite.\u00a0\u00a0Would either of these explain why my blood sugar levels tested so high?",
