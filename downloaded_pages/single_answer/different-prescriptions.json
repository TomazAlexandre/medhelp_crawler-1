            "answer": "There is too large of a discrepancy to have either filled. One of them is not the right prescription. If you're younger than 40 and your glasses test was done before your eyes were dilated the person doing the test may have let your eye muscle \"accommodate\" (focus). This will make the prescrition too strong (the bigger numbers).\u00a0\u00a0This is why ophthalmologists usually do refractions on young near sighted patients after their dilated.I would call up the office that did the most recent eye examination and explain the problem. I would ask for a \"repeat refraction\" or \"glasses recheck\". Most offices (optometrists or ophthalmologists) do not charge for this repeat service. Clarify that over the phone. When you go in\u00a0\u00a0take both prescriptions and have them retest you showing both test results and help arrive at the correct one.Weird readings like this sometimes occur in diabetics that are not well controlled or in undiagnosed diabetes. If you have any symptoms of diabetes (increase thirst and urination, weight loss, profound fatigue or a strong family history of diabetes) you may want your personal physician to exclude this as a cause.JCH MD",

    "question": "As a result of the problem discussed earlier, I had a second eye exam, only to reveal two different eye glass prescriptions!\u00a0\u00a0One was -8.50 and -7.50, and the other was -7 and -6, (.50 on each, not sure on the second prescription, other than the 7 and 6).\u00a0\u00a0How do I know which prescription to fill?\u00a0\u00a0What is going on here?\u00a0\u00a0( I did not discuss the difference in the prescription with the second examiner.)\u00a0\u00a0The exams were done within one week of each other.Thank you.",
