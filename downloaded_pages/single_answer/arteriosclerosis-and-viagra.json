    "question": "I have seen on other internet medical sites the statement that most E.D. is caused by either diabetes or arteriosclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0(Since E.D. is defined as not being able to get or maintain an erection as often as you might want to, I find this an amazing statement.)\u00a0\u00a0Assuming that they meant to say that 'not being able to get or maintain an erection nearly as well as one could as a teenager was the result of diabetes or arteriosclerosis', I have a couple of questions.\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0Would you say this is true at any level of E.D.\u00a0\u00a0Is it true if you are somewhat less able to get erections.\u00a0\u00a0Is it true if you can't get one at all?\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0\u00a0Viagra works well for me.\u00a0\u00a0Viagra does nothing for circulation.\u00a0\u00a0Does this mean that arteriosclerosis is not a major player in my case? 3. Viagra may give me chills.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a serious side effect?\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0\u00a0While I say that Viagra works well, it doesn't work as well as it used to.\u00a0\u00a0Can one build up a tolerance for Viagra?\u00a0\u00a0I know that Viagra works by masking a hormone that makes erections go away.\u00a0\u00a0Does the body produce more of this hormone as you get older?\u00a0\u00a0I have about twenty more questions, but I don't want be a pig about this.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time.",
