            "answer": "Hello,this high insulin could mean that you have insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0I am assuming that the laboratory knew you had eaten and the results and reference range reflected that.Fasting levels may not be high because your body has no food to trigger the insulin response.For now you are not diabetic but with abnormally high insulin, you will be at risk of developing it later.\u00a0\u00a0Also high insulin levels will make you more likely to gain weight and can contribute to other undesirable health conditions.how to reduce insulin levels / insulin resistance?1. Eat a lower carb diet, avoiding sweets, candies, soft drinks, sweetened drinks, and strict portion control on breads, pasta, rice etc (small portions only).2. Normalise weight if you are overweight.3. Regular daily exercise (at least moderate effort, and minimum of 30 minutes - more if you can).",

    "question": "I went for a regular check up, the doctor carried out several blood tests just to make sure everything was alright and the level of serum insulin came back very high. The blood test was immediately after lunch. A few days later, I had a fasting test for diabetes and all my levels were normal including serum insulin. My question is, were the levels of insulin in the first test high because I had just eaten? Because the fasting test was 100% normal. But ever since then, i've developed a fear i have diabetes. I am only 22 years old and i have no history of the disease in my family. Also i don't have any symptoms of type 1 or type 2 diabetes.",
