            "answer": "The word \"balanitis\" just means that there is an inflamation of the head of the penis. It does not say anything about the cause: friction/irritation, infection, allergic or chemical reaction.Why it should start suddenly without an infection after all these years is not obvious in your case. Any change in soaps? Are you rinsing under your foreskin after you wash your penis daily (as you should be doing)). Are you using any hand cream, lubricant, deodorants on your penis? Different brand of condoms? Different way of masturbating? Any of these might be a cause and might make any local trauma (masturbating) on top of tissue that was already inflamed to some extent, show up further inflamed with little further trauma.Diabetics are more prone to balanitis. It is usually felt that this is because of their susceptibility to infections beneath the foreskin and subsequent scaring of the foreskin. I have seen patients with a tight foreskin that they cannot retract who deny ever having an infection, however. A blood test to see if you have diabetes might be worthwhile if there is no other cause found.I have no idea as to the cause of the particulate matter that you\u00a0\u00a0have noted. Try catching some and taking to your physician to have it checked.You might consider seeing a urologist for a more definitive opinion.S.A.Liroff, M.D.This information is provided for general medical educational purposes only.

    "question": "Im 29, have sexually active for 15 years no problems with my uncircumsised penis. Last year my penis started to get slightly inflamed at the glands and top of skin, would heal down after few days break. Then gradually found daily masturbating started to make my glands and tip worse, skin slightly started to become red and inflamed around head, would start to fold under and then rub. Went to STD clinic twice, was told all clear results and that it's dry skin that is chapped, use moisturiser.?? I did but didn't make much difference after few months.G.P had already gave me some Timodine cream, thrush cream previously which helped to start with but made my foreskin tighter and thicker after a weeks use thought it was bit to strong?. Although the redness would start to disapear quickly the skin was still feeling sensitive and sore and slightly tacky feel to the glands. Now for past 6 months I still get this redness very easily with mild like friction. Any sexually activity makes tip and top of glands becomes slightly more inflamed. I do masturbate daily and have had some relief from stopping for a few days, (maybe I should leave it alone for a few weeks) but my sex drive is quite high and find this a problem. Now as i'm scared to have sex and masturbate i have the additional redness and soreness after? latest doc (after 20sec look) now thinks I should think about circumsion for what he belives is Balantis. I agree on diagnosis but not on circumsision as my foreskin has been never been a problem at all? Also 3-4 times this year more so last two months I get this real cloudy white sedement appear at the end of urinating right at the end of the flow..only once not before or after? it stings very slighty after the last drip. After drinking water it doesn't come back for weeks. Urine tests are clear, might need to drink more fluids? I feel like im stuck with a sore penis that can only be used on occasions and when the white trails at the end of my flow showed up now and again it had me really worried.",
