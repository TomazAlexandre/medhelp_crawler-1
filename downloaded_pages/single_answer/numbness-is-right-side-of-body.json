            "answer": "Hi! Heaviness predominantly on the right side can be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, spinal nerve compression high up in the cervical spine, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or due to bad posture.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having (except choriocarcinoma), nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 37 years old. For couple of weeks now when I am sleeping I find that the right side of my body becomes numb. This sensation continues during the day. By numb i mean - i can feel everything but my limbs feel heavy and there is a slight swelling in my ankle that comes and goes. I had choriocarcinoma two years ago and am completely healed now. I used to experience a similar feeling when I was sick. Do you think its related? I havent been to a doctor as i hate hospitals.",
