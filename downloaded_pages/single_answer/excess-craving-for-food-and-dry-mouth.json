            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Extreme thirst and headache are common side effects of Amitriptyline. Hunger is not a side effect as such but the drug causes a constant feeling of nausea and acidity which you may be countering with food.The only other possibility is uncontrolled diabetes. Multiple joint pain, numbness, tingling etc along with excess thirst and hunger should be investigated for diabetes.Apart from fibromyalgia multiple joint pain is seen in hypothyroidism, low Vitamin D levels, Low Vit B12 levels, anemia, Hasimotos thyroiditis, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, SLE, electrolyte disturbance particularly those involving calcium and magnesium, parathyroid gland problems, chondrocalcinosis and chronic fatigue syndrome.Hence investigations to rule these causes should be carried out.There are many pain medications available. Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Cox 2 inhibitor, diclofenac etc are some of the drugs that help relieve pain. On net it is difficult to say what should be prescribed without aggravating your condition. Please discuss with your doctor regarding a change of prescription and ruling out the above mentioned possibilities.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
