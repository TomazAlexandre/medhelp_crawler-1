    "question": "My mom was just diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer.\u00a0\u00a0She is 74 years old and in generally good health.\u00a0\u00a0Has Type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She just started on a chemo treatment of Gemzar and will do 3 weeks on and 1 week off.\u00a0\u00a0Next week her oncologist will also have her start Tarceva.\u00a0\u00a0My sisters and I want to take her for a second opinion and would like\u00a0\u00a0to see if someone can recommend a hospital in the NY/NJ area that specializes in treating pancreatic cancer patients..\u00a0\u00a0Obviously we want to make sure that another dr agrees with the diagnosis and the treatment and also if they can offer other treatment options as well.\u00a0\u00a0I'm feeling overwhelmed doing all this research on line and I know we need to get an appt. asap.\u00a0\u00a0My mom looks great and just has a little nausea and pain right now.\u00a0\u00a0She is quite active and really has a will to live and its hard to accept that she has this devastating disease.\u00a0\u00a0Any input would be appreciated.1. Can someone provide some recommendations on where to get a second opinion. A pancreas specialist/hospital in the tri-state area?2.\u00a0\u00a0Since it is stage IV and gemzar is the standard treatment,\u00a0\u00a0should/could she possibly be getting a more agressive treatment which could prolong her life while still maintaining a quality of life?3. How about what to do to increase her appetite? She's not eating, just picking.This discussion is related to/posts/show/235074.",
