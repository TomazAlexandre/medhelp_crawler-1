            "answer": "Hello,Xanthalesma / Xanthomas are deposits of fat/cholesterol in the eye lid. Possible causes are raised cholesterol, hyperlipidaemia states, diabetes mellitus and obesity.They cause no harm, but can increase in size producing cosmetic blemish. The only treatment is removal by surgery with/without skin grafting (depending on the size of the lesion) or use of laser (CO2 Laser).I sincerely suggest you to consult a dermatologist/cosmetologist and discuss these treatment options with him.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how your mother is doing or if you have any additional doubts.Warm regards.",
