At least 500 million individuals are infected with hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses, which cause liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Interferon based therapies have limited efficacy in the majority of subjects and recent reports demonstrating significant interferon stimulated gene expression (ISG) in chronic hepatitis suggest that these viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade the anti-viral effects of interferon. Our aim is to understand the impact of HBV and HCV stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) on viral persistence in the hepatic environment.Methods: We used a variety of in vitro (hepatocytes/hepatoma lines) and in vivo (VHL null zebra fish, SCID-upA chimeric liver mice and viral infected human liver tissue) models to study the effect of HBV and HCV infection on HIF and glucocorticoid signalling on hepatocyte metabolism and response to interferons.Results: HBV and HCV infection stabilize HIF-1\u03b1 and activate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) transcriptional responses associated with gluconeogenesis and blunt the cellular response to a range of interferons. GR antagonists restore the anti-viral efficacy of alpha and lambda interferons.Conclusions: Our findings uncover a new pathway for hepatitis viruses to utilise the hypoxic pathway to persist by reprogramming cellular metabolism and evading host innate immune responses. These studies highlight new therapeutic targets for treating chronic viral hepatitis.Assigned speakers:Garrick Wilson , University of Birmingham , Birmingham , United KingdomAssigned in sessions:10.04.2014, 09:00-18:00, Poster, 7A - VIRAL HEPATITIS: HEPATITIS B & D - EXPERIMENTAL, Poster Exhibition",
