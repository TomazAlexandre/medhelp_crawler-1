            "answer": "Hi,I am a parent of a type-1 diabetic, not a doctor, and all of the volunteers on this forum are not medical professionals. In addition, our focus is type 1, not type 2, and as you know they can respond differently to varying situations. I would suggest asking your doctor such a specific question about vitamin interaction. It may just be coincidence that your sugars have increased and not because of the vitamins, or perhaps there is a connection. It's worth seeking a professional opinion.",
