    "question": "Hi, I am a 20 year old female who is not sexually active. I have been getting extremely severe, recurrent UTIs since the past 2 years. Antibiotics calm them down but don't eliminate them completely. I have been tested for Diabetes and had an Ultrasound KB carried out on myself. Both tests were clear and so was a Urine culture test. I am drinking plenty of water and urinating frequently. Symptoms are much worse at night and in the early hours of the morning. What else can be done to reduce the pain during urination and prevent the infection from recurring? Please help.Thank you.",
