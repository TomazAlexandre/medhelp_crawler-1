            "answer": "Tingling in the feet can be a neuropathy possibly caused by diabetes. Have you had your blood sugar checked? If you are a women and are near peri-menopause or menopause you can get cold and hot or just cold. But if not I was always cold in my 20's. Hormones can do this and probably a lot of things. Maybe thyroid. Have you had your TSH checked? Other hormones may regulate temperature.",
