            "answer": "\".bl. sugar fasting ...150\"This is high. You will need to work on lowering your blood sugars by eating a proper diabetic diet, performing daily 30-60 minutes of exercise [walking], and maintaining proper body weight. Having constant high blood sugars increases the chance of diabetes side effects occurring - like premature kidney failure.\",bl.urea....20.37, sr. cretenine...\u00a0\u00a0.44\"Please post back and include reference ranges [low to high] of your BUN [blood urea nitrogen], include Creatinine [sp]. Also going to assume Creatinine is Creatinine Serum, not Creatinine Kinase test. Posting your ranges along with your results exactly as they are written/printed on your lab copy helps us help you. And tell us what your doctor said too. You did discuss your results with him/her?",
