            "answer": "I feel that there is no terrible twos and that it really is terrible threes!All four of my kids seem to have had their most complex emotions at age 3, the potty training issue is normal, a control thing as is the behavior, they struggle with trying to be in charge and still needing to be directed. He is only 3, you should be just fine, as I say no one gets married with a pullup on!So start with his pediatrician, your education makes things harder cause you understand so much-the kids know this :) Be sure firstly that there is no medical problem like a urinary tract infection or God forbid diabetes, then if his physical state is just fine discuss behavioral modification that works for him, if he is a child that thrives on attention catching him during his good moments will really be tricky but useful in rewarding him, the sticker charts are good for 3 year olds and using a treat after several dry days may be good, maybe time without his sibling and one on one with mom or dad-the oldest craves this.Hang in there. Our kids don't ever \"read the book\" and they are so smarter than we are.The bilingual thing is not a deficit just a challenge and he will do well. You are working very hard, give yourself a break and see if you can use someone else's opinions-your pediatrician, his teachers at Montessori. Work slowly but don't make big changes as the disruption will only worsen things.Hope this helps a little. Trust me, as a mom and a pediatrician my kids are the worst examples when it comes to behavior-it is so embarrassing and funny at the same time(later when you are relaxed and can laugh!!!)",

    "question": "Hello,I have two kids 3 years old boy and a 1 year old girl. In general I can't complain as they do well together they are very disciplined and very creative. My kids are raised in a bilingual environment. My older son is in preschool three times a week for few hours just for the social interaction. He does well but he's still facing communication challenges as english is not his native language. In the last few days he started wetting again. He was potty trained when he was 2.5 when he requested to go and use the potty. Sometimes when he has a wet pants I understand it was not intentional however, it used to happen once in while. In the past week he \"missed\" two-three times and it was at home. Today it happens to be both at home and twice at school. He seems to understands\u00a0\u00a0what's happening and also aware of the consequences (not getting his binky before bed/candies.., etc).He also goes from one extreme to another in the last few weeks in school. He will have a very good day or not a good day at all.\u00a0\u00a0He might throw toys, or be rude to his friends or just won't listen to his teacher who he loves!!! (He won't hit) He's checking boundaries constantly. When he feels how upset I am he promise to be good and the next time in school should be a better one but not necessarily the following one.Is my child sending me a signal? is something happening in school (he goes to a well known Montessori PreS)? Is it normal to see regression at this age? what am I missing here?Both me and my husband are teachers and educated in child development, probably not enough (PHD/MA) we spend 100% of our time with our kids. We play with them, set challenges/create and develop and do a lot home schooling.I would really appreciate your help!",
