I also havehypothyroidism (7 years)as a result of radioactive iodine treatment fromGraves disease. About 2 to 3 years ago I had shingles which was mostly inmy left upper-outer thigh. I have recently been having problems such astingling,along with chill bumps(without being cold & only in certain spotsnot covering the whole leg),& some pain,both affecting the same left outerthigh and back of my left calf. Both my primary physician and my endocrino-logist suggested that it was neuropathy. I was put on Elavil(25mg). Thishelped the pain, but I continuously have this tingling along with the chillbumps. I am swithching to Humalog insulin(Dr. prescribed) in hopes to getbetter blood sugar results. My readings are not outrageous but not perfecteither. I am a\" brittle\" diabetic I think they call it and am on an insulinpump. My question is-is this truely diabetic neuropathy and if so is theElavil an adequate treatment for it? I've heard of the pain and tingling,but not the chills in just certain spots on the leg. It is very uncomfort-able and I would like some input, and maybe recommendations. Thanks inadvance for any help and opinions you may offer.sary.______Dear Julie,Peripheral neuropathies are classically described as a 'stocking and glove'distribution of numbness and tingling.\u00a0\u00a0The long-term complications from diabetesare really problems due to impaired microvascular circulation.\u00a0\u00a0Tight controlof blood sugars can slow the progression of this ultimately microvascular disease,but not prevent them.Your symptoms are not typical for a peripheral neuropathy in that your painand numbness are in the lateral aspect of the leg and in the calf.\u00a0\u00a0You mayhave some residual effects from the episode of shingles last year.\u00a0\u00a0Elavilmay provide some relief and is a reasonable start.\u00a0\u00a0If this doesn't work yourphysician may consider Tegretol or a similar medication to help with your pain.Sometimes in these situations a physician may try a number of different medicationsto find the one that works best.\u00a0\u00a0Each patient is different.Try to have some patience, but give the medicine a shot.\u00a0\u00a0Remember that tightcontrol of your blood sugars will benefit you in the long run with diabetes.Good luck.",
