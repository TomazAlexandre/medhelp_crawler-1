            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Tumor headache usually presents with pain that progressively worsens,\u00a0\u00a0vomiting, possible visual disturbances, speech or personality changes; problems with equilibrium, gait, or coordination; and seizures. Imaging modalities such as CT scan will help rule this out. Sinus headaches, on the other hand, may present with pain that often increase in severity throughout day. It may be caused by acute infection, nasal polyps, anatomical deformities, such as a deviated septum, that block the sinus ducts. This can be treat with antibiotics, decongestants, and surgical drainage if necessary. Have this checked by your\u00a0\u00a0ENT to rule out sinus infection.\u00a0\u00a0Take care and do keep us posted.",
