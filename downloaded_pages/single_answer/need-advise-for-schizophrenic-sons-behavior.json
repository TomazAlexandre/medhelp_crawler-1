            "answer": "First of all independent housing is available. There is supported housing and for people who need more support, supportive housing and if neccessary residences (group homes). A good place to find out about housing options is independent living centers. There's one in every borough. Here's a link:http://www.ilusa.com/links/ilcenters.htmThey don't provide housing but can assist a person apply for it. As for your son's continued delusions, I would agree the recovery sounds poor. But although Clozaril is the best out of available options, there are new anti-psychotics in study, the glutamate antagonists that promote a fuller recovery and don't cause tardive dykinesia or diabetes. As I've posted I am on glycine, a glutamate antagonist in Phase II FDA study and have been identified by my psychopharmocologist as making a recovery \"as good as any FDA approved anti-psychotics or better\".\u00a0\u00a0There are multiple government studies but your son might be ruled out as a candidate because of the interaction of glycine and Clozaril but you could ask. I am taking it out of study but under the care of a psychopharmocologist who will be documenting the results. I will post a link to them but in the meantime here's a link to the official study:http://www.schizophrenia.com/research/javitt.htmand to all new medications in study:http://www.psychmeds123.info/Keep updated and informed. Your son would be eligible for independent housing but based on his recovery rate, it would be harder for him to be fully independent. So speak to a trained psychopharmocologist and perhaps find out how to get him into one of the studies. Clinicaltrials.gov is a good search engine. And as the study on me which will be published in a psychiatric journal is in official publication I'll post a link. And if you have any more questions, feel free to ask me. As board president of a non profit for people with disabilities and a recovered consumer I could answer them, certainly practical information such as housing resources but your local independent living center is the best start to help him become independent with benefits such as SSI (if you haven't applied for him you should) Medicaid and supported/supportive housing. Good luck. And as for his recovery, better treatments are in the works and they are showing promising results in multiple studies and things will change and as I am personally advocating to get these new antipsychotics out, I hope to be a part of that change and anyone who wants to join my efforts can.",

    "question": "My 23-year old son has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia\u00a0\u00a0about 3 years ago . He takes clozapine at a high dose, and lithium. He has been hospitalized a number of times, but has stabilized on his current medication regimen. My concern is that my son\u00a0\u00a0is still constantly speaking\u00a0\u00a0of the government taking over the country, and that he is somehow involved. He stongly believes my husband (whom is his stepfather ) is giving the government information against my son. He\u00a0\u00a0also talks about inappropriate things in front of my younger son. Over the years I have been to counseling with my son, I have read countless books on Schizophrenia. I have learned to handle many emergency situations where the police have been called because my son was decompensating. Now I am wondering if it's time to have him live on his own. I am honestly not sure how much more I can take.\u00a0\u00a0I have felt guilty about his illness, and have ignored everyone else in the families needs. Please advise.Thank you.",
