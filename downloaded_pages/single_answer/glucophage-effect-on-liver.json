    "question": "Re: Glucophage effect on liver[ Follow Ups ] [ Post Followup ] [ The Gastroenterology Forum ]Posted by HFHSM.D.-kb on February 13, 1998 at 09:59:39:In Reply to: Glucophage effect on liver posted by Roy on February 04, 1998 at 17:40:55:: It seems to me I recently read that glucophage can cause a buildup of fatty tissue in the liver of diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0Is this true? Are there any serious side or after effects of this drug?________________________________________Dear Roy,Glucophage as you know is a new medication for the control of Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Major side effects include Lactic Acidosis which is a rare but severe side effect of the medicine which can result in death if it occurs.\u00a0\u00a0 Unlike other oral agents used for diabetes, liver problems are not a common side effect of the medicine.\u00a0\u00a0It is true that if a person has liver disease, the medicine should be used cautiously as the liver disease may cause the drug to be eliminated from the body more slowly.Fat in the liver is a common side effect of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0As diabetes improves and the serum fat levels reduce (both which may occur as a result of taking the medicine), fat in the liver should actually disappear (or at least be reduced).Patients taking Glucophage should avoid all alcohol intake as this can increase the risk of serious side-effects.HFHSM.D.-kb0.2keywords: Glucophage, hepatic staeatosis",
