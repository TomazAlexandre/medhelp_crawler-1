            "answer": "Hi. I don't have a diabetic dog, but I am diabetic myself, so I do understand many of the additional problems that diabetes can produce. I am however curious about your concern over Optimmune. Interestingly, this is only one of a very few drugs that was first invented for dogs, and has since been modified for humans - it's usually the other way around. If it's just the side-effects you are worried about, then you might not be aware that not all dogs on this drug get any or all of the side effects. Most get none at all. It is also an FDA approved drug which has gone through a huge amount of testing and research to qualify it as safe. Not using the drug will almost certainly lead to blindness in the affected eye - which will very likely be irreversible. As a diabetic dog, there is a chance he will go blind in the other eye as he gets older .. so not treating this condition with the Optimmune may lead to blindness in both eyes eventually, which is not something anyone would want.One important thing with Optimmune, which you may already be aware of ... it needs to be kept in a clean and safe place, because any contamination at the neck of the tube and consequently of the cream itself can lead to additional health problems for your dog.Tony",

    "question": "My dog as diabetes and though we seem to be able to keep him in reasonably good shape he seems prone to other problems now. His overall health improved on 2500 IU of vitamin D but now he suffers from dry eye and will be on optimmune for that the rest of his life. That particular medication makes me very uneasy with all the listed and dangerous side effects.\u00a0\u00a0I tend to wonder if blindness in one eye would not be the better option. We just got the eye cream yesterday. He has only had one dose so far but due to get two more today and every day.",
