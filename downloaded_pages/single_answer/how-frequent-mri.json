    "question": "Hi,A little background.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with pituitary microadenoma about 5 mm in 2002.\u00a0\u00a0I had repeat MRI in 2004, with no significant change, and MRI in 2006 with no significant change.\u00a0\u00a0In 2008 I tried to get pregnant and it was found I had very high prolactin levels.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on bromocriptine and got pregnant easily. Had Gestational diabetes and other complications, but all finally ok. Had my baby February 2009.\u00a0\u00a0Tested prolactin levels 1 time since delivering my baby and they were normal range.I have been hypothryoid for 10 years now.\u00a0\u00a0Very low TSH, but other hormones ok with treatment.\u00a0\u00a0 No noticeable visual symptoms except occassional occular migraines (unrelated I think) and a major color difference / light sensitivity between eyes (maybe just me).I saw a neuroopthamologist middle of last year for visual field testing - which showed all was normal.\u00a0\u00a0He recommended a repeat MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't do that considering cost.So my question is considering that it is a microadenoma and apparently stable, is it necessary / recommended to do MRI so often.\u00a0\u00a0How often would be recommended for monitoring purposes?",
