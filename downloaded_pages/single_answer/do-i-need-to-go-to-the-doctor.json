    "question": "I have experienced facial sensitivity for many years and it lasts several days but recently it has spread, from my scalp to my face, and even ears down into my neck and throat. My face hurts when i touch the pillow on sleeping and the scalp tenderness lasts for days hurting to brush or wash my hair. I also get recurrent coldsores. I have ME, Type II Diabetes and few other problems. Do I need to get anything for this, I already take Tegretol for mood swings as I read on your forum this helps. I suffer with migraines premenstrually. Thanks Counsellordebs",
