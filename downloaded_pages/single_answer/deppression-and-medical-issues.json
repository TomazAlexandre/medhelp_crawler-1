            "answer": "I'm sorry you're having such a bad time at the minute. You can't get an STD without having some kind of sexual activity ie intercourse or oral sex and as you said you haven't then you don't have an STD. I think a trip to your doctor to try and explaine your depression would be a good idea and no need to worry about having to tell him about any STDs. Maybe you should try posting in the depression forum as well. You're not alone.",
