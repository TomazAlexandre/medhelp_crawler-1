    "question": "My boyfriend has recently been prescribed Metformin 500mg for his type II diabetes. After 10 months of this medication he's developed twitching in his forearms and a few fingers - is this a normal side effect? even after it's been this long since taking the medication? They aren't major twitches - similar to occasional, random tremors.Any responses would be really appreciated. Thank you.",
