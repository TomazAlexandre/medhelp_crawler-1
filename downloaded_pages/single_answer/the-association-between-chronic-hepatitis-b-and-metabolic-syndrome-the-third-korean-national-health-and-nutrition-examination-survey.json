The relationship between chronic hepatitis B and metabolic syndrome remains unclear. We investigated an association between chronic hepatitis B and metabolic syndrome. Methods The Third Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) was conducted by the Korea Ministry of Health and Welfare in 2005. The data obtained from the Third KNHANES were analyzed. Chronic hepatitis B was defined as positivity of HBsAg. Metabolic syndrome was defined by the modified NCEP ATP III for Koreans. Results Of the 5108 subjects, 209 (4.1%) had chronic hepatitis B, and 1364 (26.7%) had metabolic syndrome. In univariate analysis, the subjects with chronic hepatitis B were not different in prevalence of metabolic syndrome (21.1% vs. 26.9%), alcohol intake (69.9% vs. 75.1%), smoking (41.4% vs. 37.7%), exercise (47.4% vs. 47.6%), diabetes mellitus (7.7% vs. 8.6%), hypertension (25.4% vs. 26.7%), and obesity (36.4% vs. 32.4%) than those without chronic hepatitis B. However, in multivariate analysis, odds ratio of chronic hepatitis B was 0.6 (95% CI: 0.4-0.9, P=0.017) for metabolic syndrome after adjustment with age, gender, drinking, smoking, exercise, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. Conclusions Chronic hepatitis B is strongly associated with the decreased risk of metabolic syndrome. \u2020The Third Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), 2005, Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
