    "question": "I went to the clinic today because, though late enough in pregnancy I have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes.I had the initial test in my 28 week for one hour glucose and it came back high but not yet gestational.So I went back for a second one for two hours and it came back high but still not high enough. I then did another two hour glucose test and it was a little over 11.0.Not to sure why i was not sent for diabetic and nutritional counseling when it showed high the first few times but now I have been told after today's blood work tat i have to take insulin.I think this may have been avoided if I was sent earlier for counseling on diet and carb intake etc.Now I have four weeks to go and have to take insulin. The nurse at the clinic today told me that before we started she wanted to make sure to tell me that the gestational diabetes was not because of something I did. that it was not unusual and happened to even the most healthiest individuals who ate well and excersized regularly etc. She mentioned it was due in large part because of the fluctuation hormones and related things that occur during pregnancy.I have always had issues with my hormones but so far this has not been addressed and labeled as a problem with my mental health to which i have been taking medications for for several years but still experience bad mood swings and psychotic behaviors prior to menstruation.My cycles have never been normal and I also suffer great pain during my menstrual period. So anyway, my question is this:Does any one know if there have been links to blood sugar levels and the two drugs I am on Seroquel and Parnate.I have NEVER had issues with blood sugar ever and though i a obese, have no history of it in the family and have regular blood work done every 6 months to which never has it ever shown issues with blood sugar levels.Anyone know if it is possible that these drugs may contribute to this gestational diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure has still and always been optimal despite my weight ect. I feel just awful for myself and for baby and though I have heard that it is nothing I did wrong from professionals and personal friends but I find it hard to accept seeing as I am in this predicament...I am so scared and worried and filled with guilt and though I am doing the BEST I CAN with who I am at this point right now, I can;t help feel bad and worried....Any advice, suggestions, personal stories or information about these drugs would be so helpful to me at this point. Thanks for reading...",
