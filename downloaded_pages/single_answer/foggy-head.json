            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Some of the common causes of foggy head are anemia, poor sleep pattern, sinusitis and hypoglycemia. All these can cause a sense of light headedness too.\u00a0\u00a0Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "ive had a foggy head for 10 months without a day where i felt normal, not even an hour its constant and annoying. i have a dizzy feeling every now and then but not as if im going to fall over or pass out or anything, and i get lightheaded, it will just hit me whether im sitting standing or whatever. my mind is just in a daze and i cant find an answer why, i am allergic to molds and corn pollen, which i understand can cause this, but i dont think it would last this long and never let up even a little, but the dr thought that was my problem so i first i tried claritin, then put my head over steam, then used a neti pot and then antibiotics and it helped my sinuses but i still feel this constant fogginess, then they say it might be anxiety, ive known that i have anxiety problems for 6 years and this has never happened, but it has become very frustrating, i cant do the things i used to be able to do, i got a ct scan and there was nothing wrong, i cant really describe what it feels like, but the closest i can is when i stayed up for 3 days, thats how i feel constantly, its not fun, so if anyone else has had this i just want to know how long it lasts",
