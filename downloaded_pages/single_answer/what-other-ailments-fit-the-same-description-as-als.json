            "answer": "I was convinced I had it and now ask the same question that you do - what else is causing the buzzing and twitching in muscles of arms and legs. MRI is ok so is blood work and also the test that rules it out completely where they do the electric shocks and measure the reactions also stick needles in and measure the nerve reaction.I have had Fybromyalgia suggested and also Diabetes. But most of all it does seem that stress is responsible for possibly all of these symptoms you really just need to keep going to the doctor and also I have had it suggested that an imbalance of minerals can cause a lot of peculiar symptoms along the lines of ALS.\u00a0\u00a0You must keep going to the doctor or change to another to get opinion they are only human and it is impossible for them to know everything - sometimes a new doctor has had a similar case and bingo it is solved.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck you do not want to have ALS my mother died from it and you would not put an animal through what that poor women went through it is a very nasty disease.All the best Jo.",
