            "answer": "Hello,why is your sugar high?The simple answer is 'because you have diabetes\".How high?Are you taking meds?\u00a0\u00a0Which meds?To problem solve:What was your sugar before eating your 3am meal?What was your sugar about 2 hours after eating\u00a0\u00a0your 3 am meal?If it was high after eating the meal then the high at 11 am could be because you were high after eating (and maybe also high before eating).If you were not high after eating but it only started going up later this could be some version of the 'dawn phenomenon' when one's liver puts out sugar in response to fasting....If your sugars are typically high you may need to have your medications changes.\u00a0\u00a0You may also find that eating lower carb meals helps with reducing blood sugar levels.Optimally fasting blood sugar levels are in the range if 70 - 95, and post eating is not higher than 140, but ideally < 120.Hope this helps.",
