    "question": "Posted by Lou on April 26, 1999 at 01:10:32Decision Time !My mom 74 years of age has diabetes II, Hepetitis C, and Mylodispasia (chronic anemia). Her medications are Glucotrol XL 20mg and Rezulin 600mg (for diabetes), Normadyne 200mg, demadex 50mg, prinivil 40mg, Spirono Eq Aldectone 25mg. She also gets a weekly injection of 10,000cc Epogen/Procrit.Aside from her slow gait, she manages to do her dialy chores (cooking, cleaning, and shopping) from 6am till 8pm. She is not short of breath or in any pain. A recent Echocardiogram indicated that her aortic valve area to be .7 cm2, Peak Gradient at 49 mm Hg, peak Velocity at 3.5 m/sec, and her Tricuspid Valve RVSP at 79-84. Her cardiologist classified the above as \"Moderate vulvular Aortic Stenosis\". He further indicated that she needs valve replacement surgery but that he is unsure if she is a candidate for surgery as she has these other medical conditions. He further recommended that she be evaluated at a major teaching hospital in New York. We had her evaluated at the NY Hospital and the Cardiologist there confirmed the Echo readings and agreed that Valve replacement surgery is necessary and that she IS a fit candidate for same. He stated that doing nothing is \"worse than cancer\".I further inquired if mom is a candidate for the Minimum Invasive Procedure as performed at the Cleveland Clinic. His stated NO and that her percedure requires the full Monte (so to say).Question 1, Do you know of the mortality rates for an individual with the above condition ??Question 2, How does the patient and family proceed to reason and conclude whether to go ahead with the surgery or not ??Question 3, Based on the information provided (not having her medical records) do you think that we should proceed with surgery ??Question 4, Is she a candidate for the Minimum Invasive proceedure ??Any suggestions and further help would be most appreciated.Posted by CCF CARDIO MD-APS on April 27, 1999 at 14:29:31Dear Lou,1,2. In general the risk for death in undergoing open heart surgery(OHS)is about 4%.THIS NUMBER OF COURSE VARIES FROM ONE HOSPITAL TO ANOTHER, ONE SURGEON TO ANOTHER, AND FROM ONE PATIENT TO ANOTHER.Here at the Cleveland Clinic our mortality (risk of death) rate for OHS is about 1%, and that is a very impressive number considering that we do surgery on older and sicker patients.I can not be any more specific for your case since the patient's comorbidities and not just his/her history factors in to the number; in general though, the older and sicker (diabetes, heart failure, etc.) the patient, the higher the risk for death with open heart surgery.\u00a0\u00a0It is very important to get this number/estimate of risk from the surgeon since you will be weighing it against the risk of not having surgery.An Aortic valve area of 0.7cm2 is right on the fence between moderate and severe aortic stenosis(AS).\u00a0\u00a0About 50% of patients with severe AS will be dead in 5 years time without surgical therapy (a study some years ago was done comparing medical and surgical therapy in AS.)\u00a0\u00a0The fact that your mom has no shortness of breath is a good sign, however the high RVSP is concerning (i.e. making one think that now is the time to take the risk) and certainly she is not getting any younger, i.e. this might be her best shot at adding years to her life (in regards to the heart.)3. With the amount you have told me, if this were my mother, I would be leaning toward surgical treatment now, but I certainly would not have it done just anywhere, rather I would want it performed at a center that is highly experienced in complicated (older, sicker patients) cases.4. IF your mother has coronary artery disease as well as the valve problem, then NO she is not a candidate for minimally invasive surgery; of course, every \"valve only\" surgery is considered for minimally invasive approach here at the Cleveland Clinic-BUT there are other excluding points such as those with chest bone deformities.\u00a0\u00a0Without an evaluation (i.e. your mother having a second opinion here) I can not be more specific.I hope this information is useful. Information provided in the heart forum is forgeneral purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Only your physician can provided specific diagnoses and therapies.Feel free to write back with further questions. Good luck!If you would like to make an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center, pleasecall 1-800-CCF-CARE or inquire online by using the Heart Center website atwww.ccf.org/heartcenter. The Heart Center website contains a directory of thecardiology staff that can be used to select the physician best suited to address your cardiac problem.Posted by Lou on April 29, 1999 at 00:50:57Many thanks to the CCF medical professional who responded to my post.Since my post I have had mom evaluated by another Cardiologist at a NY hospital. He felt that in his opinion, the RISK factor (which he defined as mom not making it out of the operating room) is 25%. As such his perferred route is to do nothing at the moment and do another ECHO 6 months from now. The first cardiologist, an extremely respected professional in NYC, put the risk factor at only 10% and recommends surgery as soon as possible.Aside from the trauma and confussion that mom's condition has caused, the disagreement and differences between two respected NY cardiologist is making this saga even more depressing.What logical and/or methodical approach do you recommend to deal with these differences ? I now beleive that if I visit 4 more cardiologists, I will wind up with a tie score.If this was a close relative of yours, how would you approach the ultimate decision ??Please add any additional information that you think can give me a clearer picture of her condition a prognosis.Many thanksPosted by CCF CARDIO MD-APS on April 29, 1999 at 21:31:56Dear Lou,All that I can really say Lou is that it really is not unacceptable or unheard of to wait 6 months and repeat the echo in any patient with less than \"severe aortic stenosis\" and no symptoms (shortness of breath, passing out, or chest pain specifically.)\u00a0\u00a0If it were my loved one with a 10-25%chance of not making it out of the operating room, I would very seriously consider a \" wait and see approach\", actually choose that option so long as I had a doctor or two tell me that the risk of death by waiting is not itself as high (in which case I would opt for the surgical approach.)I hope that this all makes sense and is helpful, at the very least it should help you realize that a third opinion is not the answer, reason is the answer.\u00a0\u00a0When and if you decide on surgery, ask questions like, how many of these procedures have you performed? and on how many such risky patients? and the like as this will help you to make the decision based on skill of the surgeon and not just on the better quoted risk. In other words, if the more skilled surgeon tells you there is a 25% chance of death in the operating room, I would still choose him/her over a lower quoted risk in that if and when I make it out of the operating room, I want a near perfect valve, not one that is botched or one that will only cause other problems in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0So, ask why the risk is that high, not just what the number is because there has to be some explanation for one doctor telling you 10% and the other 25%, like one of them is not being realistic, or one of them is factoring in all the comorbidities; you see what I am getting at?\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck to you and your mother.I hope this information is useful. Information provided in the heart forum is forgeneral purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Only your physician can provided specific diagnoses and therapies.Feel free to write back with further questions. Good luck!",
