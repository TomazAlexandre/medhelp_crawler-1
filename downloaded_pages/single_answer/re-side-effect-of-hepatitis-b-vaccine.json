I know there is a lot of interest and a lot of publicity right now about adverse reactions to the hepatitis B vaccine.The hepatitis B vaccine has now been given to millions of people and overall appears to be an exceptionally safe vaccine.\u00a0\u00a0One physician in New Zealand claims there has been some increase in diabetes there after they starting to vaccinate older children (over the age of six).\u00a0\u00a0However, he claims the vaccine lowers the incidence of hepatitis B in young children.\u00a0\u00a0In addition other physicians and epidemiologists have not been able to shown any link.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, my conclusions are that there is not compelling evidence to feel that the hepatitis B vaccine causes diabetes and that I feel children should be vaccinated against hepatitis B and so should adults that are at risk for exposure to hepatitis B.I hope this information is helpful to you. I would be interested in any additional information or questions you have. I would also be interested in knowing if you feel you are aware of a situation where hepatitis B caused diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Any type of medication can have potential side effects and often they are discovered because individual patients persist in bringing them to the attention of physicians.\u00a0\u00a0You can contact me directly at Henry Ford at (313) 916-8865.This response is being provided for general informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice or consultation.\u00a0\u00a0Always check with your personal physician when you have a question pertaining to your health.",
