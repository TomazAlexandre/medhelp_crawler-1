            "answer": "First, levels of serotonin have little to do with mental health, as far as we know.\u00a0\u00a0There is no scientific evidence people with depression or anxiety have different levels of serotonin than anyone else.\u00a0\u00a0Now, some people might test low for serotonin, but that wouldn't necessarily mean they had mental problems -- there's far more serotonin in the digestive tract and the blood vessels than in the brain.\u00a0\u00a0Anti-depressants don't work by elevating serotonin, they work by preventing its breakdown and targeting it to particular receptors (causing other receptors to shut down until discontinuation).\u00a0\u00a05-htp is a metabolite of tryptophan, which, together with cofactors such as B6, manufactures serotonin naturally in the body.\u00a0\u00a0When 5-htp works, it probably does so by maximizing the efficiency of the body's uptake of serotonin.\u00a0\u00a0Whether it helps you or not depends on whether your body sees a need for it, and how you individually metabolize it.\u00a0\u00a0As with medication, it's very individual.\u00a0\u00a0The dosage will be on the label, but we do vary in our needs sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0It depends on how much is in the capsule.\u00a0\u00a0Some will put a day's worth in one capsule, some will divide it into two or three doses.\u00a0\u00a0Depends on the product.\u00a0\u00a0Safety is also individual -- some people are helped, some feel nothing, and some get unwanted side effects, such as increased anxiety, as with any medicine whether natural or not.\u00a0\u00a0The good thing is, if you don't like it, you can just stop taking it, a dangerous thing to do with anti-depressants.\u00a0\u00a0But also keep in mind Type 2 diabetes is a dietary disease, and if the blood sugar problems are causing your mental problems, dietary treatment and therapeutic techniques might get you to the same place.\u00a0\u00a0Also, natural remedies are usually used in combinations, not singly, holistically.\u00a0\u00a0Something to keep in mind for your future research.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
