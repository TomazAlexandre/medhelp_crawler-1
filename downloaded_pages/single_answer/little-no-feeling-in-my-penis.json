            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include psychological issues, neurogenic disorders, peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/ medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. At a primary level I would suggest being a bit relaxed about the situation and controlling avoidable factors such as stress, smoking, alcohol etc. and see if this seems to improve the condition. If you do not notice any improvement, it might be a good idea to consult a urologist for a detailed evaluation and appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",
