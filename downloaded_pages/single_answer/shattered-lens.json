    "question": "my mom had a catarct removed and when he put the new lens in it shattered and then she let him do the other eye and he told her the cataract shatttered when he tried to remove it . It's been a year\u00a0\u00a0and half ago and the floaters and eyesight are worse. She's still using eyedrops but they are not helping. I think the DR. really messed up, what do you think ? She does not have macular but does have diabetes which under control. Thanks, Beauhair",
