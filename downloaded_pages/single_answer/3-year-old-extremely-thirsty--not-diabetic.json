    "question": "Hello, my son (3 years, 10 months) has been showing (starting 4 weeks ago) a great increase in both his thirst and urination.He'll ask for water every 10 minutes or so, and pee as often.Recently (about 10 days ago) the scenario got worse and he's waking up during the night every hour asking for more water (or juice, or milk).Obviously with that liquid intake he's almost never hungry and will wet himself while sleeping, even with new diapers every hour.He has been tested for diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus, negative on both.Blood work on BMP, hemogram and urine tests all came back normal.Other than the thirst and urination, his behavior seems normal, not complaining about any pain or being tired at all.Although he doesn't appear to be losing weight, he's also not gaining any because of eating less.He has not suffered any physical trauma or emotional stress (no new siblings or routine changes), neither had surgery or is taking any medication.Doctors don't seem to know what to do, as they say they'd never seen anything like this.Any help is appreciated. Thank you.",
