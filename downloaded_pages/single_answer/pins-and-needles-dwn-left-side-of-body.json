            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This looks like an episode of transient ischemic attack wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. Otherwise it could be due to nerve compression very high up in the cervical vertebra.On a lighter note it could be exposure to cold air on a particular side of your body or wrong sleeping posture.Another possibility is Vitamin B12 deficiency. Underactive thyroid and diabetes too should be ruled out. Sometimes migraine too presents with these kind of unrelated symptoms. Please consult a neurologist. You may need to undergo MRI of the brain or cervical spine.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
