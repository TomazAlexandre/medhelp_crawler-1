            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed description or a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include infections, inflammations, trauma/ injuries, a few primary skin conditions etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by primary care physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
