            "answer": "Hi there!Well, it would be difficult to comment on the situation without a clinical evaluation, though with your description, possibilities such as compartmental syndrome and sudek\u2019s dystrophy are important possibilities that may need to be considered along with insensitivity to the current antibiotic regimen. Uncontrolled diabetes may further complicate the situation by decreased response to management. I would suggest discussing the situation and the possibilities in detail with your treating doctor, for appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I underwent cheilectomy of the right great toe for hallux rigidus (osteoarthritis of the big toe).\u00a0\u00a0Things were improving quickly until day 7 when I developed cellulitis (skin infection) at and around the suture site on dorsum (top) of foot.\u00a0\u00a0Was treated with IV Ancef and Cipro, with good response.\u00a0\u00a0I was sent home after one day (on oral antibiotics) with no weight bearing.Within a day, developed NEW swelling of entire forefoot and extreme point tenderness on the plantar side (underneath) of the metatarsal head.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is mild when there is no pressure but severe with even a light touch, and it feels as if it is radiating deep into the foot.\u00a0\u00a0I have been getting sweats and chills, but I have not had any fever.\u00a0\u00a0I was readmitted and treated with several more days of IV antibiotics, with no change in the pain or swelling.\u00a0\u00a0MRI was reported as showing no abscess, only a large collection of \"fluid\" that is \"probably impinging on a nerve\".\u00a0\u00a0I was sent home on oral antibiotics.I am now two weeks post-op.\u00a0\u00a0The swelling has not diminished at all; it involves the entire lateral half of the foot (including all the toes) but especially the right great toe.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like my foot is clamped (gently) in a vise.\u00a0\u00a0It does not seem to be getting worse, either.\u00a0\u00a0The point tenderness is just as severe.\u00a0\u00a0It does not seem to be changing at all, despite antibiotics and several days with no weight bearing.\u00a0\u00a0The surgeons seem to be stymied.I have mild diabetes well-treated with diet and low doses of Metformin.\u00a0\u00a0Labs show only mild elevation of ESR, with normal CBC.Does anyone have any idea what this could be?\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts would be appreciated.",
