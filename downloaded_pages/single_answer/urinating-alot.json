    "question": "Two days ago I started urinating 1-2 times at night and in the day about every 3-4 hours, I cut out sodas and sweets 1 week ago and I have only been drinking water and tea. I thought about diabetes but i had my mom use her glucose monitor and my reading was normal so i dont know what else to think. My boyfriend and i had been having unprotected sex, I was once on birth control pills but they made me sick so i talked with my healthcare provider and stopped those and that was about 1 1/2 months ago and at that time I got a checkup and was negative for all infections and everything. I mean he pulls out so I dont even think i am pregnant. Can someone give me some type of suggestions to what may be the problem.",
