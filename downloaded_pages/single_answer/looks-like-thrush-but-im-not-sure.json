    "question": "I am a 16 yr old male.i have been underweight my whole life but i believe i eat an average diet. Two weeks ago i experienced pain whenever i ate on my tongue.i could barely even eat. i also noticed this creamy milk like substance all over my tongue. the doctor technically diagnosed it as thrush but he was very skeptical. i took nystatin and after a few days the pain went away but not the white on my tongue. its now been two weeks that ive been taken nystatin and the pain is starting to come back.also i noticed these red lines across my both my cheeks in the same spot a couple hours ago. they are more irritating then painful. there are a bunch of red dots on my tongue, mainly the tip but im not sure if thats from thrush. when i scrape of the creamy substance, my tongue does not bleed. my twin sister has a thyroid disease but i believe i have been tested a while ago and it was negative. Any help would be appreciated. i heard it could be diabetes. What is your guess??",
