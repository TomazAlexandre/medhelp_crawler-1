            "answer": "Hi,Since you have a history of diabetes, so it looks like dry skin due to diabetes. The mainstay of management is liberal use of moisturizers after washing with luke warm water. Soap should be used minimally. Moisturizers should be reapplied liberally during the day. You can also use a topical cortisone (steroid) cream or ointment after consulting your doctor. Adding a humidifier to the central heating system of your home or using a humidifier also helps.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.If still the symptoms persist then possibility of eczema and chafing have to be ruled out. I would suggest a dermatologist\u2019s consultation in that case.",
