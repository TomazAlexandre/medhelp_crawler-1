            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Blisters on knuckles can be due to diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic bullous dermatosis, and malnutrition. Blisters can be caused by intense rubbing or friction. They can also be seen in moist skin as one always covered with sweat or water.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult a skin specialist regarding this. Take care!",
