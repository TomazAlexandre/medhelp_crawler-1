            "answer": "Hi, the spleen is marginally enlarged. Splenomegaly can occur due to causes such as infections (mono, hepatitis, TB), blood disorders (anemia, sickle cell) and also due to cirrhosis of the liver. If it persists, you will need to be worked up to rule out these causes. Fatty liver changes can occur due to alcohol consumption and due to diabetes and hyperglycemia. The fatty changes are reversible if the cause for the changes is controlled. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance. Regards.",
