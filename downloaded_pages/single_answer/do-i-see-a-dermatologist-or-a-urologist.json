    "question": "I have been experiencing reoccurring cuts on my foreskin for the past 6 months. I've never had a test for diabetes, however I am not remotely overweight ~70kg & 182cm tall. I want to go and get these cuts checked out as they never seem to heal and the foreskin just seems to be staying tight. Also I'd like to get a test for diabetes and penile cancer if possible.Can I get all of this done by the same doctor? Also should I see a urologist or a dermatologist?Thanks!",
