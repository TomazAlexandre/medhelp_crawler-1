    "question": "Hello,I have been diagnosed type 2 diabetes for 8 years. This year I just got my annual checkup report, and found that for the same random urine sample, the result isprotein\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 trace\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the normal range is negative / tracemicroalbumin\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 14 mg/L\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the normal range is 0 ---\u00a0\u00a0 17I am confused by this result. I think the two results is not match with each other. If the protein can be found in the urine regular check, that means I already have DM 4th stage! But the microalbumin is in the normal range,\u00a0\u00a0why?Am I in the big trouble, need to see a nephrologist?",
