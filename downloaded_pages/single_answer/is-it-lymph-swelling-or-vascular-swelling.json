            "answer": "Hi!The symptoms of pitting edema could be dueto deep vein thrombosis of the deep veins of the leg or maybe valvular dysfunction of the deep veins of the legs or lymphedema. This can be diagnosed by color Doppler or by angiogram of the leg veins or by duplex ultrasound. High blood pressure, heart problems, kidney and liver dysfunction, and diabetes should be ruled out if you have pitting edema. These can be ruled out through blood tests, EKG, ECHO, and blood pressure monitoring. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your vascular and medicine specialist for this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
