    "question": "Im 29 weeks pregnant today, and tomorrow im spending all day at hospital to have a diabetes test, and to also see the doctor. Had to go for a growth scan on Friday, as my bump is measuring at 35cm, and my midwife was worried. Turns out im carrying a hell of alot of water, most women carry an index of 20cm, whereas mine is an index of 27. They also weighed my baby and shes already weighing in at 3lb 6oz, and according to this app, they're only supposed to weigh around 2 and a half pounds. It's really got me worried that I may have diabetes and where im quite far gone, I've obviously not done anything to treat it, and it may affect my little girl. They said my dates were still the same, im just worried shes going to come earlier then expected, and we've got hardly anything for her. If she gets too big, will they induce me, or still make me carry her full term? This is my first child, and it's not been the easiest of pregnancy's, just petrified something is going to happen to either me or my precious little gift :-(",
