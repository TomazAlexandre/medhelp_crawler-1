            "answer": "Hello,Frequent urination in adults can be due to many causes.The primary cause which needs to be excluded is diabetes. I would advise you to get a fasting blood sugar and Hb A1 C test done.If diabetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are prostatitis(inflammation of the prostate gland),interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome, stroke and other neurological diseases, urinary incontinence, bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction . Yoge won\u2019t help in this.Please consult a urologist in that case.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
