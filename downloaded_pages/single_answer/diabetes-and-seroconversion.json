    "question": "Dear Dr's. Thank you for all of your help and great information. I have what I think may be a unique area of concern. I had a potential exposure by both inserting a cut finger into the vagina of a woman whose HIV status is unknown to me, and performing mutual masturbation where my penis was very close to her vagina and may have likely touched her vagina. I don't think my penis went in but I was pretty drunk and don't exactly remember everything with clarity.This happened in late March and I was tested at 6 wks and 15.5 weeks after the exposure by ELISA and both were negative. Today, I found out that I have early onset diabetes which I'll bet has been coming on for a while. I have read on another website that diabetes can cause a delay in seroconversion and now I am horrified that my prior tests are not reliable as seroconversion may have been delayed by diabetes. My doctor agreed to do another ELISA test today and is also ordering a P24 test in the event seroconversion has not occurred. Today would be a week short of 6 months. I know this was likely a low risk exposure but I am now frightened beyond belief. Can you tell me what you know about the relationship between diabetes and HIV seroconversion and whether or not I have something to be concerned about? I do greatly appreciate your help and pray that you will answer my question. I will not hear back on both tests for another week to 10 days and I don't think I'll make it without some direction on whether or not my fears are rational. Please respond asap. Thanks so much.",
