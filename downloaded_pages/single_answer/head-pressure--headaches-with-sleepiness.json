            "answer": "I would say if the oxygen mask does not provide you with relief within a couple weeks, then could very well be you are experiencing a migraine headache, which triptan medications are good treatment for those.\u00a0\u00a0While the pressure on top of your head is not always a headache for you, the pressure alone, especially when combined with feeling sleepy, can indicate migraine.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of people do not get a diagnosis of migraine, and so it winds up being untreated, which obviously will not do.It IS possible this mild breathing problem you've got when sleeping is preventing adequate oxygenation of the brain, and so as a result of not getting a good night's sleep and somewhat less oxygen to the body, you get this pressure feeling and naturally would get sleepy.\u00a0\u00a0So, see how that does for you, the oxygen mask.\u00a0\u00a0And as you know, any extra weight you have is going to complicate whatever is wrong, including your diabetes, which regular exercise will usually take care of that.\u00a0\u00a0Also, be sure you're getting enough water to drink.\u00a0\u00a0And also, if you are under some stress, that falls in the shoulders, and so you can consider some massage therapy for a few visits, to see if that helps.",
