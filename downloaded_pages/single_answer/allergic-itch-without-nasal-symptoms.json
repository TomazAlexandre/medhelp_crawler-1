            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Itchiness is an allergic reaction. Normally person may not manifest all the allergic reactions. Besides allergies itchiness of the whole body could be due to extreme dryness of the skin or due to jaundice. It could be due to iron deficiency anemia, liver and kidney disorders, thyroid disorders, polycythemia, diabetes and malignancies (cancer). It could also be due to certain medications and food. Others could be due to skin conditions like scabies. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "For a few months now, I've experienced generalized itchiness mainly on the trunk and neck, occasionally extending further, and sometimes the scalp.\u00a0\u00a0There is never any rash, but the itching produces raised weals (dermatographia).\u00a0\u00a0This occurs in daily episodes, generally once or twice a day, usually worse at night.\u00a0\u00a0After an hour or so, the weals are gone and the skin looks normal. Zyrtec is very effective in preventing this itch, but when I stop taking it, the itch comes back within a day or two. I just completed allergic skin testing which revealed significant allergies to mold, dust mites, and some trees, weeds, and grasses.\u00a0\u00a0Blood testing reveals no obvious problems with internal organs which would be causing the itch.\u00a0\u00a0So I am ready to start allergy shots at the doctor's suggestion.But the one thing which bothers me about all this is the lack of nasal symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Apart from some mild, occasional congestion I have none of the usual hay fever symptoms - no sneezing at all, no itchy, watery eyes as I used to get years ago in the spring time.\u00a0\u00a0So I am worried that the itching could actually be caused by something more sinister, some kind of systemic problem.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have experience with such a condition - should I rest assured that this is just some kind of allergy, or should I seek a second opinion or investigate further?Thanks!",
