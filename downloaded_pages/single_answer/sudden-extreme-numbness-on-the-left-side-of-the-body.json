They did many x-ray and tests and they all came out normal. Since his numbness passed over within hours, they sent him home. He doesn't have diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything bad/abnormal. We went to the neurologist, as well, and again nothing that is abnormal is found. What should we do now? Are there any particular experts that we should see?This discussion is related to/posts/show/1329945.",
