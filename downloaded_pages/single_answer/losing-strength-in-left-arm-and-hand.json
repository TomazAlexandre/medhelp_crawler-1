    "question": "Hi, I'm 40 yr old female with 21 yrs type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0About 6 months ago I noticed a tender spot in the front upper arm that only hurts when I lifted my arm a certain way or lay on it. Now over the past week I have noticed the strength in the left arm is getting very week more and more. I have noticed the strength in my fingers also going. I find it hard not to hold a fork but to use it. Finding it hard to lift light things. No pain apart from the upper arm when in certain positions. I have just noticed my little finger is going numb also. Hope you can help. Thank you",
