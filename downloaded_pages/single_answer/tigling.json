            "answer": "Hi! Tingling in one half of body arm can be due to multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes/hypothyroidism/Lyme's/lupus, or pinched nerve in neck.Other possibilities could be dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Fibromyalgia is another possibility. Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency too should be looked into. This would need a comprehensive investigation.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
