    "question": "I have recently noticed small hard deposits in my penis vein about 1-2\" from the top of the head. The deposits are like a calcium build up that appear to be stuck and continuously building up more in the top vein. What is this? Is it preventing me from having a full ejaculation? Could my diabetes possibly be causing harding of my arteries and leaving deposits everywhere? I spoke to a Urologist regarding this and he seemed to be unconcerned. Since then the build up has doubled. Please help.",
