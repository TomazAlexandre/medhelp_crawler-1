            "answer": "Hi,Hair thinning may be related to the stress of the previous illness, hormonal problems, pregnancy, certain medications, infections, or may be a part of an underlying disease such as lupus or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Medicines that can cause hair loss include blood thinners, medicines used for gout, chemotherapy, too much vitamin A, birth control pills and antidepressants. Fungal infections of the scalp can also cause hair loss but can be easily treated with antifungal medicines. Stress related, which is more likely, is temporary.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to find the underlying cause so that this can be treated.Take care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "I'm a 30 year old healthy female who has always had nice hair. My father is bald but other than that, no one else in my family is bald. My husband & I have noticed in the last 2-3 months that the hair right on the top of my head seems thinner, like more of my scalp is visible but I've been able to conceal it with my hairstyle. We looked at pictures from vacation in May & from 4th of July weekend & I didn't have this problem then so it basically started end of July, beginning of August. Now several things have happened:1. I started running in June & have lost about 12 pounds2. I had a stroke-like episode & was diagnosed with complex migraines & a PFO aka hole in my heart & that has really stressed me out3. Had poison ivy in July/August for the first time & was on steroids for 2 weeks4. I went off birth control 6 weeks ago and have yet to have a period.I know these can all be factors & I have an appt next Tuesday with a dermatologist but I'm terrified that she's going to tell me I'm going bald. Also, my scalp & back of my neck have been slightly itchy. Any input?",
