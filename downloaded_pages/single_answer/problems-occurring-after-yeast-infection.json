            "answer": "Hi,Pain in the penis, scrotum and groin can be due to prostate infection. It is rare for the infection in the prostate to be due to a fungal infection.Prostatitis is caused by an inflammation of the prostate and may be due to infection or irritation. This needs to be diagnosed on urinalysis, preferably from a sample collected immediately after ejaculation. Treatment is based on the antibiotic sensitivity of the organism and is for a longer course of 15-20 days.Try to avoid prostate irritants such as caffeine, alcohol, citrus fruits, and spicy foods, and drink plenty of fluids. Additionally, you will need to avoid sitting on hard surfaces or for prolonged periods of time.You will need to consult a dermatologist for your persistent skin complaints or switch to another antifungal ointment such as Canesten. Also have yourself tested for diabetes as fungal infections can occur more frequently in individuals with higher blood sugar.Do keep us posted on any further doubts in this regard.",

    "question": "A few months ago, I had sudden pain in which felt like the tract of my penis about once a week. I then noticed redness just below the head on my upper shaft. I decided to go the doctor and she immediately diagnosed it as a yeast infection. She gave me nystatin cream to use for two weeks and it worked for about a week. Then, it started to feel uncomfortable again. Also, I noticed a small red patch just under the head. I returned to the doctor exactly two weeks after my original visit, and she was unsure about the patch. She said that she would feel safe doing a blood test and a penile probe. I thought that an STD check was pretty much out of the question because I started having sex with my current girlfriend, now fiance, about 2 years ago and was virgin before that. She was thoroughly tested and is STD free. The tests came back negative and the doc recommended me to a urologist. However, now I never feel any pain, but it the urinary tract is still sensitive at times and that small red patch is still there in the same spot. It never has hurt when I urinate, but every now and then a while after I ejaculate, it feels pretty sensitive. What could this be?",
