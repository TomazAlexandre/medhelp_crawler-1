    "question": "Hi, I'm a 35 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0I'm very physically active - play tennis, spin, yoga, jog.\u00a0\u00a0Recently I noticed a few symptoms: Crossing my legs can cause my leg to start to fall asleep/tingling.\u00a0\u00a0Also, certain positions (such as yoga or just typing at computer) will cause tingling in my fingers.\u00a0\u00a0Once the position is changed the tingling goes away....but what concerns me is the frequency of these occurances which happen at least a few times throught the day within the past week or so.\u00a0\u00a0I do have some back/shoulder/neck discomfort (due to lifting a 1-year old) but cannot really call it back pain. My primary care physician is not very much concerned, thinks it may be a pinched nerve, and I am just to monitor for the next week or so.\u00a0\u00a0My question: is monitoring for the next week enough or do these symptoms call for testing now?\u00a0\u00a0What tests sound appropriate?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
