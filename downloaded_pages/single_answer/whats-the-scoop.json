            "answer": "Hi,All the drugs you have listed have been\u00a0\u00a0prescribed for different indications.The lisinopril and norvasc were for hypertension, Cartia XT was for hypertension and angina, and the crestor is for cholesterol.Do you smoke?It is possible that the cough you had while on lisinopril was due to the drug as that class of drugs have been known to cause cough, more so in Asian women.It is possible that you have an underlying medical condition other than those you have mentioned that is causing these other symptoms.Further evaluation is necessary before arriving at a diagnosis.Are you on any medication for the pre-diabetes?In the meantime, you can do the following:Start taking vitamin B-Complex supplements everyday.Increase intake of citrus fruit juices or foods high in Vitramin C.Take 2 capsules of Cod Liver oil twice daily for 1 month.Do not discontinue any medication for the hypertension and the cholesterol that has been prescribed without consulting your doctor first.It is imperative that you go back on the medication for hypertension and cholesterol ASAP.Do keep us posted on your progress.",
