    "question": "My husband has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Type II diabetes and reflux. He has heart disease in his family( an uncle and grandfather died from a heart attack and his dad had quadruple bypass). He is husky. He has been on Prilosec for years. Recently he has started having trouble swallowing his medicines. He also will get a tightness in his throat and vomit. It has mostly happened within an hour of waking. Occasionally it has been later in the day. He said he feels like pressure from his shirt hitting his adam's apple triggers it sometimes. The doctor upped his Prilosec to twice a day a little over a week ago. He did fine for a few days but he has vomited the last two mornings.",
