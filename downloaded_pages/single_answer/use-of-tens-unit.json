    "question": "My father suffered a stroke a few years ago. His stroke affected his nerves, he has a tingling, tight feeling on the left side of his body. (including his chest) He has tried many different types of drugs, none of them seem to help. He finds a few drinks and staying in bed to be the best option. I disagree. Recently someone I know showed me a tens unit she is using for nerve damage cause by diabetes. I started thinking maybe this might help. My father has talked to his doctor and she gave him the go ahead. We were wondering if you have any experience with this and how to find the best placement of the pads. Also is their a tens unit that works will for this?",
