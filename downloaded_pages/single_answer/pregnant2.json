            "answer": "Hi!Well, no contraceptive method is fool proof, however yes, chances of pregnancy after tubal burning/ligation are very less. But failures do occur. If in doubt, take a pregnancy test. If urine pregnancy test is negative then go for a blood pregnancy test. A blood HCG estimation test would be most reliable. If the test is negative then you are not pregnant. If it is borderline, repeat after a week to see if the levels are rising. Rising levels indicate pregnancy.Other possibilities of your symptoms can be PCOD, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and Cushing's. Please consult your gynecologist. Take care!",
