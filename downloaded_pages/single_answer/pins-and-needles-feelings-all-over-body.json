            "answer": "Hello Bigmoe,Welcome to the Pain Management Forum. I am sorry I am tardy with my response to you.In my opinion the feelings that you are experiencing are from the nerves being compressed and your possibly the diabetes effecting your nerve functioning. There are medications such as neurontin that can treat your symptoms. I suggest that you\u00a0\u00a0discuss this with your PCP.If you have additional questions please feel free to post again so send me a PM. Best of luck to you. I will look forward to your updates.Take Care,Tuck",
