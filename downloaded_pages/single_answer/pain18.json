            "answer": "Hi!Any abnormal sensation in lower extremities (legs or ankles\u2014which includes pain, cold legs or feet, crawling sensation etc) or in your arms while trying to sleep is usually due to \u2018restless leg syndrome\u2019(RLS) or restless arm syndrome. Usually cause of RLS is not known but few medications such as lithium, antidepressants and beta-blockers (such as bisoprolol) can trigger the symptoms. Other reasons of RLS could be rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, diabetes or any underlying heart disorder. In addition restless syndrome has been found to be associated with stress, fatigue, magnesium deficiency, vitamin B-12 deficiency, anemia and other systemic diseases. Though there is no permanent cure of RLS, regular & sound sleep helps get relief from symptoms. Supplements of iron/vitamin also help some. Sometimes medications such as levodopa, bromocriptine, oxycodone may be tried to provide some relief from the symptoms. Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may partly relieve your symptoms. Other useful measures are stretching, alternate hot and cold packs or baths, massage and applying vibrators on the arm or feet and legs before bedtime. Relaxation and meditation can also help. Do discuss this with your doctor\u00a0\u00a0and sleep specialist and get yourself examined. Take care!",
