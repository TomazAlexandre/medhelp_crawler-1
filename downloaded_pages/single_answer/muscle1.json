    "question": "My husband has a muscle jumping near his heart. He has COPD, CHF, and Diabetes. This jumping is not painful but it's annoying. I can lay my hand on it and feel it jump. This has been going on about 5 days now. The location is between his breast toward the left side. Is this something we should be concerned about?",
