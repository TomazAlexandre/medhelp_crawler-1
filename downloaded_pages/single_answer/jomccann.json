            "answer": "Hi Jomccan,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved appears to be originating from lower lumbar region (lower back region).This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your case it can be due to compressive or nutritional pathology causing these symptoms.I think you need a complete physical examination from a neurologist to rule out any pathological state.Hope this helps.Bye.",
