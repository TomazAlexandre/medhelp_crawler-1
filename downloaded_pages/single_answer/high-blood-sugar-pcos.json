    "question": "I recently saw a doctor who refered me to get looked at for PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0He also ran a bloodtest which came back with my blood sugar being high (129 i believe).\u00a0\u00a0I did not fast before this however. I ate a part of a fried sandwich approx. 4 hours before the test.\u00a0\u00a0Next week I have to take another blood test after fasting, then i have to eat and give another sample two hours later.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be related to PCOS, and should I be worried?\u00a0\u00a0Is it likely that the test was just off because I did not fast prior to the test.",
