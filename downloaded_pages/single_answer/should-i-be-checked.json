            "answer": "Hi Kathy O,I am only a volunteer here and have no medical training. I can only speak from my own experiences. As a Type 1 diabetic when I was first diagnosed my initial symptoms were excessive thirst and frequent urination. As far as the urine being a very dark color, I cannot be sure if this is a sign of diabetes. I am sorry but I am not familiar with the reactions chemo may have on your body or if this is a symptom of your treatment. My only suggestion would be to get in touch with your doctors and describe what you are feeling. I would let them decide what they think the next step should be. Make sure you mention that your father was a diabetic in his later years, that may impact their decisions. I wish you all the best!!!!!",

    "question": "I am two months out of Chemo treatment (OVCA) and have noticed that my Urine is a very dark color and I am constantly thirsty. I do not remember having these symptons before I was diagnosed with OVCA three years ago. Do you think that I should have a diabetes test or wait a while and see. I do drink alot of water and have a pretty good diet, cannot do alot of excercise yet. My father did have diabetes later in his life but not a lot of diabetes in my family. Thanks",
