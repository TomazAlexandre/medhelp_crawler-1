I have been on a low carb Diabetic diet for a week now, and have noticed some decrease in the movement of my baby. Two weeks ago I was feeling alot of flutter movements and now I barely feel any movement. I guess my question is, can my diet affect the movement of my baby. Thanks in advance for any advise.",
