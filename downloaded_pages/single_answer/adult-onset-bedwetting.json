            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Needless to say, this is an uncommon problem in adults. I fully empathize with you and ask you to seek medical help immediately from your doctor.The reasons could be stress, functionally small bladder, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, urinary bladder wall instability, UTI, stones and neurological problems. Cut down on your alcohol.I think you should discuss this with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. You will need to undergo a few tests to reach a diagnosis. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm 19 & have never had any bedwetting or bladder issues. I maybe wet the bed ONCE when I was around 9. For the past couple nights I have been wetting the bed and not even waking up until my alarm goes off and realizing I'm SOAKED. It's extremely embarrasing as I share the bed with my fiance. The first time it happened my fiance got really upset with me & I've been stressed about it ever since. I drink a lot of alcohol but I've never had bedwetting problems before these past couple days and I'm not drinking anymore than usual so I don't think the drinking is the problem. What the hell is going on?It may be relevant to mention that I have also been feeling weird for the past few weeks - loss of appetite, loose bms, shaky-dizziness, insomnia and fatigue. Could I just be so tired and stressed and drunk that when I need to urinate during the night my body just can't wake up?This discussion is related to/posts/show/916087.",
