            "answer": "Hi,Has your daughter been seen by a neurologist or rheumatologist to determine if she has another condition that is causing this? If not, I think she should first head to a rheumatologist in your area for an evaluation, and they can determine if she is best served by tendon releases or shots. I am afraid I do not personally know of an appropriate specialist in those regions. Your daughter's primary physician may be of more assistance as they will likely know of nearby specialists. Take care",
