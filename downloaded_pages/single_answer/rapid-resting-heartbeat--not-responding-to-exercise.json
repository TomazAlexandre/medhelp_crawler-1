            "answer": "Heart rates, particularly during and after exercise, though, are also highly sensitive to a person\u2019s hydration and nutrition status. Dehydration represents a state of diminished water supply in your body. Because circulating blood is composed of approximately 83 percent water, dehydration effectively lowers the amount of blood that your heart is able to circulate with one beat, or contraction. Your heart compensates for this low \"water\" volume by beating more times per minute.Occasionally, though, medical conditions and medications must also be considered if, in fact, your resting heart rate is truly high for your current age. High stress and anxiety or electrolyte imbalances are the most common conditions.There multiple factors that may explain why your heart rate seems high. As an individual who is unique, however, your resting heart rate and heart rate response to exercise may be entirely appropriate and normal for you. Regardless of the cause, it is important to raise this issue with your own doctor. Almost all of the causes of a fast resting heart rate are treated and reversible once the root causes are appropriately identified.Alcohol can definitely affect your heart rate. Changes in your body\u2019s autonomic tone can affect how frequently your palpitations occur, or how prominent the sensation is when they do occur (most of the time they are asymptomatic). Sometimes, the increased vagal tone after eating\u00a0\u00a0causes a slower heartbeat, which facilitates the premature beats.I hope this helps you understand what may be going on...hopefully things will resolve for you:)",

    "question": "so, i'm sure someone has asked this, but i couldn't find it.i have recurrent severe depression and anxiety stemming from PTSD. i did two stints on antDs with therapy, and feel good now. i've been antiD-free since march. i'm 6'1\", 185 lbs, 29, white, and i've had literally every cardiovascular and blood test available. some twice. findings are always negative for anything bad. i have no family history of stroke or heart attack, however, i do have family history of diabetes and psychological disease.i've always had a HR that recovered slowly from exertion, but now my resting HR is between 80 and 95. during sleep it falls to 65. my BP is normal to slightly low. i exercise almost every day, though, high-intensity and aerobic exercise. my HR spikes as soon as i start exercising, and can get as high as 190 when i'm wrestling or boxing. i never have shortness of breath while i'm training, and my HR comes down to about 110 in 3-4 minutes, but generally takes forever to fall any further than that (back to resting rate), and i feel racey the rest of the day. and have the sensation of being short of breath.i also experience palpitations after consuming alcohol or stuffing myself with food.i'm wondering why, after training for almost a year now after the bouts of depression and anxiety, by resting HR isn't coming down at all. i thought tests would show some kind of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but they didn't. i simply have a fast heart rate. what the heck?",
