            "answer": "Hi there!Well, ejaculation is more of psychological and autonomic response than a physical one.\u00a0\u00a0A few possible causes could be psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal/ endocrinal imbalance, low serotonin levels, autonomic dysfunction, metabolic disorders, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. I would suggest trying to relax about the situation and getting rid of the factors such as smoking drugs etc, if involved. If this does not seem to help you may consider an evaluation by a primary care physician or a urologist for an evaluation and appropriate managementHope this helps.Take care!",
