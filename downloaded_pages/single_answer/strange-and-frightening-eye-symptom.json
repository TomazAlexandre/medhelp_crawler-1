    "question": "This scared me to death but seemed to resolve on its own. I was squatting in the garden for a long time, got up quickly and almost immediately, something happened in my right eye. I noticed a vision change and tried closing my eye to clear it. With my eye closed, I saw a small, very bright white circle grow bigger, the way a flame tip burns through paper in a circle from the center out. It terrified me, but when I opened and reclosed my eye, the bright white started to fill in with a dark red, then all the way to normal blackness. I wondered if I had a small stroke in my eye, from cutting off the circulation in my legs. My vision is OK now in the right eye and all signs of the bright white are gone. Any idea what might have caused this phenomenon? I am 55 and was recently diagnosed with Type II Diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0but my numbers are excellent and I saw the eye doctor last week who performed a number of tests and found no retinapathy. Thank you for your help!",
