            "answer": "Hi,Based on your OGTT you have some mild glucose handling abnormalities(glucose intolerance) but not diabetes. It is possible that some of your symptoms are due to this rise and fall in blood sugar after you eat, in which case you should try to have small mixed meals throughout the day instead of large ones and/or carb-heavy meals.Some other common things to check include thyroid function tests and blood counts for anemias. Be sure to have a good general examination by your doctor as well as basic labwork. If you have any lightheadedness or palpitations, a holter monitor may also be useful.Stay in good contact with your doctor about this one. I am afraid I can be only of limited help given that I cannot examine you or review your medical history. But those suggestions above are a good start.As an aside, if you have any of these spells while driving please pull over immediately. No need to take an unnecessray risk.Take care.",
