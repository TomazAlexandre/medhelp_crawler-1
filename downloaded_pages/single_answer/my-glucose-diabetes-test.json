    "question": "I'm 27 weeks ftm and my son will be here January 31. I just had my glucose test yesterday morning at 8am. Everything went fine and hopefully they don't call me. Those of you that havent taken your test yet I strongly advise you get Netflix on your smartphone cause it keeps your mind off the nausea. The only worse part that happened to me was the nurse moved the needle in my vein",
