            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The probable cause for the twitching could be neuropathy, a disorder of the nerves. Most common cause for neuropathy is diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It can also be due to metabolic disorders, vitamin deficiencies, infections and traumatic injuries. Other causes for cramps are injury, repetitive activity and dehydration. It could also be due to your medications.

    "question": "Recently, I've had an increase in muscle cramps and spasms. I do twitch (possibly myclonic seizures) from time to time, specifically in my arms and hands, sometimes it starts in my shoulders and radiates down my arms if that makes sense. It's like when you shiver when you go from a hot room to a cold room. But these new cramps is something I've never had before. My hands will painfully contract and it takes a few seconds for them to uncramp, and when ever I stretch my legs, nine out of ten times, I will get a charliehorse in my calfs. I've also had an issue with jaw clenching in my sleep. I do have a bite guard to prevent damage to my teeth, thankfully, but this morning I was clenching my jaw so hard that the pain actually woke me up and it took me about ten minutes to fully unclench my and relax my jaw. I am on Keppra since I do have seizures on my right temporal lobe, and I'm on Adderall since I may have a sleep disorder and for concentration purposes. Do you have any idea what might be causing these cramps?Thanks for your help.Also, I don't know if this is connected but shortly after I started getting these cramps, I've also started waking up between 4-6am everyday, and I can't fall back asleep. I do have Xanax to help me with sleep, but I don't take it regularly since it's not good to mix adderall with Xanax.",
