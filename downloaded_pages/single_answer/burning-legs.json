            "answer": "We hear this particular complaint all the time.\u00a0\u00a0The toes on my right foot burn frequently.This is called a paresthesia and is VERY common in MS.\u00a0\u00a0If you haven't read it, there is a Health Page called, \"Paresthesias - Things that Go Buzz in the Night\"http://www.medhelp.org/health_pages/Multiple%20Sclerosis/Paresthesias---Things-That-Go-BUZZ-in-the-Night/show/378?cid=36It can help you understand how and why these things happen.Another HP that discusses this is the one on Nerve (Neuropathic) Pain.\u00a0\u00a0The burning you feel is often more painful than just weird.http://www.medhelp.org/health_pages/Multiple%20Sclerosis/Nerve-Neuropathic-Pain---A-Primer/show/371?cid=36A side note:\u00a0\u00a0A \"burning\" paresthesia is quite common in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It wouldn't hurt to have your PCP check for this just to make sure.And, since there is a chance that your doctor will treat you for this pain if it is severe enough, then it would help to read the HP (written by a pain management doc) on Treating Nerve Pain.\u00a0\u00a0He describes some very important things to know when you start these meds!http://www.medhelp.org/health_pages/Multiple%20Sclerosis/General-Principles-of-Treating-Neuropathic-Nerve-Pain/show/452?cid=36Quix",
