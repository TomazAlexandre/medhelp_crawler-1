            "answer": "Any chest discomfort that is experienced with exertion and associated with symptoms such as shortness of breath, jaw/neck/arm pain, sweating, nausea is concerning. If there are other medical risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, history of smoking, or a family history for heart disease, the suspicion for having a heart condition is heightened. If this has been happening on a continual basis then I would suggest further evaluation by your regular doctor for a thorough history and physical. However, there are a number of other conditions that can cause chest discomfort (muscle/skin disorders, lung problems, GI issues, etc), which must be carefully considered in the clinical context.",
