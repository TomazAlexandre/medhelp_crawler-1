            "answer": "Hi,Hba1c of 6.1 is too high for a child.\u00a0\u00a0Normal Hba1c is < 5.0.Normal fasting is 70 - 90 range (but typically in low 80s).\u00a0\u00a0normal post eating is < 120.Is your son overweight?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any history of diabetes in your family?If you son is overweight, this may be type 2 diabetes (unfortunately getting more common in kids).\u00a0\u00a0If he is not overweight, this may be early type 1 diabetes (autoimmune).\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor is willing, ask him to test your son for type 1 diabetes (they can test antibodies).\u00a0\u00a0Also ask them to test c-peptide along with fasting blood glucose (this will tell if his insulin levels are high, normal or low, and can give indication as to the type of diabetes he has).In any case, he needs to be watched closely.\u00a0\u00a0I think you should buy (or have prescribed) a blood sugar meter and strip to be used at home.Testing his fasting blood sugar a few times a week.\u00a0\u00a0Testing 1 1/2 - 2 hours after starting eating also a few times a week so you can see what is happening.\u00a0\u00a0By doing this you may see which meals make his blood sugars high and which meals have minimum effect (and then focus on eating foods that have least effect).His diet should be lower carb (avoid processed carbs and sweets) and focus on meats, veges, nuts, dairy etc.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid fruit juices and sweetened drinks. Keep his diet as unprocessed and natural as possible.Take this opportunity to learn about diabetes and it's management.\u00a0\u00a0You may need this information.\u00a0\u00a0 Particularly read up on symptoms of type 1, because it can develop very quickly and become life-threatening if not caught early.hope this helps.",
