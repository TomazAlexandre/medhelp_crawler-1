            "answer": "Hi!The spotting can be due to hormonal contraceptive you are using or it could be due to the contraceptive not suiting you, as is possible if you have thyroid problems or PCOD. Sex for the first time also is likely to cause frictional injury which can cause spotting.I suggest you consult a gynecologist to find out the cause. Often, a change in prescription of the pill helps control this. You may also need tests to rule out anemia, diabetes, thyroid disorders, and PCOD.Take care!",
