            "answer": "Hi,It would be best to discuss this with the doctor seeing the patient. Cancers tend to make the blood easier to clot and hence, there may be a higher risk for DVT and stroke. The GI bleed may actually be swallowed blood if there is blood being coughed out of the lung from the cancer. There are also some cases that the lung cancer can involve the esophagus and there may be bleeding from there. It is also important to remember that many patients who get cancer are also senior citizens, so the presence of other diseases such as hypertension and diabetes may also influence the presentation of the other conditions you mentioned. Stay positive.",
