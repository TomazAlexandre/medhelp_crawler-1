    "question": "I have read the other questions regarding teenagers with diabetes with behavioral issues. My son is having significant issues with anger, depression, oposition, defiance, lack of interest or motivation in school, drug use. We have him in counseling, have him seeing a Psy. for medication management, and switched him to a Christian school. None of this has worked. We are desperately looking for a boys ranch or residential treatment program that can help him. Does any one know of such a place?",
