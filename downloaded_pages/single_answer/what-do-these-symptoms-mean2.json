            "answer": "Hello,Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but are often felt in your hands, feet, arms, or legs. They are called parasthesias.Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Apart from these many other causes of numbness in the leg are there. These include injury to the back or spinal cord, Lack of blood supply to the legs as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels and abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing paraesthesias are rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Take care and do keep us posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "about 2 months ago I started having numbness in my left thigh. It would only happen when I went to bed at night. If I laid on my left side, (the way I sleep) it got worse. About 1 month ago, my left knee started to hurt. It would seem to go away if I would walk a bit. Two weeks ago the bottom of my feet started tingling. (This happened only once and has not happened again) I went to my doctor and I'm waiting for the results of a blood test. I now have the numbness in my thigh, and pain in my knee all the time. It's painful to try and walk down stairs and I feel unsteady when I get up out of a chair, etc.",
