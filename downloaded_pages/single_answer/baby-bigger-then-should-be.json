    "question": "Was anyone else told that there baby was larger then they were supposed to be? We were told our baby was 11oz when he's supposed to be 8.5oz and that they want to do ultrasounds every 4 weeks to monitor his growth, anyone else has this issue and what was your outcome? Also should add that we know we're not further along then we thought, so that's not the issue, also no gestational diabetes. Did you need to deliver earlier, was the baby really big?",
