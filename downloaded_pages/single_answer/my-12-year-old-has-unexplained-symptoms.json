            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!Well from your description, it looks like he has low thyroid functions or hypothyroidism. This can be easily detected by a blood test. The symptoms vary from person to person. By your son being chilly, I assume he feels cold even at a temperature you are comfortable or hot.There could also be a chance of chronic infection like TB of intestines. He should also be tested for diabetes and worms in his stool. What is more important is the duration for which he has had the symptoms. In hypothyroidism even the family history is important.Hope this will help you reach a diagnosis with the help of your doctor. Otherwise please let us know some more details about his medical history.Do keep writing and let us know the result of the tests. All the best!",
