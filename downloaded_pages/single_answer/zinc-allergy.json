            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Today, highly purified human insulin preparations have made allergy to insulin shots a rare occurrence. If you have been tested for the cause of allergy and it is diagnosed not to be due to the insulin molecule but due to zinc then you may benefit from zinc free insulin (insulin glulisine). Otherwise, desensitization can be tried and you can be put on anti-histamines for some time.Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
