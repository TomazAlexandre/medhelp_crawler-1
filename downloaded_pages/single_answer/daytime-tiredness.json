            "answer": "Few things to ask yourself about your cpap treatment... If you are not using a full face mask, could you be breathing out of your mouth thus losing your treatment before it can do its job and keep your airways open? How long have you been using cpap, because it can take weeks or months to recover from years of untreated apnea. Do you have a data capable machine that confirms your pressure is adequate? If not, your could ask your doctor about a 2 week trial on an auto titrating machine to see if you need a pressure change. It is great that you are able to get a decent night's sleep and have adjusted to cpap well.Aside from your sleep apnea, are you getting an adequate number of hours sleep each night? Have you been evaluated medically for other possible energy thiefs, like problems with the thyroid, diabetes, anemia, hormone imbalances, or nutritional deficiencies?Did your sleep study results mention limb movements? Some people have limb movements that make their sleep unrestful.You have done the major thing - treating your sleep apnea. Hope you are able to finish the puzzle pieces and feel rested soon.",
