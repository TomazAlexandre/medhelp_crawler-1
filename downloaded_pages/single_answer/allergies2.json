            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!This is generally due to severe acidity or GERD. Several medications are available to control this. Hiatal hernia of the stomach into the diaphragm too can present this way. At times diabetes too has this type of presentation.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Over the counter antacids should solve your problem to some extent. Omeprazole too is a good drug for this. Please discuss this with your doctor and see what he thinks about it. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I don't know if this has anything to do with allergies or not, but for the last couple of weeks I've had a weird feeling like\u00a0\u00a0I can't get a deep breath, like the air is really heavy or something.\u00a0\u00a0It's the worst when I lie down.\u00a0\u00a0Everytime I lie down, I have this pressure in my head, and I have to keep shifting to lessen it.\u00a0\u00a0Even when I'm sitting I have to make sure my neck is tilted back because if I tilt it forward it feels like there's something stuck in my throat and the pressure in my head gets worse.\u00a0\u00a0The last couple of days I've been getting dizzy spells, too, and a little queasy.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what the deal is.\u00a0\u00a0I've never had this problem before, and I can't even remember the last time I was sick with anything.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
