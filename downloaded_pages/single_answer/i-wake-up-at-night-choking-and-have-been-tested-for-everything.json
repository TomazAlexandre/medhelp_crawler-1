This can happen with cardiac disorders or lung disorders.\u00a0\u00a0In cardiac disorders there is inadequate pumping\u00a0\u00a0of blood and in lung disorders there is inadequate oxygenation. It could also be due peripheral arterial blood disorders. Symptoms are usually aggravated with exercise in cardiac disorders. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension can cause these symptoms.

Discuss these options with your consulting doctor.Hope This Helped and Do Keep Us Posted!!",

    "question": "I wake up at night unable to breathe choking, a few times I even passed out waking up ion the ER from lack of oxygen. I have been tested for Apnea and ruled it our, checked for Gerd ruled out though not 100% and I do taked meds plus watch diet don't eat hrs before bed etc. This has been going on since childhood. Doctors see it on video during test in hospital and the most common reply is \"HOLY COW I NEVER SEEN ANYTHINHG LIKE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS\" then I am dismissed and told I don't know how to help. I have been to pulmonary, Neuro, sleep and even cardiac doctors no help. It is getting worse, I now have other issues like cardiac problems and these episodes take a lot out of me plus have my family scared to death everytime I go to sleep to the point my 7 and 11 year olds check on me in the middle of the night!\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone else ever experienced such an issue and has anyone ever gotten an answer for it?\u00a0\u00a0I am desperate for help I am afraid this will kill me and I can no longer deal with doctors who say they can help but hit a wall and just tell me to move on though they have seen it themselves I am afraid to sleep at night.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We tried a CPAP meds to maybe help loosen phlem etc even surgery just in hopes it will help",
