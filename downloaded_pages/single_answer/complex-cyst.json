    "question": "I recently was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a 33 yr. old female.\u00a0\u00a0My endo ordered an ultra sound of my thyroid and it revealed a 10mm complex cyst. I also have swollen lymph nodes, but it's minimal.\u00a0\u00a0I Consulted a surgeon for biopsy, but it's too small.\u00a0\u00a0My father died at 51 from anaplastic thyroid cancer.\u00a0\u00a0In the tumor they also found follicular cancer that probably went undetected for many years.\u00a0\u00a0He had a thorough health exam at 50.\u00a0\u00a0During the surgery his original biopsy also came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0I realize that I am very hyper sensitive to this, but I kinda want the complex cyst out and biopsied.\u00a0\u00a0My question is ...does this sound unreasonable?\u00a0\u00a0should I just continue to have ultrasounds done every 6 mths?",
