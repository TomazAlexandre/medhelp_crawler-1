            "answer": "Hi Shishir,What exactly is the problem he encounters while walking? Is it limb weakness or numbness?Does he bend forwards while walking? Is there any swelling on his feet?If it was a diabetic neuropathy he would have tingling numbness in his feet which you say is not there.Maybe it is an orthopedic problem. I am afraid but your father needs to undergo a complete physical examination. So please schedule an appointment with a physician as soon as you can.",

Do you check his sugars at any other time of day? Given he is on insulin especially, I would suggest checking it atleast two other times(including bedtime to be sure he is okay before going to bed).In terms of the walking problem, it can be from years of diabetes or form another issue that may be somewhat unrelated. If he is having trouble walking and does not have an obvious injury, I suggest speaking with a neurologist to see if this is neuropathy related to his diabetes, or perhaps another condition.Hope this helps, take care.",
