            "answer": "Hi!I can understand your apprehensions. However, since there have been two mishaps, you need to consult your doctor to find out the cause. You must investigate the causes of abortion in second trimester like chromosomal abnormalities; infections like listeria, rickettsia, toxoplasma, mycoplasma, viral infections (herpes, rubella, CMV, HbAv), local infections (cervicitis, endometritis) and malaria; cervical dilatation; multiple pregnancies; leiomyomas, fibroids and anomalies of uterus; diabetes; hypertension; smoking; renal diseases; polycystic ovary; hormonal disturbances; and in some cases the cause is not known.You need a comprehensive investigation taking all these points in consideration. Some tests you have already had. Please discuss this with your gynecologist and get yourself investigated accordingly. Take care!",
