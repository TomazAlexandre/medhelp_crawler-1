    "question": "I had sex with a prostitute a few months ago. We had protected vaginal sex and I do not think the condom broke or had any problems. What really concerns me is that I fingered her deep in her vagina even touching her cervix (and I read that cervical secretions contain a high concentration of HIV) and then I immediately put the finger that I fingered her with into my mouth and was definitively able to taste her vaginal fluid. Also, my gums tend to bleed sometimes when I brush my teeth. All this considered, how high do you think my risk of getting infected is?I\u2019ve become even more concerned about this recently because I went to the doctor to see if I had a urinary tract infection, and I was told that I had protein in my urine and it is not from a urinary tract infection or diabetes. I read online that it could be a sign of HIV, and that made me really scared.",
