            "answer": "Hi!Increased monocyte count or monocytosis is seen in subacute bacterial endocarditis, syphilis (test for this as you are having rashes and weight loss),\u00a0\u00a0viral infections, kala azar, malaria, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, IBS, lipid storage diseases, sarcoidosis etc. Hence it is important to get a comple autoimmune panel and a STD panel. Also, you should test for mold infection. Systemic fungal infection is possible such as Candidiasis, Aspergillosis, Histoplasmosis, Blastomycosis, and Coccidioidomycosis. However these are seen in immunocompromised patients such as those on chemotherapy, dialysis, renal dysfunction, HIV, or other STDs or in patients with diabetes. Rarely this is seen in healthy individuals. Early diagnosis of systemic fungal infection is possible through Sandwich ELISA for circulating galactomannan, and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Test for diabetes too. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
