    "question": "Now, it was only the last few weeks or so I've had them. At first, I had been wearing some Pajama's that seemingly rubbed their blue coloring off on my legs, as it washed off quite easily.Odd thing is, it keeps appearing, despite me not wearing them anymore. Weirder still, is the fact that if I wash them with hot or cold water, it'll actually turn back to normal color. The wash cloth even had blue coloring on it. What I don't understand is, almost my entire back foot was blue...but it rubbed out with water onto the cloth?Now, I'm over-weight, I know that. I also drink probably 3 cans of soda a day, one every 4 or so hours, I thought that's really not that bad, but maybe...Anyways, I have all the requirements for diabetes, I know that...but I've still never heard of Blue Feet that can be washed off. When someone saw them, they said I might have diabetes, but then I showed them I could wash it off...(Only to return later...odd, eh?)I've come in contact with nothing with blue coloring or anything with coloring really for the past few weeks. I am quite confused and concerned.If this is the wrong area, I apologize, if so, please appoint me to the correct area. Thank you.",
