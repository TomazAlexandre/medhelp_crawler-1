    "question": "Since Thanksgiving '09 I have had two fainting \"episodes\" and I am starting to get really concerned. When I was in the first grade it happened repeatedly, but my teacher was convinced I was trying to get attention (even though it would happen whether there was anyone there to witness it or not) so it was never dealt with. I'm 28 now and after an MRI and some blood work, there is no conclusion. But the doc wants to take my driving privileges. I get why, but that doesn't make it any easier. Both times it has happened recently it started with me feeling extremely hot all of a sudden, then nauseous, then dizzy, then I wake up on the floor (face down and injuries to my face and head). The whole thing takes less than five minutes to progress to the fainting. Both times it happened I had a sort of euphoric feeling upon coming to, then immediately felt like my whole body was glued down. I couldn't move or get up for a while (I do not know how long, but I estimate 10-15 minutes). Once I was standing up, once I was seated in a kitchen chair. The doc ruled out: 1. Anemia, 2. Diabetes, 3. Pregnancy, 4. Epilepsy, 5. Thyroid disease/disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone out there help me? Has anyone ever experienced this? Does anyone know if the culprit behind by life being turned inside out even has a name?",
