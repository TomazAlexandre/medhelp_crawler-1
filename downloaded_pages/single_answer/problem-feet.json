            "answer": "Hi,' Soak frostbitten areas in warm (not hot) water. Continue until you have regained sensation and movement in the afflicted region; this often follows great pain as the nerves thaw. Never rub, slap or shake the stricken region as ice crystals in the frostbitten skin will damage surrounding tissue. Follow the treatment with a period of constant warmth: refreezing following thawing worsens the damage.'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite'Factors that contribute to frostbite include extreme cold, wet clothes, wind chill, and poor circulation. This can be caused by tight clothing or boots, cramped positions, fatigue, certain medications, smoking, alcohol use, or diseases that affect the blood vessels, such as diabetes.''People susceptible to frostbite should wear woolen socks/gloves/caps in extreme cold. For frostbite in the feet, keeping feet in warm saline water will provide relief. Diabetes can also sometimes lead to frostbite, so diabetics should take precautions as to avoid trips to ice-cold places.'Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "Hi, my problems are with my feet. Every winter I seem to be getting little bumps on my toes. They look purpelish. I have cold feet most of the time but my feet do sweat. I have tried 2 pairs of socks and have had different creams from the doctor. I think because my feet are sweating but always cold it is almost something like frostbite. Any other person having this problem. They also hurt. Thanks",
