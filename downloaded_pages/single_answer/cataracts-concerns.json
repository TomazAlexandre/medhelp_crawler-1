            "answer": "Your father is under-going the most common and successful operation done on adults. In the USA there are over 2,000,000 cataract/IOL operations each year. The chance of a complication (not loss of eye) is about 2-5% based on factors I cannot determine in a forum like this. The chance of loss of the eye is perhaps one in 7 or 8 thousand.How well he sees will generally be determined by whether the eye has other problems such as diabetes, macular degeneration, glaucoma, amblyopia, etc.The bionic implants have great promise but limited applicatbility are are almost never needed after cataract/IOL surgery.He should be up and back to his old self within a day or two after surgery. It will take about 4-6 weeks to know the final result.JCH III MD",
