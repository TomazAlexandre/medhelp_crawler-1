    "question": "I have been watching this forum, and also put a post on this forum, and was told that an Endocrinologist is NOT the kind of expert doctor that I needed.\u00a0\u00a0 I stated that I have gained a substantial amount of weight and have hypothyroidism, and that my Endo thought my cortisol levels would be extremely high.\u00a0\u00a0The only test she did was a 24 hr. urine test, which showed my cortisol levels were extremely LOW.\u00a0\u00a0But I have all the symptoms of them being high.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that I needed a lot more tests, and I needed to see an expert.I thought an Endo WAS the expert?\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know what kind of doctor I need?\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any response, especially if you know what kind of doctor I need to go to.\u00a0\u00a0 My PCP is clueless.Thank you.",
