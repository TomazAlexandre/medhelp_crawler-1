            "answer": "Thanks for your question.Vardenafil (Levitra) is a PDE-5 Inhibitor oral medication which can be an alternative; however, sildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil, and tadalafil (cialis) appear to be equally effective[1-7].You can also go for other alternatives such as :Intrapenile injection therapy with alprostadil delivers the drug via an injection directly into the penis. It takes about 10 minutes to work and lasts for about 30 minutes. Although nearly 90% of men using intrapenile alprostadil reported erections about six months after therapy, most men are not willing to inject themselves regularly, so the treatment is not often used for long periods of time[8-12].IIntraurethral alprostadil (MUSE) which is a medicated pellet about that is inserted into the urethra through the opening at the tip of the penis using a disposable plastic applicator. Like the oral medications, it, too, stimulates blood flow into the penis; an erection typically occurs within 10 minutes after insertion of the pellet, and can last for 30 to 60 minutes. About 40% of men have reported successfully achieving erections after using this drug, but the results are often inconsistent [13].Before starting any medication, please consult your doctor and discuss the side effects and contraindications related to the drug.Sincerely,Ash Tewari, MDhttp://www.cornellroboticprostate.orgThis forum is for information only.
