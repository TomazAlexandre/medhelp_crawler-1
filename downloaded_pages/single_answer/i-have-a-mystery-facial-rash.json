            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for writing in this forum.Without examination,confirmation of a diagnosis is tough ,but it sounds like seborrheic dermatitis. Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition that causes flaky,dry, white to yellowish scales to form on oily areas esp under the nose or anywhere on face. You can treat flaking and dryness with over-the-counter dandruff or medicated shampoos. Shampoo the hair vigorously and frequently (preferably daily). Active ingredients in these shampoos include salicylic acid, coal tar, zinc, resorcin, ketoconazole, or selenium.However other possibilities can be dermatitis or eczema, fungal infections or systemic diseases like diabetes or peripheral nerve diseases.If the symptoms persist,then it would be best to get it confirmed from a dermatologist.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",
