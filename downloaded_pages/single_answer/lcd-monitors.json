            "answer": "I'm looking at an LcD screen now. If they caused cataracts, I wouldn't use one and ophthalmologists would be seeing a flood of cataracts in young people which we are not. I don't know for sure whether these screens emit UV but I doubt it. Your eye strain is caused by either being undercorrected for near vision or by staring at the screen so long your eyes get dry. Try some ocular lubricants not Visine or Murine.Starbursting exists to some degree in all optical systems in air. Look at any photo of lights at night. Cataracts can cause \"halos\" or \"starbursting\" because they are degrading the optics of the eye. What you are describing may or may not be cataracts.",
