            "answer": "Hello,Frequent urination in adults can be due to many causes. The primary cause which needs to be excluded is diabetes. I would advise you to get a fasting blood sugar and Hb A1 C test done.If diabetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are pregnancy, interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome neurological diseases, urinary incontinence, bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction .I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "I am a generally healthy 20 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0For about five months now, I have had sudden episodes where I suddenly need to urinate instantly and frequently.\u00a0\u00a0My urine is colorless and odorless during these episodes (normally it is an obvious shade of yellow).\u00a0\u00a0There is no pain when I urinate.\u00a0\u00a0The frequency ranges from every fifteen minutes to about an hour.\u00a0\u00a0These can last for an hour for up to 4 days long.\u00a0\u00a0Putting up with this is getting exhausting.\u00a0\u00a0I've been checked for a UTI, but nothing came up positive (although there was apparently trace amounts of blood in my urine).\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, my lower abdomen feels swollen and heavy, like it is pressing on my bladder. Just as suddenly as it shows up, it goes away.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?",
