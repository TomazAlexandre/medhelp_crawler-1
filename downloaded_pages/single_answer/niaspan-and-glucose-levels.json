    "question": "Hi,I take Niaspan in an effort to raise HDL cholesterol..There is no history of diabetes in my family, though there is heart disease...I'm 36, 5'10 149 lbs, non-smoker, & excercise regularly...I do drink alot of soft drinks (7 cans a day), but isn't the old adage you can't get diabetes from eating too much sugar?..Anyway, in past, my typical fasting glucose readings were between 76-85..On recent lab, it was fasting glucose of 94, my MD wasn't concerned, I was only because it was my first fasting reading the the 90's...I take the maximum dosage of the Niaspan (2000mgls.), and did read Niaspan can cause increase in glucose levels..Is it possible for Niaspan (or any drug) to cause diabetes in & of itself?....I know I consume alot of soda, but I've been doing that over a decade now & I am more concerned about the Niaspan since I take the maximum dosage of it...Is there any long term studies correlating Niaspan to diabetes?..Thanks",
