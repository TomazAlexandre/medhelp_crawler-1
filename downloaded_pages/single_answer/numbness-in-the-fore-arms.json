            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!With a history of diabetes it is possible that you have peripheral neuropathies. This can cause numbness. It can also be due to Vit B12 deficiency. Please consult your doctor regarding this. If the diabetes is not under control, bringing it under control will take care of the neuropathy. Please consult your diabetes specialist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
