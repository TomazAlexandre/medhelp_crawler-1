            "answer": "Hi!A generalized burning sensation could be due to stress and anxiety at school\u2014maybe because you cannot cope up with studies, peer group or teachers.Generalized feeling of a burning sensation can be due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. This would need a comprehensive investigation.Drink plenty of fluids and water. Keep a trough of water or use a humidifier at home in your rooms. You can apply petroleum jelly and glycerine on your face and body at bed time. When choosing a moisturizer, look for oil-based creams and ointments. Fresh juice of tomato, cucumber and orange can be applied.If these tips do not help, chances are that the dryness is due to underlying skin conditions like dermatitis, psoriasis etc. Vitamin A deficiency, hypothyroidism, Sjogren's syndrome, and diabetes too can cause dry skin.It is difficult to diagnose the cause on net. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
