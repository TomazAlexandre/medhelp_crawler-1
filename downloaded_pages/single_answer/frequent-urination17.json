    "question": "Hi,I recently have the frequent urination and just 2 days ago, the urge is getting worse. I still feel the urge to urinate even though I have just done so. My bladder was removed years back due to gallstones. I have also been diagnosed with diabetes but have since been off medication as my sugar level is back to normal. I am afraid that my sugar level might shot up again as the symptoms is like leading to it. What could possibly be the problem?",
