            "answer": "Hi Tigerlily,I take a direutic for high blood pressure and this makes my body lose water weight.\u00a0\u00a0However, I do have to be careful and make sure that I am taking vitamins and minerals.\u00a0\u00a0 Direutics\u00a0\u00a0tend to eliminate important minerals from the body.\u00a0\u00a0Without these minerals, I would cramp.\u00a0\u00a0The last post was a good idea.\u00a0\u00a0Not every diet suggested is healthy or will work for every body type. We are so unique. I would suggest getting your hormone levels checked also.\u00a0\u00a0A good book about the importance of hormone levels is \"The Sexy Years\" by Suzanne Somers.\u00a0\u00a0I read it, to be informed.\u00a0\u00a0I am in my early 40's.I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

    "question": "I have had trouble as I get older, 62, to loose weight and the last time I lost 40 pounds (1991)went to a diet doctor and succeeded. He gave me water pills but told me that because I have keytones in my blood that in order for me to lose the weight that I have to eat three balance meals daily.\u00a0\u00a0I never knew that ketones means diabetes. No one ever told me this until I began to read for the first time today what you have on your boards and found it very interesting and scary.24 hr fitness wanted me to go on a almost 1600 calories diet but I am not use to eating this much because alot of it is eating their Apex cookies that have lots of calories in one cookie.\u00a0\u00a0I try and stay away from sweets because of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor did blood work on me and everything came out in the normal range like a glucose random test and my result was 93mg/dl and the range is 60 to 159.\u00a0\u00a0Urine glucose,blood,nitrites,ketones and all were negative and clean.I am 5 ft 8 and right now weigh 180 without my shoes on. My waist is now 38 inches around and that scares me alot.\u00a0\u00a0The bad thing is that there are no diet doctors here in Modesto area or around it and therefore besides exercising, it is an impossibility in what to do now. Everyone is telling me to do their diet but I am afraid because they do not give water pills that help me a lot in losing the weight.\u00a0\u00a0Without them I am loosing this battle of the bulge.I eat fruit and veggies and sometimes chicken, turkey, fish, tuna, and things like that. Can you suggest what I should do to drop 35 pounds from now till October 2006?",
