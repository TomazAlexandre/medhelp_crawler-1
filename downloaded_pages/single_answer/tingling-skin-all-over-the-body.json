    "question": "Hi, over the past 2 days i have had a tingling (almost numb-like) sensation all over my body. The feeling is kind of static-like and when i touch something it can feel the sensation last longer than it would normally. It is not necessarily painful but it does bother me. I am not taking any medications, however i have been taking pre workouts weeks before. I also read something about a B12 vitamin deficiency and how that could be the cause of it. I have also been under stress being a psychology student and suffering from what i think is psychology student syndrome. I am truly trying to figure the cause of this and whether or not it is a serious problem.Please let me know what you think, and thank you in advance.",
