            "answer": "What were your blood glucose readings when you were told this? The fasting blood sugar readings are 100-125 pre-diabetic, 126 or higher diabetic. What did the doctor tell you? It sounds like he just handed you some pills with no information. Do you test your blood sugar at home? Have you made changes to diet and exercise. You really need more information. I would make an appointment with your doctor. Insulin resistance is a characteristic of Type 2 diabetes (by the way this is a Type 1 forum, which is another sort of diabetic condition)",
