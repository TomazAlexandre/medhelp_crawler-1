            "answer": "Do your extremeties feel swollen? Preeclampsia makes your hands feet and face swell... I had it with my first but have been good thus far with my second... other signs of preeclamspia are severe headache, change in vision like seeing stars or blurred vision... also you can go to a pharmacy like walgreens or CVS and check your blood pressure and call Dr if its high... good luck mamaPS do you weigh yourself daily or weekly? Preeclampsia usually causes a 5+ lb weight gain in a week or less so if its been a steady build and not sudden it could just be regular weight gain... with my first I only gained 20 the whole time but with this one I'm 28.1 weeks and have already gained 24 but have actually been healthier this time than last",
