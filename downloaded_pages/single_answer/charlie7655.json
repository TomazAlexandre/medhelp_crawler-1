            "answer": "Hi Charlie,Well to begin with you are anemic, according to your lab work. This would explain the way you are feeling. See a hematologist right away. Once you have given him/her your health history and that of your family he/she will tell you if a visit to a nephrologist is in order. Understand, that anemia left untreated is dangerous. It can and will effect other organs and can cause irriversible dementia.",
