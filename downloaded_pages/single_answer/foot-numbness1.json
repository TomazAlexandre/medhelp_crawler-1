            "answer": "You need a thorough examination by an M.D. and should get one within the next month. I have no idea what caused your numbness, but the most likely candidate is diabetes and you have classical symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Generally an insulin clamp procedure or glucose fasting test and an EMG test would be required. I urge you to see a physician as soon as possible because the consequences of untreated diabetes are very real.",
