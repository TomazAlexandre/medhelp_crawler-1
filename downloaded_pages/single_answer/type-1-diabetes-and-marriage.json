            "answer": "I think it is sad that your parents want you to reject the person you love because he has Type 1 diabetes. I don't have statistics for you, but you can easily search for them. Complications (including sexual dysfunction) are NOT inevitable for a type 1 diabetic. What is important in order to avoid complications is that we control our blood sugar to the best extent possible. Complications occur from a long period of time spent at high blood sugars-not from an occasional high which happens to us all. If your boyfriend works with a doctor to determine his insulin doses, counts his carbs (and limits carb intake), exercises and tests his blood sugar regularly he is managing his diabetes. I assume you know him well enough to know how well he does this. You might want to educate yourself about diabetes control, target blood sugars, etc so that you can support his diabetes management. There are no guarentees but if he manages his condition he has a good chance to avoid complications and live a long and happy life. Perhaps your boyfriend can take you along at his next endo appointment and you can ask his doctor about your concerns. Your parents are obviously ignorant about diabetes and need to educate themselves.",
