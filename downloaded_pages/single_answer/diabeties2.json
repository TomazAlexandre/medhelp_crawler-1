            "answer": "My Dad tried that \"Gin soaked Raisin\" remedy, and he did NOT have any diabetes nor blood sugar issues, and it did not work for him... well, he felt better after consuming the gin-soaked raisins, but he was not a drinker, so I have to wonder if it was just the alcohol/sugar combo making him \"feel better\"... regardless, his actual ability to use his hands and to walk did NOT improve.\u00a0\u00a0For a diabetic, I personally have to express caution as raisins have highly-concentrated sugars, and alcohol is generally just not wise...\u00a0\u00a0so, talk to your doc and maybe try some other \"natural\" remedy... like SAMe or herbals, or therapeutic massage (not salon \"feel good\" massage)... but talk to your doc before trying anything.",
