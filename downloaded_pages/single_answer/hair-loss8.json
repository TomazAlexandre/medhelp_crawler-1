    "question": "I was prescribed by my Primary Doctor Clotrimazole and Bethametasone cream to apply on my bald spot BID plus Nizoral shampoo at least 3 times a week. It has redness and some part itching. He also referred me to a Dermatologist. The dermatologist gave me steroid shot on that bald spot and I noticed that there's a bit flat. I'm afraid that the steriod shot might affect my hair to grow back. The specialist didn't even explain why he's giving the shot for. Is the steroid shot to treat the fungus? Will my hair still grow on that spot?",
