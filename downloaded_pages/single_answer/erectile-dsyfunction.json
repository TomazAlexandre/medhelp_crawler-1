            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!No, it is not due to you! In a new relationship it can be due to stress of pleasing his girlfriend. Maybe he is not comfortable having a second round so soon. So both of you need to discuss your sexual preferences and time yourself.There may be some other problem too like use of drugs, diabetes, low testosterone, varicoceles, neurological or vascular problems (peripheral vascular disease, heart or thyroid conditions) etc. You would then need to consult an urologist or sex therapist for this. Take care!",
