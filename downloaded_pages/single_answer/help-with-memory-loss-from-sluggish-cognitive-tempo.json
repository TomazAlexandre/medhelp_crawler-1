            "answer": "I have personal experience taking gingko biloba (an herb) and was part of a two year study. It was remarkably helpful for short-term memory loss. By the way this supplement has been used extensively in Europe for decades and has had many trials (double blind). I do not know of any undesirable side effects, but ask your doctor about this.",

    "question": "Hello, I am wondering if anybody has a suggestion of medications or anything that works to help with memory problems associated with SCT that will not cause more memory problems or possible brain damage with long term use? The reason that I have a fear of more memory damage or brain damage from certain meds or supplements is that while searching for medications and supplements to help with memory I have come across information that certain medications like aderall and others plus different types of supplements can actually cause memory damage with long term use, plus I already have memory problems and I don't need more and I am on other medications for other diseases that will have adverse effects when taken with certain supplements.I really need something to help because I am planning on going to college fand I want to be able to successfully store and retrieve\u00a0\u00a0the information\u00a0\u00a0that I learn instead of forgetting the information after some time of not constantly using the information. My doctor has prescribed to me provigil to relieve the feeling of constantly feeling tired and sleepy, but I am not sure it will help with memory retention and memory retrieval, so I was looking to also add something else to stabilize my memory. I take citalopram for major depression and anxiety which has helped my depression and anxiety significantly, I am on 2 types of insulin for type one diabetes, I am on Levothyroxin for autoimmune attacked thyroid/hypothyroidism like my pancreas, I am on lisinipril to protect my kidneys and lovastatin to keep my cholesterol in check. Please help me find something that will help my memory but not interfere with others meds that I have to take.",
