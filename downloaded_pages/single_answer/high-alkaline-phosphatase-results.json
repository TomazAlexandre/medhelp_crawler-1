            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!An elevation in AP is often seen in cholestatic liver disease, bone disease (like osteoporosis at your age), and occasionally with inflammatory bowel disease. In an otherwise healthy individual a raised AP could be due to false positive test and the test should be repeated. In your case, since you have a speckled pattern (though not of much importance at the titration mentioned), it could be due to ITP, scleroderma, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, mixed connective tissue disorder or due to lupus.The weight gain is of concern. Common causes like overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, hypothyroidism have to be ruled out in your case. You must then look for other causes. One is water retention due to low serum protein. This along with anemia can cause unexplained weight gain. Adrenal gland problems are the other cause. Cushing\u2019s syndrome should be looked for. The kidney function too should be assessed. Polycystic ovary too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out in your case since you have pcos.\u00a0\u00a0Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis. Take care!",

    "question": "I have had some resent blood work done and I am interested in the results. My Alkaline Phosphatase is 167. It seems to be in the liver, my liver/alkaline phosphatase is 82, where the bone/phosphatase is 18 and intestinal/alkaline phosphatase is 0. I was positive for EIA Screen with a speckled pattern and 1:80 titer. I am not sure what to make of all this. I am very tired all the time and my weight keeps going up even though I have had gastric bypass surgery. I am also achey all the time and very depressed. My TSH is 3.347 which I am told is normal but I keep reading that normal doesn't mean normal as far as the thyroid goes. I just read an article on chronic fatigue and I have quite a few of the syptoms and I think I need some hormone replacements. I am 53 and have gone through menopause already. I have bee diagnosed with POS but told that shouldn't be an issue now that I have gone through menopause",
