            "answer": "Hi,Though herpes can not be ruled out here, chances are that this could be folliculitis, dermatitis, or allergic reaction.In most individuals there are outbreaks of folliculitis from time to time.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months.Let us know if you need any other information and consult a skin specialist if the lesion is persistent.Regards.",

    "question": "A couple of weeks ago, I noticed what appeared to be two whitehead pimples on the shaft of my penis. This is not very uncommon for me, and I usually just squeeze the pus out, and they disapear after a couple of days.\u00a0\u00a0About two months ago, I had unprotected sex with a girl who claimed she was a virgin.\u00a0\u00a0Now, after popping both of the 'pimples', pus came out of both, and one of them disappeared, but the other site remained, and became red and inflammed.\u00a0\u00a0After another week or so, there appeared to be about a pea sized hard mas underneath the skin.\u00a0\u00a0In about the center of this mass was a hair follicle.\u00a0\u00a0I pulled out the hair follicle, and squeezed out what appeared to be more pus, then clear fluid, then blood.\u00a0\u00a0Now, the area is much smaller, yet it has taken the appearance of a whitehead pimple again.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't hurt or itch at all and never has, and there is only one.\u00a0\u00a0 Could this be genital herpes, or am I just being way too paranoid?",
