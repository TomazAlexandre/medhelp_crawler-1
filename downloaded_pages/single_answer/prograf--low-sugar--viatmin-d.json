            "answer": "I can tell you a little about the threat of diabetes post transplant. They typically use huge amounts of steroids to prevent early rejection during and immediately after transplant. Mostly patients are kept on Prednisone for a while after being released from hospital and then slowly tapered off. Some patients have to remain on Prednisone. I have heard of some procedures that do not use Prednisone after transplant, but I think that is unusual.The steroids can cause increased amounts of glucose in the blood. This can cause a termporary state like type II diapetes. Usually this is temporary, but sometimes becomes a permanent condition of type II. I had to inject insulin until I was off the Prednisone. After that, my glucose levels returned to normal.I don't know about the link between sunlight and Prograf, but I was strongly told by the hepatologist and the dermatologist to avoid overexposure to the sun. I do not know all the reasons, but I know that one of the side effects of Prograf is that it pormotes tumor growth and makes patients on Prograf a little more likely to get cancer and especially skin cancer.I am sorry I just have these anecdotes and not really any study data to support it, but I thought I would pass it on.Brent",

    "question": "The post bellow from Kande and some of the replies got me thinking.I am just 2 months post tp. I had a live liver tp with my daughter as the donor.My doc is having me keep track of my blood sugar for possibly diabetic reactions. I stumbled onto an article which claims people with low vitamin D often have problems keeping thier blood sugar levels down. Now, they warn to stay out of the sun while doing immune suppressions. How am I to keep getting Vit. D if I can't go in the sun? And what is the connection with prograf and sun problems?Can anyone help educate me about this?Thanks in advance",
