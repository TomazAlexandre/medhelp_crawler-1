            "answer": "Hi there,The exact cause of your problem can be determined only after a thorough inspection and examination. After the tube is placed you need to maintain cleanliness and hygiene. It is possible that there is some infection which is settling in the J tube. Fungal colonization of J tubes is common and in that case you need to see your doctor. You may need tube replacement. Do keep me posted on how you are doing.Best wishes and regards!",
