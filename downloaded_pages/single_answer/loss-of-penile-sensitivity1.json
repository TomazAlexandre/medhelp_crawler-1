            "answer": "Hello,There are a few possibilities which need to be probed in your case. Firstly stress and anxiety, poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations which make sex a task rather than a pleasure, negative feelings about non performance, smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs can also cause loss of sensations while having intercourse. It can be due to involvement of the nerves with a Peyronie's plaque, post circumcision damage to nerves or some other type of nerve problem.Nerve problems causing a loss of sensation are not easily treated and hence needs a detailed examination from a neurologist. Thirdly, medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord injury, peyronie\u2019s disease, nerve damage (for example, from prostate surgery), or neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease) may also cause such loss of feelings after erection. So my suggestion is to consult a urologist/ neurologist and get your blood sugar levels, thyroid function tests, EKG, MRA ( magnetic resonance angiogram) and nerve conduction velocity tests done.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
