            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Raised liver enzymes, fever and fatigue should raise doubts for two things\u2014hepatitis and typhoid. Hepatitis will usually present with jaundice, which could be delayed in some cases. Also if GammaGt is raised then kidney infection too should be ruled out along with cholangitis (inflammation of the bile duct).Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My fiance was feeling generally tired and then a day later his fever spiked to 101-103 and stayed there for a week. He took acetaminophen and ibuprofen to control the fever. At the end of the week he went to see his doctor and she tested him for diabetes, white blood cell count and tested his liver counts.Liver was higher than normal. All other tests were normal.It is now a week and a half later and he had another liver test where it showed that it is continuing to climb. He had a sonigram and it came back with no abnormalities.Now his fever is a lowgrade one and he is feeling very fatigued and can only work 3 - 4 hours a day. This from a man who is a competitive cyclist and very active.My concern is the fever, liver counts and fatigue. He presents with no other signs (No rash, no abdominal pain etc.)He does not drink alcohol.He does not use drugs.He has had only one sexual partner in his life.He eats healthy.I am perplexed as to the cause and the diagnosis and so is his doctor.Any help would be appreciated.",
