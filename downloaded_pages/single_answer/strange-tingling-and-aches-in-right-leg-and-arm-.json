            "answer": "Hi!The symptoms could be due to fibromyalgia, electrolyte imbalance, hormonal imbalance, Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. A pinched nerve can also be the cause. Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility.I understand your limitation on copay. Ask your doctor whether any of these conditions can be ruled out based on tests and clinical examinations you had in recent past. Then you may only need to go for MRI and other tests which your doctor thinks would really be needed for diagnosis. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "For the past month I have been having strange RLS-type symptoms in my right leg AND arm. My leg has a constant 'electrical' feeling that tingles and I feel the urge to stretch and move. My arm however has been achy throughout and tingly in all my fingers and palm. These sensations change, the tingling goes from mild to severe, as well as the aches. But it never goes away completely. My left side is not affected at all. Could this be MS? A pinched nerve? Something else? I have an appt with a neurologist in 2 months, and I have an order for an MRI. However, my deductible is $10k!!! I'm trying to avoid unnecessary costs. Does anyone else have this??",
