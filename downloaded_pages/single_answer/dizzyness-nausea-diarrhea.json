            "answer": "Hello,The bowel problems of diarrhea,dizziness and nausea may be due to GERD(gastro esophageal reflux disease), acute non-GI infections (pyelonephritis, pneumonia),gastroenteritis,liver diseases, pancreatic disorder,peptic disease of upper GI tract,gastric carcinoma,CNS diseases like infections, tumors, multiple sclerosis and metabolic disturbances like diabetes and adrenal insufficiency.Gastroenteritis can be a strong possibility as you were also having it prior to your wife.Gastroenteritis is an irritation and infection of the digestive tract. It can often cause sudden and sometimes violent upsets and may be confused with spastic colitis. Gastroenteritis can be produced from viral,bacterial and parasitic infections, contaminated food or water, food poisoning, use of harsh laxatives, change in bacteria that normally live in the intestinal tract, chemical toxins in certain plants, seafood, or contaminated food, and heavy metal poisoning.Ask your wife to take adequate fluids throughout the day. The BRAT diet (ie, bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) or soft easily digestible semisolid diet can also be taken. Antimicrobial therapy is indicated for some bacterial gastroenteritis infections. However, many are self-limited and do not require therapy.The specific antibiotics are taken for specific bacteria after stool culture.So it is better to get stool culture done to find out the causative agent.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how your wife is doing.",

    "question": "My wife had diarrhea yesterday. Otherwise she was ok. Today she woke up dizzy,and nauseous. .I had to help her get around. She has slept most of the day , but when she gets up it's still there. Is this some kind of \"bug\" .I also had diarrhea about a week ago,with nausea. It went away after one occurrance. But it has returned about every 2 or 3 days , with normal intervals in between. I did not have dizziness except the first time.She has had stents put in her heart 2 years ago, but her pulse and rhythm are normal ,and she has no pain or breathing problems. Her BP is slightly high as she has not been able to keep her pill down,but is still 140/76. Her sugar hovers around 100. Her temp seems to be normal. We don't have a thermometer. It seems to be a \"bug\" but I want to be sure.",
