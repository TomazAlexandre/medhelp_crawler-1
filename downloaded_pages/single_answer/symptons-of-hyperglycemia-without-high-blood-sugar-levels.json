    "question": "Hi,I am 24 years old and have had type 1 diabetes for 10 years. Recently I have noticed that I need to take more insulin than usual at and I'm not sure why. My diabetes is pretty well controlled, and I am maintaining good blood sugar levels through regular testing but I have still been having the symptoms of high levels: increased thirst, tiredness and needing the toilet frequently (not lost any weight though!).\u00a0\u00a0Are there any reasons for this?Thanks",
