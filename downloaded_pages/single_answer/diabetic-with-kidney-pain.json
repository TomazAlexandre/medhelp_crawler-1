            "answer": "Hi!I wouldn\u2019t say unduly worried but yes, you must give your urine and stool for testing. Also it could be viral. But possibility of urine infection and gut infection should be ruled out. Kidney stone is another possibility. Please consult your PCP for primary examination and treatment. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
