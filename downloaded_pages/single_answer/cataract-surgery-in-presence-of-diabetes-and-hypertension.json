    "question": "Hi Docs, thanks for your forum...helped me immensely 4 yrs ago when I was getting ready for my own surgeries and lens replacements...this question on behalf of 53 yrs old lady in the Philippines. She has cataracts and diabetes and hypertension.How long have these condiditons have been going on is unknown, perhaps for quite a while. She is being treated for the diabetes and BP. Best info I can get is \"...sugar is 139...and blood still 160/90. Evidently they won't do anything about the cataracts until the diabetes high blood sugar is normalized.I researched a bit and see several abstracts of study results indicate cataract surgery in presence of diabetes has had good results with acceptable risks. Any info and opinions will be helpful...Lastly they have excellent docs and hospitals in Manila...don't know about the provinces, however. How should we go about selecting a doc or facility over there? if you can be helpful in that regard.Thanks very much,Jim",
