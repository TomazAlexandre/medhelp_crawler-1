            "answer": "I doubt taurine would do what the drugs do.\u00a0\u00a0It's main use as a supplement is to manufacture GABA.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, all nutrients have multiple uses, but thinking any supplement by itself will replace medication is usually a misunderstanding of how natural medicine works.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 diabetes is a disease believed to occur from behavior, at least in large part, unlike Type 1, which is genetic.\u00a0\u00a0The natural way to treat it, therefore, would be to intensely look at diet, exercise, etc.\u00a0\u00a0There are supplements that help control blood sugar as well, but my understanding is that diet is the main component of natural treatment.\u00a0\u00a0If the disease has progressed too far, this won't work, and if for reasons of individual differences in humans it's intractable, again, the natural approach won't be enough.\u00a0\u00a0We have no idea where you fall on the spectrum, but if you want to try a natural approach you will have to use an integrated approach rather than looking for something magical as medications are used and coordinate it with your doctors and natural practitioners.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck whatever you try.",

    "question": "Hey, just wondering if i could cease taking metformin for type 2 diabetes and lisinipril and if it would be beneficial for me to replace them with a natural Taurine supplement?I've read studies that suggest Taurine helps high blood pressure and diabetes among a ton of other illnesess, the reason I ask is because lisinipril has some rather severe side effects, I don't want to be taking a lot of chemical tablets when they could be replaced with something that is natural for my body instead of something that could be detrimental to my health in the long run, doctors nowadays seem to like to give out other drugs to treat side effects which in turn causes other side effects in a vicious cycle, they are also trying to get me on statins (surprise, surprise..).Any advice would be welcome, thanks in advance :).",
