            "answer": "Does she have a fever or pain on urination? How is her blood pressure and pulse? It could also be her kidneys? Did anyone do any chemistry profile on her or complete blood count recently? The doctor sounds like a jerk. You might want to have her get a EKG to see if her heart rate and rhythm are doing ok. My mother in law is 90 and she has been doing great up until this year when she started getting tired, couldn't remember things and we thought well she is old and maybe that is it. Well, she was on blood pressure meds and the cardiologist said that the pills were lasting all day. She got on some new bp meds and she is feeling great, memory is back and she wants to start painting (art) again. So, I think she should get checked by another doctor for her bp and heart and see if her blood works is normal or not.",

    "question": "Hello everyone, I'm writing this question on behalf of my grandmother. She is 81 years of age and takes about 10 different prescribed medications. She also suffers from type II diabetes but she maintains her blood glucose with insulin pills at a moderate level (it varies from 5-7). She has had issues with angina in the past but recently has been alright. Her medication hasn't been modified recently, however, she has begun experiencing terrible fits of sweating. The doctor has told her she is too old to be suffering from hot flashes. She sweats a great deal in the evening and this is coupled with frequent urination; what she approximates to be roughly once every half hour. Additionally she is very fatigued and sleepy during the day--perhaps because she isn't sleeping well at night? Her doctor doesn't seem too concerned and continually tells her that she is \"old and needs to deal with it.\" I don't think she should have to. Does anyone have an idea of a starting point from which we can search for a diagnosis or get some help for my grandma? Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated! Thank you very much for your time and consideration in advance!",
