            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Generally bad odor is due to infection, mainly by E coli. This can be diagnosed by urine culture. Strong fruity odor is due to uncontrolled diabetes. Urinary bladder infection and kidney infections do produce strong smelling urine. Another reason is dehydration. Strong ammonia smell is due to protein breakdown.However you must look at causes for the urine leak. One commonest cause is stopping the stream flow before complete bladder evacuation\u2014some urine remains in the penile urethra. This should be milked out. Any amount of urine left on the undergarments will eventually smell. If this tip does not help then you will have to seriously consider other problems.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 42 yr old white male and have noticed a strong urine smell in the last 2 months. After I urinate a small amount leaks out onto my underpants and stinks. I don't believe it is sexually related cause it has been well over a year since I have had contact and I am on atenonyl once a day for an arythma. My concern besides a health problem is that someone else is going to smell this on my clothes eventually. Any ideas besides the dehydration theory?",
