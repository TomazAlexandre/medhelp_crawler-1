Causes of burning feet and hands could be sensitivity to fabric or detergent, wrong fiber of socks and mittens, athlete\u2019s foot or fungal infection, peripheral neuropathy that is due to damage to nerves to feet and hands. Usually this is seen in diabetes, uremia, deficiency of vitamin b complex or rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, multiple sclerosis, alcoholism etc. consult a neurologist urgently. You could use pain relievers like aspirin or acetaminophen, etc meanwhile. You may be prescribed drugs like gabapentine or carbamazepine, methylcobalamine for the neuropathic pain. Hope this helps.",
