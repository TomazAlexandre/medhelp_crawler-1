            "answer": "Hello,There is no single diagnosis that can piece together all your symptoms,but few possibilities are there that need to be evaluated.First possibility is of irritable bowel syndrome. Common symptoms include abdominal cramping or pain, bloating and gassiness, and altered bowel habits(constipation and loose stools).The other possibilities that need to be evaluated are acid-base imbalance in the body(due to constant diarrhea),low sodium,calcium and vit D deficiency,muscle fasciculation syndrome,Motor neuron disease and chronic fatigue syndrome,hypoparathyroidism.Difficulty in swallowing can be due to\u00a0\u00a0gastrointestinal, psychological (Emotional or anxiety disorder) or nerve or muscle problems.You need a comprehensive profile of investigations to confirm a diagnosis.I would suggest a gastroenterologist\u2019s and neurologist\u2019s evaluation for this.I hope that helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
