            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.Since your glucose was normal and there was no sugar in your urine, it sounds like the cause of your symptoms is not diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0There are other possible causes for your symptoms and it would be a good idea to see your primary care doctor for a physical.\u00a0\u00a0He or she can examine you, run some routine blood work and can help you figure out what is causing you symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.Bridget",
