It is good that the initial diagnostic tests were normal.\u00a0\u00a0Risk factors that may increase your risk of pancreatic cancer include being overweight or obese, chronic inflammation of the pancreas, diabetes, family history of genetic syndrome, personal or family history of pancreatic cancer and smoking. If these factors are not present, the likelihood of pancreatic cancer may be nil. It is best that you discuss the results also with your doctor for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",
