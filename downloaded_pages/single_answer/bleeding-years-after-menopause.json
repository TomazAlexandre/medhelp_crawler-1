            "answer": "Please tell her she MUST go in!! My friend went through the same thing. She is 63. It turned out that it was cancer. She had to have a hysterectomy and it saved her life. My great grandmother started bleeding at the age of 74...again, it was cancer...and she had already had a hyst.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not saying that your sister has cancer,but she needs to go in to be sure! It may save her life.To get her into a clinic maybe you could tell her that you need to go see a Dr. and that you are nervous. Ask her if she would please go with you. Once there tell the Dr. about your sister's problem,and he/she will check her.(Call ahead and let the staff know what you are doing) I know it's sneaky,but I had to do that with my mother. Turned out she had diabetes and a heart condition. I'm really glad that I \"lied\" to my mom to get her in there! She was glad too.",
