    "question": "I am 29 yrs and for almost 2 yrs now I have been trying to cope with Gastroparesis but I DO NOT have Diabetes. It's really hard to research because most information relates always to Diabetes 1st which is very misleading for me due to the fact that I do not have Diabetes. I realize most people that suffer from Gastro have Diabetes but WHAT ABOUT ME?...I do not have Diabetes. I found (1) book \"Eating for Gastroparesis\" but guess what it's NOT available no matter what website I visit and Barnes and Noble say they are unable to order it. I used to be a great cook and enjoyed the kitchen but now I really try not go in anymore.My desire for children is alive and well but with my incurable illness of Gastroparesis I am very worried. I have to take so many pills for the reflux, nausea and vomiting. They are so overwhelming and my deepest fear is when I get pregnant how will all this be managed. I have to know what kind of impact will it have and will I be able to provide the efficient nutrition my baby will need during my pregnancy.I really appreciate any and all feedback.Thank you kindly,Kids are great",
