    "question": "My 17 year old son started his 10th year of football in August. Never any health problems untill now. Pre season and first few games he was fine. 3rd game he got clipped and went down on his head hard. Looking back, we assume he had a concussion. Next few games were fine, then he started getting \"lazy\" by 3rd quarter. At this point the only visible signs of a problem were profuse sweating, really blood shot eyes and he was tired. The \"laziness\" started earlier in the next games then he began to stagger and get pale. After the play he would just stand there and not go to the huddle. This happened in a matter of 2 or 3 plays then he was taken out of the game. We thought he was dehydrated so gave him water and watched him. The next day was tired but acted fine. Next game had the same problem as game before, but also vomitted. Vommited 7 more times that night. Stopped football for season. At Dr. next day, found out during his \"laziness\" chest is tight, has trouble catching breath, arms and neck hurt and are heavy, light headed. When he doesn't make it to the huddle, from decription, it sounds as if he's having a black out. Had lost 20 lbs. He has hand tremors, frequent urination, tires very easily, still big appetite, moody, \"zones out\" more than usuall. Blood tests, including drug and steroid, have been neg. Showed no dehydration. Second test for diabetes neg. Sent to cardiologist, all tests show nothing. 2 weeks left to wear heart event moniter, nothing so far. Has lost 5lbs more in 2 weeks. 5'11\" 171 lbs. ADHD and Dyslexic, never medicated. What next?",
