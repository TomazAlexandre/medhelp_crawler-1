    "question": "I am a 31 year old female with hypertension and am 26 weeks pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I am on Labetalol and it works well.\u00a0\u00a0This all started about 7 months ago ( before I was pregnant).\u00a0\u00a0I woke up one morning and my face was tight/ numbish.\u00a0\u00a0It got worse throughout the day and I went to the ER where they did a CT scan (normal), blood work (normal), ekg (normal).The facial numbness never went away for more than a few hours at a time, but started switching sides and coming and going.\u00a0\u00a0I started having headaches, which I never had before.\u00a0\u00a0 Then I got pregnant on accident and soon after started another symptom.\u00a0\u00a0I felt tingles/prickles all over....every side, all parts....sometimes just one prickle, sometimes lots of prickles.\u00a0\u00a0It got worse in the heat.Then came the buzzing...in my left knee, my left hip, my right hip, my right foot, my right shoulder blade, left forehead.....a pulsating vibration...on for two seconds, off for five seconds.\u00a0\u00a0Not all at once....the location changed over time with an episode not lasting longer than two weeks at the most....usually three days.\u00a0\u00a0I never had the sensation in several places at the same time.Most of these symptoms have eased up or disappeared.\u00a0\u00a0But I still have the facial numbness that comes and goes and brings with it a heck of a headache.\u00a0\u00a0The headache feels dull all over but feels sharp and stabbing around my eyes and small, specific parts of my head.\u00a0\u00a0I see sparkles and feel terrible.....and, yet my bp is 115/65.I saw a neuro who said he cant do anything for me until I have the baby.\u00a0\u00a0He did get me an EEG which was normal, B12 which was 525, and Lyme which was neg.\u00a0\u00a0 My PCP thinks it is all stress and my OB is not concerned.",
