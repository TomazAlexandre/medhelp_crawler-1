    "question": "Hello, hoping someone has had a similar experience and share some insights. Was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes about 3 months ago. Brought blood sugar levels back to normal ranges quite quickly. Feel okay but my fingers constantly twitch. Heard someone once say that achieving good control too rapidly can cause short term issues. However this has being going on three months and I am unsure if finger twitching is a side effect of fairly rapid changes in blood sugar. Thank you",
