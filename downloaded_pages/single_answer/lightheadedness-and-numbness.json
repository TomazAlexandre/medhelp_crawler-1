            "answer": "Hello,Headaches,lightheadedness and clicking can be explained by sinusitis but numbness and tingling are not related to sinusitis. Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Such numbness is common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted if you have any additional queries.",
