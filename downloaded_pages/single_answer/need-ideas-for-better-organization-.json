            "answer": "Glad you asked!being organized is crucial when dealing with type 1.I make sure I have my glucose meter, pens, and emergency glucagon in one area in my kitchen (near the coffee machine), next to that I also have a notebook a pencil, and may carb book.When I first wake up, I go over to the coffee machine and make coffee and check my morning reading. the notebook is there to drop in what I am eating, the weight, and the carbs... this helps me monitor what foods I agree with and which ones I should avoid, and also it gives me a peace of mind knowing that I could always look back and make sure I counted my carbs right.This has been a great addition to managing my type 1.Also put alarms on your phone for your long acting insulin, taking that one shot on time everyday is essential, and also has a huge impact on your readings.Make sure you have emergency snacks on your nightstand, and in your office. This can be done by using an empty tissue box and filling it with snacks that you would normally have if or when you have a low. And your house won't look messy or disorganized.",
