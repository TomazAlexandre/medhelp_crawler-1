    "question": "Maybe some good news...my son had the stomach flu and fever starting Sun am.. (merry christmas).\u00a0\u00a0This has been going around our family.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be why his ketones are high?\u00a0\u00a0By the way...his urine was not concentrated, I'm not sure if he has lost weight, he is always drinking H20 so I do not think he was dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0We are seeing a physician tommorrow.\u00a0\u00a0I realize now his ketones may be high due to dehydration after the stomach flu started, but prior to Sun am when he started vomiting could his body have recognized this febrile illnes and responded with high ketonuria.\u00a0\u00a0 Just FYI:\u00a0\u00a0The ER called it Asymtomatic Ketonuria on Sat afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0You people are great!\u00a0\u00a0Oh, I am buying him some Pediasure tommorrow to getn his caloric intake up in the event this is the cause.",
