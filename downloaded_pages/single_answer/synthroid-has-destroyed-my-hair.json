    "question": "I have been on synthroid treatment for about a year - and the hair on the sides of my head, by and above my ears, is so thin, it is hard to believe. The hair has stayed put on the top of my head for the most part (thank goodness) but the sides are incredibly thin.\u00a0\u00a0I made an appt to see a medical doctor - naturopath - who prescribes armour, but the appt is not until January.\u00a0\u00a0My regular endo appt is at the end of Sept and I am going to ask about synthetic T3 (cytomel) with a lower dose of synthroid, or armour, but I doubt that this endo will prescribe....she seems to focus more on diabetes and less on thyroid and I know I better find a better thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I've looked over all of my test results for the past year and nowhere can I find a T3 level test.\u00a0\u00a0I've had the normal thyroid panel of T4, TSH, antibodies, Free T4, and T3up ratio, but no testing of T3 levels.\u00a0\u00a0When I am on the 50 mcg of synthroid, I feel a little tired, but sleep great.\u00a0\u00a0At 50 synthroid, I still lost hair on the sides, but at least I could sleep.\u00a0\u00a0T4 and Free T4 were normal, but TSH was around 4.8-5, so she wanted me on 75 synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0I tried but was miserable and sleep deprived, although told that my TSH was at a good level - 2.3 with the 75, but I felt terrible.\u00a0\u00a0So, after two months of 75 and feeling awful, I convinced her to let me stay at 50 for awhile, but I still lose so much hair and it all seems to come from the sides and some from the lower back of the head, with the crown fine.\u00a0\u00a0How can one convince a doctor to first of all, test T3, and then add T3 with lower synthroid, or switch one to Armour?",
