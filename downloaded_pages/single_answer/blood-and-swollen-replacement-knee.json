            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear that you have been going through such a bad experience post knee replacement. Usually joint replacements become infected if you have diabetes, an autoimmune disorder like rheumatoid arthritis or are very obese. In most cases where there is infection or repeated trauma to the knee with collection of blood the knee implant or replacement is removed. Some time is then given to the joint to heal and the knee is then managed conservatively through braces and medications. At times the bones are fused.However, you need to discuss this with your treating doctor to judge whether your knee is healing or not and whether it is possible to keep this implant. Also causes of these complications that I mentioned need to be ruled out, and if present adequately treated. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
