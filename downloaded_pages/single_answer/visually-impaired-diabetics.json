    "question": "I have a question which takes in more than one forum. I have a genetic retinal disease, unrelated to diabetes, but which also causes blindness. This seems to more imminent than I had anticipated. My problem is that I've discovered there are absolutely NO blood glucose testing meters on the market, usable by someone who is severely visually impaired! I have frequent lows-like 36-and if I cannot test, do I just look forward to dying when my sight fails? Why has no one invented something? Help! (I've been an insulin dependent diabetic for about 6 years, diabetic for almost 15.)",
