            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Actually vitamin D deficiency occurs due to inadequate exposure to sunlight or because of a strict vegetarian diet. Excessive use of sunscreen, having IBS, Crohn\u2019s or celiac disease could be the other risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. Since Vit D is a fat soluble vitamin, disorders affecting fat metabolism can affect Vit D absorption. These include liver disorders, Crohn\u2019s disease, colitis, and kidney problems. Rarely this is a hereditary disorder. Obese individuals who have undergone gastric bypass surgery may become vitamin D deficient without a sufficient intake of this nutrient from food or supplements, since part of the upper small intestine where vitamin D is absorbed is bypassed. So, if the cause is found and corrected and vitamin D supplemented, some of your symptoms (particularly polyneuropathy like) will go. Some doctors also advocate vitamin D therapy to treat some types of glaucoma. So, ask your doctor about it.There can be some very simple causes of frontal (forehead) headache. Poor sleep, eye strain (glaucoma too could be a cause), refractive errors of the eye like myopia (near sightedness), temporal arteritis, compression of cervical spinal nerves (possible as you have ringing too), and sinusitis are some of the common causes of frontal headache.Also, yes, the nerve pains should be thoroughly investigated for peripheral neuropathy, MS, and nerve compression. Please discuss all this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi please help, I am a 53 year old white female and about 5 years ago I experienced sever nerve pain in both feet ( so bad that I didn't want to stand on them) I also experience muscular pain in both legs, hips, and pelvic area. I was tested for ms but the MRI showed no lesions. I was then diagnosed with sever poly neuropathy ( for unknown reason). I did have gestational diabetes with all 4 of my pregnancies but my routine bloodwork does not show diabetes now. Most recently, (July of 2013) I am experiencing right ear humming and ringing and daily morning headaches in the frontal lobe area. These morning headaches are not like my migraines . I went to my PCM\u00a0\u00a0and he could not find a cause for this ( no testing was done ). However I did have regular bloodwork done and that showed my vitamin D is only 12. I also went to my eye doc for a routine exam and he said I have glaucoma . He doesn't know why I have it because nobody in my family's as ever had it and my age 53 doesn't fit the profile. He is sending me to specialist this week and I am seeing an ear specialist this week. My eye doc wanted to have a better understanding about my nerve pain and my history. He said he is \"very suspicious \" and is actually questioning\u00a0\u00a0my trust of my PC. Would there be concern for ms with tests proving optic nerve damage, humming in right ear, daily headaches and nearly zero vitamin D. Can someone out the please help me sort this out. Thank you so much.",
