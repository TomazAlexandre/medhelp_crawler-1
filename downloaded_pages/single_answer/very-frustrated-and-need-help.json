            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!You must look at various causes of obesity\u2014rich diet, lack of exercise, (first two seemingly ruled out in your case) adrenal gland problems, hypothyroid state, diabetes etc.A good nutrition specialist and fitness instructor can help you get your body back on track after all the tests have been done.Too much of organic food too can cause gas in stomach, especially if you have irritable bowel syndrome. I would strongly recommend you to see a gastroenterologist (a specialist who looks after the diseases of our digestive system).Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
