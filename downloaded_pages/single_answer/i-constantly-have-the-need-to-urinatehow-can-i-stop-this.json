            "answer": "Hello,The urge of frequent urination can be due to diabetes mellitus. Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, diuretic drugs and pregnancy.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography , pregnancy blood test, thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis. I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made. But firstly try drinking plenty of water because if it is simple UTI, then adequate amount of fluids will flush out the infection.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have the constant urge to wee. I am a 23 year old woman and had my son three years ago. This problem only started about 3 days ago but is extremely annoying. I cannot even stand half an hour without the urge to go to the bathroom. I have no pain at all, although after I have emptied my bladder I have a feeling as if more needs to go out. The feeling is similar to that of holding your wee in and almost busting to go. I get up twice in the night to go toilet. Although during the day it is the most frequent. I have yet to visit my GP.This discussion is related to/posts/show/916894.",
