            "answer": "Hello,I cannot confirm anything without examination but it can be due to eczema, dermatitis, bacterial or fungal skin infection, diabetes, medication or lichen planus.Keep the area clean and apply some calamine lotion on the rashes. Also wear cotton clothes and take some antihistaminic like Benadryl. If the symptoms persist then please get an evaluation done from a dermatologist. Also get your blood sugar levels estimated.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
