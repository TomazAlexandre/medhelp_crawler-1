    "question": "am 24male healthy. Not having any sexual relationship yet. I dont drink or smoke. And dont having any disease like blood pressure, diabetes. My penis is not erecting whenever i want since last 3 weeks. Earlier it was normal and could masturbate normally.Before starting the problem i masturbated 3-5 times a day for whole week. Suddenly i stopped it for 5-6 days and tried masturbation i realized the problem .Now my penis remains erected only when i wake up in the morning and get normal after toilet.\u00a0\u00a0but it don't react anymore for masturbation i feel weakness in my penis. mentally am stressed now.
