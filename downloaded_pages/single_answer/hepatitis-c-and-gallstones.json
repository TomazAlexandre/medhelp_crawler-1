    "question": "Posted by AL on April 23, 1999 at 09:43:39Following hepatic colic, gallstones have been detected by ultrasound examination. Surgical removal of the gallbladder was decided.However, the operation was suspended/posponed following blood analysis which revealed HCV antibodies. Hepatitis C dignosis has subsequently been confirmed by RIBA and by HCV RNA test.ALT and AST have been found normal (near the upper boundary) in three subsequent analyses (about 3 weeks/1 month spaced).In the mean time, gallstones are giving problems.My questions are mainly related to understand the relation (if any) between gallstones and hepatitis C and the reasons for operation posponig, but I would also very much appreciate a general comment on the situation.Best regards.Posted by HFHSM.D.-D.M. on April 29, 1999 at 13:09:46Dear AL:I really appreciated your question.\u00a0\u00a0No one has ever asked me before if there is a relationship between hepatitis C and gallstones.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds as if you have both hepatitis C and gallstones.\u00a0\u00a0You wonder if there is a relationship between the one and the other and if there is any reason the hepatitis C should prevent you from having the gallstones taken care of.As for as I know there is no relationship between having a hepatitis C infection of the liver and having gallstones.\u00a0\u00a0They really are two separate and distinct problems.\u00a0\u00a0One of the drugs used for hepatitis C (ribavirin) has been reported to cause gallstones if used for along period of time, however, it sounds like you were just diagnosed and have not had treatment.The vast majority of people with hepatitis C have well compensated liver disease.\u00a0\u00a0In that setting, the hepatitis C should not be an obstacle to removing the gallbladder.\u00a0\u00a0In a few individuals with hepatitis C, the liver has started to show signs of failing and these individuals are at increased risk of complications during and after surgery.\u00a0\u00a0It typically is relatively straightforward to identify these individuals. If you do have your gallbladder removed, you may want to ask the surgeons to biopsy your liver at that time.Good luck with you situation.\u00a0\u00a0 I hope this information is helpful to you.

Since that diagnosis he has had various other diagnosis made, one of which is diabetes as of 9/98, it came on very fast and is quite difficult to manage. He is taking a lot of insulin and we increase it often. There is no diabetes in his family so from what I read this is probably the result of hep c. In doing research under diabetes I found that it is quite common for people with diabetes to have gallstones.\u00a0\u00a0Al doesn't mention if he has diabetes or not but if he does, there may be a roundabout connection between the hep c and the gallstones.Posted by HFHSM.D.-D.M. on May 09, 1999 at 17:54:52Dear Mary Ann:Thanks for your thoughts. You are correct that there is a correlation between diabetes and gallstones.\u00a0\u00a0However, it is still very controversial as to whether there is a relationship between diabetes and hepatitis C.\u00a0\u00a0Some researchers feel there is a correlation between hepatitis C and diabetes but it is very unclear as to whether this is the case.\u00a0\u00a0Really, more research needs to be done.\u00a0\u00a0I should also point out that other physicians describe a relationship between diabetes and interferon treatment of hepatitis C but that is different than a relationship between diabetes and the hepatitis C itself.If you have additional information or questions, I would invite you to post the material to MEDHELP.\u00a0\u00a0At Henry Ford, we have an active group of liver specialists and we have an interest in the care and research of hepatitis C.\u00a0\u00a0The direct phone number to our Liver Clinic is (313) 916-8865.This response is being provided for general informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice or consultation.\u00a0\u00a0Always check with your personal physician when you have a question pertaining to your health.",
