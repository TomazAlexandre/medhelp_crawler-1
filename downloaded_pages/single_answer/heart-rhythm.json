            "answer": "Hi i read your post...i think you are doing the right thing by following up with your doctor because that is the only way that you will really know what is going on and it sounds like the docs are going to do the right tests.\u00a0\u00a0 The only other thing that i can think of is if you ask your docs to put you on a Holter Monitor for a specific period of time so that they can determine what it is you are feeling thru sound transferring to visual with the monitor.\u00a0\u00a0The antenolol may simply just not be working for you as well as it did if you are having what is called \"breakthroughs\" on the meds and it may be something simple like the doc has to increase the dosage you are on but that is totally up to the doc and their final diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0It is great you have such a pro active doctor and they are running these tests to get to the bottom of it.\u00a0\u00a0So i guess my suggestion would be just be patient and wait for the doc to come up with a final diagnosis for you....good luck w. your stress test next week.",

    "question": "I was born w/heart murmur which cleared up at the time.Today I have palpitations once in a while and a rolling thump beat or fluttering beat in my chest. I'm on Atenolol which helps. Could this be a recurrence fromheart murmur? Dr's can't find reasons for palpitations. I have a stress test scheduled next week. I want Dr's to run more test to rule out Arrhythmia orHeart valve leakage. I'm also taking Vitamin D-2 for vit D deficiency. Sometimes Ifeel a slight achy or pinche tingly feeling in my chest which Dr said could be dueto vitamin D deficiency or heart burn which I sometimes have.I've never smoked a cigarete in my life, I don't drink except a taste on specialoccasions, don't have high blood pressure or diabetes. I don't understand why I'm having these symptoms. Are there any suggestions or recommendations?",
