            "answer": "Hi,You might have postural or orthostatic hypotension which there is a sudden fall in blood pressure that occurs when a person assumes a standing position, usually after a prolonged period of rest. This may present as dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, blurred or dimmed vision, generalized numbness/tingling and fainting.Footcramps may be due to positional causes or lack of hydration. Drinking plenty of fluids may help. Nightsweats are usually not a sign of a serious underlying medical condition. It may be triggered by something as simple as too warm a room or too many blankets on the bed. Other causes of night sweats may include: menopause, anxiety, medications, drug or alcohol abuse, gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD) or diabetes. Treatment is usually directed to the underlying cause. If it persists, it would be best to have it evaluated further by your doctor. Some laboratory test may also be done to rule out other causes.
