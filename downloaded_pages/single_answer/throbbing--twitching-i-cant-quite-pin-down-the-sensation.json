            "answer": "Drinking primarily soda can cause a lot of health issues aside from tooth decay, obesity, and diabetes. Drinking soda can also cause magnesium and then calcium deficiencies, and of course, a chronically irritated stomach.Magnesium and calcium are necessary for healthy heart, nerves, and bones.Magnesium deficiency can cause a variety of mysterious symptoms and doesn't show up on a blood test.\u00a0\u00a0Calcium deficiency can lead to brittle bones, which you might not discover until you break one.Switch to water and take a good quality multivitamin/mineral and then see how you feel in a month.",

    "question": "I'm a nineteen-year old male who's been experiencing a strange palpating-like sensation on the top of my right foot along the (inward) side of the first metatarsal. I'm not well versed in anatomy whatsoever and know next to nothing about the circulatory system. Therefore, I can't tell whether or not the problem is coming from a vein/artery or tendon. It seems to only occur when I'm at rest (I.E. sitting or seemingly less often laying down). I'm not a very active person by any stretch of the imagination so I'm afraid that it might involve a blood clot. A secondary concern is perhaps the onset of a muscular disorder. It's been happening (as far as I can remember) for a few days/weeks.It it isn't too much information, I like to read (laptop) on the toilet and quite often sit there until one or both feel fall asleep. I'm 5'9 and weight about 120 and drink very few fluids other than soda. I know it's unhealthy... Anyway, I'm rambling. I hope you can shed a light on the possible cause of this issue. Thanks in advance!-Adam.",
