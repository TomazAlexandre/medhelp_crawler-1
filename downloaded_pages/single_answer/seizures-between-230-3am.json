    "question": "For the past four years, I've had seizures about twice a year consistently but *always* between 2:30-3am.\u00a0 They have been witnessed by several people, and appear to be grand mal.\u00a0 I wake up suddenly on fire, try to cool myself, but realize the seizure is coming (ringing ears, delusion, fainting) and let it happen.\u00a0 I am usually out for about a minute and twitch and make hand movements, etc then wake up gasping and panting.\u00a0 My question is... is this a sleep disorder of some sort?\u00a0 Since they have not interfered with my life and are always the same, I have not gone in for an EEG or asked for any sort of medication.\u00a0 I've tried to pin it to times of the month, alcohol, sickness, stress, etc.. and there is never a clear association.\u00a0 I also, oddly, tend to get a vague lower back pain (right side only) pretty consistanty, and it always makes me incredibly fatigued.\u00a0 I've been test for diabetes three years ago, and they found no problems.\u00a0\u00a0 Any answers/suggestions/comments??? Thanks.",
