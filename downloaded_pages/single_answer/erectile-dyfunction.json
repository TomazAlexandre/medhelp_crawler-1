    "question": "My partner\u00a0\u00a0has been having a serious problem with maintaining an erection and very seldom ejaculates. It all starts out great, we are very sexual, but half way through, things head south. He can achieve\u00a0\u00a0another erection but the same usually happens.\u00a0\u00a0He is very\u00a0\u00a0embarrassed to go for treatment blaming this on age (48) and it is putting alot of stress between us because he is so frustrated, which frustrates me. He works a stressful job, has been having trouble with gerd\u00a0\u00a0lately. I also have noticed when he urinates, I don\"t feel he has a strong stream and it takes awhile, he is also up a few times a night. It seems each time we have sex which is not to often anymore, it gets worse and he gets more frustrated. He could probably stand to exercise a little, but for the most part we are an attractive couple, I'm a very small woman, we were very sexually active, and up until now\u00a0\u00a0had no issuses. got any suggestions.",
