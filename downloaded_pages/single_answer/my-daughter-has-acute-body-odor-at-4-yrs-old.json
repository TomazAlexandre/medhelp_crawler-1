            "answer": "I think I already answered this in a repeat post. Body odor in my mind with a child with rapid growth sounds like what is called premature adrenarche. This needs workup which includes an xray of her hand to see if her bones are advancing and labs to see if her adrenal hormones are high. These are the hormones that change baby sweat to stinky bo.Also acne, pubic hair and axillary hair may develop.With near drowning if there was a central insult sometimes the pituitary may not stay asleep as long as it should and there may be some signalling in regards to true puberty hormones, however we would see female hormone response such as breast development, vaginal bleeding or discharge etc.So with body odor alone ask your pediatrician at least to consult with peds endo and if no labs at least get a bone age, if it is advanced then referral is important.",

    "question": "My beautiful daughter has mind blowing BO regularly at 4 years of age. She runs hot naturally so I try to keep her in cotton PJ's etc. I have expressed my concern to my pediatrician and he ruled out that she might have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She has no symptoms of pre-puberty. She is above average in height but normal for weight.\u00a0\u00a0She's lean and very tone with olive skin and brown eyes (which makes me feel better about PKU)\u00a0\u00a0She does have ezcema, small teeth that are spaced out...enamel issues???? (she grinds at night) She also has strong cheek bones a prominent forehead and a stawberry hemangioma on the side of her face between her ear and chin on her neck. (is this a possible related pigment issue?)She survived a near drowning incident in salt water at age 2 1/2 and I always wonder if that may have triggered anything PH wise.\u00a0\u00a0Please advise-\u00a0\u00a0Nervous Nelly Mom",
