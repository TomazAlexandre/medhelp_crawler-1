    "question": "Has anyone heard of PGX? Its apparently a natural supplement that works very well with diabetic people and insulin resistant people. I talked to a woman who said her husband has type 2 diabetes. They had him on metformin but it gave him too many side effects, so now he is on PGX and he has lost weight and feels great!this stuff apparently lowers the GI of the foods you eat, and allows your body to process it slower so that you dont get hungry as fast and crave food constantly!Has anyone tried it? Is anyone on metformin who needs to get off of it because of unwanted side effects?Fill me in!",
