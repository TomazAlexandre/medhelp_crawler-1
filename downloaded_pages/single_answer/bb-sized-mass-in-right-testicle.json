            "answer": "I'm not a doctor but just wanted to pass on some information that may help.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor acted correctly by doing the ultrasound as a precaution but it probably would be a good idea to have your blood tested for tumor markers also.\u00a0\u00a0The thing with testicular cancer and blood markers is that not all guys diagnosed with tc present with elevated markers.\u00a0\u00a0Some do others dont.\u00a0\u00a0My boyfriend was one of the ones who didn't show elevated levels but still had the disease. This may be your doctors thinking but its such an easy test to run it seems silly that it wasn't.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Elevated markers means somethings up, no elevated markers means theres still a chance of having tc.\u00a0\u00a0If your markers were above normal the sooner the mass comes out the better.\u00a0\u00a0I dont want to worry you because it could be nothing but three months when it could be something is a long time in terms of cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Keep checking any changes in size and act quickly if it gets larger.\u00a0\u00a0It very well may be benign but nows the time to act to make sure you have the best outcome.\u00a0\u00a0 A second opinion never hurts.",

    "question": "Hello, I am a 46 year old male with sarcoidosis, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0My sarcoidosis has been in check now for about 6 months and I no longer take prednisone.\u00a0\u00a0I have known involvement with sarcoid in my lungs, lyphatic system, and skin.\u00a0\u00a0Last week I went to the urologist due to my epidydimus on my right testicle being swollen.\u00a0\u00a0The urologist didn't think it was overly enlarged and didn't feel anything out of the \"normal\" during his examination.\u00a0\u00a0The UA was negative.\u00a0\u00a0As a precaution he sent me for an ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0This week upon returning, he told me the ultrasound showed a bb-sized mass within the right testicle.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't send me for any bloodwork and just wants me to monitor the situation by self examination over the next few months.\u00a0\u00a0He wants me to have another ultrasound in three months for comparison.\u00a0\u00a0Is this the right course of action here?\u00a0\u00a0It seems a little \"laid back\" considering what could be wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Should I get a second opinion?\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas would be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
