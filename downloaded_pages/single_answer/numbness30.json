            "answer": "Hello,Without examination,confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but going by your symptoms,I feel that most of this numbness is on the left side of the body.Numbness on the left side of the body means that there may be an abnormality in the right side of the brain.It can be a neurological pathology like motor neuron disease,TIA or stroke or autoimmune condition like multiple sclerosis in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination.It can be diagnosed by MRI brain and MRS of the brain.Other possibilities are vit B12 deficiency,diabetes , hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism or peripheral nerve trauma or compression. This can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition. Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the numbness is gone or not.If numbness is there only on the left half of the body,it means a right side pathology of the brain.So I feel that clinical evaluation from a neurologist is necessary to rule it out.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
