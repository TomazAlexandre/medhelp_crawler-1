            "answer": "Your symptoms could be related to your heart, especially, the fatigue, the nausea and the lightheadedness if your heart suffered a large heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0The way your would know that would be from an echocardiogram, specifically, the ejection fraction.\u00a0\u00a0It it is normal, close to normal, or even moderately depressed, you should not have these symptoms from your heart.\u00a0\u00a0These symptoms could also be related to other conditions and also to the medications you are taking.\u00a0\u00a0The conditions worth looking into include commonly Diabetes and hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0The coreg could make you lightheaded if you are on too much of it.\u00a0\u00a0The vytorin and the aspirin could give you nausea.\u00a0\u00a0The vytorin could also give you muchscle aches.\u00a0\u00a0The only way to tell if your arteries are blocking up more is by worsening symptoms of chest pain or exertional dyspnea or by a catheterization.\u00a0\u00a0It does't sound like you are having those symptoms, therefore, I wouldn't worry about that.\u00a0\u00a0More importantly, it is imperative that you take your medications because all the long term benefits come from them.\u00a0\u00a0 If the ones that you are on are truely giving you some side-effects as you have described than your doctor should switch you to an alternate medication.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like you should sit down with your cardiologist and go over all these issues.",

    "question": "I had a sudden death heart attack 6 years ago. I am on aspirin, vytorin, coreg,trimed, fish oil and xanex.\u00a0\u00a0I always feel very tired, and most days feel nausea, and light headed. Also lots of muscle aches of moderate intensity. Is this from all the medicine I am taking, or would it indicate other heart problems?\u00a0\u00a0I am 57 years old, exercise some and watch my diet regularly. I sometimes think that my arteries are blocking up even more, but no one seems to have an answer. Does anyone else have these symptoms???",
