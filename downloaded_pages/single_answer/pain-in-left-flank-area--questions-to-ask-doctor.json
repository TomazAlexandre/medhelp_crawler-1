    "question": "Pain in left flank areaI've been having pain in the left flank area since May of this year (2012). I went to a walk in clinic and the doctor felt I had a kidney infection (I had a urine test and was put on antibiotics). When I followed up with my own GP, he dismissed that assessment and stated I simply had back pain, as a second urine test came out normal. The pain subsided but the constant need to urinate remained.\u00a0\u00a0About three weeks ago, I had tremendous pain in my left flank area again. I figured this return in pain wasn't anything and tried to ignore it. But after three days, I decided to go to the doctors again. I went for an x-ray and a 2.3 calcified density was noticed. A CT scan was suggested. However the CT scan, which was ordered a week later, showed I was normal. Could I have passed the stone?\u00a0\u00a0But I still get waves of pain? I still urinate constantly and it often burns. I will be seeing my doctor in a few days to go over the results. Any suggestions on what to ask about or what it could be?",
