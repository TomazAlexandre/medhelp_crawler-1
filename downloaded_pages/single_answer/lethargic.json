            "answer": "Hi,Has your blood sugar been checked after you eat and having these symptoms? Or have you had an oral glucose tolerance test? I suggest checking one of these to see if your blood sugars may be playing a role.If it only happens after you eat I doubt that your thyroid is the culprit. But if all diabetes tests are negative then your dose may need revisiting.Take care.",

    "question": "I haven't been diagnosed with type 2. I do however, experience SEVER sleepiness and almost lethargy after I eat. No matter what I eat. I try to watch my carbs since they do intensify this feeling. I do have hypothyroidism and have been on meds for at least 8 years. My TSH is good. I don't like feeling like this.",
