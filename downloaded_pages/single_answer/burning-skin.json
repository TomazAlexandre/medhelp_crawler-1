            "answer": "Hello,It does not sound like contact dermatitis or allergies since you are just having burning of the skin without any redness.Other possibilities have to be ruled out. Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Such symptoms are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the burning is gone or not.Also apply calamine lotion to the skin having burning sensation.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
