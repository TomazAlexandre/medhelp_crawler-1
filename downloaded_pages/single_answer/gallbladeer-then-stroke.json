            "answer": "Hi, understand your predicament. Have you been initiated on thrombolysis? Thrombolysis, also known as thrombolytic therapy, is a treatment to dissolve dangerous clots in blood vessels, improve blood flow, and prevent damage to tissues and organs. This has to be done immediately after the stroke and carries a good prognosis. Besides this blood thinners, controlling high risk factors like diabetes and hypertension and physical therapy are needed for recovery from stroke. So, take care and work towards improving from your stroke symptoms. Regards.",
