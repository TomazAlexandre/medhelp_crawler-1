    "question": "My mother in law was recently discharged from the hospital after we took her to the ER for stroke symptoms. The hospital ignored the symptoms, but admitted her for her diabetes instead. Since then her symptoms of stroke have continued, and today when I visited her in her home, the entire left side of her face was paralyzed. I can't get her to go to the hospital! I feel like this is an emergency! Isn't it? How much time do we have before this stroke becomes massive and kills her or paralyzes the rest of her? What will they do for her to treat it?",
