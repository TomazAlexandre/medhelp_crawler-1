It sounds like your mother had coronary artery disease. You describe at least two risk factors for heart disease: a family history as well as high blood pressure. While you are a young woman, it is still important to control your risk factors for coronary artery disease. This means controlling your blood pressure and cholesterol, not smoking tobacco, and preventing or treating diabetes. Of course, a heart healthy diet and exercise are important as well.Chest pain which is cardiac in nature can present in many ways. Typical chest pain comes on or gets worse with exertion or exercise, may feel like a pressure sensation, can radiate to your jaw or left arm. Cardiac chest pain may also be associated with nausea, vomiting, sweating, and shortness of breath.You should see your physician. Additional testing would be helpful in order to identify the cause of your chest discomfort.",
