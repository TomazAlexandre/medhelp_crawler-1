            "answer": "HiI can understand your concern.Your daughter could be suffering from hypothyroidism, diabetes or, peripheral vascular disease. The fainting (type) attacks on changing position could be due to orthostatic hypotension. \u201cThe disorder may be associated with Addison's disease, atherosclerosis (build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries), diabetes and\u00a0\u00a0pheochromocytoma.\u201d \u201cOrthostatic hypotension may be caused by hypovolemia (a decreased amount of blood in the body), resulting from bleeding, the excessive use of diuretics, vasodilators, or other types of drugs, dehydration, or prolonged bed rest. It also occurs in people with anemia. Please refer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotensionI would suggest a complete checkup, hormone analysis, tests for diabetes, hypothyroidism and anemia. Colored doppler test of the pulsating blood vessel may give a clue about its cause. Please consult her physician at the earliest.Hope this helps. If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries. Please keep me posted.",

    "question": "My 15 yr. old daughter has been experiencing pulsating around the knee in her left leg.\u00a0\u00a0 The other evening it lasted for a couple of hours and she told me she had felt this before but only for a short while.\u00a0\u00a0When I placed my fingers on the area, I could actually feel the pulsating.\u00a0\u00a0It was like a vein was about to burst.\u00a0\u00a0Is this dangerous?\u00a0\u00a0Not sure if it's related but she also seems to have some periods of either \"hot flashes\" or feeling cold and sees black for a few seconds when she gets up from a sitting or laying position.\u00a0\u00a0She also complains of stomach aches.\u00a0\u00a0Can someone tell me what it could be?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
