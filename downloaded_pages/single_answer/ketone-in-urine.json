            "answer": "Hello,when was the trace keytones reading?\u00a0\u00a0If it is fasting in the morning without eating, then this is normal.If it is at any other non-fasting time during the day it is not normal.The best way to test your blood sugar is using blood sugar test strips, not keytone strips for urine.You could also ask your Dr to test for Hba1c, which is a blood test that gives average blood sugar over the past 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0A truly normal number is\u00a0\u00a05.7 typically indicates diabetes, and the higher that number the worse it is.Hope this really helps you. Let us know how you go.",

    "question": "I not sure if this is the right forum or not. I was worried about my sugar levels so I bought some urine test strips and checked my urine . It was reading a trace of ketones. Is this something to be concerned about. I do drink a lot of soda. Is there a certain time of day I should check my urine to get an accurate reading . I just got over having a kidney stone. When I went back to the urologist he did ct scan and took a urine sample and he told me the stone was gone. He also asked me if I was diabetic and I said no and he said the ct scan didn't show any signs of diabetes. I didn't know they could see that on a ct scan? When you go to a urologist do they check your urine for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I have other health issues such as chiari malformation which causes some symptoms such as fatigue and dizziness and balance problems. I also have an enlarged prostate. Any help with my question would be appreciated. Thanks for listening to me ramble on.",
