            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!What you have is probably \u201csleeping limb\u201d or \u201cparesthesia\u201d. It is caused by a block in the nerve pathways or arteries. This prevents the electrochemical impulses from reaching the brain. When pressure is exerted on the limb in one position over a long period of time, it can compress arteries in that area. Once the limb is moved, blood returns to the area, which results in the \u201cpins and needles\u201d feeling. The sensations of pins and tingling are generally due to peripheral neuropathies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism and diabetes. Do get a thyroid antibody test too.Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis and G B Syndrome are two other possibilities. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Please read more about it on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ParesthesiaPlease discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
