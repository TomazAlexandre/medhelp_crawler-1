    "question": "May 31 2010. I am a male around 27 went to a spa and during happy ending i kissed her on lips and she gave me a fellatio later (unprotected) ( i was less knowledgeful then abt STDs and hence unprotected)two days later i suddenly develop Flu like symptomsm, Fatigue, Cold sweats and Cold/burning sensation near genetals and inner thighs but not on Penis and no visible sores or rashes, I went to a doctor and she said that my symptoms dont match any STD and she did tests for STDs HIV, Chlamidia, Gonorrhoea and Syphillis which all came back negative. She asked me to take Tylenol to solve the Flu problem.Tylenol seemed to work but the Genital Burning sensation started to increase day by day. I also started to feel a bit itchy in different parts of my body. By that weekend after around 7 days, i saw a small bump above my buttocks near lower back. Not sure if it was a lesion or what but it kind of scared me and i thot if it were syphillis or HSV. I was also not getting good sleep during the night because of the constant worry as to what is happening to me. When i went to a different doctor this time, he heard the whole story and said that the bump at the back definitely is not herpes and herpes lesions come in groups and are much worse, he said what i am experiencing is possibly because of ANXIETY and he gave me pills that will help me get sleep and prescribed Doxycycline 100mg twice a day to help with the genital burning sensation.After using Doxycycline for two days, my burning sensation subsided but with each day i started to get new symptoms like Cold/burning sensation in thighs , legs arms and then the next day it became tingling sensation all over my body. I started to hyperventilate. I continued with the dose and the symptoms reduce to mild burning sensation in genitalsJun 14th in the morning i started to feel unusual fatigue and felt very weak, i visited the doctor that afternoon and my weight reduced by 5 pounds which never happened in last 2 yrs. (its a different doctor this time since i wanted to get a different opinion). He checked for Lymph nodes and checked my genitals and said the tingling sensation and loss of weight could be from Anxiety, he was in agreement with the Doxycycline treatment from the previous doctor. He asked me to get another round of HIV test done and also included test for Herpes in it.While i am awaiting the results, i am starting to notice some new symptoms which bother me more. Since yesterday i started to feel a lot hungry and even though i eat a meal more than usual my stomach feels empty and i still feel tired. I lost a lot of fat around my waist and arms and cheeks. There seems to be some white deposit on my toungue since this morning although i clearned my toungue well when i brushed. Also all day long i was getting a taste of sweetness in my mouth, my saliva started to taste like artificial sweetners.When i read online the last few symptoms along with Weight loss matched with HIV (although no diarrhea), but the sweet taste in the mouth inclines me to think if it is because of pre diabetes and not HIV. the while color thing on my toungue although i read is associated with HIV, it can be a side affect of Doxycyline is what i read online.I am going crazy as to what is happening to my body. I never had sex in my entire life except this one encounter",
