            "answer": "Hello~sometimes nerve endings that are extra sensitive can cause itching and crawling sensations. You said you had OCD, well, this is very stressful, so, that stress could be manifesting itself in the form of crawly feelings and itching. I would say it is all anxiety/stress related",

    "question": "I feel like something crawling under my skin. No itching, no burning, no scabies and no bugs. I've had complete blood work done and no thyroid problem, no diabetes, and definitely no std. My skin is not dry at all, as a matter of fact i get compliment on how soft my skin is. Ive been using cocoa butter since i was very young. I have not changed anynithing from what i been using all along. I'm in great health I eat chicken, fish and turkey. I drink water and apple juice with no sugar. I am a total veggie eater. So my diet is really good. No fry food, just baked or boiled. I also have a regular movement at least 3 to 4 times a day. My house is clean because I have OCD. I change and wash my bedding every week and I use Lysol to disinfect. I don't drink or smoke. Can someone please tell me what this is?",
