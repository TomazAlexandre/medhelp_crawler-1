            "answer": "Sugar in the urine may be suggestive of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This should be ruled out with at least two fasting sugar tests.\u00a0\u00a0If there continues to be suspicion, a glucose tolerance test can be considered.\u00a0\u00a0 The latter test can especially be considered if you have sugar in the urine after a high sugar load.Repeating the urinalysis at a physician's office can be considered to ensure the reading is accurate.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "I have bought my own set of urine strips and at certain times (about 3 times now) I notice that I have glucose in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had test done at the lab but this has never shown up.I have been checked for both Diabetes and Kidney disease and both have been negative. Creatine is at 60.QuestionsWhat else can cause glucose in your urine?Are these strips accurate? They are fairly easy to read- the strip changes from yellow to green so I know I am not reading it wrong.Is it possible what you drink could cause this? I usually notice it after I drink a sprite.Recommendations.Thanks.",
