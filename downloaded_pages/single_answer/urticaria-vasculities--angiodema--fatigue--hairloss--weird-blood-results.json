            "answer": "Hi!Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of hair loss. Iron deficiency can be due to poor intake or poor absorption or due to hidden loss from bleeding as is seen in UTI and gut problems like IBS. The cause of anemia has to be found out by various blood tests as your SPEP levels are off. Thyroid disorders and diabetes too could be a cause of all your symptoms as also insomnia, stress and anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
