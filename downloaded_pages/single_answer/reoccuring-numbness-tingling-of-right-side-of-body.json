            "answer": "Hello,Tingling on the right side of the body means that there may be an abnormality in the left side of the brain.It can be a neurological pathology like motor neuron disease,TIA or stroke or autoimmune condition like multiple sclerosis in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination.It can be diagnosed by MRI brain and MRS of the brain.Other possibilities are vit B12 deficiency,diabetes, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism or peripheral nerve trauma or compression. Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.If tingling is there only on the right half of the body,it means a left side pathology of the brain.So I feel that clinical evaluation from a neurologist is necessary.I hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing and if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "I'm 22 years old female, in good health, but for the past 5 years I have had numbing sensations on the right side of my body. It it very intense when I run for a long period of time, my whole right side will tingle and sweat more than my left side does. I ocationally have a numbing pain in my arm ( but I'm pretty sure it's from stress). And recently I've had pain in my right leg after running or after a long drive.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have an idea why this might be happening? Is it too serious to put off seeing a doctor about?",
