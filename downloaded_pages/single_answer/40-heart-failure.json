Other medical problems such as kidney disease and diabetes are also important along with being a smoker or drinking alcohol.There are 2 heart failure survival prediction tools: the Seattle Heart Failure Model and the Heart Failure Survival Score. Not knowing your age or the answers to the questions above I can't answer your question about survival but you may wish to look up these scores and discuss them with your doctor.Treatment options for heart failure are evolving rapidly. Some hospitals will admit patients for 'invasive monitoring' and 'tailoring' of medical therapy to optimise fluid balance and blood pressure. Review with a heart rhythm specialist is increasingly common among heart failure patients and may lead to consideration of a defibrillator or a new kind of pacemaker therapy called 'cardiac resynchronisation therapy' in which a pacemaker helps the heart contract in a more organised way. Ablation, which involves abnormal electrical circuits being interrupted so as to restore a normal heart rhythm, is an option for some.A small number of patients will be eligible for and undergo heart transplantation. Since heart transplantation is a scarce resource, increasing number of patients are having mechanical pumps called 'ventricular assist devices' to replace the failing hearts function. Both transplant and mechanical support carry risks and are not an option for all. However, the earlier the conversation about your husbands future treatment options begins, the better you will be able to consider the best option in your case.Heart failure specialists are cardiologist with special training in reduced heart function.
