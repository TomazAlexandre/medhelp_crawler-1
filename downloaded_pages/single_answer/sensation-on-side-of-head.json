            "answer": "Hi there. Tingling and paresthesia on the side of head could be physical nerve injury like nerve entrapment, disease affecting the nerves, like neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, diabetes etc.\u00a0\u00a0If these symptoms are present in multiple locations, this needs multiple sclerosis workups.\u00a0\u00a0Other conditions are diabetes, peripheral artery disease, peripheral neuropathy or head injury. Consult a neurologist for investigation of these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Multiple sclerosis has multiple symptoms and signs and is a diagnosis of exclusion. The symptoms of multiple sclerosis are loss of balance, muscle spasms, numbness in any area, problems with walking and coordination, tremors in one or more arms and legs. Bowel and bladder symptoms include frequency of micturition, urine leakage, eye symptoms like double vision uncontrollable rapid eye movements, facial pain, painful muscle spasms, tingling, burning in arms or legs, depression, dizziness, hearing loss, fatigue etc. The treatment is essentially limited to symptomatic therapy so the course of action would not change much whether MS has been diagnosed or not. Apart from clinical neurological examination, MRI shows MS as paler areas of demyelination, two different episodes of demyelination separated by one month in at least two different brain locations. Spinal tap is done and CSF electrophoresis reveals oligoclonal bands suggestive of immune activity, which is suggestive but not diagnostic of MS. Demyelinating neurons, transmit nerve signals slower than non-demyelinated ones and can be detected with EP tests. These are visual evoked potentials, brain stem auditory evoked response, and somatosensory evoked potential. Slower nerve responses in any one of these is not confirmatory of MS but can be used to complement diagnosis along with a neurological examination, medical history and an MRI in addition, a spinal tap. An abnormal EEG could have various causes like brain tumor, attention problems, cerebral infarction, head injury, enceplalitis, migraines, seizure disorders and sleep disorders. Therefore; it would be prudent to consult your neurologist with these concerns. Take care.",
