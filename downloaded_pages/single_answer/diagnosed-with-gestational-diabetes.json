My doctor wants a 24hr urine, EKG,more blood work to check thyroid and other things. This has me all worked up! My doctor at 12 weeks told me I had a miscarriage and called me in a pill to open my cervix and before going f to pick up the medicine he sent me to the hospital for a xray of my tubes....I'm 19 weeks now and he was way wrong and now I feel he is making me do so much extra all the time. To me I have felt awesome and fine and every appt it feels he trust to scare me or make me feel like there is always a concern.",
