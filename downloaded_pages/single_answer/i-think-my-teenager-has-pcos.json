            "answer": "HiI am 14 alsoMy mom will not let me take Oral Antibio's but I do recommend talking to your doctor about getting your daughter some topical antibiotics to use to treat her acne. Clindamycin, Benzaclin, Retin-A, and others. There are a lot of options. Proactiv didnt work for me, and it wont work for most. Main ingredient is benzoyl peroxide, and that doesnt help squatola with my acne.I believe I have PCOS as well. I'm going to the doctor soon to discuss it. I am really quite sure I have it. I get sharp pelvic pain, about every 6 months. My periods are often extremely heavy, extremely light, bloodless, and very irregular. Sometimes I skip a month and a couple times I've got two in one month.But really, it's important that you make sure she has pelvic pain. Sharp, Stabbing pains. Those are a sure sign of PCOS.",

    "question": "I have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) related to insulin resistance myself, and there's a family history of insulin problems, thyroid problems, and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My 14-year-old has irregular periods (not unusual since she just started last year), bad facial acne and facial hair problems.\u00a0\u00a0She has had a belly fat problem since she was a child, but she isn't overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I mentioned my concerns to my family practitioner and he tested her thyroid levels and blood sugar levels, both of which were normal.\u00a0\u00a0Talking to a PCOS friend, she says my kid definitely looks PCOS to her and suggested we have her estrogen/testesterone/androgen etc levels tested and get her on glucophage and possibly birth control pills, and oral antibiotics for the acne.Does this sound reasonable?\u00a0\u00a0This poor kid is afraid to show her face in public because so many people comment on her skin.\u00a0\u00a0She comes from a family history of skin problems on both sides (great genetics we have...) but mostly in the males.\u00a0\u00a0We've currently been trying proactive for three months, and it seems to be keeping the acne from spreading, but does nothing to relieve it.Any other ideas?",
