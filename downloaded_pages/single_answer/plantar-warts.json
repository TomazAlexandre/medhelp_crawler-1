            "answer": "Warts are very stubborn.\u00a0\u00a0I've seen patients that had them for 6+ years!\u00a0\u00a0Typically, i cut these lesions out (down to\u00a0\u00a0the basement layer of your skin) and perform a rotation of the adjacent skin to allow for closure.\u00a0\u00a0This works well and has very little recurrence rate.\u00a0\u00a0I would consider having this done by someone who has the training to do so.As for the nail whiteness:\u00a0\u00a0sounds like yeast.\u00a0\u00a0You can go to a podiatrist to get a dermabrasion of the nail to remove most of the yeast.\u00a0\u00a0Then, topical ketoconazole 2% cream (prescription) applied twice daily for 4 weeks should do the trick.\u00a0\u00a0The numbness could stem from a drug reaction, vit b12 deficiency, or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It's difficult to assess without seeing you.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend getting this checked out by your podiatrist.",

    "question": "I've had Plantar Warts for years now.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a podiatrist who started out trying to get rid of them with acid and scraping but that started being too painful.\u00a0\u00a0She tried freezing them but it only worked superficially.\u00a0\u00a0So she did surgery.\u00a0\u00a0She put me out and I think that she used a laser to cut them out.\u00a0\u00a0I have two large ones on the the side of my right foot and a cluster near one on the bottom.\u00a0\u00a0Sure enough, 6 mo later they came back.\u00a0\u00a0I've just been filing them down and moisturizing to keep them from snagging my hose.\u00a0\u00a0I read somewhere that they should have gone away on their own after a while.\u00a0\u00a0My question is are they a symptom of something else going on?\u00a0\u00a0I'm having other issues that seem to me to be autoimmune in nature or neuropathic.\u00a0\u00a0I have also developed white areas under some of my toenails. They are not powdery.\u00a0\u00a0And for the last 10 years I've had numbness in the second toe of both feet and burning on the bottom (like I just walked across a hot sidewalk).\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time.",
