    "question": "I'm a 39 y.o. woman with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis who has been taking thyroid replacement since 2000 (Synthroid since 08, Armour prior to that). I have been working with my OBGYN & endocrinologist to figure out why I am still plagued with hypo symptoms & continue to gain weight, when there is no logical reason for it.Among the discoveries made by these two drs in the past 6 mths are: ovarian cysts & uterine fibroids w/enlarged uterus (treated w/3 mths progesterone), PCOS & insulin resistance (insulin & HOMA-IR were WAY above normal, just started Metformin therapy).On my bloodwork from my OBGYN in June, my eGFR was slightly low (58) with a slightly elevated creatinine (1.06 with a \"normal\" range listed as 0.57-1.00). I noticed my dr. made a note to himself to reference more info on the Kidney Assn. website, but no mention was made to me, at my followup appt.On 01-06-10, I had lab work done with my endo. At this visit, my eGFR was even lower (53.2) and my creatinine was 1.2. Again, no mention was made of this, although, in his defense, my endo was focusing so much on my insulin & thyroid levels, at this visit, which were very much out of range.I am trying to figure out if I have cause for concern here, as the research I have done suggests that any eGFR below 59, for a woman, is suggestive of possible kidney damage, and an even bigger concern is when subsequent labs continue to show a drop, as they have in my case.I am obese (240 lbs), so I know that can affect the numbers, but I also have been plagued, over the yrs, with various auto-immune issues (ITP, Hashimoto's), and I know that that can also cause damage to kidneys. With my family's history of type 2 diabetes, that adds yet another concern. Can anyone with knowledge in this area advise if there's reason for concern? Thanks, Angela",
