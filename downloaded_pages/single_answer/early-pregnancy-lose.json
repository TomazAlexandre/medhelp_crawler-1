            "answer": "I'm so sorry you're experiencing this.\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately you'll want to seek a physician's diagnosis, but here's a few causes that can lead to mulitple chemical pregnancies:Endocrine (Hormonal) Imbalances resulting in a short luteal phase.\u00a0\u00a0A luteal phase must be long enough, at least 10 days (over 12 days being ideal), to allow a fertilized egg to have a chance to implant and mature.\u00a0\u00a0If the luteal phase is too short, you'll begin to shed the lining (period) because your body hasn't enough time to register there's a fertilized egg.\u00a0\u00a0Most physicians will prescribe Clomid to promote optimal ovulation and a health progesterone level in the luteal phase.Uterine Abnormalties are also common, such as a heart-shaped uterus, or a uterus that may have cysts, fibroids, scar tissue development, or endometriosis, all of which impede successful implantation.Production of Antibodies by your immune system is also known to cause miscarriages.\u00a0\u00a0This is when the mother's own body rejects or fights off this new growth (fetus) by producing antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0A blood test would be able to determine if the antibodies are being produced close to the time of a miscarriage.Uncontrolled diabetes, overweight/underweight, thyroid disease, high blood pressure, unknown infections, or other medical disorders can have an effect, too.If you check out okay in all these categories and tests performed by your physician, you may want to have your partner's sperm tested for prostaglandins, a treatable condition.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!!",
