            "answer": "Hi!Either you do not eat well or there is increased metabolism as in hyperthyroid states, HIV, cancer etc. Poor absorption as in irritable bowel syndromes and malabsorption syndromes too is possible. Malabsorption syndromes are seen in intestinal tuberculosis, HIV, tropical sprue, parasites in stool and Whipple\u2019s Disease. Diabetes too can be the cause. Hyperthyroid states and diabetes can be associated with low vitamin D. Hence get this investigated. Deficiency of Vit D can result from several causes such as: inadequate intake, inadequate exposure to sunlight, gut disorders such as IBS, Crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes and even gastric bypass that limit its absorption, and impaired conversion of vitamin D into active metabolites such as in liver or kidney disorders. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
