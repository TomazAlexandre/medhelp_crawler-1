    "question": "Hello. First off I want to say thank you for the service here. I hope I am not asking a question which is already in the archives, but I did give an honest search. I am a 24 year old male with a persistent case of oral thrush which has been confirmed by a doctor. I have had it off and on for months ever sense I used antibiotics after a wisdom tooth removal back in September. The thrush has gotten worse in the last two weeks, and I finally went to my doctor and he agreed it was thrush and prescribed nystatin 100000 5 times a day. I currently only take the antifungal and adderral for ADHD. I do not have HIV, I don't fit the symptomatic criteria for diabetes and I used to smoke and abuse alcohol and xanax, but I quit the drinking and drugs two years ago and the smoking two weeks ago. My question is why would I ha ve thrush with no known conditions to impair my immune system, and is it normal withnystatin for it to get better after dosing and then get worse a few hours later? Would cancer be likely or worse? Thank you.",
