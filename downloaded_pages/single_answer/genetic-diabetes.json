These are the two diabetes tests:1. OGTT/GTT - http://tinyurl.com/6azl9d2. A1c - http://tinyurl.com/58u7edThese will determine if you are normal, prediabetic or diabetic.Genetically Mutated - My understanding of this is, and I stand to be corrected,\u00a0\u00a0is science has discovered a cell passed from parent to child that makes one more likely to to inherit the disease. The answer may come from the above tests.I would also have your thyroid checked.",

    "question": "I am a 27 Female who has recently began to have many medical problems (drinking lots of water, blurry vision, headaches, dry mouth, itchy skin, especialy in the groin area, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0I initailly thought I had type 2 diabetes since it runs in my family, but all of my tests were normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have since been to the Gyno and Urologist and all of my test are still coming up normal (renal ultrasound, colposcopy w/biopsy, blood work, urine cultures).\u00a0\u00a0Most recently my right toenail on my big toe has started flling off - I believe it's becasue of a beau line (I suffered no trauma to the toe).\u00a0\u00a0After reading up on things more I noticed that beau lines can be caused by diabetes (which I don't have) but also by something having to do with beta blockers in your system.\u00a0\u00a0I had also read that there are other types of Diabetes that are genetic mutations which can also affect beta blockers.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a doctor and don't understand about 80% of what I was reading, but the diabetes research said that this mutated type of diabetes is difficult to detect and wouldn't show up in the standard glucose tests.\u00a0\u00a0Is there really a \"Genetically Mutated\" type of diabetes and is it possible I could have it?\u00a0\u00a0If so, how to I broach the subject with my PCP without sounding crazy?",
