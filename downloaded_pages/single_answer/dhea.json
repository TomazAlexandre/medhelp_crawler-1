            "answer": "DHEA is produced in the adrenal glands.A low DHEA can mean a variety of things. Conditions thought to be related to diminished levels of DHEA include inflammatory diseases, metabolic syndrome, cancer, osteoporosis, type II diabetes, disturbances of the immune system, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's. Aging lowers the level, too.DHEA is sort of a minefield right now. It isn't that well understood. New findings and claims are popping up faster than they can be studied properly.You need to correct the low level, but if you look online you will find a lot of \"cure everything\" or \"live forever\" stuff. Body builders are chugging it down, and a lot of people are jumping on bandwagons with no wheels.Not to make light of your test result.Just saying, it could mean several things, and DHEA supplements have been all the rage for a few years. Makes it hard to sort the truth from the fiction.",
