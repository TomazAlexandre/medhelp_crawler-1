            "answer": "There is no specific age, although the average age is somewhere around 64 or so. It's not entirely impossible for you to have it, but the chances are very very slim. It sounds more like Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, or PCOS. Some of the symptoms are multiple cysts, being overweight, glucose intolerance (diabetes), and facial hair. There is a PCOS forum here on MedHelp. Perhaps you could read some of the posts and see if it sounds familiar. If you haven't done so, you should also have your blood sugar tested. If its high, now is the time to get control of it. It could also help you lose some weight. Can your mom or someone you trust help you do a little research?You are doing the right thing by asking questions. Not too many girls your age are proactive with their healthcare. You have a great start!Good luck to you!Gail",

    "question": "I'm a bit worried. I am only 14 and I already had many,many ovarian cyst. My first one being nearly so big, I almost needed surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I have been in the hospital for the pain. Lately, Ive been getting full real easily. Maybe after the first few bites. And I've been losing my appetite quickly. And I feel pressure down low.A while back, I was put on a low esteren Birth control specifically for my cyst so they would atleast not get as huge. But I've been reading on Ovarian Cancer articles lately and I've been coming to the question of having Ovarian Cancer? On my mom's side of the family, Breast Cancer is passed down in every generation. My mom, and her two sisters all got breast cancer. Their mom died of it. I am a fairly big person weighing over 200 pounds. How old can you be to get ovarian cancer?",
