            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From your description of symptoms, it certainly sounds that you are suffering from post viral fatigue syndrome that may originate after a long lasting viral infection or if you had viral illness plus underlying disorder such as anemia, diabetes etc. One may experience muscle pain, headache, no refreshing sleep, malaise, pains in joints and sometimes nerve compression symptoms (tingling/weakness). To diagnose this it is quite essential that your doctor first evaluate common accompaniment of other disorders such as anemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes, kidney or liver dysfunction and may be persistent (or not properly cured) infection. Meanwhile, you should keep your immunity high by taking a balanced diet, avoid stress, take brisk morning walk and take sufficient sleep. This will surely help you in recovering from your symptoms much faster. Hope this information proves helpful.Take Care & Regards!!!",

    "question": "Hi,Can someone telll me whether post viral syndrome really exists please.For about a year now on and off i've had pins & needles and tingly feeling in my right hand only lasting for a few days or so. From about Sept this year i noticed it was a lot worse than normal and that the whole of my right arm starting going numb and tingly and slightly heavy too and was suffering severe tiredness so i went to my GP. He referred me to a Neuro. By the time i saw the Neuro my symptoms had got worse. Really heavy right arm, (Struggled to brush my hair or lift a plate) and it was sometimes on my left side too. Buzzing feelings around the body, arm/shoulder tremors and blurry vision.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as i mentioned to the Neuro that i had noticed the symptoms this time round started up 3 days after i'd got rid of a cold - he suddenly said he thought it was more than likely post viral!.. Although he did send me for a spine MRI - which i am now awaiting the results. (After seeing the GP in Sept and before the Neuro app, i had numbness of my neck and back and my lip, motion sickness, frequent tremors all over the body)... they disappeared and then after seeing the neurologist mid Nov up until my scan on 16th Dec my symptoms returned pins & needles/heavyness/tingly right arm and hand.. jelly legs, tingly inside knee caps, fluttering in back of head, tight, restrictive, corset feeling around my waist and internal tremors and noticable tremors of both arms/shoulders, neck etc and eye tremors and pain, tingling around the armpit area and down my sides/ribs (both sides) and brain fog, struggling to think of words and having to re read things over and over before i could take it in... I went back to the GP who made me feel like i was making all these symptoms up and just said oh well i really do think its post viral like the neurologist thinks and it'll go in time, and then shooed me out the door.My questions are : -1. Even if the symptoms from the september episode were post viral (after the cold i had) - how does he explain the numb/tingly hands that have been going on previously to that!.. i don't remember having been ill for it to have triggered them!2. How long does post viral last for? does it come and go every few months? and get worse each time?3. And if my symptoms keep getting worse how do i know when/if i should go back to the GP without him just going to say oh its still just post viral and make me feel like i'm wasting his time again?4. Could it be something more than post viral. The GP and Neuro have done lots of blood tests all back clear and like i said a spinal MRI but thats it.Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
