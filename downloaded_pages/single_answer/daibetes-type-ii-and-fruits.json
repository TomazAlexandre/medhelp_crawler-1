            "answer": "Hi,In general fruits are good and not to be avoided entirely . They offer a great deal of benefits that should not be ignored. That said, fruits that are higher in fiber content(like apples) and water(like watermelon) may be better for you. Fruit juices can cause sharp increases in blood sugar so if you want those, try to stay with high pulpy juices and perhaps dilute them down a bit. Hope this helps.Take care.",
