            "answer": "Hello Jmm1.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry to learn of your son's severe eye problems. In spite of all the new diabetic medications and all the advances in eye surgery and laser, diabetes remains a leading cause of new blindness in the world.It is not inevitable that your son's eyes will both end up alike. However it sounds like they both have the same problems and the same age and exposed to the same metabolic conditions.Many paired organs do not follow in lock-step. For instance many people need one hip or one knee replaced even though they are the same age, one is shot and the other is just fine.Remain close to your eye physicians and meticulously control the diabetes.Good luckJCH III MD Eye Physician and Surgeon",

    "question": "my son has been type 1 diabetic for 16 yrs. november 06 had lots of laser and 2 victrectomies on his right eye. the doctors also discovered glaucoma. he still has no vision in that eye but my concern is his left eye. since november they had been watching the left eye very carefully because of what happened to his right one. so far they have done alot of laser and glaucoma surgery for his pressure (a shunt was placed for drainage).i don't think they want to take a chance doing a victrectomy considering it didn't work for his right eye. my question is, does one eye follow the other, so if he lost all sight in his right will the same happen to the left? he only has about 25% vision in that eye as it is.thankyou",
