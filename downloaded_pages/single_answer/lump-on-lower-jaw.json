Closure of the hole or abscess may be delayed for some due to various factors such as medical condition an d over-all health of patient. Medical conditions such as diabetes may also delay healing. It is good that the hole has been closing, you may need to observe this for a few days and return for follow-up as advised by your dentist. Hope this helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hi,I have had a hard swelling under an old root canal on my lower right second last molar. I went to the dentist and had the tooth removed and had a course of antibiotics. The dentist showed me a large black hole on the x-ray and said it was an abscess. I was going to have an implant inserted but when I went back 6 weeks later the hole hadn't closed enough. The hole has been closing but the lump has not gone, and every now and then the lump swells up slightly again and can be a little bit painful.Any advice on what it could be? Has the dentist missed something a bit more serious?",
