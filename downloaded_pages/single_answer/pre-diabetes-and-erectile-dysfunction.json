            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. It is difficult to say whether the ED is related to pre-diabetes status or not. If your fasting blood sugar is in pre-diabetes status, your PP sugar may be in diabetes status. You need to get this checked immediately. A fasting, PP and HbA1c will need to be done. Also, you may need get a dopplar study of penile blood vessels, rule out varicoceles as cause of ED and get a EMG/NCV to fine out if you have peripheral neuropathy. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi AllI used to never think about erections at all until one day (Feb2013) during sex ... my penis was just semi hard ... and her ** .. HJ and penetration did not get it hard .. ... Ever since I have tried to have sex with a few others but even if I am hard initially I will go semi hard in 5-10 minutes. So I tried to use the liquors store male enhancement pill (Zen) this gives me the hard erection for about 3-4 days but also gives me unusual headaches, tingling at fingers tips and lower back pain which is not at all pleasant. If someone knows are these pills at liquor stores safe for use?\u00a0\u00a0 I cannot anymore get hard by grinding, or just making out with a girl. I had been a pre-diabetic in early 2012 but I got under control in six months with strict diet and exercise (160 lbs jan2013) put started eating everything later to look big (now my weight 197 lbs). I just checked my blood sugar again now i am getting consistent fasting blood sugar readings in prediabetic range.Anyway, ,my question .. I think my ED is mostly related to pre-diabetic .. so if I reverse my pre-diabetic will I be able to achieve normal erections again?\u00a0\u00a0or is the damage to my arteries irreversible?\u00a0\u00a0Also, is there any exercises diet that will help Pre-diabetic and ED condition now?\u00a0\u00a0 Also if you can suggest any tests to confirm my ED with prediabetes I will get it done.",
