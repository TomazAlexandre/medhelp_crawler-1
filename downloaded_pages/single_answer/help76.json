    "question": "So recently i have developed asistic acne, and i have never had problems with acne. Im currently on accutane which is working good but i also have noticed that none of my skin heals as fast as it should. just for an example i have to get blood work done monthly and the whole left from the needle takes over a week before it is barely noticable or even healed. i have ruled out diabetes as a factor. Ive also developed really bad pain in my back as well as all of my joints and i have no idea whats going on??",
