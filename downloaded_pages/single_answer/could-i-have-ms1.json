            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth, dental caries, etc\u00a0\u00a0can all cause facial numbness and pain. They can also cause ear numbness that spreads to face. Since you also have a sore throat, you should check for swollen glands. If you find them it could be EBV infection or infectious mononucleosis. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
