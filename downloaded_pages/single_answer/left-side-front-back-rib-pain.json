    "question": "Hi :)I recently started (past 2 days) to have throbbing pain right under my left breast and directly behind in my back.\u00a0\u00a0I have had no changes in my bowel habits...no acid reflux is present. This pain does not occur after eating either..seems random...I had my gallbladder out about 5 years ago..Just stopped working..no stones.\u00a0\u00a0Hard to say if any other symptoms are connected as I just had a baby via c-section 12 weeks ago...so..sleep deprived.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to waste my time in the doctors office if this is likely to be no big deal..That said, if it could be something dangerous..being home with 2 small children..I would go.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts on what could be going on?\u00a0\u00a0Oh, I also had gestational diabetes with both pregnancies....My specialist thinks I went into type 2 right after my first in Jan 08 as I tested very early (16 weeks) with this last pregnancy for the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I still need to go to confirm whether the diabetes has left or not. Plan on doing in January.Thanks for any help you can give..Anna",
