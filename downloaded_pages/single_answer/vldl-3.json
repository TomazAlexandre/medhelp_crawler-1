            "answer": "VLDL-3 is the densest LDL sub-fraction, and is associated with a greater risk factor for heart disease than both VLDL1 and VLDL2. When breaking down LDL, particles vary in size, ranging from small, dense \u201cPattern B\u201d particles to large, buoyant \u201cPattern A\u201d particles. Smaller LDL particles are associated with an increased risk for heart disease. Small, dense LDL (\u201cPattern B\u201d) is associated with insulin resistance or diabetes.Simply put, VLDL-3 is the smallest and most dense particle of LDL (Bad cholesterol) in your system. It is more prone to collect in an artery and is less likely to bind with HDL to be removed from your blood.Again, statins are very effective when used along with lifestyle changes that include exercise and diet. By lowering your triglyceride levels, you also lower your VLDL cholesterol levels. Healthy lifestyle changes such as losing excess weight and exercising regularly can help lower triglyceride levels. Also, avoid sugary foods and alcohol, which have a particularly potent effect on increasing triglycerides.Hope this helps,Jon",
