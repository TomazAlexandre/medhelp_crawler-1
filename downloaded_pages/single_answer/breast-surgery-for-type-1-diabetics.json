    "question": "Hello!I am currently considering breast enlargement but I am a Type 1 Diabetic (3 years). My diabetes is reasonably well controlled, my blood sugars are a little on the high side. I realise I need to get my diabtetes completely under control before going ahead with this, but can you give me some advice on how to ensure I am not one of the unlucky 25% who have to have the implant out?I always heal very well, have numerous piercings and tattoos that have all been fine and healed well. I do not generally get infections or illnesses and think my immune system is very good.I just wanted to know if there are things I can do prior to the surgery to make sure it goes as smoothly as possible, or if there are any supplements I can take to aid it?What are your experiences of type 1 diabetics and breast enlargement?Thanks for your help!Jen",
