            "answer": "Hi JoPenn999,I am a volunteer not a physician so the only information I can give is based on my own experiences with Type 1 diabetes. I really have no experience with renal problems or urinary tract infections. My suggestion when you go to your doctor is explain your symptoms exactly as you have done here, perhaps in a little more detail. Since your renal scan was clear you can ask what are the symptoms of renal problems. In looking at some websites regarding kidney disease here are some first sign symptoms they post.Symptoms and diagnosis of kidney diseaseThe kidneys work hard to make up for the failing capillaries so kidney disease produces no symptoms until almost all function is gone. Also, the symptoms of kidney disease are not specific. The first symptom of kidney disease is often fluid buildup. Other symptoms of kidney disease include loss of sleep, poor appetite, upset stomach, weakness, and difficulty concentrating.I cannot comment about the back pain again I am not a doctor, chronic back pain can be a symptom of many conditions. Again a doctor would know best. The American Diabetes Association website has a lot of information which may help you form the questions you would like to ask. Hope all turns out well. Keep in touch and let us know how it goes. CG",
