            "answer": "Hello,I cannot confirm anything without examination but it can be contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis, vascular eczema or lichen simplex chronicus. I suggest you to get an evaluation done from a dermatologist. Till then he should keep his legs elevated while sitting and apply some calamine lotion of the legs. He can also take an antihistaminic for the itching.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
