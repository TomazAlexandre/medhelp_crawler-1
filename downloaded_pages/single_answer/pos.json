    "question": "Does having POS mean you have many cysts on your ovary or can you have a single large cyst? Also what are some warning signs you may Have POS? I have been having cysts since\u00a0\u00a0was 11 years old and i am now 24. I am on brth control and i stll seem to get cysts. My peroids have been irregular in the past 6 months. When i do miss a perod i get all the sympyoms lke back pain and sever cramps but no peroid. Currently i have one cyst on my right ovary that started off being 6.5 cm and after 7 months it is now 1.5cm. I asked my ob/gyn what it could be but she did not say anything much... said somethng on the lines of \"maybe your just a cyst maker?\" what the hell is that? I had a CT scan and i have a appointment on Monday to get the results. I just want to be able to walk in the office knowing what im talking about. If anyone could give me some insight that would be great!",
