            "answer": "Hi,You are dealing with quite a lot there, so I can understand your frustration.Your diabetes regimen is quite complex, and I do think you should be seeing an Endocrinologist to help streamline the regimen. Given your first interection with the one you saw, perhaps seek out a dfferent doc with whom you have better rapport?It is not uncommon to be on large amounts of insulin, and also requiring some orals to help the body use the insulin more efficiently(and in some cases help balance out the weight-gaining effects of insulin). Your blood sugars are still too high however, if they really are in the 250-300 range. Some people simply need higher doses of insulin--you probably have severe insulin resistance. I have had patients on 500 units of insulin a day because that is just what their body needed. Don't be afraid of the number of the dose--give your body what it needs and in the best way possible. I do not know if your regimen is the best it can be.\u00a0\u00a0The Levimer may need to be split in two, or perhaps the entire regimen changed completely.I strongly suggest you speak with your doc about seeing another specialist who can\u00a0\u00a0work with you on getting a regimen that works better than your current one, and is more ammenable to you as well. hang in there. Your situation is a tough one, but you can do it.Take care and feel free to write back with other questions.",
