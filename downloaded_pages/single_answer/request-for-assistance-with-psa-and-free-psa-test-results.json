    "question": "My vital statistics and family hx are as follows: Age: 38; Sex: Male; Ht: 5' 5\"; Wt: 162 lbs; Father: recently passed away at the age of 73 secondary Prostate Cancer which got metastasized and as a result he had bone cancer as well; Mother: has diabetes and previously has had benign tumor removed; Older Brother: Healthy; Race: Asian-IndianAbout a 2 weeks ago 04/23/07 as part of routine check I had blood test done and the results indicated I had PSA level of 3.5, subsequent to this at the request of my doctor I had more lab work done yesterday and was just advised yesterday, 05/07/07, of the following:PSA level: 3.68 with Free PSA level of 8Additionally, the doctor stated that the above numbers would be indicative that I probably have a 24% chance of having prostate cancer. The doctor I have been seeing and who has ordered the test does family practice and has now referred me to a urologist for further tests and exams.Given the above I would just like an independent opinion of another doctor from this forum. I understand without the benefit of examining me and/or looking at the lab results first hand it would be hard to provide an accurate opinion. Never the less, if you could please provide your feedback and analysis I would greatly appreciate it.I thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to your feedback.Sincerely, Concerned Patient",
