            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to meralgia parasthetica or parasthesia. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I am currently experiencing a burning/road rash like sensation on my inner and top of thigh.\u00a0\u00a0There are no visible signs of anything- redness etc...\u00a0\u00a0I am almost convinced its some sort of nerve issue.\u00a0\u00a0Like something is lieing to my nerves saying there is a problem in the affected area, when theres not.\u00a0\u00a0While browsing the internet, I have become aware of the conditon called\u00a0\u00a0meralgia paresthetica.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms I have read that are associated with it are tingling, numbness and burning.\u00a0\u00a0But I do not feel tingling or numbness- just burning.\u00a0\u00a0The burning sensation is constant; meaning everytime my pants material slightly touch my skin or if my other leg touches the inside of my right (affected) thigh.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is from any slight contact with the area.\u00a0\u00a0Firm pressure does not actually hurt, only a light touch.\u00a0\u00a0This is on my right thigh only. Top and inner, from mid-thigh to the knee.\u00a0\u00a0I will add that I have experienced this before.\u00a0\u00a0The first time was about 3-4 years ago, and it lasted for apprx. 1 month.\u00a0\u00a0Then it happened last year, again for about 1 month.\u00a0\u00a0It has been going on currently for about 1 week.\u00a0\u00a0It is driving me crazy more than anything.\u00a0\u00a0I feel that I should let whoever's reading this know that I also have Hashimoto's Hypothroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Which I have heard can be associated with meralgia paresthetica (in what way or what level I dont know).\u00a0\u00a0Could this be meralgia paresthetica or something else I have not heard of?\u00a0\u00a0Again- No visible symptoms (nor will there be, I know by now).\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for reading this- I hope somebody has some great ideas.\u00a0\u00a0I have attatched a photo outlining the area.Sincerely, Frank",
