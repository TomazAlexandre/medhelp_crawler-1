            "answer": "Generally it is advised to take it easy during the week\u00a0\u00a0following PCI/angiogram.This is mainly for the entry wound in the groin area.Walking stairs and lifting weights should be limited and/or done with care to avoid post-procedural bleeding.Also driving is not allowed for a week.When the catheter is fed in via the wrist in stead of the groin (radial instead of femoral), recovery can be quicker.If you take it easy and do not lift heavy suitcases etc, you may perhaps travel earlier.After an angiogram or routine angioplasty, you may be able to fly after 2-3 days.You should check your insurance company if you travel abroad. Many medical insurance companies will not provide insurance within 1 month of an angioplasty procedurePersonally, I would not travel to a remote area, shortly after angioplasty is performed.",

    "question": "My partner is having an angiogram after suffering chest pains a few weeks ago. NAD was found at the time from blood tests and ECG (done over 18 hours). Was kept in overnight. Had no discomfort since, but suffers from type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol which are all controlled and low due to medication.His chest pains were\u00a0\u00a04 weeks ago and he's had nothing since. At the time of his chest pains the emergency doctors said not heart related and probably pulled muscles in his chest. After being sent for a treadmill test, which they wouldn't do due to T waves, we went to see a cardiologist privately.\u00a0\u00a0An angiogram was recommended.Now in the situation where being teachers, we're on holiday for 6 weeks and have been forced to cancel our much awaited holiday abroad. Just hoping insurance will cover as we declared all conditions.Just wonder when the angiogram is done in the next week, what will the advice be on travelling abroad? That's if nothing abnormal is detected? Could we travel a week after an angiogram and what is the advice should angioplasty be required?Thanks if you can advise. I know at the end of the day, it'll be down to the cardiologist.",
