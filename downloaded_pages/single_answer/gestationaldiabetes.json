Starving yourself is bad for you, bad for baby and will cause many other issues. Eat a healthy diet of mostly whole foods.\u00a0\u00a0Indulge every now and then. Drink lots of water, nearly a gallon a day.\u00a0\u00a0Cut back on things like white bread, white rice and potatoes. Eat high fiber fruit and veggies.",
