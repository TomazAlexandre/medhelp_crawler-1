    "question": "About eight months ago I began having a tingling sensation in my right foot and sometimes leg. It pretty much went away for about four months, and only bugged me when I went running. A couple of months ago it came back, and much worse. It\u2019s mainly on the top of my right foot and continues up to below my knee and also in my right hand to below my elbow. It keeps me up at night, and irritates me regularly, especially while at my office desk, running, and driving. I went into a chiropractor for TMJ issues, which I had never had, and recent migraines, also new to me. I casually mentioned the numbness after a few visits, and have sense had a cervical spine MRI and lumbar MRI. The Physiatrist I was referred to was expecting to see a slipped disk but did not anything to be concerned with. I am a 23 years old and have not been having normal menstrual cycles, and have been incredibly tired (not pregnant). I have always been full of energy but I feel so exhausted some days and then completely fine others. I don't know if these symptoms have anything to do with each other. What could be the cause of the pins and needles? They are talking about brain MRI next, is this necessary?\u00a0\u00a0No one has suggested blood work should I rule out diabetes?",
