            "answer": "Hi, the squeezing type of pain may not be due to GERD. As there was relief with nitro, more likely a cardiac cause for the pain. Further stress testing or an angiogram may throw more light on this. Follow up with your doctor. Good luck & regards.",

    "question": "Male, 57, smoker, daily red wine, overweight. Normal BP, no diabetes. Had ablations 2 years ago to fix PVCs (all good). Had Angio 3 years ago to explore, DR said he could drive a truck thru my veins. Have a bit of GERD lately but nothing thats not manageable.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Had an episode sunday night that landed me in ER. Had EXTREME squeezing in center of chest, radiating outward in all directions, shortness of breath, cold sweat, nauseous. Paramedics applied Nitro, it helped right away. EKG looked normal, x-ray normal, CT w/Iodine normal except for\u00a0\u00a0calcified plaque in left anterior descending artery...no dimensions or percentages provided (I assume if it was bad enough they would have given numbers and given me a stent). Enzyme test negative. Conclusion: Could be Esophagus spasm, but follow up with cardiologist. Please offer an opinion before I see my cardio DR.",
