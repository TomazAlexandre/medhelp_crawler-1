    "question": "Hello,I am a 33 year old african american and has diabetes/hypertension/chlolesterol. I have for the past 4 years taking a stress test which has been negative along with my chloesterol levels. My blood sugars have been out of control until i went to see an endocologist now they are under control. My recent visit to the doctor(cardiologist) stated that he saw abnomality in my stress test 0f moderate iischemia. But he believes that due to me being overweight is a false positive rate. he is repeating a calcium score and claudication which my calcium score(2006) was a 0 score. Also he wants to a cartoid to insure that there is nothing going on. Can weight be a factor of a false testing?",
