            "answer": "Thyroid dysfunction can affect BP -- usually hypo increases diastolic, hyper increases systolic.\u00a0\u00a0This is not too hard to sort out in most cases -- checking the thyroid levels (TSH) will tell you if you are in a normal range or not.\u00a0\u00a0Synthroid itself should not cause an increase in BP if the thyroid levels are normal.",

    "question": "In November 2007 my doctor put me on 88mcg of Synthroid because her interpretation of my TSH llevelsl led her\u00a0\u00a0to believe I had hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed starting in January 2008 my blood pressure readings started to go up, but they seemed vary quite a bit so I thought everything was okay.\u00a0\u00a0During the past 9 months my blood pressure, especially the systolic has increased significantly, most of my lowest readings have been 154/80.\u00a0\u00a0My pulse rate has also increased.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on Lotensin 40mg BID, HCTZ 25mg, and Toprol XL 50mg for about 5 years and suddenly none of those drugs are keeping my blood pressure down.\u00a0\u00a0My cardiologist tried me on Bystolic and Sular, but still no noticable improvement.\u00a0\u00a0Now he wants put me on Minoxdil and the side effects scare me to death, beside I don't think the root cause of problem has been addressed --overdosage of Synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0I am 64, weigh 140, have diabetes and coronary artery disease.\u00a0\u00a0 I sent a fax describing the situation to the doctor who prescribed Synthroid but so far no response.\u00a0\u00a0How do I get these two doctors to consult about my problem.\u00a0\u00a0Do I need to change doctors or what?\u00a0\u00a0Any advice you can provide me will be greatly appreciated.",
