            "answer": "Hello,Thank you for your post.The only way that you might put yourself at risk, with or without gloves is in the case of a needle stick injury, and even so, the risk is low.\u00a0\u00a0Provided that does not happen, there is no risk for you.\u00a0\u00a0HIV cannot go through the gloves if you are wearing them; but even in the case that you did not have any gloves on and blood comes into contact with your skin, that would not pose any risk of infection either.Best wishes,Dr Jos\u00e9",

    "question": "Hello Doctor,I think my paranoia is in over drive (probably should get that checked out) but I have a question regarding HIV transmission in the health care setting.I work at a clinic and perform health care testing for patients (diabetes, cholesterol, INR, etc)I always use vinyl gloves (latex allergy) and sometimes I get blood on the gloves but have never seen blood on my hand because I always check afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0My assumption has always been if you wear gloves, no holes in glove..then there is NO risk of transmission.Another healthcare worker told me that HIV can pass through the tiny pin holes in gloves and put you at risk for infection.\u00a0\u00a0Is this true? Or would the virus have to be in the blood and not outside of it.I guess I'm confused.\u00a0\u00a0I figured if I saw no blood on my hands, then I'm never at risk.Please help.",
