            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you tested negative for HIV at 6 months post exposure or after that then you do not have HIV. Jock itch can be either fungal or due to sweat dermatitis. Please keep the area clean, dry and apply some topical antiseptics. OTC anti allergics will help. You can apply topical creams with zinc oxide and mild steroids and see if it helps. In case the symptoms persist then antifungals (Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1% and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%. Many OTC products containing these salts are available, your pharmacist can help. Try a combination of two and apply until the infection you see disappears) may be needed. Other than that it can be an allergic reaction to something. For confirmed diagnosis please consult a skin specialist.Burning sensation in the feet can be due to plantar fasciitis, diabetes, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, peripheral neuropathies, hypothyroidism, SLE, alcoholism, peripheral artery disease, sciatica, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis and high blood pressure. You will need blood tests, nerve conduction studies and dopplar studies to reach a diagnosis.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
