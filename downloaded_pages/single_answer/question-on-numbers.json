    "question": "I did a glucose fasting test about 3 weeks ago, and my fasting number was 144. My doctor and I talked, and I have increased my exercise, I'm cutting out the sweets, eating a lo-carb diet with lots of veggies and fruits, some whole grains. I'm trying to deal with it nutritionally first to see if a lifestyle change affects my numbers.\u00a0\u00a0I have not even been diagnosed with pre-diabetes, but I'm quite aware of the whole deal since my 18 year old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes 2 1/2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor wants me to test my blood 4-5 times a day. My daughter loaned me an extra meter and I have been faithfully checking my glucose for the past 3 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0The first week my morning number were high..anywhere from 143-155.\u00a0\u00a0And then throughout the day were between 133-145. Now the past week my numbers are lowering to 111 or 112 in the morning, and never going over 135 after I eat.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my question is, are these numbers before eating in the morning within normal range or are they still high?\u00a0\u00a0I'm going back to my doctor in a month.\u00a0\u00a0I have read that fasting numbers in the morning should be below 100.\u00a0\u00a0Is that right?",
