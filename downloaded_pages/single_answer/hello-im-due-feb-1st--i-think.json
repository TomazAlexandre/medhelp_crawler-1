            "answer": "You may not get sick at all! Here's hoping! :-)Everyone is so different. I'm beginning to get sensitive to smells (usually the smell of corn doesn't bother me, but I gagged when feeding it to my son yesterday).Even if you have symptoms, they could come and go. You may hate the smell of your hubby's cologne one week, and not mind it the next. You may feel fatigued for three days straight, then suddenly feel like you could run a marathon. You just never know! LOLBelieve me, you'll start feeling little changes in your body before long! And you'll be crying over little things, too! I remember crying about a commercial that showed a man talking about how you should make sure to get checked for diabetes. At the end, he stood up to walk away and he was using a cane because he was blind. He said something like \"I wish I had\" . I started sobbing uncontrollably when I realized he was blind. My poor hubby had to witness the whole thing. I just looked at him and said \"That was sad.\"\u00a0\u00a0We had a good laugh about it later.Anyway, the emotional, hormonal roller coaster is just beginning. Try to enjoy the ride as much as possible!\u00a0\u00a0:-)",
