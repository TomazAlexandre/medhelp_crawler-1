            "answer": "Hi!It is difficult to diagnose the cause on net. Generally bad odor is due to infection, mainly by E coli. This can be diagnosed by urine culture. Strong fruity odor is due to uncontrolled diabetes. Urinary bladder infection and kidney infections do produce strong smelling urine. Another reason is dehydration. Strong ammonia smell is due to protein breakdown.A routine urine examination along with a urine culture will be able to detect the problem. Drink plenty of fluids and water and see if that helps. Also if you are on crash diets etc then protein breakdown can cause an ammonia smell. Also diet rich in protein can be the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
