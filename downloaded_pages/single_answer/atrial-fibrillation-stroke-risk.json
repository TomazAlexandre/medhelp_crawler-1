            "answer": "Yes, there is still a 1%/year risk of a stroke if you are in continuous afib (& are rate controlled) and take warfarin/coumadin and you had a prior history of high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0So the odds of a stroke over the next 30 years is about 25- 30%. On the other hand, this is about the average (1%/yr) for the general population (who are not in afib).\u00a0\u00a0So you are not at greater risk\u00a0\u00a0than the average person--- but the risk is still there.Here's a website that briefly discusses the probabilities (based on the CHADS model)http://heartdisease.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htmThe odds of a stroke increase if valve problems are contributing to your afib, or if you have a history of diabetes, heart failure, prior stroke and if you are over 75 years of age.I assumed that you had a CHADS score of 1 (for prior high bp) = 2.8% risk a year without anticoagulation and less than 1% with warfarin/coumadin.I also have a CHAD score of 1 and am curently in afib that is rate controlled (resting HR varying between 55-80) and take coumadin.Best wishesTony",
