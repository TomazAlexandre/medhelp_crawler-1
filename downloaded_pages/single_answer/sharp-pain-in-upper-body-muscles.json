            "answer": "Hi!Usually pain due to spondylosis is more common and evident in winter than in summers. However, the pain in muscles can also be due to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance if you drink less water in winters. Exposure to cold and hypothyroidism, and also diabetes can cause muscle aches in winter. Keep yourself warm and see if it helps. Other than this, please discuss these possibilities with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
