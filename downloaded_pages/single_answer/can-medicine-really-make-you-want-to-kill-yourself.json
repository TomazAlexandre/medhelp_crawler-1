Mood disorders (such as Major Depression) and anxiety disorders (such as Panic Disorder) often go hand in hand. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) medications such as Paxil and Prozac are often beneficial in the treatment of both depression and anxiety disorders. It would be highly unusual for this class of medications to make people feel like killing themselves. Suicidal ideation may however be associated with both Major depression and Panic Disorder. I am glad to hear that you are okay now. I am not sure why Paxil was discontinued and replaced with Prozac. Both have RARE reports of aggravating diabetes.I recommend that you discuss your concerns further with your treating physician/psychiatrist. You will benefit from thorough evaluation by a psychiatrist, if you are not under the care of one yet.This response is provided for general information only. Always consult your physician for any health concerns.Keywords: anxiety, panic attacks, depression, Prozac, Paxil, SSRI",
