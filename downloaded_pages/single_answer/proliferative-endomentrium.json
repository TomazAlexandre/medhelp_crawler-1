            "answer": "Hi, am 47 and had laparoscopy to remove large ovarian cyst\u00a0\u00a09 days ago. Was terrified. Surgery went well. Surgeon tried to talk to me and show me pics whilst still whoozy from anaesthetic.\u00a0\u00a0Vaguely remember the pics but couldn't tell you what she said to me!Am a p/t primary school teacher and swapped my days with my job share so I wouldn't miss any time (no work, no pay).\u00a0\u00a0Had to bail out of going in today as feel too rough. Hardly slept last night, pain and discomfort in abdomen awful.Had shoulder pain after surgery as expected. Took anti-inflams for couple days and co-codamol when needed.\u00a0\u00a0Am very frustrated and tearful. Have rested as best as possible but still feel queasy and in pain/discomfort. Also have slight tugging sensation in op area.Doc said I'd be fine in few days but 9 days later am beginning to wonder if I will ever feel better.\u00a0\u00a0This is my second op in 2 wks (eye surgery) and feel very out of the loop as far as life is concerned.Realise I may sound mardy but am fed up.\u00a0\u00a0Pain seems to get worse after eating.\u00a0\u00a0I go from feeling hungry to having no appetite at all and to top it all off I now seem to have diahorrea (sorry!).Have searched for info lots of times and this forum has been a godsend. Thanks to all of you who take the time to share your experiences.",
