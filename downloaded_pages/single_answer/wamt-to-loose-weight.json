            "answer": "Hi!Well, flax seeds can increase fiber in your diet and help you control portion sizes. However, this is not the best way to lose weight. First try and rule out whether you indulge in eating, exercise less or have diabetes, hypothyroidism, or PCOD (if you are female). If all these factors are ruled out, then join a good physical trainer or take up an aerobic activity like jogging, swimming, cycling etc and eat healthy. You can even take help of a dietician. Hope this helps. Take care!",
