            "answer": "Have you had any thyroid tests done?\u00a0\u00a0That would be the first step.\u00a0\u00a0The minimum you need would be TSH, Free T3, Free T4, and since you are losing weight, I'd recommend antibody tests to confirm or rule out both Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and Graves Disease.Hashimoto's is most often associated with being hypothyroid, and gaining weight; however, if you have thyroid nodules (sounds like you might have), you can swing back and forth between hypo, hyper and normal, for some before becoming completely hypo.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOab) and Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TGab) are necessary to confirm/rule out Hashi's.Graves Disease is most often associated with being hyperthyroid, and often causes weight loss, along with other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0To confirm/rule out Graves, you would need a Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI) test.Considering your increased appetite, along with the weight loss, I'd strongly recommend that you get tested for diabetes, as well.",

    "question": "I believe I'm having a thyroid problem. About 3 years ago I started to get a rash under my right eye and on the inner part of my right leg. I have tried everything to try to rid myself of the rash but they just linger. Then from time to time I get chest pains. Maybe a couple of time a weak but it's been like that for about 6 years.\u00a0\u00a0The wesnday before Christmas I woke up with a painful dry/sore throat. Then I started to get neck pains but for right now the pain is gone. However I get a pain in the left ear that lasts for a few seconds off and on. I do have\u00a0\u00a0a small lump inside my throat but I believe its just\u00a0\u00a0mucus because I can spit it up and then its clear for a little while but still feels like something in my throat. My lymph nodes under my chin may or may not be swollen. Now just about 3 days go I started to get a very increased appetite. I can eat a full meal and then in about 30 minutes I'm starving again. It should be noted I'm losing a lot of weight too I'm gong to see the doctor tomorrow to find out the news but wanted to hear something from the people here tonight.-Thanks",
