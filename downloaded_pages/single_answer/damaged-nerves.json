            "answer": "Hi,Your past history of drug use could likely have contributed to your condition.As you have posted, you have started using drugs since you were thirteen.Firstly, I would not suggest that you continue using the viagra until you have your condition assessed by a physician.These medications have their own side effects and increasing or tapering the dose of medications without close supervision of a physician is not encouraged.As with the supplements, I can not say if these are effective in reversing your condition.The underlying cause of your erectile dysfunction has to be ascertained.Reversing the condition means treating the underlying cause directly.Here are some underlying causes of erectile dysfunction:Source:http://www.uroweb.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Guidelines/2005ErectileDysfunction.pdfVasculogenic- Cardiovascular disease- Hypertension- Diabetes mellitus- Hyperlipidaemia- Smoking- Major surgery or radiotherapy (pelvis or retroperitoneum)\u2022 Neurogenic- Central causes- Multiple sclerosis- Multiple atrophy- Parkinson\u2019s disease- Tumours- Stroke- Disk disease- Spinal cord disorders- Peripheral causes- Diabetes mellitus- Alcoholism- Uraemia- Polyneuropathy- Surgery (pelvis or retroperitoneum)\u2022 Anatomical/structural- Peyronie\u2019s disease- Penile fracture- Congenital curvature of the penis- Micropenis- Hypospadias, epispadias\u2022 Hormonal- Hypogonadism- Hyperprolactinemia- Hyper- and hypothyroidism- Cushing\u2019s disease\u2022 Drug-induced- Antihypertensives (of all classes, most common by diuretics and beta-blockers)- Antidepressants- Antipsychotics- Antiandrogens- Antihistamines- Recreational drugs (heroin, cocaine, methadone)\u2022 Psychogenic- Generalized type (e.g. lack of arousability and disorders of sexual intimacy)- Situational type (e.g. partner-related, performance-related issues or due to distress)At your age and with a strong history of drug use, a thorough assessment is needed to rule out an organic or physical cause first.Psychogenic factors may play a big role in erectile dysfunction.A thorough assessment by a urologist as well as a referral to a counsellor or therapist will guide you through this. Discuss this openly with them, Your past medical history is important.",
