            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This could be due to food poisoning or gut infection. Take an OTC lactobacillus preparation (probiotics) and yoghurt with your meals. Drink plenty of fluids (clear soups, water, ORS in water, lemonade). Eat light, do not stay hungry but eat simple things like toast, porridge, cereals, crackers, banana, rice, peeled apple, etc. Take over the counter antacid and antiemetic (this SOS for vomiting). Watch out for a day or two with this treatment.If it does not help, then you need to consult a doctor and rule out IBS, Crohn's etc or diabetes, or hyperthyroidism.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
