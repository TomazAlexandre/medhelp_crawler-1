            "answer": "Since this behavior does not occur every day, and when it does it seems irrational and unlike her -- my guess is that when these events occur she is extremely tired, or hungry, or something like that.If it was daily, I would say this is part of her temperment, and some counseling might help her learn to control her emotions a little bit better (if she is crying uncontrollably then she is feeling hurt at the time.) A trained counselor might be able to work with her so that when she has these feelings she has some better coping mechanisms-- something that will help her keep control.But since its not every day, it sounds like most of the time she can keep it together, and there are just some times that she is too tired, hungry, stressed-- whatever- and she can't.She is young. I think 5 is a tough age-- its when they really start to separate from parents.Asking her pediatrician about what to do is a good place to start. But from what I am reading-- I don't think there is really anything wrong-- especially since your daughter has not displayed any other mental or physical delays.",

    "question": "My daughter is 5 years and 2 months old (born June 27, 2002). She is in kindergarten and due to her birthday, she is the youngest kindergartner in her class.Everyone agrees (teachers, friends, relatives) that she is a very bright, sweet and all around good kid and not one of the trouble makers. However, here is the problem: she is still prone to temper tantrums and often over the slightest upsets. I'm not talking about major things like being unable to watch a television show or read a book; if the mood is \"wrong\" or \"off\" and you tell her \"no\" or refuse her, or even suggest a compromise or work around, or ask her to do something that she's done helpfully without argument a hundred times before, she will break into tears. This will not be a short spurt of tears, but it's a good crying jag that can last ten minutes to an hour. She will not be distracted from her tears; attempting to calm her down does not help nor does simply ignoring her.She can go days without this behavior and then suddenly she will have one of these \"tantrums\" every other ten minutes.My husband and I are at our wit's end. We are beginning to wonder if there is not perhaps an underlying physical cause to her behavior, but don't know where to begin to look. I'm looking for advice on managing her behavior or perhaps questions to give me insight of some signs and symptoms that we should be watching out for. We're going to schedule an appointment with her pediatrician, but beyond what I've described above, I don't know what to tell him even.The last bit of information I can provide is that she was born 5.5 weeks early. I had gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia and was induced. She has never lagged behind mentally or physically as a preemie, other than this tantrum behavior.",
