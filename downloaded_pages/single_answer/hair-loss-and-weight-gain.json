    "question": "In the past 2 yrs I've started having hair loss.\u00a0\u00a0At first it appeared to be just on the top of my head (female-patterned baldness), but now it's thinned all over.\u00a0\u00a0My mother has thinning hair, but it wasn't as bad as mine is now at my age (I'm 22).\u00a0\u00a0I've also developed dermatisis on my scalp.I've always been overweight, but not obese.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 5'4 1/2 and roughly 175lbs, 15-20 lbs I've gained the past year (I'm a Hurricane Katrina Survivor, LOL).\u00a0\u00a0My weight has always fluctuated, but I've never been this big before.I've been tested for thyroid problems (twice), and diabetes off and on (it's prevalent in my family).\u00a0\u00a0They actually thought I had diabetes this past year because my sugar was so high after a fasting blood test.I'm also having problems sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0Either I can't get to sleep, or when I do get enough sleep, I still feel restless and tired (after 10-12 hrs 0.0).I'm leaning toward insulin intolerance as being one of my main problems.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to change my diet to see, but I just have a strong feeling it's something else as well.",
