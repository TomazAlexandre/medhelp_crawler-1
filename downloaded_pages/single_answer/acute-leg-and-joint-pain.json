            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

    "question": "My husband is 46 yrs old and has been having terrible pain in his legs--mostly in the area where the thigh meets the hip (groin/front of leg?) and also in his knees. His legs ache as if he's been running marathons, only he doesn't do any running. He is tired and also has developed restless legs type of symptoms occasionally that doesn't get better when moving the legs. At first we thought he only had rls or plmd, but the symptoms of pain are always there, whereas the restlessness and twitching comes and goes. What seems more unusual is that during the day, his legs will hurt so badly for hours on end and he'll feel exhausted, when suddenly, out of the blue, the symptoms of tiredness and severe pain will alleviate for a bit. However, the aching never totally stops. He's always aware of some pain and tightness in his legs. He's tried Advil with minimal relief and tylenol, which doesn't help at all. He stretches everyday, multiple times a day, and is so stiff and tight. It hurts to walk, to sleep, to run... please does anyone have any clue as to what this is? His family has a history of nerve issues in the back, but my hubby doesn't seem to have back issues, just these leg problems. He's had blood tests done to rule out a lot of things and everything has come up negative.Any help is much appreciated-- thank you!!!Isis",
