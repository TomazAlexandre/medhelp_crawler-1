            "answer": "Hi,The symptoms of burning sensation and numbness and tingling could be due to Peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy may be inherited or acquired, and diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of acquired peripheral neuropathy. Other acquired peripheral neuropathy causes include: HIV, vasculitis, alcoholism, malnutrition, autoimmune disorders, malignant/benign tumors, nerve physical injury/trauma, vascular and metabolic disorders, toxin buildup- kidney, liver conditions, environmental toxin exposure- arsenic, lead, mercury, chronic/acute inflammation-\u00a0\u00a0Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, hormonal imbalances-\u00a0\u00a0hypothyroidism, too much growth hormone, infections-\u00a0\u00a0shingles, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex, Lyme disease .Peripheral nerves may regenerate if the nerve cell has not been damaged. As for your numbness, tingling, burning neuropathic pain sensations, analgesics may help. Some lifestyle changes that may improve the symptoms are- eat a balanced diet, avoid toxin exposure, routine exercise program, correct any vitamin deficiencies and limit/avoid alcohol consumption . Please consult a neurologist for treatment. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",

    "question": "I have had\u00a0\u00a0burning pain in my left side for a few months. I thiught every body got that burning pain when muscle pain was severe. Apparently not. I just thought it was from doing exercise or sitting at the computer for too long but the pain now travels from the side of my head down to my foot. I have tried several over the counter pain killers & nothing works. I have had Bowen Therapy for months it seems to help for a week but then just comes back & is getting worse. I can't sleep properly & I also get numbness & pins & needles on my the side of my face & fingers & hands. Also my head shakes slightly every now & then. I have seen a couple of doctors but just found one who is taking me seriously. He said it will take alot of tests & a while to find out what it is. Does anyone have any idea? Appreciate any help.",
