            "answer": "Hi!Electric jolt like feeling can be due to side effects of certain medications. So if you are on any drug, ask your doctor and stop this drug and see if it helps. It can also be due to fibromyalgia, Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. A pinched nerve can also be the cause. Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I've been having these sharp \"zaps\" multiple times a day on a daily basis that actually cause my head to jolt or jerk for a split second each time this happens.\u00a0\u00a0It happens 20-30 times a day sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0This has been going on for about a month.I recently had an MRI done, and the only thing that was found was a large cisterna magna.I've also over the last two weeks been having extreme cases of sleep paralysis multiple times a night.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure if the two have any correlation with on another, but just thought I'd list that here.Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!Thanks!",
