            "answer": "Hi!Yes, any procedure during that time may affect your chances of conceiving. At this stage, it would be best to avoid pregnancy until you have biopsy results. You can then plan a pregnancy after all this has been sorted out.Also, since you have been trying for two years maybe you can undergo other tests to find out what could be wrong\u2014whether you are ovulating, have hormone imbalance, PCOD, thyroid problems, diabetes etc. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
