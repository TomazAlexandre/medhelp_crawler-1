            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor with your parents to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.Fungal infections of the human body are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "Hi, I have been studying my lips very very closely due to a problem i have in that i worry about getting ill all the time! Since studying my lips i have noticed that in both corners of my lips i have little white patches, looks like three little marks joining together. I have felt them and there is absoultely no bumps or spots there, just the marks, so i suppose you could describe it as a rash. Except it is not red, it is white and it is pain free, ie, no tinglings or soreness. My question is, can people have natural marks there and i have always had it, i have only just noticed due to my over analysis or is this a sign of something....i studied my lips very closely because i was worried about little bumps i have along my lips but i have since been told that these are normal. I am very worried that these white marks are the beginning of coldsores! Many thanks,",
