            "answer": "Hello,your a1c is too high.\u00a0\u00a0It is best that it is below 7 and even better if it can be below 6.5.\u00a0\u00a0Consider that normal non diabetic hba1c is < 5.0.Your insulin doses are not high enough.\u00a0\u00a0You need to test your basal rates and also determine your carb to insulin ratio.\u00a0\u00a0This will allow you to properly dose insulin to control your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you are just taking a fixed dose of insulin without adjusting it based on what you eat.Please go to the following U-tube site: Bernstein Diabetes University.\u00a0\u00a0There are about 41 lectures on managing diabetes.You could also find the books: Think Like a Pancreas, Using Insulin.basically, to test basal rate (for your levemir), you take your insulin at night.\u00a0\u00a0If your fasting blood sugar is higher than target (ideally is between 70 - 100), then you increase your bed time insulin by 1 - 2 units.\u00a0\u00a0Observe for 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0If your blood sugar is still high in the morning, then increase again.\u00a0\u00a0You do this until your blood sugar is at target.\u00a0\u00a0When you increase your nighttime insulin, you should probably also increase your morning dose of levemir (by say 1 unit for every 2 units increase in the night time dose).To fine tune your day time dose you have to continue fasting. You take your morning dose of levemir and then test at say 12, and then 4 pm.\u00a0\u00a0If your blood sugar continues to rise during the day (even on fasting), then you need to increase your dose.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You would do this maybe once a week until your blood sugar level during the daytime stays stable.\u00a0\u00a0It is hard to say, but I have found that daytime basal insulin could be about 70 - 80% of the night time dose (maybe lower to account for exercise).For your eating - novorapid.\u00a0\u00a0You have to calculate a carb to insulin ratio.\u00a0\u00a0Start with assuming that 15 g of carbs requires 1 unit of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0So you eat a meal with 15 g of carb.\u00a0\u00a0Measure your blood sugar 2 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0If your blood sugar is higher than target (let's say in increase of more than 30 points from your pre-eating blood sugar) then you need to try a lower ratio.\u00a0\u00a0You would then try say 1 unit of insulin for 12 g of carb.\u00a0\u00a0Adjust over a period of days.\u00a0\u00a0Your insulin: carb requirement could be as low as 1 u for 5 g of carbs, or it could be as high as 1 u of insulin for 50 g of carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Depends on how insulin resistant you are.\u00a0\u00a0but you need to determine this for yourself.Test frequently.\u00a0\u00a0Particularly you want to see the impact of exercise on your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0It may be you have to eat a bit more or take a bit less insulin when you exercise.the best way to gain weight is with normal blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0This is because when your blood sugar is high your blood will pee out the carbs you ate instead of converting it to body mass.Hope this helps.",
