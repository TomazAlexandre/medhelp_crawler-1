            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Penile erections involve an integration of complex physiologic processes involving the CNS, peripheral nervous system, and hormonal and vascular systems. Any abnormality involving these systems, whether from medication or disease, has a significant impact on the ability to develop and sustain an erection, ejaculate, and experience orgasm. The etiology of ED is usually multifactorial. Organic, physiologic, endocrine, and psychogenic factors are involved in the ability to obtain and maintain erections.Almost any disease may affect erectile function by altering the nervous, vascular, or hormonal systems. Smoking, diabetes, mental health disorders, sedentary life style, hypertension, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, kidney failure, and certain drugs like antidepressants etc can cause ED.Have you been treated for BPH? Prostatic surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia has been documented to be associated with ED in 10-20% of men. This is thought to be related to nerve damage from cautery. Newer procedures such as microwave, laser, or radiofrequency ablation have rarely been associated with ED.I would suggest to maintain a healthy life style with balanced diet and moderate exercise, also visit a urologist to rule out any physical causes for ED.All the best.",
