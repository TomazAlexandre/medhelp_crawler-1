    "question": "For a few months, have cold feet in morning, burning feet in afternoon and normal in evening and overnight. The cycle is steady day after day. With pre-hypertension, my family doctor says it is not circulation related. My allergic rhinitis has been especially bad during this same time period. Possibly Graves disease, CFS or vitamin B deficiency? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
