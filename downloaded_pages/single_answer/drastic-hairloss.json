It may occur when some type of shock ,\u00a0\u00a0emotional or physical, causes hair roots to be pushed prematurely into the resting state. In a month or two, the hair follicles become active again and new hair starts to grow.\u00a0\u00a0Hair typically grows back once the condition that caused it corrects itself, but it usually take months.Other causes of hair loss are: poor nutrition,\u00a0\u00a0certain medications, hormonal changes, and medical conditions such as diabetes and lupus can also cause hair loss.Take care and regards.",
