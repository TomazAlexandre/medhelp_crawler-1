            "answer": "Hi there!Ejaculatory dysfunction could develop due to a variety of causes. Possibilities that may need to be considered include vas obstruction, psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress are the most common possible cause. You could try being relaxed and working on the psychological factors. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work; I would suggest seeing your primary care physician or a urologist for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",
