            "answer": "Hi,During your first bout of UTI,have you had a urine culture done? This should have been done prior to antibiotic therapy. The results of the culture could have guided treatment. A urinary tract infection may recur due to poor compliance to medications, an underlying resistance to the antibiotics, underlying structural abnormalities or due to infection of more atypical organisms that present with chronic (longer ) infections.Have you had any of these mentioned above?Any underlying disease like diabetes?With regards to having examinations taken for STD's, this may be done and you can discuss this with your physician. If you have a significant sexual history , then tests to rule out an STD may be necessary.Have a repeat urinalysis done. An ultrasound of your kidney, ureter and bladder may actually help rule out any underlying structural abnormalities such as kidney stones.",
