            "answer": "Because these problems have developed recently you need an in-person appointment with a neurologist for an evaluation. Bring with you a single sheet of paper with a timeline outlining the onset of the problems and whether they have been becoming more severe.\u00a0\u00a0Probably an MRI and an MRA. I would also get a consult with a hematologist and an endochonologist.\u00a0\u00a0Confusion can be due to something as simple as chronic anemia, or due to a much more complex problem. At your age you are pretty much dependent on your parents to arrange these tests. Among other things you require a test for diabetes, which is called an Hba1c. It's not stress. If there is a problem with expenses it is no embarrassment to seek financial aid. There are clinics that charge a flat ten dollars a visit. Talk with your mom or dad about this. Post back when you hear what they have to say.Good luck.",

    "question": "Lately it's been hard to think straight and process information correctly.Sometimes i'll be sitting down and reading a book then I just won't be able to understand anything that I had read before or what i was reading then. At other times i'll be talking to my friends in person or through text and one of us will say something and i won't be able to respond to them or if I said it then I won't be able to continue the thought. This happens completely randomly or I just won't be able to think for the entire day. This makes it really hard for me to do my school work and other daily things like going to the store because i'll forget why I was there in the first place and wonder why i was in that section of the store. It's not just that i'm forgetful... My mind always feels fuzzy and I used to not be like this. I've looked these things up and found out that it might be stress but I don't know for sure... Can anyone help???",
