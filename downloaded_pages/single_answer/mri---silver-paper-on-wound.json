    "question": "My husband has Type II Diabetes, & has had a vascular bypass along with amputation of one toe.He is currently hospitalized again for more surgery to remove an infected bone in his foot. One wound on his leg from the bypass has been slow to heal, so one of his doctors put a wad of some sort of silver backed paper into the wound to help it heal. However, following the bone surgery he was given an MRI. He soon began to feel extreme pain in his leg.\u00a0\u00a0The silver paper had melted into the leg wound. They stopped the MRI, he is now on morphine, & I'm told it will just be fine in a week or so. However, I'm not convinced. Does anyone have any idea of what kind of damage could be caused by giving an MRI to a patient with silver backed paper wadded into a healing leg wound? I feel I need to know what to look out for. Thank you!",
