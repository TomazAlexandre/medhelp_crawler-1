            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The symptoms you experienced could be due to a prodromal phase of an infection, before the actual signs are evident. You will need to check to see if you are running a fever. The dizziness and weakness are a consequence to this. They could also be due some metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorders. Sometimes anxiety or stress can cause similar effects. Only a consultation with your primary care physician can help diagnose.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
