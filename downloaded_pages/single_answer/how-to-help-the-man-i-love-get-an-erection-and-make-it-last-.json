    "question": "I have been married for 17 years we have been together for 19. Ever since we met he wouldn't have sex until we got married. We try and he still has yet to keep an erection long enough to have sex. He said he feels if it doesn't work he doesn't want me to get all hot and bothered and he can't perform. He has went to an urologist who said nothing was blocked and gave him some viagra and it seemed to work but since then we try but we usually just have oral sex and I want to experience the whole ball of wax. I try to console him and tell him I am his wife and we can work on this together but he just ignores intercourse all together. I have recommened seeing a counselor and he said no, but I have told him how much this means to me and he said he would go. I also asked him if there was someone else or if he was gay and he denied both. He says he loves me and always has and I love him. Any suggestions or help is appreciated.",
