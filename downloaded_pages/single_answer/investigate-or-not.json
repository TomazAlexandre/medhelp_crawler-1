    "question": "Both parents, and a number of other close relatives have had varying degrees of hypertension. I started having chest pain in 2006 and my BP was found to be 168/110.\u00a0\u00a0It responded quite well to treatment but I was sent forinvestigation.\u00a0\u00a0I had an echocardiogram which showed definite, although slight, left ventricular hypertrophy, and it was felt that I must have been hypertensive for some time.\u00a0\u00a0 I had exercise ECGs and a radionuclide scan.\u00a0\u00a0The result showed slight narrowing of the LAD, but it was considered insignificant and the pain had disappeared.\u00a0\u00a0My BP remained between 130/84 and 145/95 and I was on lisinopril - increased to 20mg and diltiazem 120mg.In 2011 I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I eat a healthy diet, although overweight (but losing), and it is well-controlled on Metformin.\u00a0\u00a0However this, and the family history, mean that my BP should be consistently below 130/80, which it was not, and in June 2012 I started propranolol 40mg twice dailyA month ago I started to develop similar central chest pain, similar to that in 2006, although not radiating, worse on exertion, but sometimes present at rest.\u00a0\u00a0My GP would like me to have further investigations.\u00a0\u00a0The last two days I've resumed home BP monitoring and it seems to be consistently 166/100 or above.\u00a0\u00a0Tonight the pain was severe enough to require GTN, which is very rare for me.\u00a0\u00a0This relieved it instantly, which would point to angina, and I took my evening medication.\u00a0\u00a0Before the GTN, my BP was 170/108, which is higher than it has been for over five years, although I am consistent in my medication.\u00a0\u00a0Now it is still 163/93 and I think I will need my medication increased long-term.",
