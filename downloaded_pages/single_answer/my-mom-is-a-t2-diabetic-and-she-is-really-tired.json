            "answer": "HI,Thank you for writing on behalf of your mother.There are a number of things that may be going on, so I am on limited help just based on this forum.\u00a0\u00a0How well are your mother's sugars controlled? Are they still too high? Or perhaps too low? Either direction can lead to feelings of fatigue. Medication side effects can also be culprits, including the supplements if she is taking too much. Heart disease is always important to consider especially when you have diabetes. Thyroid disease is also quite common. The list of possibilities is actually quite long, so the best thing is for your mom to speak with her doctor and have a very thorough check-up and labs done to see if they can pinpoint the problem together.Take care.",

    "question": "Hello,I am writing in concern for my mother. She is 43 years of age and weight is 125lbs. Her diet is really good. She is a T2 diabetic and takes Natrol multivitamin, Solaray- Cal Meg Citrate and Metaformin HCL that is given from her doctor. With all of this she always feels tired and sometimes more than ever. What can she take differently that would help with her weakness or are the things that she is taking, the wrong product or companies?! And is this a sign of anything such as heart desease, blood cyrcilation or anything else?!Please help, i am a very concerned daughter at the moment. I will keep doing my reaserch and anything you say i would greatly appreciate.Sincerely,Gledia Triepshi",
