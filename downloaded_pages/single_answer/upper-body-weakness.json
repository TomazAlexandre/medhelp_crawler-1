            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0X-rays are not enough to diagnose nerve involvement. For this, you need to get a MRI and nerve conduction study along with EMG. Also, you will need to rule out peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, thyroid disorder, lupus etc. Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I'm experiencing upper body weakness that starts in the back of my upper arms and progresses across my shoulders. My arms feel extremely weak and I feel like I can't lift them.\u00a0\u00a0It's not painful, feels somewhat like the burn you get when you over exercise a muscle only much more extreme. My doctor was convinced it was in my neck, skeletal, but X-rays were negative. I doesn't last but a few minutes, 4 to maybe 8, but I must sit down and wait for it to pass. I've had six episodes in the last two months or so. It frightens me but doesn't seem to leave any after effects. I'm relatively healthy for a 73 year old, I have all the usual complaints of old age, arthritis, lower back pain from bulging discs and spinal stenosis. I really don't think it's anything serious even though it frightens me. I'd like to hear from anyone with similar symptoms and especially anyone that has been given a diagnosis.",
