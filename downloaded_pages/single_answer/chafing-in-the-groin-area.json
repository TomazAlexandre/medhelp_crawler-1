            "answer": "This might be yeast, but it might also be a reaction to the bleaching cream, or it might have made it worse.You need to get this checked by a doc.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like a fungal infection, but given that you have been using bleaching cream, that goes beyond the OTC yeast meds.\u00a0\u00a0Also, a lot of yeast infections are becoming resistant to the OTC stuff.You also could be further irritating your skin by washing too much/too hard.\u00a0\u00a0All you really need is a very gentle soap, such as Dove unscented for sensitive skin, and just normal, once a day or every other day washing.I always say the vagina is like a self cleaning oven.\u00a0\u00a0You don't really have to do too much to it to keep it healthy.If you don't have insurance, try a Planned Parenthood if you are in the US, or a GUM clinic in the UK.\u00a0\u00a0There are also std clinics in Canada.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know or really even think this is an std, but they should be able to help you.You can also call your local health dept if you are in the US, and ask about free or low cost clinics.AJ",

    "question": "When I was pregnant and especially during the hot periods I found I had an itch in the groin area and when I scratched the skin would peel -it comes and goes. Recently it came back but I don't remember what I took to get rid of it. Could this condition be caused from diabetes, high blood pressure or is it an std?\u00a0\u00a0I've tried garlic and yogurt in order to get the good bacteria back in that area but no relief yet.\u00a0\u00a0This condition also came back after I wore a very tight pants to work and even when I have no itch I constantly want to dig away at the dead skin falling off (I am black and so the area is now whitish). I also tend to wash that area too hard and was previously using a bleaching cream to clear up the black skin down there. What can I use over the counter to get some relief.",
