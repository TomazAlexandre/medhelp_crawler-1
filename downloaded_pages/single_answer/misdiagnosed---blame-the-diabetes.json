    "question": "I was recently bitten by a dog.\u00a0\u00a0Although I required 8 stiches in my arm, no surgery was seemed necessary.\u00a0\u00a0This was based on an xray and the ER doc's exam.\u00a0\u00a0I have followed up with the surgeon whi saw me in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone to therapy 3x a week for 3 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0My hand is freezing cold and I get tingling in my hand and fingers.\u00a0\u00a0I also have horrible mobility in my wrist,\u00a0\u00a0My therapist seemed concerned that something might be structurally wrong.\u00a0\u00a0The surgeon without doing any tests and barelly looking at me said I have RSD, carpal runnel, and diabetic neuropath, all brought on by the bite.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like there is more to it than that, plus I show no symptoms of neuropathy in other limbs.\u00a0\u00a0I plan on seeking another opinion, but with no extensive exam, no xray, MRI, or anything, this doc has blammed the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Is it wrong of me to be so skeptical?\u00a0\u00a0Is this surgeon brushing off something as diabetes complications, when my body tells me differently?\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone relate?",
