    "question": "Hi. I'm dating a guy with Type I diabetes, I'll call him 'Tom' on this site. He's laid back and great. We haven't had sex because we're Christians and want to wait until we marry. Tom's previous marriage was annulled after 5 months, Tom told me that his wife felt like the marriage was a mistake and decided to leave him.When I flirt with Tom he doesn't always respond much, or he seems a bit uncomfortable... I'm not sure why he gets like that.Tom's 33 years old. Is impotency likely in a 33 year old man with Type I diabetes?I work in a hospital. A friend of mine who's a doctor put this question in my head.... I want to know more about tYPE i DIABETES first and deal with any issues sensitively with Tom.",
