            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!If the swelling is occurring one month after the sting, chances are less it is due to the sting. It could be due to an infection as you notice pimples below the eye. Please consult his doctor immediately. Since your husband has recurring infections also get his blood sugar tested for diabetes.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My husband was stung on his brow bone by a wasp about a month ago and experienced about five inches of swelling for 5 days. His eye was swollen shut. He had experienced a similar reaction the year prior when he was stung in the arm and even got a staph infection. Yesterday his eye started swelling again and he's having a hard time keeping it open. The only thing I see is three small pimples below the eye. He also had a history of a pretty bad stye that required antibiotics and left scarring on the opposite eye. What is going on?! Is it possible that this is connected to the sting?",
