            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!There are many causes of dizziness, lightheadedness, passing out, blackouts etc. It is difficult to comment without examination. I am just enumerating the possible causes. You can discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Other causes are anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling.Certain types of epilepsies and seizures too can cause similar symptoms. If you have an accompanying headache then you must also look at benign intracranial hypertension. Heart problems have also to be ruled out in your case. If all other tests are normal, maybe an ECHO should be done to rule out mitral valve prolapse.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "been doctoring for 6 months with no resolution. i get light-headed, nauseous, and hot. feel like i am going to pass out & have to lie down. i am real tired after and could sleep for hours. this lasts anywhere from 5 - 90 minutes. it feels like i am on a boat in the ocean. the left side of my head feels funny -like there is pressure by my eye. it seems to mainly happen when i squat down to plant flowers - work in the garden or if i get really worried or scared. it has also happens while cleaning house and sitting at the computer. went to ENT doctor and head & ears are fine. had an MRI - fine. Any ideas? my dr. is suggesting a neurologist.",
