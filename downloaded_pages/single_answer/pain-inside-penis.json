            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms it can be due to urinary tract infection or prostatitis. Symptoms of UTI are frequent urination, burning sensation during urination, passing of blood in urine and even fever. The most common causes of repeated UTIs are kidney stones and diabetes mellitus. Making a diagnosis of a urinary tract infection includes performing a urinalysis test, which checks for the presence of pus, white blood cells, and bacteria in the urine, which point to a urinary tract infection. A urine culture and sensitivity is usually performed to find the exact microorganism that is causing the infection. I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I am a 40yr old male.\u00a0\u00a0I am having an issue where I have a pain/burning(?) about 1cm below the tip of my penis inside.I have no pain with urination, no pain with ejaculation, no fever, vomiting, no physical sign of anything on my penis, nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Just this stupid pain and I dont know what it is.Started about 3 days ago and it seems that when I urinate, it kind of feels better. I searched the net but nothing really fits that I can think of or find.Full physical about 8 months ago and all my levels were fine. Can guys get UTI's? Could this even be a UTI?\u00a0\u00a0I dont want to goto the doctor yet if possible as both me and my wife were recently laid off and money is better spent elsewhere at this time.The only thing I can think of is about a week ago, me and my wife were sharing a bath and she was playing around.\u00a0\u00a0She held the head of my penis and was ( this is embaressing ) making it talk by opening and closing the uretha.\u00a0\u00a0Could water or soap irriatated it? HPV? HIV? Gonohrea? Clamydia?...The more I search the net, the more afraid im getting.I started taking some cranberry pills today and lined up a whole bunch of water to drink.\u00a0\u00a0I have some amoxycillian pills from a tootache awhile ago, should I take them?",
