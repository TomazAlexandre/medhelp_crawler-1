            "answer": "Hi,The cause of this decreasing GFR needs to be assessed first. Differentials will be infections like pyelonephritis, inflammatory conditions like glomerulonephritis, an undiagnosed diabetes mellitus,polycystic kidneys , renovascular disease and certain drugs.A kidney ultrasound, a complete blood count to rule out anemia, a 24 hour urine collection for urine albumin levels , and serum levels of electrolytes ( potassium, calcium ) may be able to shed some light on this.I feel that this worries you . Just be proactive about this and continue to reassure your husband.Your husband's GFR may need to be closely monitored. Also,openly communicate with your physicians. Let us take this one step at a time.",
