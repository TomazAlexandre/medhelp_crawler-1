Also get your blood pressure monitored as orthostatic hypotension due to sudden decrease in systolic BP can also cause dizziness.Sometimes, there are partial or complete blockages in the arteries that supply the brain with blood.\u00a0\u00a0These blockages can cause a temporary loss of blood flow (called transient ischemic attack, or TIA for short), or permanent loss of blood flow (called stroke; also called cerebrovascular accident).This can lead to impaired blood flow through these arteries and so dizziness.Ear infections and other causes like Meniere\u2019s disease or inner ear diseases can lead to dizziness. If there is any ear pain or tinnitus along with then it may be the possibility.Pls get yourself evaluated for that.Get the blood sugar evaluated and an ECG done.CT brain is also useful if a brain injury is suspected to be the cause of vertigo. The choice of treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Regarding your tingling sensation in the right arm,it is common in diabetes, alcoholics, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition, carpal tunnel syndrome transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out. You can also take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
