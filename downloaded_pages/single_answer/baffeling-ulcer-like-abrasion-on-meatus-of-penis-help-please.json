            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This is probably a non healing ulcer. The first thing to be ruled out is diabetes. Then color dopplar of penile blood vessels should be done to rule out poor blood supply. Penilel ulcers may be due to infective or non-infective causes. Infective causes are sexually transmitted and include syphilis, chancroid, genital herpes, LGV and granuloma inguinale.Traumatic penile ulcers may be caused by vigorous acts of masturbation or sex. Behcet's disease (if you have mouth ulcers too), Stevens-Johnson syndrome and diabetes (since the ulcer is not healing) should be explored.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, I'm a 20 yr old male and a couple months ago I noticed a depression on the meatus of my penis, so far I've went to my primary doctor whom said it was an abrasion and it would heal on its own, he also sent me for blood work all came back clear. I also have had two emergency room examinations at two different hospitals, one of which gave me an RCB test despite me having one done eariler that month ofcourse it came back negative. The other thought it was just an abrasion. It has not healed yet over two months. Upon examination by my self I can tell you when opened it is circular with a redish inside, never any pain or discharge from it, the rim of this is skin colored - with no irritation it honestly looks like a crater on my meatus. When closed it just looks like a cut or line. I also will provide links to images to help further, I appreciate any help and I hope that it isnt much.Again I have been tested for mostly everything and it came back negative the only thing that I know to my knowledge that I have is the herpes virus that gives cold sores on the lips of which i'm asymptomatic to.",
