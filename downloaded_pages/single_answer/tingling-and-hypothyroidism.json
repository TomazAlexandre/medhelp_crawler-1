    "question": "I have had hypothyroidism for 10 years and have Type 1 diabetes for over 12 years now.\u00a0\u00a0 I have tingling all over my body about once a day, sometimes twice.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor says its my thyroid/diabetes and not to worry.\u00a0\u00a0Just recently the back of my thigh started lightly tingling and now is numb..\u00a0\u00a0This has lasted a month so far. Some days arnt as bad as others. My doctors says its not MS, he thinks might be pinched nerve?\u00a0\u00a0Since these symptoms do resemble MS, how can my doctor be so sure its not?\u00a0\u00a0The body tingling started a year ago and never really went away, does that sound like thyroid/diabetes induced?Thanks!!!!",
