            "answer": "Hi!One possibility for weakness in both legs is compression of spinal nerves in lumbo-sacral region, and thus MRI of lumbar and sacral spine should be done. Other possibilities are peripheral neuropathy like in diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, Reynaud\u2019s phenomenon, Vit B12 deficiency; anxiety and panic disorder; or even due to electrolyte imbalance. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, polio, and multiple sclerosis are other possibilities. ALS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis too can cause weakness in both legs, and yes at times EMG results are not conclusive. Hence nerve conduction velocity can be conducted. Please discuss these possibilities with your treating doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 24 year old female who has had weakness in the knees/legs and forearms since 11/24/11. Pain is constant and has not gotten better nor worse. I do not know if the weakness if coming from my legs or knees. But I feel it in my knees and could be due to Quad weakness. This leg weakness is symmetrical and bilateral (happening the same way in both legs).It's especially weak when I straight my legs out, my knees feel like they are going to give out. In addition, there is muscle cramping and fatigue after I do regular walking in my legs and arms.I've had EMG/NVC done - NORMAL. Blood work- NORMAL. MRI of brain, cervical spine and thoracic spine - NORMAL.My concern is that in some instances, ALS does not show up on EMG's. Do people who ALS have bilateral onset? In other words, does the disease start out in both legs by the knees? And start out on the forearms? Any other feedback would be greatly appreciated.",
