    "question": "Today my midwife offered to do a sweep of my membranes. I'm 38 weeks with gestational diabetes. It hurt SO badly for her to even check me so I couldn't even go through with it. Does anyone else experience such horrendous pain with the vaginal exams? I'm pretty down on myself for chickening out because I want to have this baby before she gets too big!",
