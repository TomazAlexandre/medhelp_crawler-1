    "question": "Hello,I have been having this problem for about 6 months now where even if it is hot my feet and palms and nose are extremely cold and sometimes painful. I have done many tests such as diabetes and other blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing was found however i am concerned about these symptoms and I have no clue what they are from.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that they found on the blood test was a bit cholosterol but i went on a certain diet given to me by a dietician and the cholosterol has gone down but the symptoms still remain.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any clue what it could be? this is very frustrating that out of the many doctors i went to noone was able to find anything.Thank You",
