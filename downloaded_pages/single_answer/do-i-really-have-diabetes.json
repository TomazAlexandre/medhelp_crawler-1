            "answer": "Yes, you need to get tested. A random glucose test doesn't mean much, but you should have a fasting blood sugar and even more important a A1C which is an average of all blood sugars for 2-3 months. You said your result was very high for glucose but you don't say how high or when it was taken relative to eating. Unfortunately it does sound like you have either diabetes or hypoglycemia, so it is good to check further. If you do have diabetes you want to find out which Type you have and then learn as much as you can. Let us know.",

    "question": "I'm 17 years old and I have to go to the bathroom all the time. I'm always peeing, sometimes three to four times in an hour. I went to my gynecologist and they gave me a Glucose test and a urine test for an infection. My results came back very high for the glucose meaning I'd have diabetes and negative for the urine. When I went to my normal doctor she checked my sugar after eating and it was low. Now they want to give me more blood test. I don't have the thirst like normal diabetics do, but if I miss a meal or even a snack I get very sick. So the doctor's don't know whats wrong with me and I was wondering if this would help.Thanks.",
