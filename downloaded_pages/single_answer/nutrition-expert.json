    "question": "This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/234475\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/234475</a>.In contrast to commonly accepted by family doctors who do not follow trends in modern literature, GGT is not just a liver enzyme. It is produced by every cell in the body. High level of GGT activity indicates high level of oxidative stress in the body, that in turn increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, cancer, hepatitis C, diabetes and other life threateneing illnesses. Normal level of GGT is 20, not 60. There is a natural food supplement that helps normalize GGT. This supplement is made from probiotic culture extracts and called LeukoMeal. Some variation of the same with addition of cocoa and other antioxidants is called LactaMeal. Quite a few publications acknowledge substantial positive effects of LeukoMeal on GGT level and general reduction of oxidative stress.Go to http://clfood.net/default.aspxfor further information.",
