            "answer": "Hi,You mentioned having to void urine more often than you would like, but do you have any problems with voiding urine, in terms of a sensation of obstruction?\u00a0\u00a0Saw palmetto had some adherents for this particular problem and then indirectly, it was believed that the same can be said for prostate cancer. However, when more rigid testing was done, it seemed that saw palmetto improved the perception of obstruction, but the obstruction preceeded unabated. Hence, it didn\u2019t hold up to its promise. As to how well it will reduce PSA though, is an unanswered question.As to the steroids, it is true that treatment will reduce PSA. What you need to realize though is that a reduction in PSA is not necessarily a guarantee that you will not get prostate cancer. There is some concern that this method actually masks the current state of the prostate (since the PSA is low for quite a long time, no one would consider performing a biopsy), with the end result of getting more aggressive cancers.Preventive strategies are harder (and take longer) to do than those involving therapies for diseased patients, but there are some studies underway investigating some supplements. However, until then, keeping fit and a diet that would keep away heart disease and diabetes is probably the way to go.",

    "question": "I'm 48 and my psa went from 5.5 up to 6.2 over 15 months, I had a biopsy, it was negative but the whole process was miserable. Waiting for two months was stressful to say the least. The urologist said come back in 6 months. My grandfather died from prostate cancer and I'm not so keen with the \"let's wait until something goes wrong before we fix it\" approach. I want the next psa test to be lower. I'll try everything that's reasonable. If something works than I'll figure out what works and what doesn't.I read that zinc is important to the prostate so I've been taking two multi-vitamins a day (I weigh 190 lbs so I figure 2 is reasonable). I don't eat a lot of red meat so having low zinc seems possible. I think it has helped with how often I need to pee. I've also noticed I'm not as lethargic as I was before this whole thing started. I read about saw palmetto and progesterone. I tried the saw palmetto but it gives me the runs. I cut back on that and I'll see how it goes, so to speak. What about progesterone? This is one thing I haven't tried.If it helps, I'm 6' 4\", so fairly lean.",
