            "answer": "Parathesia is a symptom.\u00a0\u00a0It is an abnormal feeling or sensation.\u00a0\u00a0Some can be just irritating, some can be very painful and unpleasant (dysesthesia.)\u00a0\u00a0It is just a feeling.\u00a0\u00a0The key here is the cause.If the cause is MS, a disease of the central nervous system, the pain and feelings are the result of \"short circuits\" in the wiring of the brain or spinal cord.\u00a0\u00a0Your fingers, toes, feet, hands, etc. are usually fine.\u00a0\u00a0The main computer (the brain) is \"seeing signals\" that are not valid.Now, if you have diabetes and the vasculature of your foot is compromised and the peripheral nerves are damaged, you can get parathesias, as a result of the damage.\u00a0\u00a0Parathesias that are the result of peripheral nerve insult are typically called peripheral neuropathy.It is possible to have CNS caused parathesias and peripheral neuropathy at the same time and if you have a reason to suspect this, you should discuss it with you neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0Just because you have MS, doesn't mean that there can be something else going on at the same time.In MS, parathesias themselves are harmless.\u00a0\u00a0I have them in my feet and lower legs, worse on the right.\u00a0\u00a0Every night or more often, when we are out camping or something, I check the soles of my feet and lower legs.\u00a0\u00a0Little scrapes, ingrown toenails, puppy scratches, etc. may not hurt like they should.\u00a0\u00a0Be very careful trimming your toe nails.\u00a0\u00a0You want to make sure that any area of your body that has altered sensation gets a visual once over.\u00a0\u00a0There are all sorts of nasty infections that can get out of control in just s few days.Bob",

    "question": "I am seriously questioning the effects of parathesia? I get the tingling, shocks, and pin pricks. Some nights I get them really bad. For 2 nights in a row I had them so bad and then I noticed I couldn't willfully curl my toes. People say that it is harmless put I can't understand how they can be harmless and do no damage misfiring.Am I missing something?Aloha!",
