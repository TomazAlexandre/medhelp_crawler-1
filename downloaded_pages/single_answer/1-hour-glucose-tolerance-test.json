    "question": "I had my 1 hr glucose test yesterday and my results posted online this morning. Im curious what everyones results were and the outcome. My results for both tests were 1 # lower than standard range. Is that ok? Standard range i believe was like 11.5-14 and mine was 10.5. Both my other pregnancies i was right in tge middle so i never inquired about it. Thanks :-)",
