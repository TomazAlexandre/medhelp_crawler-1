    "question": "Hello,A month ago, I suddenly began having a strange difficulty breathing.\u00a0\u00a0 The difficulty is 100% of the time; even at rest.\u00a0\u00a0It feels as if my airways have shrunk to half the size, and I have to expend considerable effort to move air through them.Description:Difficulty moving airChest tightness and pain when breathingOxygen levels drop to 88-89% when walking in the pulmonary function 6 minute walk test (99-100% at rest)Test ResultsEKG: normalechocardiogram: normalUltrasound of stomach: normalUrinalysis normalCBC: white count 18 (but could be attributed to mild stomach virus I contracted while in hospital)D-Dimer negativeChest CT: normal; no sign of clotPulmonary function tests: lung capacity a bit low; O2 drops to 88-89% while walkingTreatments to date with no effect:Nasal steroidAlbuterolPrednisone 50mg 5 daysCurrently on third day of azithromycin and second round of prednisone 40mgFrom what the doctors have said, and from what I've read, the next step would be to get my pulmonologist and a cardiologist together to figure out what to test next.History:I am 35; healthy; reasonably in shape; 130 lbs; childhood history of asthma (but never with symptoms like this); NEVER smoked or used drugs; rarely drink; oral birth control; 2 healthy pregnancies in the last 3 years- gestational diabetes (diet controlled) with the second; have been told I'm slightly anemic, even when on 2 iron supplements per dayHas anyone had similar symptoms diagnosed?\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas about whether I'm on the right track?Thank you!Kristen",
