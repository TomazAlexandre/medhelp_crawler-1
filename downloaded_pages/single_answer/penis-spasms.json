            "answer": "Hello,If the spasms are not associated with any pain then there is nothing to worry about. Other causes are alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low calcium, sodium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp. in diabetes),hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease or nerve compression.I suggest you to get evaluated for these causes only if the spasms turn painful or are associated with any vibration sensations.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
