            "answer": "Yes the pulse pressure (66) is a little bit high, up to 40 is considered normal. However, the actual systolic and diastolic pressures are still part of the equation for risk or long term effects. Imagine someone with a blood pressure of 160/70, (pp90), then this will have far more dramatic effects on major organs over someone with a pressure of 115/49 which is quite low. So, I don't think a pulse pressure of 66 with such low pressure will cause Doctors to be too concerned.",
