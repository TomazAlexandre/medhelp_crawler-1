            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for posting your query.I can understand your concern and the condition that you are having is called erectile dysfunction.In most of the cases, erectile dysfunction is psychological in nature. It usually goes away with proper counseling and interactive sessions with the patient. Other causes are diabetes, depression, autonomic nervous system problem, excessive alcohol ingestion or tobacco smoking, heart or thyroid conditions and poor circulation.In your case, you need to be properly examined and investigated to pinpoint the diagnosis. As I have mentioned earlier, in young men, mostly it is due to psychological causes. However you need to have your blood sugar levels, complete blood count, thyroid function tests and cardiac function evaluated.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Wishing you good health.",
