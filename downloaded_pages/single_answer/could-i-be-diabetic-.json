            "answer": "You need to get back to your doctor, or a different one at the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0If the doctor did not prescribe you with anything to help to heal the fissure, then he should have done.\u00a0\u00a0He should have prescribed a medication to soften the stools so that they are not hard so that you do not strain to empty your bowels.He should have also prescribed a pessary for you to insert into the anal canal so that when you pass a motion it will not aggravate the tear any further and an ointment to apply around and inside the anal canal.If you continue to struggle and strain to pass a motion, it will be difficult for the fissure to heal.Diabetes does not cause bleeding nor will it cause a fissure.Feeling dizzy with nausea may be due to anxiety, inner ear or throat infections, sometimes even a urinary tract infection.Make an appointment to see the doctor to check things out.\u00a0\u00a0Write a list of your symptoms and give it to the doctor.Make sure that you drink plenty of water as well as fresh fruit and vegetables to get your fibre.\u00a0\u00a0High fibre cereals like porridge are also good.Wishing you a speedy recovery.",

    "question": "I am 28 and not pregnant and have had my bloods done and I am not anaemic and have no thyroid problems however. I am getting frequent dizzy and nausea spells. Today I was at a cuss party and felt so disorientated I could see where I wanted to go but with all the kids running around I was too dizzy and had to make my way outside. I get spells where I am very warm and feel faint and nauseous . This particularly concerning me as I have a three month old baby and am afraid I will fall done the stairs or have an accident holding him. At time I feel very tired and I was wondering could this be diabetes?? I am currently bleeding when I go number twos on the toilet and the doctors say it is due to a fissure that will heal up. It's been two months and it's not healed which has also made me think if Diabetes. Can someone please help and advise me. I feel like I am pestering my doctors and telling them what tests to do but I just can't go in like this x",
