The latest being a UTI infection which I've had for over 2 years,which no consultant can find a reason for. I have 6 monthly blood tests but ever since I started taking DHEA - nearly 10 years ago - my thyroid levels have been raised, but still within the normal min-max range. I am taking 18 different medications, including DHEA, for the various ailments and would like to know if any drugs which could cause a raised level, on my thyroid tests. Many of he symptoms I have are in relation to a low thyroid level. But I am not taking any thyroid replacement therapy. Could you tell me if there are any group of drugs which may cause an elevations such as I have described in thyroid tests.",
