    "question": "I found out last week that I have GD and I have been very stressed out about it. I have been checking my blood sugar 4x a day for a week and only one reading has been on the high side. My first son was 9lbs and I am terrified of having an even bigger baby boy this round! Any advice on how I can settle my mind around this?! Merry Christmas!",
