            "answer": "Hi!In most cases the origin of the blood clot cannot be traced. However, history of heart disease, diabetes, thyroid disorders, increased cholesterol, recent surgery, and deep vein thrombosis increase the possibility of thrombus or clot formation. Thrombus or clot may remain attached to blood vessel for variable duration of time, and may not cause any symptoms. However, it carries the risk of dislodging from the blood vessel and moving in the circulation. It is now called an embolus. If it blocks another blood vessel, then depending on the site of blockage it can cause stroke (brain), optic stroke (eye), pulmonary embolism (lung), heart attack, etc. It can even block blood vessels of liver, spleen, gut, kidney and cause ischemic or low oxygen changes there. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!",
