            "answer": "Well it's hard, or rather it's impossible, to give you a definitive diagnosis without performing the necessary physical exams, blood work, or other tests needed. What I can do is give information, and I do suggest you schedule an appointment to see your doctor to start, who can then hopefully give you a refferal to see a rheumatologist, or whichever specialist she/he sees fit. For one, I can guess that from looking at your username, you're 68 years old, if I'm wrong do correct me! With age can come general wear/tear problems for the body, effecting all of the general systems involved in creating a functional human body. Numbness in the farthest point of the extremities could be do to a lack of full circulation to the area. Have you ever noticed when you take your shoes off your toes might be a dark reddish blue? That could be one case. Are you diabetic? If so, I'm sure you know of all the consequenscees that comes with diabetes, this being one of them. Another case could be related to nerves, which could be the case as with age comes compression of bone in certain areas, which could compress nerves. Why I recommend eventually seeing a rheumatologist or neurologist is because rheumys specialize in dealing with problems involving circulation, joint and muskuloskeletal problems, connective tissues, and autoimmune diseases, which can also become noticeable with increased age. They could perform a physical exam and guess whether your symptoms are related to circulation or whether a neurologist, who can perform MRIs and conduct nerve conduction studies that look for damaged nerves, is a better choice. So basically there could be many reasons for your symptoms of few of which are listed here, and really I think ultimately a specialist is going to be the doctor to help you. But the first step is to calling and making an appointment with your primary doctor so they can perform an initial exam, possible ordering some tests, and give you a refferal based on what they see during the exam. So I hope that provides some sort of aznswer to your question. I do wish you good luck in sorting this all out and in finding the doctor that's right for you, who can provide you with the best care as possible. I also hope you find this website helpful, as it can be a good resource and has some good support forums, so I hope you keep us posted :). I am sending my best thoughts and wishes your way, take care,Sara RN",
