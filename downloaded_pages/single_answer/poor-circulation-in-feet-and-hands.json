Have them check her blood pressure (sometimes low blood pressure can cause this), check for anemia, check her thyroid (a low thyroid can cause slow circulation), some blood diseases can cause this. Also have them check her blood sugar for diabetes. Sometimes diabetes can cause circulation problems as well as some heart diseases.
