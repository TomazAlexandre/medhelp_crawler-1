            "answer": "Hi there,The risk factors for UTI in males are sexual intercourse, use of spermicidal products, stones in kidney, changing sexual partners frequently, diabetes and childhood infections. The urine can also be due to retention of urine anywhere in its flow due to obstruction. Inherited factors may be related to recurrent UTIs in few people. Drink plenty of water. Continuous or post-coital prophylaxis with low-dose antimicrobials or intermittent self-treatment with antimicrobials may be helpful in managing recurrent uncomplicated UTIs.
