            "answer": "Both type 1 and type 2 have some hereditary elements, but type 2 diabetes seems to be more commonly inherited. Many type 1 diabetics seem to have no other type 1 folks in their families. As for testing your glucose levels in case you develop it, I would probably recommend that you just be educated as to what symptoms to look out for. Some people show symptoms of hypoglycemia for a period of time before developing diabetes, so it may behoove you to be aware of what symptoms point to low blood sugar as well as high blood sugar. If the pancreas is not doing its job properly, your glucose can go either high or low.Symptoms of low blood sugar:fatigue, sleepinessdizzinessunable to concentratehunger OR nausea and complete lack of appetitecraving for sweet foodsshaking hands or other muscle tremorsbreaking out in a sudden sweat like a hot flash OR unexplained chillsyawning for no apparent reasonheadachetemporary loss of memory or ability to use full vocabulary in speechslurred speech if glucose is extremely lowSymptoms of high blood sugar:thirstconstant hunger but the person tends to lose weight even though eating a lotfrequently need to urinate because of constant drinking of liquidsfatiguenausealight-headed feelingYou can see that the symptoms of both can be similar in many ways. This is because in both scenarios the body is unable to metabolize the sugars needed for the brain to work properly. I would recommend that you have yearly checkups with blood tests to check glucose levels, and to be aware of symptoms. If your glucose levels do go up enough for you to become diabetic, symptoms will show up at some point. And annual blood tests can be a good way to find out how well your pancreas is doing. I hope you stay healthy.",
