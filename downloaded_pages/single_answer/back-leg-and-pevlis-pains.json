            "answer": "Hi, probably it is due to nerve compression may be at lower spine level or sciatica. Please get MRI spine done rule out this possibility. This condition is called lumbar spondylosis.Investigations like MRI spine would lead to exact diagnosis due to neuropathy. Sometimes nerve compression at lower spine level leads to weakness in leg along with pain.Do you have history of diabetes? Deficiency of vitamin B in the body is also related with peripheral neuropathy giving symptoms of pain and stiffness in legs.\u201cSciatica is a set of symptoms including pain that may be caused by general compression and/or irritation of one of five nerve roots that give rise to the sciatic nerve or by compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve itself. The pain is felt in the lower back, buttock, and/or various parts of the leg and foot. In addition to pain, which is sometimes severe, there may be numbness, muscular weakness, and difficulty in moving or controlling the leg. Typically, the symptoms are only felt on one side of the body\u201d. Taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatica",
