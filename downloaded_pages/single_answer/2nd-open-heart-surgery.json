    "question": "my mother has had open heart surgery jus 2 and a half months ago on her valve, they tried repairing it and just to find out that it wasnt done correctly or it undid...i am not sure, but they say she needs to have a second surgery to replace it this time. She is having the shortness of breath problem which is one ways we found out something was wrong. Now my question is, should she wait to heal a little more before the second surgery and how long? Id love the best doctor and surgeon for my mother, is there a refferal program we can look into?",
