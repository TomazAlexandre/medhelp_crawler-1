            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Spirometry tests can help diagnose if your symptoms are due to asthma or not. If due to asthma, it may need dose adjustments. Inadequate oxygenation can produce symptoms of breathlessness, as the body tries in an effort to compensate for the decreased oxygen supply. The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
