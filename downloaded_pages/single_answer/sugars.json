            "answer": "You should really be asking this question on the Nutrition expert forum here on MedHelp. But I can tell you that you\u00a0\u00a0may be craving sugars because it actually may help increase serotonin, which is a brain chemical that makes you feel happy. Consuming sugary foods increases the absorption of an amino acid called tryptophan, which helps in production of serotonin, so it is actually possible that eating something sweet may make you feel happy.However you need to remember that sugar is nutritionally empty calories and can cause long lasting health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.",
