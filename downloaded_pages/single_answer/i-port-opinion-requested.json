            "answer": "Lantus should always be put into a separate site from any other type of insulin. Lantus crystallizes after injection, and everything I have read says that you should never inject another type of insulin near that site, for the quick-acting insulin can mess up the crystallized insulin's release times.",

    "question": "My 9-year old daughter was diagnosed about 11 months ago with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She has to endure one uncomfortable shot of Lantus every night, plus Novolog before every meal (4-5 times a day).We want to explore using the I-Port to avoid having to inject her with so many needles every day.\u00a0\u00a0(We are also planning on moving to a pump as soon as we complete our training with our doctor and nutritionist.)My question is this - does anyone have experience in using the I-Port and if so, were/are you injecting both the Lantus and the short-acting insulin through the same site for 2-3 days before switching sites?\u00a0\u00a0Or, are you injecting the Lantus in one site and the short-acting insulin in another site?Thanks!",
