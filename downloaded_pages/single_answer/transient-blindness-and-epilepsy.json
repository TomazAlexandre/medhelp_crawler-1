            "answer": "Hi there!There can be several causes of this transient blindness. Postural hypotension can also lead to transient episodes of blindness. Whether it is related to your epilepsy is difficult to say. Several conditions can cause this transient loss of vision like vertebrobasilar\u00a0\u00a0insufficiency, space occupying lesion in the brain, brain tumors, retinal emboli, severe hypertension,stroke,diabetes mellitus, central retinal vein occlusion etc.I will advise you to see an ophthalmologist soon. A complete eye check up is advised. Do keep us posted.Best wishes!",
