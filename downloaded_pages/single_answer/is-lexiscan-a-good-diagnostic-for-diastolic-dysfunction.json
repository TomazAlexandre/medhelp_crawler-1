            "answer": "Im not certain why a lexiscan is needed for diastolic dysfunction? The biggest cause is high blood pressure followed by aortic stenosis. Diabetes can also be a leading factor because of its effects on blood pressure. I would have thought that she has had an echoscan to diagnose the problem? and they would have noticed if there is an aortic valve issue? The only other cause I can think of is a previous heart attack which has left dead scar tissue, causing the venticle to become stiff. So if blood pressure, diabetes, aortic valve are ruled out, then I guess the best option would be a nuclear scan to check for dead heart muscle.",

    "question": "My wife had an angiogram for chest discomfort when she was 55. The results were perfect, zero restriction. The Cardiologist told her the chest discomfort was probably due to mild diastolic dysfunction. She is now 60, and 30 pounds overweight. She recently went to her GP for bouts of chest pressure and indescribable \"dizzy\" feeling. She has no swelling in her feet.The GP scheduled her for a Lexiscan. Is this the best diagnostic for diastolic dysfunction, or should she cancel it and see her Cardiologist?\u00a0\u00a0Many thanks,,,Bob",
