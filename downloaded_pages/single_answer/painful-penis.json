            "answer": "Hello,Tingling sensation of the penis can be due to anxiety, contact dermatitis, traumatic damage to the nerves of penis, diabetes, prostatitis, genital herpes, urethritis and STD\u2019s like Gonorrhea and Syphilis but they are less likely in your case.I would suggest you to keep the area clean and wear cotton underwears. Also apply a mild steroid cream on the penis. If the symptoms persist then the above said conditions have to be ruled out. Please consult a urologist in that case.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi Forum,Just want to know if any of you have experienced what I'm feeling. Was fine until had protected sex with a woman with genital herpes. I never developed any visible sores on my penis. 6 weeks after the encounter I've had a burning sensation on the right side of my penis. I can't even apply soap when I shower and forget about having sex. 4 months after I'm still testing negative for herpes and all the usual suspects. The burning sensation has been present for 31/2 months now. If it's not herpes then what is causing this pain? I'm so depressed about it.",
