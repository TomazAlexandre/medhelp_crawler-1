Making lifestyles changes to ones diet is not awful and not difficult. Instead of trying to figure out what not to eat focus on what he should eat. Avoid white foods as these quickly turn into sugar after digestion. Eat quality proteins like fish and fowl, nuts and seeds, beans and legumes, fresh vegetables and small amounts of whole grains. Also, he must exercise 30 mis to 1 hr daily and maintain proper body weight. Google search diabetes type 2 side effects. He needs to understand that these do happen to everyone who ignores lifestyle changes - blindness and amputation being the end result.He needs to have a home glucose test meter. He needs to test before each meal and then 2-3 hours after a meal to see how the foods he ate affected his glucose levels.
