            "answer": "Hi there,Menstrual cycle with intervals exceeding 35 days is oligomenorrhea. In long cycles there may be ovulation problems. There may be no ovulation, ovulation may be very irregular or ovulation is abnormal. Eating disorders, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, hyperprolactinemia, PCOs all can lead to irregular periods. It is important to get evaluated for above mentioned possibilities. A clinical examination and tests like pelvic scan, blood sugar levels, and serum prolactin levels may be needed. Treatment will depend on the cause. I hope it helps.Best luck and regards!",
