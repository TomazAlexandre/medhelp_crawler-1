    "question": "Last Dec. I had a UT infection and was dehydrated and bad case of gas all at once.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the ER and was tested and given medication.\u00a0\u00a0The next day I woke up with gout.\u00a0\u00a0When I went to my PC doctor she said the gout might have been triggered by the medicine they have me (which I ended up being allergic to) and she changed my medicine.\u00a0\u00a0Did not have another flare up until I had another UT infection and trauma to my bunion and foot while I was in a cast.Now I was told gout is caused by too much u. acid in system - but mine only occurs when there is trauma going on somewhere in my body.\u00a0\u00a0Could this really be the cause?\u00a0\u00a0I have the list of foods that you are supposed to stay away from so I rarely, if ever eat them.\u00a0\u00a0That's why I'm wondering if something else triggers the gout.\u00a0\u00a0Any comment?",
