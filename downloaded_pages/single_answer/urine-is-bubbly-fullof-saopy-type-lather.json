            "answer": "Soapy of foamy urine makes me think of protein spilling into the urine - think of egg whites, egg whites are albumin.\u00a0\u00a0You whip egg whites and they get foamy. Same is true of urine with albumin (protein) - you urinate and it can look foamy.\u00a0\u00a0Since your were so recently checked, it seems unlikely you could have developed mircoablumin from you diabetes.... Sometimes people normally spill protein for various reason. I read up on daonil and didn't see a side effect of urine sudsing.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect you will need to check with your doctor.Here is a quote from Wikipedia - Proteinuria (/pr\u0259\u028ati\u02d0'n(j)\u028a\u0259ri\u0259/, from protein and urine) means the presence of an excess of serum proteins in the urine. The protein in the urine often causes the urine to become foamy, although foamy urine may also be caused by bilirubin in the urine (bilirubinuria),[1] retrograde ejaculation,[2] pneumaturia (air bubbles in the urine) due to a fistula,[3] or drugs such as pyridium.[1]\u00a0\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProteinuriaHere is a thread on sudsy urine.http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Urology/Sudsy-Urine/show/688029",
