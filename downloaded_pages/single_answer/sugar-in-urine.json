    "question": "I brought my 7 yr old daughter to the dr today because she was complaining that it burned when she pees. She has a history of bladder and kidney infections. She has already been hospitalized with psuedomonis infection. They did a urine test and it came back that she did have an infection and there was sugar in her urine. They then proceeded to check her blood and the level came back at 115. They said that was normal. He said for me to watch her sugar intake because its a sign of diabetes. He didnt seem too concerned but i am. everywhere i look i see diabetes!!",
