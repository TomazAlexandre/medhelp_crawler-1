    "question": "hi, for the last 4 years i have been experiencing a range of pains, after I had a motor bike accident, where i had a large blow to the front of my head on impact with the ground and injury to my back from where the bike came into contact, which was about an inch form the spine, halfway down my back, and whiplash injusy to my neck. I get migraines at least every week, they use to be more often (3-4 every week) but have gradually started to become less with the help of some medication from my dr, that is ment to prevent them. I have a constant headache, sometimes it is worse than other times, but it is always there. I experience nausea for the most part of the day, every day. occasionally i will experience dizziness, some pins and needles/tingliness (mostly in my arm) numbness (mostly in my hand and up the arm about halfway, occasionlly in the leg aswell), I am tierd most of the time, never really get much sleep and even when i do im still exhausted. just don't feel like i have much energy. sometimes i will experience sharp pains in my stomach area and up towards my heart.It gets worse when i try to take larger breaths.I have had xrays and a mri and they have come back with nothing to indicate the cause, havn't had a cat scan yet.wondering what I can/ should do. the drs dn't seem to come up with anything helpful whenever I do go, they just say take this drug, and it doesn't even work. i'm only 18. will I grow out of having the migraines and headaches, they are the most annoying things.advice wanted thanks",
