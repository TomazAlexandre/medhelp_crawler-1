    "question": "I was just wondering if these symptoms are likely to be diabetes. I have a doctors appoinment tomorrow so I will ask then but I was just hoping for a little more information.I have recurrent thrush, I also get some bleeding after passing stools, and I have had a fair few bouts of impetigo lately.From what I've seen these symptoms can be a sign, but I don't have a frequent need to urination or feeling overly thirsty. I also don't feel dizzy after eating sugary food- or if I eat lots I soon recover from feeling sick.I'm slightly worried as I'm 18 and supposed to be going to uni in September. Im not sure how I'll cope with the medication.",
