            "answer": "Hi there!The tablets would not make a difference to the angiography results or reverse the condition and are primarily prescribed to prevent the condition from getting worse and controlling related factors i.e. hypertension, diabetes, hypercholestremia, decrease blood coagulability to prevent clot formation etc. Ideally an angiography is advisable; however a few of the medications may need to be stopped before the test and re-started afterwards. A passive approach would be to wait for sometime for the angiography, if the ischaemia noted has been mild. However if an angiography has been advised by your doctor I would suggested getting done with it at the earliest.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
