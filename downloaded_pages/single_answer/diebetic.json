            "answer": "What amount has your vet prescribed?\u00a0\u00a0Is your dog showing ill effects from this dosage?\u00a0\u00a0You should only be giving your dog a medication that has been prescribed by his or her vet, so if you are worried that this is too large a dose or if your dog is showing adverse signs from the medication you need to contact your veterinarian IMMEDIATELY and tell them what is happening. Especially with diabetes your dog's life depends on this.\u00a0\u00a0Please don't guess, call the vet ASAP.Ghilly",
