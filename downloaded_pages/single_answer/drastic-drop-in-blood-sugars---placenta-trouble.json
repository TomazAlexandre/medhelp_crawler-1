    "question": "I'm 31 weeks pregnant with diet-controlled gestational diabetes. I have an ultrasound in 10 days because at my last ob appointment I was measuring small. However in the last 3 days my blood sugar numbers have dropped drastically and even with an increase of carbs my numbers are really low. I've read this could be an indication of placenta deteroration/failure.\u00a0\u00a0I'm very worried if this is true baby won't make it to the ultrasound. Should I be worried or am I over-reacting?",
