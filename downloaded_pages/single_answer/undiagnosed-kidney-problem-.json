    "question": "I am a 25 year old female, 150 pounds, and exercise regularly. I have been having mutliple health problems for four years shorty after having mono, and kidney stones which were a year and a half apart. Focusing on the kidneys they are constantly sore. When I eat certain foods, especially salty foods, i urinate even more frequently, and leak urine. I have been to a urologist and my bladder is perfectly healthy. I have been to a homeopathic doctor who has discovered all my problems stem from my kidneys, I was told my left kidney functions at 80% normal and my right at 92%. I have had other symptoms such as sore muscles, and hives. I do believe my kidneys are the reason for all of these symptoms. I use two pads a day, and urinate anywhere from 10 to 25 times a day. If I go out to a Mexican restaurant, I find myself up every hour of the night. Beverages and food with high sodium content also make my symptoms worse. I have been told I'm not diabetic, but have history, my father and maternal grandfather also have a\u00a0\u00a0history of stones. In 2004 I had a stone stuck in my ureter for a few days, and finally went to the hospital to have something injected in to relieve pain. Other that that I do not know the cause of my stones. I want to see a nephrologist but am curious if anyone has clues to what is going on. I cant live this way any longer!",
