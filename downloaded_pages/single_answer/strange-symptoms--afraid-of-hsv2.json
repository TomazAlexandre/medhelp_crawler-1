            "answer": "I highly doubt that was herpes related at all. I won't say it's not possible but it's close. Hsv lesions are not like what you describe..now as far as testing is concerned. I don't think you need it. That being said you have clearly had stress over this (very normal) so why not just get a igg blood test for hsv2. When it comes back negative, then you can let it go and move on.It's completely your call but I do not suspect hsv from what you describe",

    "question": "I had a one time sex exposure a year ago. This year in July I formed what I believe to be an abscess. It was firm, long and hot to the touch. After 2/3 days it began to leak and after a hot shower popped and a thick greenish/yellow pus leaked out. A few days later it healed and left a scar. Since some of the fluid began to leak, I believe it caused me to get a yeast infection or bv. Since then, I have panicked that it may have been a herpes blister. Since then I have had a mild burning sensation\u00a0\u00a0aginally..along with mild froonnpain. No blisters, no discharge, no itching. I have some soreness on my buttock..but nothing that stretching doesn't help or just resting. I also was diagnosed with mono a month ago...help!!! Should I get tested or is it my anxiety...",
