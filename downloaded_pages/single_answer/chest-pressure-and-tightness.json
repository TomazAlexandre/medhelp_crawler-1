            "answer": "HelloFirst. I apologize. I responed to your post promptly but it did not post. Anytime a patient has chest discomfort, it's very anxiety provoking.

It is good that your risk factors for cardiac causes of chest pain seem to be minimal. that is, no cholesterol problems, hypertension diabetes and normal weight with good exercise toleranceEven though you are on antibiotics and taking them according to instructions, follow up to assess resolution of the mycoplasma infection is the most appropriate and safest course of actionGood luck and happy holidays",
