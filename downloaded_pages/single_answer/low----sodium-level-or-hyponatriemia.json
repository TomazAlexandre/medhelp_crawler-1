            "answer": "Hi there. Your father has a cardiac history of blocked vessels, not corrected with angioplasty due to other co morbidities diabetes, congestive heart failure. Hyponatremia is defined as Serum Na levels less than 135 mmol/L. It can develp due to excessive free water if received hypotonic solutions during a hospital stay, excessive renal or extrarenal losses of Na or renal retention of free water and deficient intake of Na, though less common.I understand your concern, but self treatment of hyponatremia at home can be very dangerous since he has congestive heart failure where you have to restrict salt and fluids to contain edema and pulmonary edema. So my advice to you is that do not increase sodium intake unmonitored. Sudden increase in serum sodium levels is also associated with central pontine myelinosis.Please show him to a physician and he would be the best judge if this hyponatremia needs correction at all in the background of other diseases he has or if this can be left untreatment if asymptomatic.Hope this helps. Take care.",
