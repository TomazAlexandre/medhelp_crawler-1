    "question": "My husband is a 32yr old hispanic and for a year now he has been getting dark large spot like what some people get on their elbows on his bottom and back of the neck. They are hard like really dry skin but they do not bother him. I have started to notice that his hands and feet are starting to turn dark brown as well now. Help me please to understand what it might be. He is over-weight and has a family background of diabetes.",
