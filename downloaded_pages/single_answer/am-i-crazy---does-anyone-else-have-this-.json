            "answer": "Oh, yea, I get them if I eat, or if I don't eat!!! There is just not really a let up in these things and they can just drive you nuts trying to determine what to do about them. I went to the ER several months ago b/c I was in a sustained PVC rhythm that had been going on for hours and hours and finally I just could not take them anymore. The ER docs did not seem at all concerned, in fact the hooked me up to an IV and the nurses were in and out of my room....mainly out which I did not like. I think my husband and I were there for about 2 hrs before they decided to give me Lopressor in the IV and after one more dose a little while later, the sustained beats stopped. But, I was pretty frazzled, mostly by the nurses just being so blase and uninterested in my 'cardio event' which had caused me much distress and it takes a lot to get me going!!! i was basically told my the attending physician these things were not life threatening at all and that I should just try to relax the next time it happened.So, I really do not have many suggestions for you other than to say that most of the time, I would say that these types of arrhythmias are prob nothing to worry about but when in doubt, then I would have them ck'ed out. Relaxing and trying to stay calm is what everyone says to do and I know that is not always easy but just try to remember to take that advice!! I know too that maybe we do obsess about these things but naturally that are imp to us and we want to get as much info from our doctors as we can. I\u00a0\u00a0also know that when I am talking to my cardio about my arrhythmias, he is prob thinking about something else entirely. Sometimes that is the impression that I get!So, take care and hopefully someone will help you more!!",
