            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Take his body temperature and see. If it is low, then it could be due to thyroid disorders, adrenal gland problems, anemia, diabetes, hypoglycemia, liver diseases, low Vit B12, and vasovagal attacks. A strain like head injury could affect the various body glands function.If the temperature is normal, then feeling cold is the after effect of head injury. This needs to be treated by a neurologist. In any case please inform his pediatrician and consult him and a neurologist. Take care!",
