            "answer": "It could be due to the fact that the burn has given you a small infection, and infections can sometimes cause the rise in blood sugar. It could also be due to the stress, it causes a big time rise as does any trauma. Some nurses and doctors have used sugar for healing, but, they usually make a paste out of it and apply it in the wound. I would not let it go too long or get too high. Give it maybe a week and if it continues, see your doctor.",
