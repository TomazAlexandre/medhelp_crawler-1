            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!It is really difficult to comment on a case like this. You should look at two main possibilities\u2014one is hormonal and the other is autoimmune. For thyroid get a thyroid antibody test done. Also you may need to get other hormone panels done. Diabetes too should be ruled out.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
