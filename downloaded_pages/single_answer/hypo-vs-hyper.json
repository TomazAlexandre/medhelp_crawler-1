            "answer": "Your doc should refer you to an endocrinologist who specializes in Thyroid, not diabetes. Many auto-immune conditions can run together. It is not uncommon for a person wtih Lupus to have Hashimoto's Disease.People with Hashimoto's (which causes HYPO-thyroidism) have high TSH. You should have your Hashi antibodies tested (TGab and TPOab). Also, I suggest getting Vitamin D levels tested. I'm a Hashi who has difficulty maintaining vitamin D.D vitamin is needed for calcium absorbtion, strong bones.Again, a good endo will know better how to treat and diagnose you. TSH is not as important as the freeT3/freeT4 levels, which tell us directly what the thryoid is doing. TSH is a pituitary hormone.:) Tamra",
