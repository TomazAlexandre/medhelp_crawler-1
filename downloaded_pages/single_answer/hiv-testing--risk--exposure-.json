            "answer": "Hello,Thank you for your post.If you are going to continue being so paranoid about these incididents, you'd better be looking for a new job!None of the two epsiodes would qualify as stick needle injuries; therefore I do not beleive that they had posed any HIV risk to you at all.\u00a0\u00a0I think that you are overreacting and worrying unnecessarily.In any case, I can assure you that a negative HIV test (simple antibody test) is final and fully conclusive after 12 weeks (84 days) of a possible exposure.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore if you get this test at 91 days, you can rest assured that you are negative and you can safely breast feed your baby.Best wishes,Dr Jos\u00e9",

    "question": "Hi Doctor,Back in October, I posted a question regarding my risk of HIV acquistion.\u00a0\u00a0I was giving a patient a flu shot, patient began bleeding after I took off the gloves, I wiped up the blood with an alcohol swab.\u00a0\u00a0I did have a finger prick on that finger where I was holding the alcohol swab.\u00a0\u00a0I could seperate the skin, but no active bleeding. I asked the patient, and he denied being positive for HIV or HEP C (married 44 year old male)I tested 28 days later with an an ICMA test, I am in the US and could not get a DUO test.In November, the same day I got my results back, I was helping another patient, he wanted to be screened for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I had vinyl gloves on and got blood on my thumb and forefinger.\u00a0\u00a0Took off the gloves, didn't see blood on my actual skin.\u00a0\u00a0Started cleaning up and then got worried what if there was blood on the diabetes testing machine and strip container....so I went in to full freak out mode (again)\u00a0\u00a0I never asked this patient his HIV status.\u00a0\u00a0All I know is he had been feeling really tired lately and was overweight and had heard diabetes might be causative, so he wanted screening.\u00a0\u00a0The rational part of me says, if he was HIv positive he wouldn't be coming to a pharmacy to get screened for diabetes, he'd be seeing his doctor. Anyway....I am going to get tested again next month.\u00a0\u00a0It will be 91 days past the second exposure (if you can even call it that) and 119 days after the first incident.Mostly, I know my fears are irrational....I have never had any issues with blood, but since I've been pregnant, I'm all over the place with worry (about anything and everything)Will the testing be considered conclusive at 3 months?The CDC recommends six months.\u00a0\u00a0I'm due in April, if I went 2 weeks before my due date it would be 22 weeks since the second incident.Also if the test comes back negative next week, do you think it's safe to breastfeed? No risk of delayed seroconversion.Thank you for your answers!",
