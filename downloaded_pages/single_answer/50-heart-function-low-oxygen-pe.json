            "answer": "Hi,Recovery in your father\u2019s case depends upon various factors like nutrition, improvement of weakness of respiratory muscles, absorption of any fluid present in the lungs and prevention of PE. With advancing age, and comorbid conditions like high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, diabetes etc recovery might take longer, but in this period proper care ensures a healthy recovery.You can take a nutritionist\u2019s help for his diet plan or if he is not willing you can ask his doctor for intermittent ryle\u2019s tube feeding. Hope this helps. Best.",
