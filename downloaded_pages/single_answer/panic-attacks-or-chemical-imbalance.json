    "question": "Last summer I had a horrendous kidney infection that sprang up out of nowhere.\u00a0\u00a0I was almost hospitalized, but after several shots of antibiotics I turned out ok.\u00a0\u00a0A few weeks ago, I was experiencing heart palpitations which turned into a full blown panic attack and went to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0They diagnosed me with low potassium, gave me some pills and Ativan and sent me on my way.\u00a0\u00a0Last week, I checked up with my regular physician, he re-ran my potassium, and did blood work for my kidneys and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He called me earlier this week and said \"Everything looks kinda ok; So basically you're fine.\"\u00a0\u00a0Last night I completely freaked out and had another panic attack. I took an Ativan and after throwing up and hours of nervous shaking and crying, I was able to fall asleep.\u00a0\u00a0My heart is still racing, and I just dont feel normal. I am scared and all alone. 6 months ago I broke off and engagement, and am living by myself after 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0So, I dont know if this is all related or what?\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions?",
