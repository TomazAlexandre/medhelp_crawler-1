            "answer": "You're smart to be so observant and concerned. It cannot hurt to share your concern with the little girl's mother.

    "question": "I have a 3 1/2 year old girl that I watch 5 days a week.\u00a0\u00a0She is very large for her age, so I don't think she is losing weight.\u00a0\u00a0However, she is excessively thirsty and has to go to the bathroom quite often.\u00a0\u00a0She is a very good eater.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe too good!\u00a0\u00a0She is a very happy little girl.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure if I should mention to her mom that she might want to have her tested for diabetes? What do you all think?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your insight!",
