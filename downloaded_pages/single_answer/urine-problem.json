Causes are sleep apnea, hyperparathyroidism, chronic renal failure, urinary incontinence, bladder infection, Interstitial Cystitis, diabetes, heart failure and benign prostatic hyperplasia.You need to consult a urologist and get your blood sugar levels, urine examination, urine culture, PSA, prostate examination and kidney function tests done. All these possibilities also need to be ruled out one by one. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",
