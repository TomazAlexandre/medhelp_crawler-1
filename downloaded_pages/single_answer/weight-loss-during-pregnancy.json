            "answer": "hi Kaitlynlilythanks so much for your question!According to your initial description you say you are 40 Kg\u00a0\u00a0overweight based on your height to be considered \"normal\". You have not provided me with specific data so i am assuming that you have the right numbers.Regarding to your question yes it can be healthy to lose weight like this study shows: Take a look!\"Losing weight during pregnancy may improve the health of babies born to obese women with gestational diabetes\"Traditionally, doctors haven't liked to see pregnant women lose weight, even if the women are obese. Indeed, the 1990 guidelines of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) suggest that obese women should gain 15 to 25 pounds over the course of a pregnancy.As you say it may be just the change of not eating junk with the increase of activity. Remember if you diet go and check with your local docotr and make sure it is safe for you to lose wight when pregnant.Hope this helps!",
