    "question": "I have been getting odd sensations in my head at times. It started about 2-3 months ago and went away after a week...it has now come back. Often, upon waking up or...ummm... after climaxing when falling asleep, I get intense waves of weirdness through my head. No other time.The closest I can compare it to is the odd feeling of your stomach \"leaving\" when you drop suddenly (roller coaster, quick dropping elevator), except in my head instead. It is very intense, almost to the point I am scared my brain is going to \"short out\" from it. Not in any way pleasant. I get one wave, feel relatively normal for a second, then another. Often it doesn't happen until I get up, in which case laying back down helps. When it happens after climaxing, it is when I am falling asleep right after.It isn't painful in a headache sort of way by any means. It really does feel like a wave of energy traveling from the back or middle of my brain towards and out of my face. starts of mild building up to very intense and then fading out again, all within a second, then occurring again after another second or 2.Things I also suffer from: \"ocular migraines\" (various vision disturbances, from mild to severe at times. At the onset I also acquired many \"floaters\") and diabetes (not officially diagnosed, but 95% sure). These 2 do not seem to have a patterned relation to the \"energy waves\". Can't seem to pair it with stress or anything else either.28 year old white male. Light smoker, but active and eat healthy. No medications at all. Thank you for any leads on this situation.",
