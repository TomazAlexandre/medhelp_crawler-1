            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you have recently started a birth control pill, then it could be the side effect of this medicine. Hence consult your gynecologist regarding this. Breathlessness can be also be due to several causes. The commonest cause is anemia. It can also be due to asthma like conditions, bronchitis, high blood pressure, diabetes, hypothyroidism or obesity. Certain heart conditions (like a murmur) too can cause breathlessness. If it is not the pill, the best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Hope this helps. Take care!",
