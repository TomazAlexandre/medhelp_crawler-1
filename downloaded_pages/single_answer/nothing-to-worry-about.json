            "answer": "Hi,Your tests are indeed normal, which is great. However given your family history and distribution of weight, you are at risk for diabtes in the future. The fact that you do not have it now does not mean you are \"protected\" as your doctor suggested. We do not have a good way to predict who will develop diabetes or when it will happen, so the best you can do is work on making it less likely in future.I do not think you need further testing for diabetes right now, but you should have a fasting glucose once a year.Metformin is not indicated for use as a weight loss medication so I would not suggest that right now.\u00a0\u00a0If you have a 2 hour glucose test showing an elevated glucose at the 2 hour point, metformin may be a good medication in that case. Overall the goal for you right now is definitely weight loss. There are medications that can help with weight loss(like xenical and meridia) that you can speak with your doctor about when you have a clinic visit. The best option is to enroll in a diet/lifestyle program that includes good nutritional guidance and daily exercise as a way to lose weight.And definitely keep your thyroid medication optimised.Take care.",

    "question": "I am a 53 year old female with a family history of Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In the last two years, I have put on a significant amount of weight (probably 35-40 pounds), almost all of it in the belly. I seem to be hungry all the time and I'm fatigued a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I keep reading about belly fat and insulin resistance and hunger, so I got myself tested for diabetes.My numbers came back as follows: fasting glucose was 86; insulin was less than 2.0 and Hemoglobin A1c was 5.3. For good measure, I bought a glucose meter and my fasting glucose is always normal, although after eating carbohydrates, my glucose will rise to about 122 one hour after a meal and then instead of falling, at two hours, I will be at 126 or so.My doctor said these numbers are completely normal and, in fact, given the excess belly weight that I am carrying, I must have a gene that is protecting me from becoming diabetic.I have a few questions.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think any further diabetes testing is warranted?\u00a0\u00a0Could a drug like Metformin help me lose weight even if I am not diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0I am really at wit's end with my weight gain. I had two Cushing's workups which came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed last year with Hashimoto's, but I am on thryoid replacement and with replacement have a TSH of 2.75.Am I just wasting my money with more diabetes' tests? I just don't know what is wrong with me.",
