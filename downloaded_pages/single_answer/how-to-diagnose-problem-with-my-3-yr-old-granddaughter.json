            "answer": "What professionals have seen your grand daughter and what reason did they give that she wasn't on the spectrum?If you go over to the autism forum and click on the Health Page icon on the top right hand corner of that page, have a look at the 'Behavioural Characteristics behind the DSM IV clinical criteria for a diagnosis of autism'.\u00a0\u00a0DSM IV is a medical book that lists all the different disorders and what the criteria is to get a diagnosis for each individual disorder.\u00a0\u00a0 Professionals use these criteria to decide if your child is on the spectrum or not.\u00a0\u00a0Some parents have also posted examples of their childs behaviours that met the clinical criteria to help others identify what kind of things are relevant.As you say your grand daughter has sensory issues I would recommend you google the name Olga Bodgashina and read an article by her printed in Autism Today.\u00a0\u00a0She has a very good book called Sensory and Perceptual Differences in Autism and Aspergers.\u00a0\u00a0This book has a caregivers questionnaire at the back of it that you can complete to get an picture of your child's sensory profile.\u00a0\u00a0For example your grand daugther may have differences with the senses of smell and taste.\u00a0\u00a0Olga is a reputable professional and her questionnaire is used by our autism department.If the family definately thinks that autism is behind it then you need to go to your GP or paediatrician and ask for a multi disciplinary team evaluation by professionals who are experienced in diagnosising autistic spectrum disorders.\u00a0\u00a0This usually involves a Speech and Language Therapist, Psychologist, Occupational Therapist (if motor or sensory issues are involved), and may include other such as Neurologist etc depending on the child.",

    "question": "Hello,I have a 3 yr old granddaughter who has been ruled out of the autism spectrum.\u00a0\u00a0However, she seems to have behaviors and symptoms that seem abnormal for a 3 yr old.\u00a0\u00a0She was born 3 weeks early, her mother (my daughter) had diabetes while pregnant and needed insulin.\u00a0\u00a0The birth was vaginal and the cord was wrapped around her neck.From the very beginning the baby had acid reflux and cried unconsolably for hours.\u00a0\u00a0She was breast fed almost exclusively.\u00a0\u00a0She had a hard time changing over to baby food, and eventually refused to eat altogether.\u00a0\u00a0She was 6 lb 8oz at birth and currently weighs 25 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0She only eats certain foods, will not drink milk and has to be hand fed (hot dogs).\u00a0\u00a0She does pick up dry things such as cookies, crackers.She has been diagnosed with sensory issues, but she speaks only a few words and has meltdowns where she cries uncontrollably.\u00a0\u00a0She has not slept in her crib and almost from the beginning has slept with her parents.\u00a0\u00a0She has speech therapy and occupational therapy.\u00a0\u00a0She is attending special ed pre-school this fall.Sometimes she seems in her own world and does very little interaction with other children.\u00a0\u00a0She has been seen by doctors who seem to have no diagnosis for her, and we know that it is important to get the proper help as soon as possible to avert the autism.\u00a0\u00a0We are worried but seem to lack the proper diagnosis and prognosis for our precious granddaughter.\u00a0\u00a0What type of doctor can we go to for a correct diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0One doctor even mentioned Rett Syndrome as a matter of fact statement.Thank You,Bonnie",
