    "question": "Hi, I am 43 have had 3 babies via c-section. My periods became abnormal last year. At first I didn't have a cycle and then started heavy bleeding with lots of clots. I was on clomid for serveral months this help stop the bleeding, but then it just stopped working and I started bleeding and bleeding again. Then the Dr. put me on lose dose birth control last month. I have my period now and have heavy bleeding with large chunks of tissue discharge. I have been anemic before and, I am again because of this blood loss. The Dr. thinks it is perimenapause. But, I think that maybe it is something more. Why is my lining shedding so much? I have thinning hair and have had gestational diabetes and severe acne in my 20's. Any help is thanked!",
