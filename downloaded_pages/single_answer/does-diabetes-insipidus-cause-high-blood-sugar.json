    "question": "My son has bedwetted for 3 years. He has had plenty of urine tests. He recently went on a synthetic Vasopressin substance called desmomelt. This worked for about 3 weeks. Then it stopped working. I as told to raise the dose. I didn't, I decided to take him off. Following this he began wetting constantly as soon as he went to sleep but stopped after about 2am. I asked for him to be tested for any infections in the bladder, the uretha etc. He took a urine test and it showed high glucose levels and he was diagnosed immedietely with type 1 diabetes and administered insulin. I kept asking the consultant whether it had anything to do with coming off the drugs and they said no. His blood sugar level has been as high a s 30, I was told he should be in a coma! But he feels fine and dandy. I have discovered something called diabetes insipidus and if anything I would say he has all these symptoms. But can he have high sugar level with this diabetes insipidus? Can the sudden withdrawal of the drug have caused this adverse reaction?If you see any correlation then please let me know.",
