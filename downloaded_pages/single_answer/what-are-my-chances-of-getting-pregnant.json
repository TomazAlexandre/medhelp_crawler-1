            "answer": "Welcome to the community. I am sorry you are struggling with this. If you are overweight, losing some weight can normalize the menstrual cycle and ovulations increasing your chances of pregnancy. According to this fact sheet - http://womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/polycystic-ovary-syndrome.html - \"Even a 10 percent loss in body weight can restore a normal period and make your cycle more regular.\"Type 2 diabetes drug metformin is sometimes helpful at restoring ovulations as well as having other positive effects. It is mentioned in the above fact sheet. This link - http://www.fertilityplus.com/faq/metformin.html - has a list of medical studies on this subject.Fertility drugs are of course another option.A reproductive endocrinologist should be able to help you with this.Best of luck to you!",
