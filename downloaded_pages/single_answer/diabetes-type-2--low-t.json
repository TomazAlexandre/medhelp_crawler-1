            "answer": "There is no doctor on this board, only other people with diabetes. I cannot advise you on your ED or tell you the side effects of medications. What I can tell you is that you need to get your blood sugar under control. The most important thing you can do for that is lose weight. As long as you are at that high weight you are going to have trouble controlling your blood glucose (and will develop other medical problems as well). You need to eliminate sugar and cut your carbs way down. This will reduce your blood sugar and help you lose weight slowly and safely and develop new healthy patterns of eating. If the medications you are taking are not keeping your blood glucose in a healthy pattern you might talk to your doctor about putting you on insulin, at least until you lose some weight and get the numbers down.See an endocrinologist, not just a regular doctor and have him refer you to a dietician or diabetic educator to become a part of your diabetes management team. But the bottom line is you DO have the ability to control your diabetes, and everything else in your health picture which is related to that.",
