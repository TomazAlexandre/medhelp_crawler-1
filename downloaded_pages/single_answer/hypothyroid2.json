            "answer": "I got married around five mths, suffered from late periods, I now have PCOs, the deal with this is, u should always seek advice from a GOOD doctor, I have had my case messed up before, one of the doctor put me on OCPs (contraception) for six mths time and said it would heal up if i lose weight and stay to a healthy weight. I did that I now have it back, my advice would be u seek advice from any other doctor, preferably a better gynecologist. PCOs is a big mess itself and because of that other problems come swimming along, this time I have abnormal LH, FH, TSH levels which are causing missed periods, more weight gain and I am getting hard time since I cant even get pregnant and to make it worse, I have type 2 diabetes. u should get the treatment for PCOs its a major issue here. some people dont gain much weight in the begininng, but if u have gained weight tell ur doctor about it. I felt a bti nausea too but my doc said it was due to my late periods. I an now in pills, things have started to cool down a bit, I do have a horrible backache though and trouble sleeping along with breast pain. what else do u have? did u get an ultrasound yet?",
