            "answer": "Hello and Welcome to the Pain Mangement Forum. I am sorry to hear about all your medical conditions and pain.I also understand your concern with the TKR. If you trust your surgeon I would follow his advice. I know it can be frightening but I doubt a respectable surgeon would recommend it if he felt it was too risky.It's your body and always your choice. Personally I would have the TKR. My mother is in her seventies and had one even though she has multiple medical issues, including diabetes. She came through with flying colors.What ever you decide we will support you. Best of luck and please let us know how you are doing.Take Care,Tuck",
