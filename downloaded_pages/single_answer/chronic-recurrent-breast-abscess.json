    "question": "Hi!I am going thru something called chronic breast abscesses. It started back on 6/12 and as I write this question I have multiple abscesses on my left breast some about to break open other that look like a big bruise and some in my right breast. They're very painful & after 4 surgeries I am very sad to say it seems to get worst every time.My surgeon sent me to an infectious disease doctor, 3 weeks ago but still unable to see her bc of my insurance. No one has an idea why the abscesses keep coming, nothing gets to them! I've had all kinds of antibiotics given to me, yet\u00a0\u00a0still going thru it. Any help?",
