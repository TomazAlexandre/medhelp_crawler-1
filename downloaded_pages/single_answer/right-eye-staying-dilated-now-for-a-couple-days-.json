            "answer": "Hi!Since you have diabetes, the first thing to be ruled out with a dilated pupil is glaucoma.If you have unequal pupils, but the difference between the two pupils is less than 2mm, then this is physiological variation. If it is more than 2 mm then it could be due to pathologic anisocoria. This is due to an abnormality in the musculature of the iris or in the parasympathetic or sympathetic innervations to the pupil. It is also a sign of serious brain injury. Aneurysms, bleed in the brain, glaucoma, meningitis and tumors also cause unequal pupil size. Please consult an eye specialist immediately. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
