            "answer": "Hi,This sounds like a fungal infection.Has this been present for quite some time already?There may be an overlying bacterial infection which may attribute to the foul odor. This usually happens if the condition is untreated. I suggest that you have this assessed by a dermatologist. You may need oral medications for this. Culture of any discharge from the affected area may be necessary to guide treatment.Do you have any underlying conditions like diabetes?",

    "question": "I think it's a rash, but am not sure.The area around my testicles, in between the testicle and the leg on both sides has a bad rash, I think.The area is sweaty, has painful bumps and sores, and has a very foul odor to it. It only hurts if something rubs against it, and sometimes when I walk. This seems to go away and come back every once in a while. It may go away for a week and stay for two or three.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it hurts badly, and I can't stand to walk. Can you help me with what this might be, and maybe a treatment? I'm not sexually active as far as with a partner or anything.",
