            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The echogenic shadows in the liver could be due to fatty liver changes. Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. This can progress to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. So, prevention or cure is by avoiding alcohol and treating diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels.The sonography findings in the kidneys, reflect an old injury to the kidneys in the form of infections or inflammations.Liver function tests and Renal function tests will show the actual functional status of the\u00a0\u00a0liver and the kidney. Ask for these blood tests when you meet your doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
