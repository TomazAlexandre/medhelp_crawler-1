            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!What you have is probably postural hypotension. The blood pressure falls when you stand and causes all the symptoms that you are suffering. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Addisons\u2019 disease, hypoglycemia, VitB12 and folate deficiency can all cause hypotension. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, blood tests, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required to find the cause. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take",

    "question": "Hi, my name is Catherine and I am a 15 year old girl.\u00a0\u00a0For about two years, when I change positions, from sitting to standing up, my vision starts to black out, and I see a purple/black clouds.\u00a0\u00a0I also get headaches behind my eyes when this happens.\u00a0\u00a0Everything lasts about 15 seconds.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors have given me no answers, only to drink more, which doesn't always help. We did learn that my blood pressure dropped during these episodes, like to 100/56.\u00a0\u00a0I have never been hospitalized for this, until recently, but it was all different.\u00a0\u00a0I walked upstairs to get some lunch, and I felt so sick, like I would throw up, but I thought if I ate I would feel better.\u00a0\u00a0I collapsed, and sat on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0On the way to the ER, everything I saw was bright, white and fuzzy.\u00a0\u00a0My arms and legs felt numb.\u00a0\u00a0My mom was asking me questions like my address and birthday.\u00a0\u00a0I said the answers in my head but could barely make my mouth say them.\u00a0\u00a0I started sweating hard as everything ended, and I felt fine again. My face and lips were white.\u00a0\u00a0It lasted ten minutes.\u00a0\u00a0They doctors have no clue what's wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0I need help.\u00a0\u00a0If this ever happens when I am driving, it could be bad.P.S. I had a MRI, it came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0So did a EKG.",
