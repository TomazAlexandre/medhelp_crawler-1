            "answer": "Hi!Well, if your right eye has a problem then right side of head will hurt. Yes, it could be a pinched nerve in the neck. It can also be a peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or lupus or thyroid problem. Please ask your doctor to look into all these aspects. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

    "question": "I've been dealing with right sided head aches for about 2 months now, been to the ER and my Doctor numerous times. I got a CT scan, without Dye, and it came out clear. Now I'm getting this chill like feeling in my right scalp and on my right four arm at the same time. its not constant, rather random actually. I also have a very slight neck pain. I'm getting very tired of this, what should I do? The doctor thinks it could be my right eye, I require glasses for this eye and he thinks my headaches are being caused by me not wearing the glasses, but I thought if my right eye was bad the left part of my head would hurt? Could it be a pinched nerve in the neck?Thank you for all the help!",
