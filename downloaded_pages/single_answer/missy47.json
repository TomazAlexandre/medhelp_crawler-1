            "answer": "I am happy to address the questions that you pose, although it is important that you recognize that my impression is based entirely on the information you have provided in your posting and is by no means a substitute for an office visit with a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosis is contingent on detailed history and physical examination and as such, the following information should be considered solely for educational purposes.You are describing some sensory disturbance, which is -generally speaking- a very subjective and non-specific symptom which can reflect potentially a process involving the sensory pathway, which extends all the way from the skin and the sensory receptors to the higher sensory centers in the brain.Accurate diagnosis of the underlying condition requires a visit to a neurologist who can obtain more detailed history about the time course of your symptoms, the pattern of involvement and then do a thorough physical and neurological examination to detect any objective findings of sensory loss or other associated neurological deficits like weakness, abnormal reflexes....etc. Based on the history and the exam the physician would then identify or localize the area that is probabely affected and then tailor the workup accordingly.The list of possible conditions is pretty broad given the limited information I have right now. some of these possibilities are:. peripheral neuropathy which is usually seen in conditions like diabetes, vitamin deficiency, excessive alcohol, exposure to variety of toxins and medications. immune-mediated conditions, like Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) or CIDP, connective tissue disease like lupus. Trauma (as in carpal tunnel syndrome). Infections. Conditions involving the brain or spinal cord, like demyelinating diseases (multiple sclerosis), or chronic inflammation or infection, some types of strokes.. Certain hereditary conditions. Psychosomatic disease (related to stress or anxiety) can sometimes present with non-specific symptomsAs you can see, a large spectrum of conditions can present with numbness. That is why my advice to you is to get into to see a neurologist who will obtain history, perform an exam and then order the appropriate workup to figure out the process that is causing these symptoms.Thanks for using the forum, let me know if you have any further questions",
