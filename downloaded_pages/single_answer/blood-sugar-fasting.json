            "answer": "Hello,< 125 is reasonable control, but it would also be good to know what is happening after you eat and what your Hba1c (average of 3 months blood sugar is).If your fasting is high, then I also suspect your post eating numbers are high.I would recommend you ask your Dr about medication such as metformin / Glucophage as it is better to get this very well controlled as early as possible.Do you have a home blood sugar meter?\u00a0\u00a0If so, please test about 1 1/2\u00a0\u00a0- 2 hours after eating and see what your numbers are.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally they are < 140 all the time. If they are higher than 140 please discuss further with your drs.let us know how you go.",
