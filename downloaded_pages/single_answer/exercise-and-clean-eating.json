            "answer": "Hi!Your weight is on the higher side. The common causes of weight gain are overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, hypothyroidism have to be ruled out in your case. If all these causes are ruled out then you can start a diet and exercise program to lose weight. A healthy way to lose weight is between 1 and 2 lbs. per week. To lose 1 to 2 lbs. per week one needs to burn 500 to 1,000 calories more per day than the consumed. Any weight loss programme needs a good combination of a balanced diet and exercise to lose weight. Take up lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, oats and other whole grain products and lean meat and take carbohydrates in moderation and limit fat and sugar. Week by week slowly increase the exercise which should include both aerobics and strength training. Drink plenty of water and non fattening fluids such as clear soups etc. Stop eating processed foods\u00a0\u00a0diet ,sodas, fried foods,toffees,soft drinks, tinned foods,puddings,fruit juice,desserts,artificial sweeteners .The healthiest way to reduce weight\u00a0\u00a0 is to reduce your portion sizes, eat fats in moderation, and increase your physical activity. You will need sustained efforts to achieve weight loss. Hope this helps. Take care!",
