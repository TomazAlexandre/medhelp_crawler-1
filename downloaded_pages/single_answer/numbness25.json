Pain, tingling and numbness are signs of neuropathy.Nerve involvement may be single (mono-neuropathy) or multiple (poly-neuropathy).This neuropathy can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your case the symptoms are due to nerve compression at the level of shoulder joint as you are having numbness till your hand.Your symptoms could be due to shoulder impingement.You should be consulting a neurologist and an orthopaedician for your further reference.Keep me posted.Bye.",
