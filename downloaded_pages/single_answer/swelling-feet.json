    "question": "HelloI have type 1 diabetes,14 yrs now,\u00a0\u00a0and for the past 2 weeks I have noticed that my feet, around the ankle they swell. I have done the 24h urine test, and it has shown that I m losing Leukoma. I do not have high blood pressure and unfortunately here in Athens it takes time before being able to make an appointment with the doctor. Although, I will see my md next week, I was wondering if anyone knows the seriousness of this matter, if it is treatable, what s the best thing I can do before I see my doctor.It started suddenly, and I m concerned. I have no idea what started it etcAnyone who can give some advice will be greatly appreciated.Thank you,Sophie",
