            "answer": "Hi, \"vertigo\u00a0\u00a0is the most recognizable and quite often the sole symptom of decreased blood flow in the vertebrobasilar distribution. The vertigo due to VBI rarely is brought on by head turning, which could occlude the ipsilateral vertebral artery and result in decreased blood flow to the brain if the contralateral artery is occludedPatients are advised to slowly rise to standing position after sitting for a long period of time. An appropriate exercise regimen for each patient can also be designed in order to avoid the excessive pooling of blood in the legs. Dehydrated patients are often advised to increase their water intake, especially in hot, dry climates. Finally, when applicable, patients are often advised to stop smoking and to control their hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol level.Sometimes, to prevent further occlusion of blood vessels, patients are started on an antiplatelet agent (aspirin, clopidogrel, or aspirin/dipyridamole) or sometimes an anticoagulant (warfarin) once hemorrhage has been excluded with imaging\".This information is taken from website http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebrobasilar_insufficiency",

    "question": "In the past I have had a lacunar infarct.\u00a0\u00a0I am diabetic, hypertensive, hypercholesterolaemic, family history of coronary artery disease.\u00a0\u00a0Had an MRA four years ago which detected the infarct and MRA detected congenitally small left vertebral artery.\u00a0\u00a0For the past two weeks I have had vertigo.\u00a0\u00a0It occurs only when I am about to lie down in bed, getting up in the morning, turning my head to the left abruptly (this also causes excruciating pain for a few seconds), looking upwards, e.g. on high shelves in kitchen.\u00a0\u00a0Could my left vertebral artery be kinking and causing vertebrobasilar insufficiency which in turn presents as vertigo? Should I see a Neurovascular Sugeon? Carotid artery Doppler revealed only small plaques.\u00a0\u00a0Coronary angiogram normal.\u00a0\u00a0Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks",
