            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Wrist pain could be due to carpal tunnel syndrome. It could also be due to rheumatoid arthritis. If you are a diabetic or have a family history of diabetes, this should be checked as diabetes can cause stiff joints of hand.You could also be suffering from gout, which also results in joint pains and swelling. This is due to high uric acid in the body that gets accumulated in the joints.Dip hand in warm water and gently rotate the hand at wrist. Take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as tylenol, ibuprofen, or naproxen. If this does not help,please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.
