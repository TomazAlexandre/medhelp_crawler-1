            "answer": "Hello,Anal itching can be due to yeast infection, diabetes, worm infestation, haemorrhoids, anal fissure etc A low fiber diet can lead to a condition called hemorrhoids .These are swollen veins in the anal canal.

About a month back was constipated for a few days and upon going to the bathroom eventually would feel a burning sensation around the anus during bowel movement.
