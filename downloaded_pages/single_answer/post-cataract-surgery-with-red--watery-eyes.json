    "question": "I had cataract surgery in April, 2015. I also have glaucoma from my diabetes. Since my cataract surgery, my eyes are red and water a lot. I have tried Refresh Optive and Systane Ultra and my eyes are still watering and are red. I also have to take Combigan and Azopt for my glaucoma. Any suggestions?",
