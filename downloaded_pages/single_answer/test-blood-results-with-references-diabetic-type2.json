            "answer": "I'm only going to speak to your A1C as I am a diabetic and that is what my knowledge includes. You should speak with your doctor regarding the other results. An A1C of 6.3 puts you in the prediabetic category. (6.5 is diabetic). This is an opportunity to slow the progression of your diabetes. I would recommend losing any weight you need to lose, and continuing the good work with exercise. You say you eat a \" healthy diet\"\u00a0\u00a0but I would suggest learning about carbs and how they affect your blood sugar (getting a meter and testing periodically to see if you can stay under 140 at two hours after your meal). Your initial A1C was into the diabetic range, and you have lowered that, but this means you need to continue to monitor your blood sugar to make store it stays in range with diet and exercise.",
