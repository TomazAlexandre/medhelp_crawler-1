            "answer": "MS can certainly cause vague neurological symptoms that come and go as can anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0As I have never seen your MRI, I cannot accurately comment on as to whether or not this supports or refutes the diagnosis of MS.\u00a0\u00a0However, if they're nonspecific and just scattered throughout the white matter, they may just be incidnetal findings that represent migraine changes, incidental findigns or chagnes related to stroke risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A positive ANA also doesn't necessarily mean anything unless there's a significant elevation in the titer or absolute value by other testing methods.\u00a0\u00a0The second opinion should be helpful - make sure you bring your films. In the meantime, if you do have significant anxiety, consider medications or counseling to see if this reduces your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
