            "answer": "Hello,Tingling sensation of the penis can be due to anxiety,contact dermatitis,traumatic damage to the nerves of penis, diabetes, prostatitis,genital herpes,urethritis and STD\u2019s like Gonorrhea and Syphilis but they are less likely in your case.I would suggest you to keep the area clean and wear cotton underwears.Also apply a mild steroid cream on the penis. If the symptoms persist then the above said conditions have to be ruled out. Please consult a urologist in that case.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am 24, and In July I had orchiopexy surgery.For the past month I have been having this tingling sensation on the tip of penis. It literately feels like someone is taking a feather to the tip or penis and every once and while burns. But I can no longer sleep. It is a feeling I have all the time. I constantly feel like I need to pee, and has been getting worse.I have looked it up online, and have gotten answers that it is infection, nerve damage, or just in my head.My father thinks it has been because I have been under a lot of stress; which I have had. But I cannot imagine how I could put myself through this. I know that the brain is powerful, but this is becoming to much to handle and I just feel like it's gotta be something.By the way, it cannot be an STD because I have not had sex in over 6 months.",
