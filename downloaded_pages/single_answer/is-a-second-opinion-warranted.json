So, it is entirely possible to have an inconclusive biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0A lumpectomy would remove the entire area of concern and provide a definitive answer as to what the mass is.\u00a0\u00a0It is impossible without evaluating every aspect of her health as well as the lump to advise. If there is concern, a second opinion may make good sense.",

    "question": "I have an 88 yo aunt who had the nipple in her right breast disappear.\u00a0\u00a0The PCP found a mass and she was sent for a mammogram, ultrasound and needle biopsy. The biopsy was inconclusive. How can that be?\u00a0\u00a0They are suggesting she have a lumpectomy. She has several health problems, diabetes, past heart attack where they wanted to insert a stent but she declined, and children who neglect her.Shouldnt she get a second opinion before she allows them to do surgery?\u00a0\u00a0If not, is there a way they can monitor the lump within the next year? She said Medicare will only pay for one mammogram a year.Thank you for your assistance.",
