            "answer": "Saw the internist yesterday about the above problem and he is also mystified, though he did mention that it could be related to a hormone. (?) I asked if it was menapausal related and he replied that \" no this wouldn't be that kind of hormone.I am going back for some more specific tests Monday and will wait a few days for results ( of course..grrrrr) and in the meantime he's setting up an appointment ASAP with a gastroentologist.I really loved this doctor, though, and now consider him my new family doctor. He was like the perfect ideal for a doctor you would want to talk to and trust. So that at least is a great development. I hated my other doc...he was condescending and dismissive.So what about the gastro-hormone? What is that about?",

    "question": "Last year I ruptured L4 and L5. Epidurals,Soma, and excersize have improved things greatly. In April I received my most recent epidural ( successful) About that same time I began experiencing neuropathy in my feet at night ( diabetes has been ruled out) and complications and reactions to solid food has been getting progressively worse.At this time,now I am unable to eat any solid food at all without a \"reaction\" as follows: At first sleepiness and sore eyes followed by extreme fatigue and weakness ( went down like a bag of rags once) Then after I lie down ( of course) the aches and pains begin starting with my rupured discs and then progressing to sciatica and neuropathy. Along with all this comes a general \"ill\" feeling ( but not nausia or vomiting) which can be intolerable if a reaction is severe and accompanying that is a marked irritability ( more than just because of feeling ill) blurry vision and ringing in the ears.Now, obviously, I am no longer eating any solid food at all. Even a tablespoonful can cause a slight reaction. I tried clear broth and still get a slight reaction, but it must be done. Skim milk is my best bet right now.I have seen my family doc about this and all tests were good. After one particularly bad reaction to one egg, I saw another doc in the emergency room. More additional tests were good so he referred me to an internist/diagnostician with an appointment set for this afternoon, presumably with more testing.Maybe I should consult my spine specialist about this instead? While everyone is testing and being mystified, I'm starving here!! Nerve compression? Enzyme deficiency? Food intolerance? I need at least some clues!",
