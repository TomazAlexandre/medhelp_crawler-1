            "answer": "Hi!Episodes of blackouts could\u00a0\u00a0be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position) since your friend gets them on standing from a sitting or lying down position. The blood pressure falls when she stands. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain epilepsies too behave this way with temporary blackouts. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Get her blood pressure checked in different positions\u2014sitting, lying down, standing. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required for diagnosis. To begin with make a conscious effort to drink fluids (not plain water but juice, lemonade, soups, herbal tea, etc), and eat at regular intervals. Normally this helps. If it does not, then you need to consult a doctor and get all the above causes ruled out. Take care!",
