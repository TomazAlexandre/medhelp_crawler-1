    "question": "over the past 2 months i have noticed several changes in my body...after a night of pretty heavy binge drinking and smoking(cigarettes and marijuana) i started to feel fatigued and nauseous. i thought it was just a hangover, but i felt this way for about a week and then i began to worry about my health. during this time i began having panic attacks and a severe headache that lasted for 2 weeks straight and i lost about 15 lbs(end of june til present). i had lost 15 lbs over between february and june unintentionally, but i was a very heavy smoker and ive always had problems with diarrhea... i went to a neurologist for the headache and was put on prednisone which helped out alot...i had an mri of my head which was normal...but i continued to think that there was something wrong with me...a fews weeks later i began to feel ill an went to the doctor where they did blood work and urinalysis and i had a mild kidney infection and a very slightly elevated bilirubin level...all other tests were normal...i took cipro for the infection...went back a week later all tests were normal...i continued to have anxiety/appetite loss and continued to lose more weight...about 3 weeks ago i learned to control my anxiety about my health and started to eat like i used to...i was beginning to feel normal again until i began having muscle twitches in my thighs and buttocks, mild chest pain that comes and goes, feeling of numbness in ankles and feet, foamy urine(urinalysis was normal/hadnt been drinking any water)...this morning i awoke to pretty swollen left foot and a slighty swollen right foot...i hadnt been eating healthy thought and the night before i ate lots of sugary food....i dont know whats going on, im only 19, i stopped smoking and drinking on july 6th and things have gotten a little better but im still kind of concerned...my mom from complications with systemic lupus 6 years ago and i had screening done which came back normal, ive been tested for diabetes, hiv, hepatitis, etc i pray daily that im completely healthy and this is just a phase...i have an appt for complete physical friday i pray that my results are normal...im tired of feeling like this...i need closure",
