            "answer": "Have you had a gastric emptying study done?\u00a0\u00a0I assume that your doc feels it's unnecessary because he already found evidence of slow empyting in the undigested food left in your stomach - maybe that's why he didn't order the emptying study.\u00a0\u00a0Reglan is supposed to help speed peristalsis, which is the muscular action of your entire digestive system that moves food through your stomach and intestines.\u00a0\u00a0It makes sense to follow a low residue diet as well.Because your symptoms appear to not be responding to the treatment, I think it would be worthwhile to go back to your GI doctor and pursue further testing.\u00a0\u00a0We already know you're a \"slow emptier\", the the questions remain:\u00a0\u00a0Why did your function change, and why did it change so quickly?\u00a0\u00a0It wouldn't hurt to try different nausea medications as well until you get the underlying problem diagnosed.I have nausea and vomiting every day of my life because of adhesions (scar tissue) wrapped around my intestines that slow transit time tremendously.\u00a0\u00a0If the food can't go through, it comes back up.\u00a0\u00a0Phenergan has worked very well for me for several years, and I take it daily.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, I don't eat anything close to what would be considered a normal diet, being mostly liquids, but I'm surviving.\u00a0\u00a0Nausea is every bit as bad as pain for wrecking a person's life, and sometimes you have to get creative to deal with it.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, I would rather drink smoothies and take vitamins the rest of my life than eat a regular meal only to have to see it again.\u00a0\u00a0:-)",

    "question": "Hi-I am a 35 year old female-no stomach surgeries, diabetes or other known issues. I got very ill prior to x-mas 2007-severe abdominal pain, watery diarrhea for about 24 hours and nausea. While the diarrhea has stopped, the abdominal pain (right below be breast bone) and the nausea has continued...and it the nausea that has affected my quality of life. I went to GI who performed an Upper Endoscopy and he found undigested food, even though I had not eaten in over 13 hours. He saw no other abnormalities. I have changed my diet to low fat/fiber foods and am eating 6 small meals a day as he prescribed. I am also taking the generic version of Reglan and Aciphex-I have seen no relief from the nausea. Seems like these symptoms are common-anyone have any luck curing their nausea?",
