            "answer": "I'm sorry you are going through this miserable problem. My understanding is that frequent yeast infections are a result of out of control blood sugar. So my suggestion to you would be to work on getting that under control which will benefit you in many ways besides the decrease of these infections. Are you seen by an endo? Are you on a basal/bolus regimen of insulin? Do you use an Insulin:Carb ratio to determine your mealtime doses? Have you lowered your carb intake? All these things are the standard of care for insulin dependent diabetes and will help get your blood sugar under control. Just out of curiosity, are you sure you're actually Type 2? You say you were diagnose din 2/08, but not how long you've been on insulin. That is very quick to be insulin dependent and makes me wonder if you are in fact LADA/1.5 (slow onset Type 1). Many LADAs are misdiagnosed Type 2 because they can do ok for awhile on oral meds. Regardless, getting your blood sugar under control is the key to reducing your yeast infections. You might also try reading Using Insulin by John Walsh which will help you with insulin use to get good blood sugar control. Good luck to you.Zoe",

    "question": "Hello. I have Type 2 Diabetes (est. 2/2008), Sleep Apnea and High Blood Pressure. I used to get yeast infections maybe once a year, however I started a new job this past August ('09) where I'm extremely active with children and usually am in very hot environments causing me to sweat like I'm forever stuck in a sauna.I used to get home from work where I was literally drenched in sweat from my underwear/bra to my hair. Then the yeast infections started. I sought help from my gynocologist. I was treated with the suppositories, the cream, the oral prescriptions and the infections kept coming back.It is now the end of March 2010 and I have not had one day of relief of the severe burning, itching and major discomfort from my reoccuring yeast infection. I have bought so many over the counter tubes of vaginal cream it isn't even funny. And now I find myself itching \"down there\" because nothing is stopping this madness.Yes I have Diabetes. Yes I'm on insulin and oral meds. Yes (right now) my glucose is out of control. Yes I wipe properly. Yes I no longer soak in sudsy bubble baths or wear fragrant mini pads. Yes I've tried eating yogurt up the wazoo and wearing cotton underwear and loose fitting pants. Yes I'm watching what I'm eating. And yes I'm going crazy because this is affecting my work life, my home life, my social life and my life in general.All I do every single day and night is stress because my private area is on fire ~ literally. And I can not stop the need to itch like mad.Please help me!",
