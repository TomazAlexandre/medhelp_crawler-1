            "answer": "Wow, well a trip to your GP would be a good start and then from there he/she will refer him on to the appropriate expert.\u00a0\u00a0Or if you want treatment asap go to your local ER and they will be able to do x-rays, blood tests, CT Scans etc there and then and u'll get a quicker diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0They will be able to deal with his circulatory problem more effectivily.The one thing you didn't mention is how long this has been going on cause if it's acute (it's happened very quickly) then it needs urgent medical attention and a trip striahgt to ER if it's chronic (happened over weeks or months) then the choice would be yours as to whether you go GP or ER but it needs medical attention.One question though has he had any tests done in the recent months?\u00a0\u00a0My thoughts are it could be due to Diabetes or an injury that hasn't been treated.....something along those lines, so the cause is vast and wide....",
