Switzer on March 05, 1998 at 02:07:38::I have a family member who may have a genetic predisposition to very lowlipid levels (HDL and LDL). There is little written on the subject, and many of our local physicians are inexperienced with such matters.Can you shed any light on the possible dangers, concerns, causes (if not genetic), and treatments for low plasma lipid levels?Thank you.________Dear D. Switzer, thank you for your question.\u00a0\u00a0Low lipid levels are an area that iscertainly not as well studied as high lipid levels but I will try to shed some lighton the subject for you.\u00a0\u00a0LDL cholesterol is the most important of the lipid subfractionsand we have good, firm data that an LDL < 100 is the goal for anyone with known coronaryartery disease (atherosclerosis) or anyone with multiple risk factors for coronary diseasewhich include hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and a family history of premature coronarydisease (before age 55).\u00a0\u00a0If the LDL and HDL are low, there is little risk of problems sincethe LDL is what drives prognosis the most.\u00a0\u00a0High HDL levels are protective against coronarydisease but that is not as important when the LDL is low.\u00a0\u00a0Women before menopause havehigher HDL levels which protect them against coronary disease.\u00a0\u00a0There are numerous geneticpredispositions to high LDL levels but I'm unaware of a genetic predisposition to low lipidlevels.\u00a0\u00a0There is a syndrome, however, where the HDL is low, the triglyceride is high,hypertension is present, and diabetes is present.\u00a0\u00a0In this syndrome, high triglyceridelevels predispose patients to coronary disease.\u00a0\u00a0The causes of the syndromes are diverseand are related to how the liver handles cholesterol at the cellular level.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, Isuggest that your family member have a complete lipid profile, a blood test for diabetes,and serial blood pressure checks for hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0Once those tests are done, the prognosiwill be better defined.Information provided in the heart forum is for general purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Specific diagnosesand therapies can only be provided by your physician.",
