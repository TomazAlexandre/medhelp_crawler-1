    "question": "I have tried so many ways to chart when I'm ovulating and nothing has been accurate. In the past due to poorly controlled diabetes I had stopped ovulating, but since then I got my butt in gear and have had much better control and even have fairly regular periods.. but still nothing. I'm wondering if I need to go back to my obgyn and see if maybe I'm not ovulating still?",
