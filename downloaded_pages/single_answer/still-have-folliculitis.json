            "answer": "Folliculitis is common, unexplainable, and far too unimportant to merit even a fraction of the effort you and your doctors have put into your case.\u00a0\u00a0There is no explanation for it, as indeed there is little or no explanation for many common phenomena, medical or otherwise.In my experience (and this is something I see every week), the condition just peters out on its own in its own good time.You simply have to learn to ignore it.\u00a0\u00a0I advise you to get whatever help you need to do so.Best.Dr. Rockoff",

    "question": "Dr.,I posted a while back about this case of folliculitis I've been diagnosed with.\u00a0\u00a0I still have it and am now more upset than scared by this whole thing.\u00a0\u00a0I keep getting them on the \"hairless\" side of my forearms.\u00a0\u00a0They start off pink, and gradually (over the period of about a week) turn red, and some eventually scab over.\u00a0\u00a0They resemble bug bites but do not itch.\u00a0\u00a0Like I said before, this has been going on for one year plus.\u00a0\u00a0It is simply impossible for me to take my mind off of it.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried, believe me.\u00a0\u00a0My family doctor put me on Paxil because he though it would ease my mind.\u00a0\u00a0But, \"happy drug\" or no \"happy drug\" it's very difficult to stop thinking about something that no doctor (dermatologist or not) can explain.\u00a0\u00a0They don't go away with antibiotics and only disappear superficially with topical ointments or creams.\u00a0\u00a0Every time one goes away, another pops up.My family doctor doesn't think I need a diabetes test because I do not show any other symptoms of the disease.\u00a0\u00a0And like I said before, I've been tested for HIV and it came up negative.\u00a0\u00a0I know that it's difficult for you to help without seeing it first hand but I've done everything within my own ability to put this out of my mind and pray that it runs it's course.\u00a0\u00a0My dermatologist and family doctor have done (what I believe) all they can do.\u00a0\u00a0 Here is a list of ALL the medications I have been on:\u00a0\u00a0Accutane, Omnicef, Tetracycline, Diflucan, Minocycline, Emyacin, Cephalexin, Cipro, Ryfampin (cool drug that turned all my fluids orange!), and topical ointments Diprolene and Benzac.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if there's a medication I have not taken that you would recommend.I have quit playing tennis in the past 6 months and in result have seen a decrease in the lesions but they still pop up.\u00a0\u00a0There has to be some sort of explanation if no cure is obtainable.\u00a0\u00a0I have come to the realization that doctors don't know everything (much to my chagrin).\u00a0\u00a0However, I refuse to believe that this is so unique of a case that it cannot be explained.\u00a0\u00a0Should I get another biopsy?\u00a0\u00a0The first one revealed nothing.\u00a0\u00a0At least, no organism.\u00a0\u00a0Any and all help is appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
