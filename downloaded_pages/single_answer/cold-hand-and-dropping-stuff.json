            "answer": "Hello.The symptoms do appear to be neuropathy related. The cause has to be found out. Diabetes is a common cause of peripheral neuropathy. Have you checked your blood sugar recently?What is more concerning is the dropping of things from hands. It is due to weakness? Or is it because you do not feel the object in the hand?One quick look at a possible carpal tunnel syndrome is also necessary. But two years is a long time period to have ongoing CTS.Regards",

    "question": "The last two years my hands have gotten colder and colder, when it's really not that cold out.\u00a0\u00a0I envision wearing tank tops and gloves soon.\u00a0\u00a0I thought it may be Reynauds, but my doctor thinks it's a neuropathy, because I have no discoloration or ulceration.\u00a0\u00a0I now cannot keep anything in my hands either, always dropping especially slippery things like anything made with plastic.\u00a0\u00a0I have worked at a keyboard for 18 years so think that's a factor.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also going through menopause.So any good ideas to start with?",
