            "answer": "Hello, Ken,I'll give you a \"starter answer\" and then I'm going to check in with some others at JDRF who may know the specific stats.I do know that there are genetic blood tests that can be done for members of your family and also your wife's family to give you an estimate of risk that's tailored to the two families' specifics.In the interim, I'd like to refer you to a research article on the JDRF website that reports some of the findings in this field of research.Visit www.jdrf.org (or click onthe link to JDRF in this forum).\u00a0\u00a0Then select RESEARCH from the top banner.\u00a0\u00a0There is an report in the research area entitled,\"Genetic Collaboration Reaches Milestone\" from 2001 that describes some of the genetic contributors to juvenile diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you browse that site, you will likely find other reports on ongoing research initiatives, too.I will post again in a few days once I've been able to tap into those more informed about that type of research.I have Type 1 (33 years); my older sister has it also (~45 years).\u00a0\u00a0One of her 2 daughters developed it.\u00a0\u00a0At the time they were doing their family planning (over 20 years ago), much less was known about the genetic factors contributing to Type 1.I hope this info is somewhat helpful.",
