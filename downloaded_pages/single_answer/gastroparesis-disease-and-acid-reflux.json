I started having stomach problems three years ago. I was taking lexapro for P.M.S symptoms when I started having bloating, pain, bleaching, gas, spasms in my stomach, and feeling full after eating a few bites of food. A ultra sounds showed that I had gallstones. I had my gallbladder removed and still had the same symptoms except the stomach pain has left. I have now been diagnose with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and gastroparesis\u00a0\u00a0Disease. I have had hypothyroid\u00a0\u00a0since I was 26 years old.Since May I've had severe acid reflux because of the delay emptying of my stomach. It's was so bad that I had acid in my lungs and was on a inhaler. I raised the head of my bed 9 inches higher, that helped with my lungs. For four months now I've been taking nexium twice a day. I've also changed my eating habits, small meal's, cut out fats and all the other foods and drinks that cause acid.\u00a0\u00a0Changing my eating habits and not being able to eat much I keep losing weight I'm down to 111 pounds. I don't have diabetes I know they say that one of things to check for with gastroparesis.My G I doctor prescribed\u00a0\u00a0Reglan for my stomach but I couldn't take it so he has now three years later he put me on Erythromycin, I've been on it for two months.. My acid reflux hasn't improve will it ever? PLEASE HELP! Are there any help for my gastroparesis?JamieBlue Ridge, GA.",
