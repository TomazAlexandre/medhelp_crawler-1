            "answer": "Welcome:I am so sorry to hear about your miscarriage. I have also had that problem. If there was 1 thing I wish someone had told me while preg, and trying to get preg. It was to take D3.There is lots of\u00a0\u00a0free info on the importance of D3 while preg. at the vitamin d council web-site at www.vitamindcouncil.orgD3 is cheap and easy to find at Costco, Walmart etc. Next time you have blood work ask the doc to add a D3 test. The optimal level is between 50 and 70 ml. Dr. Christine Northrup and Dr. Oz both recommend 5,000 IU a day. I don't know a preg. dose. It would depend on where your levels are at now. Sorry I also don't know about the kelp.Are you taking thyroid now?Watch out for gestational diabetes, since you are low thyroid. Your B12 could also be low. A complete vitamin panel would be a good thing to have too. I always ask the doc for a copy\u00a0\u00a0of my blood work and any other info that I feel is important. You can refer back to it, and even copy it for other docs if you go see a specialist like an Endo.Congratulations and good luck on the new pregnancy,Elbamom",
