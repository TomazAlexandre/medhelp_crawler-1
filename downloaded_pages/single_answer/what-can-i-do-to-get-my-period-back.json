            "answer": "Hi!If you have a weight and period problem, there are some conditions which need to be seriously considered. These are hypothyroidism or low thyroid function, Cushing's disease or adrenal gland malfunction, diabetes, and polycystic ovaries. First consult your doctor and get yourself examined, and undergo the requisite lab tests. Then you may need to consult a gynecologist and an endocrine specialist. Discuss with your primary care doctor. Take care!",
