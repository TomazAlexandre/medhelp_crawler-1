            "answer": "Hello,The most common causes of fatty liver are alcoholism, toxins, certain drugs, hereditary metabolic disorders, and metabolic abnormalities, such as excess body weight, insulin resistance, and high triglyceride levels in the blood. These conditions cause fat to accumulate in liver cells either by causing the body to synthesize more fat or by metabolizing and excreting fat more slowly. As a result, fat accumulates and is then stored inside liver cells. Lose weight. If you're overweight or obese, reduce the number of calories you eat each day and increase your physical activity in order to lose weight. Control your diabetes if you have. Lower your cholesterol. Avoid all medications, alcohol and over-the-counter drugs which put extra stress on your liver. Keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",
