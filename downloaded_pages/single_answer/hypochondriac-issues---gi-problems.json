            "answer": "I had health anxiety and I still have it but I found out that my thyroid levels were low of normal so ,that's what could be what' was causing all these pains throughout my body, I was also really low on vitamin d which could explain all the muscle and bone pain i had and fuzzy light headed feeling but trust there's times I feel like I have diabetes which I saw if ur low on vitamin d it can cause you to get diabetes :/ But on my physical I had 2 months ago my glucose level was at 88 which is normal and I thought I had heart problems which I'm scared I do because my heart has been beating really fast especially after eating to the point I get light headed and sleepy. I thought I had hiv which I still feel like I might have it because all of these problems just came out of nowhere. I had unprotected sex couple months back but I got tested at 3 months and it came out negative but I'm still going to go again. I also thought I had cancer in the bone marrow which I still feel like I do as well because I've had 2 MRI's done on my leg and ima going to find out soon what's wrong with my leg. I thought I was anemia\u00a0\u00a0but I'm not my b12 levels are fine. I also saw if ur low on vitamin d it can cause cancer so your not alone there people like you out there that worry about there health everyday I'm 21 and I'm constantly worrying about my health :/",

    "question": "I have been obsessed with my health since I was a young girl when I went through an anxiety provoking situation in the 1st grade, and since then I have been self diagnosing myself with every possible disease and illness out there. But lately, I have been getting GI issues such as diarrhea and stomach cramps that lead to panic attacks and shaking and overheating and nausea, all that fun stuff. So the other night I had what appears to be an \"IBS\" attack of diarrhea and felt like I was going to die, so the next day I got blood work of my CBCs, thyroid, etc. which all came back normal, but I'm still waiting on the celiac test. Anyways, so after that attack, my abdomen has been pretty sore and tender to the touch (some rebound pain too), and walking can be uncomfortable\u00a0\u00a0as it irritates the pain in my abdomen. I had an ultrasound which showed no issues with my gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, liver, etc. but this pain is ominous and anxiety provoking even though a gastrointestinal doctor checked me out and thinks it's just IBS. I am worried it's something worse though, like peritonitis or something horrible. If someone could offer some of their own experiences and advice, that would be most helpful as I am just a college student right now away from home feeling anxious about my well being.",
