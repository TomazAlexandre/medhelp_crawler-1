            "answer": "Hi,How are you?I can understand your worry and concern, but please relax. The white matter changes seen on MRI can be due to stroke, chronic headache, old age, high BP, diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s, chronic alcoholism, Multiple sclerosis, and migraine.As of now it seems that the white matter changes in your case can be due to migraine, if other causes like alcoholism, diabetes and high BP can be excluded.Usually follow up is done after 6 months to rule out Alzheimers and MS.Membrane thickening of the left maxillary sinus does indicate a sinus infection or an allergy and since your headaches are also on the left side, this may be the cause of your headaches. Please consult your PCP about it as you may need medications to clear the infection.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, I have a history of people suffering from migraines in my family.\u00a0\u00a0As a teenager, I also suffered from them and was on a preventitive medication through high school.\u00a0\u00a0When I went off to college, I seemed to only suffer an occassional headache but now that I am 33, it seems that they have returned.\u00a0\u00a0I have been treated for the past 10 months for migraines, and on Topomax and it doesn't seem to help a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a CT scan and my doctor said it came back fine, just recently had an MRI of the brain, with and without contrast and that is what has concerned me.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said it showed vascular scarring and I need a follow up in 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0No big deal.\u00a0\u00a0But when I requested a copy of the report and read it at home, nothing was mentioned about vascular scarring?\u00a0\u00a0My daily headache/pain is always limited to the left side of my head.\u00a0\u00a0The pain I experience does not seem to follow any triggers, weather, foods... nothing.\u00a0\u00a0And rarely pain killers that I take will help ease it so I can cope.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned it is more than migraines because the MRI speaks to the\"nonenhancing increased T2-weighted signal in the white matter laterally adjacent to the atrium of the left lateral ventricle\".\u00a0\u00a0I have seen the pictures and the white matter.\u00a0\u00a0What is this and why didn't my doctor speak to this when going over the report with me?\u00a0\u00a0Another finding in the report was \"minimal membrane thickening of the left maxillary sinus\".\u00a0\u00a0Is this the start of a sinus infection, should I see my PCP for treatment?\u00a0\u00a0I am just concerned that I wasn't given clarity form my doctor on what the findings were in my MRI, should I get a 2nd opinion?\u00a0\u00a0Nowhere did it say anything about scarring?\u00a0\u00a0It also references the T2-weighted matter as a nonspecific finding.\u00a0\u00a0What does that mean?\u00a0\u00a0It goes on to say \"A more aggressive lesion is considered less likely.\"\u00a0\u00a0Is the white matter a lesion?\u00a0\u00a0There are no measurements of this matter.\u00a0\u00a0Just worried....and need answers?",
