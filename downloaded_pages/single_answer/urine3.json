            "answer": "Hello,Protein in urine is due to diabetic nephropathy (damage to the kidneys because of diabetes) or due to a compromised kidney function. Firstly, the cause of the proteinuria has to be found out. The treatment will depend on the same. For that a battery of tests are required like 24 hrs urinary excretion, all the kidney function tests. Mild proteinuria can occur due to a number of conditions and can go away on its own. Please do consult a nephrologist for examination.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
