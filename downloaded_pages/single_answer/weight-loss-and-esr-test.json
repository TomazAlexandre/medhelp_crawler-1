    "question": "Hi,In the past 3 months I have seen huge weight loss close to 20 pounds, I did make diet changes eating less rice etc since I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes in the 3 month period. But I din't expect the weight loss to be dramatic. The doctor did ESR test and it came high at 37\u00a0\u00a0( Iam 33yr old). The doctor want to retest it again in 2 months, should I be concerned with the weight loss and ESR results.\u00a0\u00a0Now my sugar level has come to normal.Thanks,AR",
