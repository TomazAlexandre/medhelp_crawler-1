            "answer": "Hello,Boil is usually due to plugged sweat glands that become infected or by an ingrown hair.Apply warm compresses on the boil and keep the area clean. Drainage of the boil is done only when it becomes soft and forms a head. Take some over the counter pain reliever and consult a doctor for examination and antibiotics prescription. Since there are recurrent boils, get your blood sugar levels estimated as recurrent boils are commonly found in diabetes and in immunocompetent individuals.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided.
