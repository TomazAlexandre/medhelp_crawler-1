            "answer": "Hi!Since you have mild CP and are now finding it difficult to get up in the mornings, I suggest you consult a sleep specialist. Sleep apnea is common in CP, and causes disturbed sleep. If this is the cause, then proper treatment will solve this. The other possibility is depression. For this you need to consult a therapist. Anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism too could cause similar symptoms and hence get these evaluated through blood tests. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
