            "answer": "LV Prominence reflects the increased thickness and/or enlargement of the left ventricular wall.Left ventricular enlargement may be seen with many conditions, in the vast majority of patients it is due to systemic arterial hypertension, advanced aortic valvular disorder (stenosis, narrow valve opening), or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The aortic valve can become calcified restricting blood flow to the system, and systolic pressure gradient across the aortic valve in those with predominant stenosis can/will enlarge left ventricle.While aortic calcification likely signifies that you have some atherosclerosis in your aorta, you should feel reassured to know that aortic calcification is almost uniformly present in all individuals aged beyond their middle years. Atherosclerosis is an inevitable process of aging, and aortic calcification merely reflects this process.Managing cardiovascular risk factors is the most effective way to reduce the severity or worsening of aortic atherosclerosis. Like coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis in the aorta responds favorably to cholesterol reduction, blood pressure and diabetes control, elimination of smoking, exercise and a healthy diet.There's no specific treatment for aortic calcification, but it does require monitoring for further developments of heart disease. It's important to have your cholesterol checked, because you may need medications to lower cholesterol and help prevent progression of aortic calcification..... If the valve becomes severely narrowed, aortic valve replacement surgery may be necessary.",
