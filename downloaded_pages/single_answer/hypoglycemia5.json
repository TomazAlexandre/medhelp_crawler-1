            "answer": "You may be hypoglycemic and you may have diabetes. Whatever it is, sugar is not the answer. Sugar does give you a quick boost to your blood sugar, but in the long run it will keep your blood sugar jumping up and down and will contribute to whatever problem you have. The key is to heat sufficient carbs on a regular basis to keep your bloodsugar level. However, if you are pre-diabetic or diabetic you need to be seen by a doctor to figure out the correct diagnosis and how to manage it. Passing out, hitting your jaw is not good. Do you drive? That is extremely dangerous for yourself and others. Please do yourself a favor and see a doctor and get a correct diagnosis and treatment.",
