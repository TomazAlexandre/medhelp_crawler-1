            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The blood pH normally remains within 7.35 to 7.45. A higher value (7.49) is mild alkalosis. This is seen in fever, kidney or liver disease, living at high altitudes, and in lung diseases. A high ferritin level with normal iron saturation is seen in conditions like alcoholic or infective liver disease, chronic inflammatory disease such as arthritis or asthma, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes. High iron in blood is seen in hereditary hemochromatosis, hemolytic anemia, liver problems, dietary iron excess, and multiple blood transfusions.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
