            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin without a rash can be due to dry skin, dermatitis and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods .You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch. Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have had itching on my left side (directly over the area of my spleen) for over a year now. I was on accutane 2 years ago and have recently started a 2nd course. However, this began several months after I stopped the accutane. While I was on it, I did develop dermatits on my hands & forearms as a side effect, but this went away with steroid cream tx and the symptoms disappeared when I stopped the medicine, so I don't think it's related to this itching. I had heard that itching could be related to certain conditions such as lymphoma, which has me worried. I have had bloodwork since this began which has been normal. There is no rash of any sort in this area, just an itchy feeling that comes and goes. Any ideas as to what could be causing this?",
