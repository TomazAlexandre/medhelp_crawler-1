            "answer": "It's possible there may be a short circuit between your cells calling for more hormone and your Pituitary sending TSH to your Thyroid. It's a long, complicated path and there may be a couple of things happening.It could also be an Adrenal gland problem.A good Endo (who treats thyroid patients) should be able to narrow down the possible causes and treat you.Some Endo's specialize in Diabetes, so you should make sure you see a Thyroid specialist.",

    "question": "I am 25 and my doctors since I was about 5 years old have wondered about my thyroid (weight has always been a problem and I have a extremely sluggish metabolism).\u00a0\u00a0I have been having a lot of problems within the last year which includes: depression, muscle weakness, joint stiffness, insomnia, lethargy, exhaustion, difficulty concentrating, and massive weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0For example I have gained 10 pounds in the last week.\u00a0\u00a0I was sick for 4 days (vomiting, no diarrhea), and I actually gained 4 pounds when I barely got anything to go down.\u00a0\u00a0My abdomen is ballooning up and my face looks swollen.\u00a0\u00a0My acne has flared up tremendously and my eyes feel sore and dry all the time.\u00a0\u00a0My hair is thinning out yet I am getting dark neck hairs appear.\u00a0\u00a0My eyebrows are fair and thin, but I don't remember a time when they were not.I saw my internist and 6 months ago my TSH was normal (1.5).\u00a0\u00a0Today, she said she wants me to go to an endocrinologist to make sure there isn't something else going on.\u00a0\u00a0I don't see how it could be Thyroid if my TSH was 1.5 just 6 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Previous TSH tests have been around 2-2.5 depending on the year.What is really alarming is the rate of weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0My diet hasn't really changed in the last year, but I have gained 30 pounds in the last 6 weeks, while this past year I gained 125 pounds (the last 6 months contributing to 80 pounds of that).\u00a0\u00a0I am gaining faster now than I did at first and again, my diet and exercise is the same as it was before.I don't really know what an endocrinologist can do if I have normal TSH levels again.Anyone else run into the same problems?\u00a0\u00a0If you have a normal TSH, can you still have thyroid hormone problems?",
