            "answer": "Hello!I would suggest you to rule out Diabetes by going for a fasting blood sugar which might cause tingling.I would suggest you to get yourself examined and rule out peripheral vascular disorders and if required go for a Doppler ultrasound.I would suggest you to get yourself checked by a neurologist to rule out peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve trauma and sciatica.Knee injuries, cerebrovascular accidents and other knee conditions can contribute these symptoms. As you had a recent knee injury this might also be a possibility.Proper diagnosis after examination and after necessary scans can be sought for.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,About 6 weeks ago, I hit my knee on the corner of the bed. My GP said it was tendonitis and bursitis of the quadriceps. After a few day, a scab formed where there was a small cut on the upper edge of the knee cap, but the pain in the local area remained. About a week later, I began feeling tingling sensations below the knee cap and down the outer shin (from the muscles just outside the shin to the outer side of the lower leg). Some the tingling goes down to the anterior part of the ankle. My physio says it's \"odd\" that I should have tingling sensation from bursitis and tendonitis.I would like a second (third?) opinion. Is this tingling \"normal\" or might there be another problem. Is there anything I can do to help the healing process and start jogging again?Thanks for your help in advacne.",
