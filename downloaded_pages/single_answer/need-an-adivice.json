            "answer": "Hi!If you truly have premature ovarian failure, you will need to use donor eggs and In Vitro Fertilization in order to conceive. Premature Ovarian Failure is basically the same thing as menopause except that it occurs at a much younger age.\u00a0\u00a0If you are willing to consider donor eggs, there is no reason why you can't carry a pregnancy.Some things to consider:\u00a0\u00a0An MRI of the pituitary--there are some very rare LH/FSH secreting tumors, if you have this instead of POF your ovaries may be fine.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I'm sure your doctor has tested your thyroid and ruled out diabetes, but if not, better check for problems there too.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, you will probably need to take supplemental hormones and calcium for bone density.Good luck!Dr B",
