            "answer": "This does beg the question of why with such a worrying response to alchohol you are drinking at all?!\u00a0\u00a0If you cannot help but drink, then you have to admit to having an alcholol problem, if not then just stop.\u00a0\u00a0It's the equivalent of banging your head repeatedly against a brick wall and then complaining you have a headache.\u00a0\u00a0This is obviously harming you so the answer is seemingly straightforward.\u00a0\u00a0Yes there could be a connection to your diabetes, achohol is filled with sugar and is a diuretic, and also likely is reacting to your medication.\u00a0\u00a0One other less likely explanation is an extreme wheat allergy, if you are drinking beer, but given your medical history I wouldn't delve into this theory just yet.\u00a0\u00a0Please stop drinking alchohol, this problem is very easy to solve.\u00a0\u00a0If you can't stop drinking, please get help so you can overcome this.\u00a0\u00a0You have diabetes insipidus, you are at constant risk of dehydration.\u00a0\u00a0Your medication is working to counteract this.\u00a0\u00a0Alchohol is a diuretic (makes you pee lots and lose lots of water).\u00a0\u00a0Surely you can see what a bad combination this is.\u00a0\u00a0Take the sacrifice and stick to soft drinks when you go out.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry for the harsh response, just annoys me that you are making yourself sicker than you need to be by your actions.\u00a0\u00a0Be well.",
