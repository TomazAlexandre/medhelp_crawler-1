            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Numbness of hands and feet is a type of sensory neuropathy and can be associated with several conditions. One such condition is diabetes. This would be best checked by a performing an oral glucose tolerance test, not a hgba1c. Did you have gestational diabetes with your pregnancies?It could be possible that the toes and hands are unrelated. Causes of hand numbness can include conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome and is usually numbness of the thumb and first couple of fingers. People with this condition may wake up at night and \u201cshake their hands\u201d. Carpal tunnel syndrome is known to occur during pregnancy and resolve after delivery. The feet numbness at the toes could be from either trauma locally at the feet (e.g., years of wearing shoes) or could be from your back.There are several causes for calf cramps and muscle fatiguing. Muscle cramps are not an uncommon manifestation of a systemic viral illness. Also, metabolic causes such as thyroid problems or low potassium can be the cause of muscle cramping. The latter two can be diagnosed with simple blood tests.I would suggest that you continue to discuss your symptoms with your primary doctor and neurologist. He or she may, depending on the findings, send you for a test called EMG/NCS to evaluate the nerves in your feet/legs and also may do basic lab work (e.g., serum glucose, thyroid panel, vitamin B12, and basic chemistry and oral glucose tolerance test).Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "Hello, I have had three children and have experienced tingling in my hands and feet after giving birth to each of them. Usually, it has subsided in about a year after giving birth. My youngest child is two, and I continue to experience the tingling. It is dominant on my left side. I have seen a general practitioner, chiropractor, and a neurologist. Noone has been able to identify the source of my problem. I have a\u00a0\u00a0virus right now, and my whole body is sore, and I am very tired. The tingling is worse, and I am feeling pain\u00a0\u00a0in my left fingers and toes. Acupuncture and exercise/yoga help. Any insights would be appreciated. Peace.",
