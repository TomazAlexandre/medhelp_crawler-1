            "answer": "Hi!Since you were on acyclovir, you probably have a viral disease and you must not stop the medication until the virus count is considerably negligible and your doctor advises you to do so. All the recent symptoms could be due to withdrawing gabapentin. Please consult your doctor immediately and restart gabapentin. Also after the viral count, you may need to restart acyclovir. Tingling/numbness etc can be due to the virus afflicting the peripheral nerves. It can also be due to peripheral neuropathy (diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s lupus etc) or due to vit B12 and vit D deficiency. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "okay so for about 5 years i have being experiencing tingling numbness burning itching all over my body mostly in my hands, arms, legs, feet. i was only 15 when this started happening so i really couldn't do anything about it so i figured if is wasn't causing me any harm just deal with it. i don't know how it started but i know 5 years ago i had a man to man sexual encounter unprotected. recently i got checked for hiv stds and i was negative for everything. i think this was the cause for my neuropathy. but im unsure. fast forward to a week and 1/2 ago i been expierencing some really weird symptoms i don't know where from. mind you i haven't had sex in 7 mths. And only had sex protected since 2011. My symptoms are heightened under stress i guess but they include neck stiffness, left eye hurting, teeth have moved straighter , i feel like im crying on my right eye but im not, dizziness, the back of my head hurts, my guns hurt, ringing in my ears, left nostril feels like it moved upwards, left stomach pain, knee hurts, isomnia, boweling to the right, food feels weird going down, my stomach makes a weird noise, loss of appiete, lose 5 lbs in a week. I recently have quit gabapentin & acyclovir. Also i rarely ever get any sunlight. But I don't think i have a vitamin d deficiency. Can anyone relate or help me out please?",
