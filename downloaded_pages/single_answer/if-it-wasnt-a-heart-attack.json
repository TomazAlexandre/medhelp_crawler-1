    "question": "I recently was awakened at 3:30 am with a pain in the center of my chest. It became worse and was causing me great discomfort. The pain seemed to correspond to every heartbeat and it felt as if a bomb was being dropped in the center of my chest with the pain radiating through my body but specifically to my back. The pain was so great it would buckle my knees as I was standing. I thought it was a heart attack, but blood enzimes, chest x-rays, echocardiagrams, ekg's, and a stress test all revelaed a normal heart. I was realeased from Wake Forest University Baptist Hospital with no real answers other than it was possible small vessels in my heart may be stopping up or closing. I was given a medicine which has a slow-release form of nitroglycerine. I am not satisfied with this diagnosis. I am a 65-year old male with diabetes, hypertension, and a recent kidney transplant.Any ideas?",
