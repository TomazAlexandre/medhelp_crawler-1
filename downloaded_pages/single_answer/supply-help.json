    "question": "I am a single mom with a 14 year old diabetic son. he is doing awesome in school and keeping his diabetes under control. My problem is, I have health insurance however I have a $3600 deductible and I can just afford his insulin and diabetic labs/office visits. Anyone have any idea or suggestions on how I can get help with his pumping supplies ( Medtronic). I would like to keep him on the pump since his sugars and A1C are so good. Thanks for any help and or suggestions you can give.",
