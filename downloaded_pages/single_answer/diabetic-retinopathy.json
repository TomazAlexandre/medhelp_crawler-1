            "answer": "Yes, yes, and yes! You can most certainly halt the progression of your diabetic retinopathy by getting your blood sugars under tighter control. Most complications can be halted and even reversed by controlled blood sugar. We all hear the horror stories of relatives and friends who had horrible complications. In the past there was little understanding or attention to diabetes, and many people suffered complications because they let their blood sugars stay high for years. Complications are NOT inevitable. There are people who have had both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes for over 50 years without complications!To get your blood sugar under good control: Lower your carb intake. This includes sweets, bread, pasta, cereal, rice and potatoes. If you are overweight lose the extra weight and maintain the loss. Get regular exercise. Monitor your blood sugar regularly. Aim for a fasting under 100 and post prandials (two hours after meals) under 140. (Some people try to keep it under 120). If you test regularly and still can't maintain target blood sugars talk to your doctor (or see an endo) about changing or adding to your medication, or starting insulin if appropirate. If you want a website with a lot more diabetics successfully managing both types of diabetes, send me a PM.Good luck and you can do it!",

    "question": "I'm a little freaked out today. Had my annual eye exam. For the first time in 5 years, there is evidence of early diabetic retinopathy. Just one hemorage showing in each eye. All she really told me is that it is early and to get my glucose under better control. I am only 39 so I'm very concerned about having complications so young. Does everyone go blind eventually with diabetic retinopathy? I've been reading on the internet and it does not sound good. I go back in 6 months and I heard the Dr. tell the staff member to code me as high risk. Five years ago tomorrow I had melanoma removed. My Dr. at MD Anderson told me I needed to be more concerned about controlling my diabetes than the risk of my melanoma metastatizing. I'm understanding now what he meant. My heredity is awful. Dad and 5 siblings all had heart disease beginning in late 30's. Most died in their 40's or 50's, including his mom. I clearly am at high risk of everything. Anyway, my real question is, if I get myself in gear and control my glucose really well, even if that means going on insulin, is there a chance I might not go blind. I think I'd rather be dead than blind (which in my family could very easily happen). Is it possible to keep from going blind now that I have diabetic retinopathy? Thanks.",
