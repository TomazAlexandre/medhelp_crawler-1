    "question": "My 85 year old father was just told he has a retinal bleed.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor told him everything else looked ok but he was concerned about the bleed.He asked him if he had diabetes and he has not had a history of that at all.\u00a0\u00a0He has had heart problems for many years and 3 years ago had a septuple bypass.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor told him to see his regular doctor and have him run some blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter-in-law works for a different eye doctor and she said they do lots of tests and take extra pictures of retinal bleeds.\u00a0\u00a0My question is should he have more tests from the eye doctor and what might cause this retinal bleed.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
