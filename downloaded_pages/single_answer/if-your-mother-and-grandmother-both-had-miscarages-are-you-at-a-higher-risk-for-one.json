            "answer": "I'm not sure if there's proven medical research that shows a correlation between your maternal relations having miscarriages and your chances of having a miscarriage increasing.\u00a0\u00a0I had trouble getting pregnant naturally and my mom and grandmother didn't have problems having 3 children each.\u00a0\u00a0My mom had my youngest sister when she was 39!\u00a0\u00a0My sister is extremely fertile with three kids, two of them are twins!\u00a0\u00a0I had IVF done and now I'm over 7 months pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0The risks I do have are gestational diabetes (I have a family history of diabetes) and my age (I'm 37).\u00a0\u00a0I've read that IVF provides the best chances of the healthiest eggs growing to healthy embryos so your IVF treatment may actually increase your chances of having a successful pregnancy (or at least offset the risks you think you may because of your mother's and grandmother's experience).\u00a0\u00a0Plus, before the IVF, your doctor already did many tests to see if your uterus is healthy and if you produce the minimum amount of progesterone and other hormones, right?\u00a0\u00a0And if not, you'll be on hormonal supplements until at least after the 1st trimester ends.I had such a huge fear of losing my pregnancy so I know how you feel.\u00a0\u00a0My advice is:\u00a0\u00a0eat healthy, RELAX and breathe (oxygen is key!), take your pre-natal vitamins, and don't do anything strenuous like lifting or moving anything over 8 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0I had to still work during my pregnancy but I make myself feel less stressed that I can quit if things get too tough at work.\u00a0\u00a0Knowing I've made a decision to quit when I feel like I need to made me feel a lot better and I'm actually less stressed\u00a0\u00a0atwork (despite all the fires going on around me!).Good luck with the pregnancy!",

    "question": "My husband and I had IVF done and are now pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0We had 2 embryos put in.\u00a0\u00a0We don't know yet if we have 1 or both going and I guess we won't know until May 7th when we go in for our first ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0 My HCG #s were 200.22 and then 2 days later 621.1I'm worried about having a miscarage.\u00a0\u00a0My mother had many miscarages plust 2 live births and my grandmother had a similar experience.\u00a0\u00a0Does their history mean that I carry an increased risk?",
