PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose toleranceI suggest that you see a specialist called a Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility specialist.\u00a0\u00a0They can determine the reason for your irregular periods and help you become pregnant.",
