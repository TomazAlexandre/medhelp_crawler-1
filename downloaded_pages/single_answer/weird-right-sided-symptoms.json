            "answer": "Hi, a disorder called fibromyalgia can produce these symptoms (tenderness). Sometimes repetitive injuries or strain can also produce these symptoms. Inflammation of the muscles, joints and surrounding soft tissues like bursa can also cause pain. Diabetes Mellitus and Hypothyroidism could also cause the symptoms described by you. A simple blood test could help detect diabetes and hypothyroidism. Consult your primary care physician for these tests. Regards.",

    "question": "Hi. I am a 26-year old female and have been having \"weird\" symptoms for the last 2 years or so. All of them tend to be on my right side. The major thing has been a severe peripheral neuropathy in my right foot/leg. Occasionally (at least once per month) I will unexpectedly get a sharp, shooting pain, which starts at the bottom of my foot, sometimes going up to my ankle. It's the worst pain I've ever experienced (10/10) and my foot goes numb afterwards. I saw a doctor, and she said it was probably plantar fasciitis, but it didn't sound right. I had a nerve test at my neurologist and everything came back normal.I was also diagnosed with IBS a few years back. The pain is very specifically in my RUQ and it's fairly consistent. I frequently have heartburn, indigestion, hiccups, etc, and don't normally eat large meals. I've been taking Dexilant as needed, which works quite well, but it's at least 3x a week that I have these symptoms. I also frequently have lower back pain on the right side. Most recently, I've been having not so much pain, but a strange feeling in my right eye. It feels like a constant pressure behind my face; sometimes my cheek hurts, but I feel it CONSTANTLY. It's more annoying than painful, and hasn't affected my vision, but it's a constant annoyance and I can't stop feeling it.I am suspicious that all of these things are on the right side of my body. I also have a baseline low blood pressure (generally 90s/60s, although it has been running closer to 100/70). I get postural hypotension basically whenever I change position. All of my labs, however, have come back normal, including thyroid tests, tests for anemia, B12, etc. I have a suspicion that something else is going on, but I can't quite figure it out... neither can the doctor. I am otherwise healthy... I'm a full-time student, but I don't think it's stress related, I exercise fairly regularly, and have never had any major illnesses. Perhaps they're all unrelated, but I'm wondering if there's anything that ties all of this together.Thanks so much for your help.",
