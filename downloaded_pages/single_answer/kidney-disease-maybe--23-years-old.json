            "answer": "Hi there,A detailed history, clinical examination and work up are necessary for appropriate diagnosis and management of your condition. People with kidney disease can have itching of the skin. The problem can be due to the damaged kidneys\u2019 inability to balance the levels of the minerals calcium and phosphorus in the blood. Damaged kidneys cause phosphorus to build up in the blood, which can also cause itching. You can apply some calamine lotion at the rash as it will help in soothing the skin. You can take some OTC oral antihistamine medications like Benadryl . Your doctor may refer you to a dermatologist. It is also advised to consult a nephrologist and get evaluated. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause. I hope it helps. Take care and kind regards.",

    "question": "I've been having pains in both kidneys for a couple of years but never went to the doctor for it until recently. I also have had a horrible taste in my mouth like on my tongue and no matter how many times a day I brush my teeth, or what products I've tried I can never get rid of it. Its very embarassing for me. My dentist can't figure out why. I have very low energy levels. And my hands and feet are usually always cold. I have one more weird thing that has been going....itchy shins.... I have gone to my dermatologist several times and she can't figure it out. I itch them.until they bleed and can't stop. I just got the results of my ultrasound and they said both kidneys had abnormalities. I am scared and have been reading up and a lot of these symptoms are related to kidney disease. Also diabetes runs in my family... I'm hoping someone can tell me if they've had similar signs and symptoms or any similar experiences and what the treatment/outcome was.",
