            "answer": "I suggest her goes to her MD and get blood-work done, especially thyroid function. She may need an adjustment of medication (to regulate the thyroid); if that is the medication you were referring too. You did not state if she was on medication for her diabetes. If she has hypothyroid disease, it slows down our metabolism and it does become difficult to loss weight. Research has indicated that the combination of thyroid medication, healthy eating and exercise will result in weight loss. Eat low fat meats (chicken, fish, loin of pork) or non meat sources (soy products), low fat vegetarian combinations (rice & beans, pasta & beans, low fat cheese & pasta), fat free or low fat dairy products (skim milk, 1% milk, low fat cheese, low fat yogurts, low fat soy milk/yogurt), and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. Eating daily high fiber breads and cereals (oatmeal). Increase your physical activities to 1/2 hour a day. That 1/2-hour can be broken up through the day, 10 minutes here and 20 minutes there. For example, park your car in the back of the parking lot and walk to the store. That will give you additional walking. Portion control is important and here some general tips = \u00bd cup for all starches and vegetables; one piece of fruit or \u00bd cup of small fruits; 1 cup for low fat dairy products, and only 3oz of low fat meat or protein substitution a meal (only 6ozs total a day). To help eat less food pre meal, eat about 7-10 almonds (good fat and helps lower cholesterol), 20 minutes before lunch and dinner so you will feel full faster and not eat as much food.\u00a0\u00a0Do not be discouraged, weight loss can be a slow process but the slower you loss, the higher chance it will stay off. Think of this new way of eating as your new healthy lifestyle and not as a diet. That will help you to keep your weight off, and keep your body healthy. Thank you for your question.",

    "question": "My sister is 4ft 11in and weighs almost 16 stone. She has a huge stomach and although she managed to carry her second child full term, she now has diabetes and has not lost the baby weight at all. Her metabolism does not function at all and she is on two tablets to kick start it, but I don't believe that they are doing much good. Surely there must be some other methods of helping her to lose weight. she is going to the gym and cutting back on food intake, but we are all very worried about her and in particular internal body fat which we are hearing so much about. she is 39, please offer any advice or treatment she could get. She lives in London.",
