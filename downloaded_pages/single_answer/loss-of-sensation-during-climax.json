            "answer": "Hello.There are several physiological conditions which may be relevant to your lack of sensation.Viagra doesn\u2019t create sexual interest or enhance sensation; it merely increases blood flow to your penis. It can be dangerous when taken in conjunction with blood pressure medications. If you have an organic condition which affects blood flow, then Viagra can, indeed alleviate this concern. However, if you\u2019re conflicted about sex, or uninterested, or some other psychological or emotional concern is preventing you from being turned on, all the pills in the world can\u2019t help that. Something is getting in the way of your enjoyment, and it\u2019s your job to find out what it is.Your first step is to ask your physician whether it's possible that Altace has some sexual side effects. If so, you might want to consider switching to another medication.Your second step is to consult a urologist to determine whether there is a medical cause for your lack of sensation. Possible causes are diabetes, internal scarring which affects the nerves, nerve damage from other conditions and neurological issues. Best of luck to you. Dr. J",

    "question": "Sexual performance is not the issue. The problem is that I have no sensation when ejaculating. I feel the contractions but nothing else. It was sudden, not a gradual loss of sensation during climax. It has been over a year. I do take high blood pressure medication (altace). Will Viagra help?",
