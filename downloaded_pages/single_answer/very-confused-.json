            "answer": "Hi!A negative d-dimer test rules out a clot (high negative predictive value), but a positive test is not specific for clot (poor positive predictive value). Hence d-dimer test alone is not of much value. It needs to clinically correlated, and also correlated with other tests and investigations. An elevated D-dimer test apart from indicating a clot in the body could also be high due to any condition that increases fibrin content in the body such as recent surgery, trauma, infection, liver disease (cause clotting factor abnormalities and raise d-dimer test), pregnancy, eclampsia, heart disease, and some cancers. The complement C rise will have to be studied in detail as this may be associated with kidney diseases, certain autoimmune diseases and with some cancers.In your case, since you have a speckled ANA pattern, it could be due to ITP, scleroderma, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, mixed connective tissue disorder or due to lupus. You need a detailed study of various antibodies associated with these autoimmune diseases. Definitely the possibility of hypothyroidism and diabetes should be looked at.Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
