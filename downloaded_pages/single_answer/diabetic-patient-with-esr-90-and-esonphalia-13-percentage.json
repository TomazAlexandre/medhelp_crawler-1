            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Her diabetes appears to be controlled. She should have a HbA1C test for proper evaluation of diabetes. ESR is elevated and could indicate an inflammatory pathology. Raised eosinophils indicate an allergic reaction. A disorder called fibromyalgia can produce these symptoms (tenderness). Sometimes repetitive injuries or strain can also produce these symptoms. Inflammation of the muscles, joints and surrounding soft tissues like bursa can also cause pain. They are diagnosed by a physical examination. Sometimes blood tests, x rays, bone scan, CT and nerve conduction studies can help clinch the diagnosis. Treatment usually depends on the cause and pain killers are given if the pain is severe. Please consult an orthopedician.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
