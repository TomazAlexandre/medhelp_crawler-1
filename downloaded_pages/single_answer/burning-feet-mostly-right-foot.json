            "answer": "Hi there. I understand your concern over the burning sensation in your feet. After warm shoes and socks, you need to understand peripheral neuropathy where the nerves are damaged like in diabetes. You need to get a medical evaluation of yourself and rule out neuropathy even with AIDS, alcohol abuse, pernicious anemia, vitamin B 12 deficiency, heavy metal poisoning and circulatory disorders. CIDP or chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy is managed with vitamin supplements, and a detailed deficiency evaluation is important assessing B6, thiamine, niacin and B12 levels. Investigate celiac disease, thyroid, kidney and liver function, gout etc cause small fiber neuropathy. You will need to be investigated for tarsal tunnel syndrome, CRPS or complex regional pain syndrome and autoimmune processes. The doctor needs to do nerve conduction velocity testing, xray, blood testing etc for diagnosis confirmation. Exercise is beneficial, keeping feet dry, pain relivers like aspirin, neuromet is mecobalamine or B12analogue, usually given in diabetic, alcoholic or uremic neuropathy. Consult a podiatrist for ideal foot care. Hope this helps. Take care.",

    "question": "Hello,Few months back I had burning feet sensation. I thought it might be due to my shoes, so I changed my shoes and the problem went away, however, I am having the same problem in past 2 months with same problem which had been coming and going by itself. From last 2 weeks the problem is persistant and and is relieved when I sleep. Sleep makes it go away. When I wake up after a while it starts burning sensation and it is more in right feet. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure 7 months back and since then I am using medication which is 5mg CONCOR (Each tablet contains 5 mg or 10 mg bisoprolol fumarate (2:1). Bisoprolol is (\u00b1)-1-[[alpha-(2-isopropoxyethoxy)-p-tolyl]oxy]-3-(isopropylamino)-2-propanol fumarate (2:1).) AND AMPRESS 5mg ( \t[Amlodipine (Besylate). Talked to a doctor he has advised Neuromet 5mcg for 7 days.Wanted to know the possible reasons for that?",
