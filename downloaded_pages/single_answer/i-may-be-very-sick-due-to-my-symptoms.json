    "question": "I wasnt sure where to catagorize my question because there is so much that I have noticed that it could really be anything.I have been extremely tired all the time, there has been stomach pain in the lower area and when I breathe in my lower back area ( where my kidneys are) hurt. I drink plenty of water everyday, and I have to pee way more than I think I should compared to the water I am consuming. I have read the articles on Diabetes and the only person I know that had it was my dads dad. I would like to know more about why I may be feeling this way and having such symptoms that sound so similar to blood pressure, and diabeties,does being Anemic have anything to do with this?thanks aubrey",
