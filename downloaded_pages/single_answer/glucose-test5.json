            "answer": "I did and it was soooo sugary :( basically instead of monitoring you for only one hour they do the same for 3 hours just to see how quickly your body gets rid of sugar. one of my test was elevated (I'm assuming the first one) than the other two were normal. I would google gestational diabetes, there is a lot of good information on it that will explain it better than I could haha.",

    "question": "30 weeks tomorrow and had to take the 3 hour glucose test. The drink was so gross it's making me feel sick. :( I guess my blood test came back high the first time. I'm so hungry I can't wait to get out of here and eat. Baby boy is kicking up a storm in there. Who else had to take the 3 hour test and what does it mean?? What is gestational diabetes or whatever it's called??",
