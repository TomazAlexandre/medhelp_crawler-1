            "answer": "Hi,I am glad you are feeling a bit better about things. Know that you have every right to ask questions during your appointment and receive an answer given with respect.C-peptide is usually used to determine how much insulin you make on your own. Most doctors use it to support a diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes, or to determine if your body can still respond to oral medications if you have Type 2. If your c-peptide is very low, you are unlikely to benefit from oral diabetes medications.\u00a0\u00a0It can be checked without your being on insulin.Good luck in your search for another Endo doctor. I understand you may have to drive a bit of a distance but I think it is worth the effort.Take care.",

    "question": "Doctor, what is the test called that I could get to find out what my Insulin level is, in my body. I asked my Dr. to do a C-pedide but he got mad because I was asking for test. he said if I was on Insulin that is the only time u do that c-peptide test. That was the same day he yelled at me and look so mad at me. I won't ask him for this, I am looking for another Dr. but my luck hasn't been real good. The itty bitty Town I live in has limited Dr. I live years ago about 150 miles away fromhere and worked in St Joseph's hospital on the Surgery floor and surgery room. All we heard out of the college student that the c-d Doctors get sent out here. I am believing that now. I might have to go far to find a better dr. and a endo Dr for sure. Thank u for all your help, it has really helped me calm down.",
