            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Ketones in a person with diabetes are an enormous concern, and I can't imagine them being any less of a concern in a child.\u00a0\u00a0The ketones are what is causing many of the symptoms you are seeing.\u00a0\u00a0Ketones are produced by your body when it's not getting the carbs it needs.\u00a0\u00a0From what I can find, treat the lows you see with him as an immediate fix, and as a long term fix change his diet.Here's a couple links with information:http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/d_0n_020.htmhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketotic_hypoglycemiahttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/ketotic-hypoglycemia/AN00302Everything refers to ensuring that the child doesn't skip meals, as well as eats frequently.\u00a0\u00a0A good, well-balanced diet is essential to handle it.\u00a0\u00a0So yes, get him to eat more, and ensure he gets healthy foods with carbs in them.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "My son has been ill for 2 months.\u00a0\u00a0Waking up with headaches, not eating much at all, stomach aching, feeling cold in his leg bones, and not being able to do much activity without having to lay down.\u00a0\u00a0He lost 3 pounds in two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0He is not overweight. We took him to the doctor and have not gotten many straight answers.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor found that he had ketones in his urine and that his alkaline phosphates were the level that it should be for an adult.\u00a0\u00a0We saw a ped. and he did not seem concerned about the alkaline phosphates.\u00a0\u00a0Which we were told deals with bone turnover.\u00a0\u00a0The ketones in his urine are supposedly because he is in a technical term \"starving\".\u00a0\u00a0His body is eating his fat. I have checked his blood sugar a couple of times when he woke up with a headache, it was 62, 67. (tester is for myself being borderline hypoglycemic)\u00a0\u00a0Hypoglycemia, Migraines, and a nervous condition are the things that were suggested.\u00a0\u00a0What are things that we could or should be doing or looking for? Should we be forcing him to eat when he has a stomach or headache?",
