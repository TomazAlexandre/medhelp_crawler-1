            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. If alcohol is the only cause of neuropathy, then you should start recovering. Get blood tests to rule out diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme\u2019s, lupus and other such conditions which can cause neuropathy.You need to exercise and undergo physiotherapy. Nerve stimulation can be tried. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I am 43 year old female diagnosed with neuropathy about three years ago. While the cause is not certain, it so most likely due to alcohol abuse. I have been clean for a year and trying everything possible to reverse/recover from it. I take neurotin and the butrans patch, have tried acupuncture and vitamins and herbs. I've experienced some relief but am eager to know.....will I ever recover or is this a forever thing? I'm also receiving alcohol injections for a neuroma.",
