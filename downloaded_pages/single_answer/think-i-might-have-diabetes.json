            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.Have you had testing recently? You are correct that all of those are symptoms of diabetes. Some can also be symptoms of other problems. I recommend that you speak to your doctor about your symptoms and discuss a full work up. Blood work and any relevant testing could help reveal what is causing your symptoms. Meanwhile, I recommend that you start to try to make the healthy dietary decisions that you can.Cathy",
