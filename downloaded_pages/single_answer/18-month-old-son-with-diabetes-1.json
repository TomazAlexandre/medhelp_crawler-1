            "answer": "Hi there!While diaper rashes are common in babies and may not necessarily mean an inherent abnormality; the blood sugar values seem to be high. However, hyperglycemia in babies could be due to an acute stress such as infection, vaccination etc and may not specifically indicate a secondary issue, but would certainly indicate an evaluation, especially since you mention a low weight. It would be best to have this evaluated by a primary pediatrician initially and if required a specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I have been very worried about my 18 month old son.\u00a0\u00a0It all started with a diaper rash (almost looks like a blister) that I just can't get to go away.\u00a0\u00a0He has also been really cranky lately, for about 4 weeks which is very unlike him.\u00a0\u00a0I googled diaper rashes that won't go away and type 1 diabetes came up.\u00a0\u00a0My father in law has type 2 so he has a meter laying around all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I checked his level, just randomly and it said 169.\u00a0\u00a0I thought that was high, so I decided to do one first thing in the morning, which came back as 105.\u00a0\u00a0Is this high, is he at risk for type 1 diabetes to just start showing up.\u00a0\u00a0I should also mention he is very under weight for his age, only in the 10%, so I think that rules out any type 2 concerns?\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know,\u00a0\u00a0I have an appt at my doctor for him, but peace of mind today would be great :)",
