            "answer": "Hello,As I have not examined you,so it is difficult confirming a diagnosis,but your normal lab tests and symptopms suggest that this can be a panic attack.A panic attack is a response of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The most common symptoms may include trembling, dyspnea (shortness of breath), heart palpitations, chest pain (or chest tightness), hot flashes, cold flashes, burning sensations (particularly in the facial or neck area), sweating, nausea, dizziness (or slight vertigo), light-headedness, hyperventilation, paresthesias (tingling sensations), sensations of choking or smothering.Causes may be stress,anxiety,hyperthyroidism,hypoglycemia, Wilson's disease, mitral valve prolapse, pheochromocytoma and inner ear disturbances (labyrinthitis). Vitamin B deficiency\u00a0\u00a0can also cause panic attack. Sometimes panic attacks may be a side effect of medications such as Ritalin (methylphenidate).During a panic attack, Breathe slowly through the nose using the diaphragm and abdomen. Do not breathe through the mouth. Talk with a supportive person if you are feeling stressed or anxious.Do not worry about the future and talk to your family if feeling anxious.Pls get yourself evaluated for diabetes ,thyroid disorders and heart valve disorders.Also take vit B supplements for some days.It might help.If the symptoms persist then pls consult a physician.You may need anti anxiety medicines.Severe cases may require Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted in case you have any additional doubts..",

    "question": "It Started in either the end of April or the beginning of May this year when I was going through a deep depression. When I was on my menstrual cycle I started getting sharp shooting pains on the right top side of my head. When the pain would shoot, I would feel a post nasal drip run down my nostril and down my throat. And I noticed that my eyes were getting very sensitive to light. When my cycle stopped, the pain stopped. Shortly after my eyes started itching, burning, and running, I felt a tingling jittery sensation all over my body, them my hands started to shake a little, I was also very tense and stressed out when this happened. Then I had a panic attack I believe, I had shortness of breath and I was very tense and uncomfortable and I had chills. Then I started getting a pressure and tight scalp feeling in my head which later subsided to a just a weird pressure, like something pressing down on the inside of my head. I started to feel lightheaded and felt like I was losing my balance and coordination a little. Then that stopped. I have been to the hospital a couple times, the first visit I was told that it was probably due to stress and depression, The second visit I took some blood tests that came back almost perfectly normal except my protein was a little high which they told me that I probably was a little dehydrated that day. My neurological tests were fine they were sure I didn't have a brain tumor or lyme disease, then the doctor was diagnosing me with anxiety. My parents were telling me that they think it's my sinsuses because of the drip and at first I was thinking the same thing so I started taking sudafed a couple weeks ago and it feels like the pressure and funny feeling is subsiding like it's going away, but I still feel a little unnerved when I get around groups of people and I feel the pressure in my head more. This ruined my whole summer and started a few months before my 21st birthday. Anyone ever experience this sorta thing?",
