            "answer": "Hello richies_girl,I am one of the volunteers here.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep in mind that I am not a medical professional, so my input and advice is based on personal experience in caring for my now 10 year old son who was diagnosed at the age of 3.I am doing my best to find out information about whether albuterol can raise the blood sugar.These are the side effects of albuterol that I have found:SIDE EFFECTS:Dry mouth, irritated throat, dizziness, headache, lightheadedness, heartburn, loss of appetite, altered taste sensation, restlessness, anxiety, nervousness, trembling, and sweating may occur but should subside as your body adjusts to the medication. If these symptoms persist or worsen, inform your doctor.Of course, In addition, it states to inform your doctor if you have__________and it lists several conditions, one of them being diabetes, but, as you probably know, all medications say that.I would do one or both of the following.\u00a0\u00a0(Actually, he should definitely ask his endocrinologist if albuterol is know to elevate blood sugar and, if so, the doctor and your Dad can figure out what to change as far as your Dad's insulin schedule.)\u00a0\u00a0Another person to ask would be your local pharmacist.I am sorry that my answer cannot be straight to the point.\u00a0\u00a0Call the pharmacy and ask to talk to the pharmacist and ask your question.\u00a0\u00a0Also, have your Dad call and leave a message for his endo to call him.I am interested in finding out the answer.Re-post if you can and let us know.Keep in mind that there are other volunteers and visitors of this website who are very knowledgeable when it comes to medications and how diabetes affects the body in general, so, I am sure you will receive comments on your question.Take Care!SS",
