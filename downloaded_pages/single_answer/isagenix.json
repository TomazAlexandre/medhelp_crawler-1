            "answer": "Hi!Well, it is difficult to say whether isagenix will be of help or not. Most such cleansing agents rob the body of essential nutrients.Honestly speaking no diet supplements/pills can actually help you lose weight in a healthy way. Most fail to cause weight loss. Even if they are helpful in losing weight, they make you lose weight by suppressing appetite, causing indigestion, preventing absorption of nutrients, and other such drastic routes. Though you lose weight, the weight loss is not healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if you have PCOD or hypothyroidism or adrenal gland problems or diabetes, then also, you may find losing weight difficult. Hence, if you are not losing weight, you need to find out whether you suffer from any of these. Many supplements have hidden calories. These too make it difficult for you to lose weight. Also, if they are not approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other such governing bodies, then their efficacy and safety will always be doubtful. I suggest you eat frequent small meals and stop counting calories. It is best to eat lots of fruits and non-starchy green veggies, go slow on fats, eat carbohydrates in moderation and increase your protein intake (lean cuts, whites of eggs etc). Drink plenty of water and non fattening fluids such as clear soups etc. Look for hidden calories in salads and soups and avoid them (eg: cheese, butter, dressings etc). Also, you need to exercise regularly. A combination of aerobic, strength training and stretches works best. If you lead a busy life, then walk to work, or to bus stand etc, climb stairs instead of using lifts, walk while talking on cell phone, or briskly walk to any place you are going to. See how you can change your lifestyle to incorporate exercise. Hope this helps.

    "question": "Has anyone used this??? What are your thoughts?? I gained just over 50lbs with my last pregnancy and have lost 30 so far and have 20 more to go. I'm not breastfeeding, and will be going to the gym 2 days a week starting in march for a mom and baby work out. I would like to add something else with it and came across isagenix.
