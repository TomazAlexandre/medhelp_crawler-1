This uses up lots of fluid, and increases the viscosity of the blood and, in turn, this predisposes the body to clots.

You know, of course, about cinamin and Chromium GTF in helping to control the diabetes.Commonly physicians only prescribe insulin, however, depending upon whether the Islets have any insulin producing activity left, you might consider using both insulin and either glyburide or metformin.The sleepiness, as you know is common with high blood sugar levels.I am going to suggest something silly.

I can't say this is true, but I am thowing it into the mulligan stew.I don't know about the Babinski reflex. You have something going on in your brain. An infectious process comes to mind.
