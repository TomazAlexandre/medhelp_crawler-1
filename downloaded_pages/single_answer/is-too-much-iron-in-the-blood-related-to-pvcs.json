    "question": "I was told about ten years ago, after some routine blood tests, that I had more iron in my blood than I should. I was told not to take iron in my vitamin pills. I've been taking vitamins without iron ever since. Just had a blood test last week and again it showed I have too much iron. I don't know how much, but the doctor's office will be sending the results. This doctor again said I'm probably taking too much extra iron. I'm not.I did a google search and found that too much iron in the blood isn't all that uncommon, and that it can cause heart arrhythmias and other coronary problems, , arthritis, diabetes, fatigue, and worst of all liver damage (can sometimes lead to liver cancer if not treated).\u00a0\u00a0Just in the last two year,s I've found out I have one slightly elevated liver enzyme and now I have PVCs (about 8500 a day). I'm going to ask my family doctor more about this and find out if I need treatment of some sort.\u00a0\u00a0Feeling a little concerned here.And I'm wondering whether any of you here have iron overload, and if so, what can be done for it. If your arrhythmia comes from it, does it mean your heart is being damaged? Can one reverse the arrhythmia?\u00a0\u00a0I'll be asking a doctor all these things in a month or so (after the holidays) but I am curious and a little uneasy about this. Thanks for any reassurance you can give me.\u00a0\u00a0I could use some right now.",
