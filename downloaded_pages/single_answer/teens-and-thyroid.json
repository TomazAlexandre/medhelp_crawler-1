            "answer": "I always believe that anxiety, depression, etc has a source. Doctors said the same thing about me, but I refused to believe them. I insisted my doc test my antibodies and I have Hashimoto's.It is a shame the docs didn't test FT3 levels along with TSI antibodies to see if she has Graves causing the symptoms. I would also suggest TGab and TPOab antibodies to see if Hashi could be the cause. Hashis do go hyper in early stages. Strange that your daughter's FT4 is on the low end, which Hashis get, but her TSH is on the low end, common in Graves.Only a good endo can get to the bottom of this and determine if thyroid is the cause. Don't give up. Below is a website listing recommended endos. Make sure the endo treats mainly thyroid, not diabetes. I saw three diabetes docs before finding a good endo.http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/:) Tamra",
