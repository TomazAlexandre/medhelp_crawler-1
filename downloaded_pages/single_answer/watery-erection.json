            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for posting your query.By watery erection, I suppose you mean not so strong erection.Varicoceles may cause pain and decrease in fertility but it is less likely to cause problems in erection. The condition that you are having is called erectile dysfunction.In most of the young men, erectile dysfunction is psychological in nature. If you are having morning erections then the cause is most likely psychologicalIt usually goes away with proper counseling and interactive sessions with the patient. Other causes are diabetes, depression, autonomic nervous system problem, excessive alcohol ingestion or tobacco smoking, heart or thyroid conditions and poor circulation. Testosterone levels if low can cause decreased libido rather than erectile dysfunction.In your case, you need to be properly examined and investigated to pinpoint the diagnosis. As I have mentioned earlier, in young men, mostly it is due to psychological causes. However you need to have your blood sugar levels, testosterone levels, complete blood count, thyroid function tests and cardiac function evaluated.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Wishing you good health.",
