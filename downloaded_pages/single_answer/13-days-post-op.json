            "answer": "Night sweats can be caused by numerous things such as: hypoglycemia, diabetes, female hormone issues, menopause, etc. Have you had all these rulled out?\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever checked your sugar levels during the night when this happens? I would do that just to rule it out. You can have your Dr test your female hormones as well.The acid reflux is a different monster....keep up with your meds and ask for something different if it isn't working. Keep trying. I would also suggest digestive enzymes with your meals. You can find them at any of your local health food stores.The incision and stitch area will take a little time to heal and yes it will take a while to regain all your sensation there. :)Hope you keep healing and feeling better! :)",
