            "answer": "Kudos to you for staying so active!!\u00a0\u00a0Having a pacemaker set to 40 BPM seems unusually low.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a reason the doctor has set the pacemaker at such a low rate?\u00a0\u00a0Or, is it low because of the beta blocker?\u00a0\u00a0I'm guessing your doctor wants optimal rate and BP control so your heart does not have to work too hard.I'm not a doctor, but it doesn't sound like your heart is coming to a grinding halt.\u00a0\u00a0Talk frankly with your doctor during your next visit.\u00a0\u00a0Let him/her know your concerns.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with diabetes 2 in 2004, had a quadruple heart bypass in 2005 , recently developed bradycardia and had a pace maker set at 40 beats per minute. I usually find I have between 40 and 50 per minute. I take 25mg of atenolol daily. When I experimented for three days by taking no atenolol my heart rate went up to over 70 (but my blood pressure went from 130/70 to 150/85). I have no dizziness, breathlessness or other symptoms, and at age 74 lead an active life in politics and gardening.My question really is : is my heart grinding to a halt ?",
