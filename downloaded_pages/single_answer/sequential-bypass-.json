    "question": "I had a quadruple bypass last year.\u00a0\u00a0In the last 2 mos I notice that I have new chest pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Not gastric (I already take Protonix andthat stopped that).\u00a0\u00a0This pressure comes when upset, with stair climbing, walking sometimes and just recently while doing nothing (i.e. sitting in car, sitting at table).\u00a0\u00a0It just comes and goes, sometimes with jaw pain, sometimes without.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the jaw pain only.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it's not there at all during the exercise but when I sit down to rest it comes.\u00a0\u00a0I have had diabetes for 35 years (I am 42).\u00a0\u00a0I take insulin, capoten, lipitor (yet my cholesterol is still 190), zetia, imdur, aspirin (I do forget the aspirin at least 2x a week).\u00a0\u00a0The question is, my bypasses were done sequentially.\u00a0\u00a0The dr said he only cares if they (the new grafts)\u00a0\u00a0stay open and doesn't worry about the arteries I was born witrh (native arteries).\u00a0\u00a0Isn't that a problem?\u00a0\u00a0Don't you want the native arteries to stay open so that in the event a sequential graft fails, the native kicks in?.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have experience with this issue?",
