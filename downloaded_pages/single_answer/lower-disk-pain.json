            "answer": "Hi!It is difficult to say whether you need surgery or not. It all depends on the degree of bulge and other factors such as the cause of bulge, condition of vertebrae, your own diabetes/hypertension/heart disease status etc. You have to discuss the best treatment option with a neurologist, which can range from medication to physiotherapy to traction, lumbar belts, lumbar corsets or even surgery. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
