    "question": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0My grandfather is starting to scare us.\u00a0\u00a0Everytime he sleeps/naps , it's like his body clock resets.\u00a0\u00a0When he wakes up he thinks it's morning, goes for a shower, shaves etc.\u00a0\u00a0as a result he ends up showering 3-4 times a day and asks for breakfast at all times, like 12 am.\u00a0\u00a0he needs to be convinced that it is not morning.\u00a0\u00a0this is affecting his taking of medication for high blood pressure as well as his eating habits (e.g. always would drink milk before sleeping, now refuses to have it, because he doesn't drink in the morning).\u00a0\u00a0He has also begun to eat much more often and developed more of a sweet tooth.\u00a0\u00a0he is 85, with no history of diabetes or any other illness, other than high blood pressure which has come about in the last ten years.\u00a0\u00a0he has always been extremely fit with regular morning excercises and walks for 1 hour, mentally acute (he worked until the age of 75) etc.\u00a0\u00a0Aside from his lapse of understanding of time, he seems normal.\u00a0\u00a0what could this be?",
