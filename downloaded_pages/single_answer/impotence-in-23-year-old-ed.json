    "question": "I'm 23 and I'm having impotence.\u00a0\u00a0I frequently am unable to get an erection.\u00a0\u00a0I am almost 100% sure it's not psychological because I've had a steady girlfriend and I'm plenty confident, etc.\u00a0\u00a0If I am able to get one, it's really weak and if I put on a condom I lose it often.\u00a0\u00a0They used to be very hard just a year ago and now the head isn't nearly as hard and it just feels weaker in general.\u00a0\u00a0If it does get up, it needs to be stimulated pretty quickly or it'll go back down.\u00a0\u00a0Last year I could have one with virtually no stimulation and stay hard for 10+ minutes no problem.I've had my testosterone tested and I'm on the high side of normal.\u00a0\u00a0When flaccid/limp it feels like blood is constantly pushed out and it doesn't stay as 'full' as I'm used to...almost like it's always cold or shriveled.\u00a0\u00a0I had one girlfriend who bent it downward fairly hard and it hurt a few times.\u00a0\u00a0I think I have a family history of prostate cancer but I didn't think that would develop until I was older.I don't smoke, I exercise regularly, no diabetes, great health.\u00a0\u00a0I had taken adderall pretty regularly and had problems but that usually went away in a day.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't taken it in 3+ months now.\u00a0\u00a0I guess it just doesn't feel normal anymore, like something physical is different.\u00a0\u00a0Even masturbating is difficult and porn barely turns me on.",
