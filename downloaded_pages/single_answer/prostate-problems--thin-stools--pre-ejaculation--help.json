            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include excessive fluid intake, GU infections, inflammations, systemic causes such as diabetes, neuro-muscular causes etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an internist and a urologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "Hey, Im a 26 year old male. My issue is with my prostate. I'm slightly overweight with a bad diet. I eat out almost every day. About a year and half ago I went to a urologist because I often have to urinate alot more than usual. Often a couple times before I get up in the morning. If I have a couple beers, i'll have to go to the bathroom probably 3 times in an hour. All times I feel like a urinate completely. Anyways he gave me a prostate exam and said I had prostatis and enlarged prostate. I was given bacterial medication and was told to take saw plametto. My problems seemed to go away for the most part but recently i've had some issues arise.My first problem is still having to go to the bathroom more than i should. I've also noticed in the last few months that i'll dribble on myself after, which i've read is another cause of a enlarged prostate. The next couple issues im not sure if its related. Lately i've had thin stools that always sink. They are flat on both sides and seem shorter and thinner than usual. In the last few months i've also noticed something very weird. Right before ejaculation, a watery almost like urine but not, squirts out just prior to actually cumming. My girlfriend actually pointed it out to me, and since then i've ejaculated and noticed it myself. Seems to be more when i havent masturbated in days.I'm really not sure if those last two issues are involved with my prostate issue. Im affraid to go back to the urologist and have another finger up the butt (worst day of my life haha). Does this all sound like its because of my enlarged prostate? Would simple medication fix this?",
