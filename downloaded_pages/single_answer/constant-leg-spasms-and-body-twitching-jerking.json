            "answer": "Hi Stacy,Muscle twitching, cramps and spasm, usually occur due to neuropathy. To name a few causes, it could be a diabetic neuropathy, uremic neuropathy, secondary to brain/spinal injury and infection.I would suggest you to meet a neurologist. Complete work-up including the blood counts, hemoglobin, electrolytes, CT/MRI Head and spine, EMG, EEG and a sleep study will help to make a diagnosis.",

    "question": "Ever since i was 19 (i am 32 now) I have had problems with my calves twitching uncontrollably.I used to get horrible leg cramps in my sleep to where my calves would literally sink inward.It's not the cramps that worry me anymore. Its the leg spams and twitching.Unlike restless leg syndrome where the problem happens at bed time, my legs twitch/spam 24 hrs a day.You can see it happening.I also notice when i go to bed at night my body jerks alot esp right when i fall asleep.I have even woke myself up QUITE\u00a0\u00a0a few times because of this.My fiancee' tells me how i jerk alot in my sleep and even kick him.It seems to get worse as i get older.I am afraid it's the beginning of something MUCH worse than restless leg syndrome.Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Also i should state that 3 years ago i was diagnosed with type II diabetes and after a recent cat accident was told i have diabetic neuropathy. But would that be why my legs creep and cry and spasm every minute of everyday? Please help.",
