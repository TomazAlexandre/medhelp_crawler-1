            "answer": "I am worried about him, not necessarily about diabetes mellitus but perhaps diabetes insipidus, this is what is called \"water diabetes\". The pituitary makes a hormone called antidiuretic hormone, this helps us hang onto waters in our kidneys during times when we need it. In kids who have lower levels or missing this we will see them drink excessively, preferring cold to hot beverages and water or milk for some reason, they will urinate excessively.So in a child with polydipsia and polyuria and poor growth we need to rule out diabetes mellitus-sugar diabetes, diabetes insipidus-water diabetes, bladder infection or other problems, perhaps as simple as urinating a ton due to polydipsia but no real cause.The poor growth all of a sudden bothers me but with excessive fluids and poor food maybe nutritional, would worry about thyroid, celiac disease or other problemsGo to your doctor soon, call them and get his urine checked and blood tests donekeep us informed",

    "question": "I have adopted a two year old son. He is a little short for his age but he is stalky. When we first got him about 6 months ago he would eat anything and everything you put in front of him. Now he has gotten to where he will hardly eat anything but he drinks constantly. It doesn't matter what you give him to drink he will drink all of it and instantly want more. When he is drinking he drink he doesn't just drink it he downs almost the entire drink before sitting it down. When he finally does put it down it is only because he is out of breath. His diapers are soaked and always smell bad. His poopy diapers are also very fowl. He has not gained any weight since he have had him despite the first five and a half months were he would eat everything he saw. He also will drink anything he can including his bath water. If you tell him to wait on a drink because you are busy at the moment he starts crying uncontrollably. We have been told by friends to have him tested for diabetes but I'm not sure what the signs of diabetes are. If you could help me I would really appreciate it.",
