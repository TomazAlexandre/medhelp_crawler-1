Hence it is important to get a STD panel. It can also be due to bacterial vaginosis. Third possibility is a non specific vaginitis. This happens due to break in the normal flora of the vagina and is usually treated by lactobacillus preparations for the vaginal and oral lactobacillus tablets. Another possibility is vaginal irritation due to latex of condom or due to spermicidal jelly. If you use either of these methods of contraception, then your vagina could be allergic to the material of these. You can try latex free condoms or a different brand of spermicidal jelly. Allergy to semen is also possible and the itch due to this allergy disappears after sex. This is best treated by using condoms or latex free condoms.

Diagnostic tests including culture and microscopic exam of vaginal discharge, pap smear and urine and blood studies (including hormone levels) may be done to help with the diagnosis. . Keep the area dry. Wear cotton panties. Check and see if you can identify any personal care items that could be causing the itch. If yes, stop using them.
