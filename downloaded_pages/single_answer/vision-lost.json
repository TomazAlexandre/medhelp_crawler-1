            "answer": "That is way too broad of a question to possibly answer here, but I'll try. First you need to have your eyes checked by a specialist. Most common causes of sudden one eye vision loss in younger patients is infection, retina detachment or inflammation. For mid age it's the same plus nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy and diabetes. For the older patient its the same plus Age Related Macular Degeneration.Best wishes,Timothy D.
