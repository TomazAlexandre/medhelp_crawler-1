    "question": "I am a 29yo male in avtive duty military, and currrently on my second tour. I have recently had some heart feelings, and went to my TMC to find out what was going on. After a quick look, they had me going to a main hospital over here. I was later diagnosed with \"Severe Palpitations\" and a \"Over Active Heart\". Heart disease and heart problems run on both sides of the family in various issues ranging from decongestive heart failure, heart attacks, diabetes, and just recently found my biological father was diagnosed with \"Arterial Sclerosis\" at a young age. My doctors here are telling me I am fine and that nothing is wrong. Is this something I should bring up to them and have them check for ? What are some of the things they can do to test me for this ? Thank you for any help !!!",
