            "answer": "Hi,Have you had any blood tests done?I suggest you have an oral glucose tolerance test to be sure your glucose metabolism is totally normal, as well as check your thyroid function tests and adrenal function to make sure evrything is okay on those fronts. That amount of weight loss is not expected without exercise and diet changes, so please see your doctor soon for an evaluation. Definitely cut out the coca cola in the meantime.Take care",
