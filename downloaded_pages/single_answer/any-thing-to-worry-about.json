            "answer": "Hi,What are the symptoms present? GGT may be high in liver diseases and may be associated with pancreatic disease, myocardial infarction,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, diabetes, obesity, medication side effect and alcoholism. On the other hand, increased direct bilirubin may suggest liver and gallbladder issues. It is best that you discuss the results with your attending physician for proper evaluation. Factors such as your medical history, symptoms present and results of other diagnostic tests are also important considerations. Take care and do keep us posted.",
