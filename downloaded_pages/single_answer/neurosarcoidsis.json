            "answer": "According to the New England Journal of Medicine:Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid in patients with central nervous system involvement indicates nonspecific lymphocytic inflammation. The diagnostic value of measuring ACE levels in cerebrospinal fluid is controversial, since ACE levels are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis.74 In a third of patients, oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands in the cerebrospinal fluid are elevated, making it difficult to differentiate sarcoidosis from multiple sclerosis.Elevated ACE levels in serum testing , are not enough for a definitive Neurosarcoidosis diagnosis. Only with a brain biopsy (not likely to happen) will be 100% definitive,so, I'm going to assume,\u00a0\u00a0that if have you been diagnosed, your diagnosis is possible or probable Neurosarcoidosis.Higher than normal ACE level may be a sign of sarcoidosis. ACE level rises or falls as sarcoidosis worsens or improves.A higher than normal ACE level may also be seen in several other diseases and disorders, including:Cancer of the lymph tissue (Hodgkin disease)DiabetesLiver swelling and inflammation (hepatitis) due to alcohol useLung disease such as asthma, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or tuberculosisKidney disorder called nephrotic syndromeMultiple sclerosisOveractive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)----Source: National Institutes of HealthI could not find any lab reference values, to compare with your posted ones,as they were outrageously high, making me suspect the measurements of units are perhaps not the same.What were your labs ranges? Please include measurements of units.Take care.Niko",
