            "answer": "Hi,I am not sure what is causing the itching, but one of the most important things your OB needs to check will be liver tests, as liver dysfunction can lead to this problem and is quite serious. Your glucose level is high and certainly needs to be addressed soon.\u00a0\u00a0Testing at 28 weeks is thought to be optimal, but given that insulin resistance worsenes later in pregnancy, your glucoses may have been normal at that time but worsened during the following weeks, especially with the continued weight gain.Until you see your gyn, be sure to stay well hydrated, stay away form concentrated sweets, spread your carbohydrates out through the day.Take care.",

    "question": "Hi,I'm 37 weeks pregnant and have extreme itching. I've had my PUPPS test done and waiting for results. I've been itching for about 2 weeks and it's unbearable. Today I took a blood glucose level test from my mom's machine and I had 197mg/dl. she mentioned that I have diabetes, i informed my GYN immediately and i'm going in to see her. My question is, how come my glucose level is high now, but nothing showed up when i was tested at 28 weeks, and what causes the itching?thanks",
