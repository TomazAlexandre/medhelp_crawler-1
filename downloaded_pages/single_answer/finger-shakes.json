            "answer": "Hi.Does the shaking occur at rest, when using your fingers, or during both?Your symptom is generally non-specific and can be caused by many conditions, including thyroid disorders, diabetes, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies. It can also just be physiologic tremor (normal tremor) that is exacerbated by stress or fatigue.If it is not severe, you could opt to observe your symptoms for the time being. If you are concerned about it, you could consult a physician.Hope this helps.",
