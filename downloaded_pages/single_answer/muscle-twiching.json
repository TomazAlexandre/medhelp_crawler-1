            "answer": "Oh my! That's a horrible one! My daughter took my g/daughter to St. Lucia\u00a0\u00a0in the summer to see her father. I thought she was making up this silly name for an illness and even asked her if you get it from chickens? how ignorant was I! Daughter came home to UK with it and invited friends back- who all became ill in UK! So, so ill. We are white English and have never heard of it. So, I went on to the St. Lucia site to find out exactly what it is.\u00a0\u00a0They were so helpful so I suggest you go on a site like that, I don't know where you are, and explain where you are and ask for their help in how you get that help wherever you are living. That is one horrible illness and does take ages before you feel OK. I answered your question because I actually saw this dreadful thing in the summer. I hope this has been of some help.",
