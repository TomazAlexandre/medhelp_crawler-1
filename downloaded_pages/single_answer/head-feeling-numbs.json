            "answer": "Hi there.The more common explanation for this in the setting of diabetes is that of diabetic neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0this means that the nerves are chronically damaged by the prolonged elevation in blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0This can manifest with numbness and if the blood vessels in the brain are also affected, this can manifest with dizziness.However, due to the previous history of breast cancer, it is best to work this up as if related to cancer until proven otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that brain imaging may be necessary such as a CT scan, and I suggest you discuss this with your doctor.Regards.",
