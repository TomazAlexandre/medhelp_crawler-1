    "question": "2.5 months ago I had suffered a penis injury during sex. I went to the emergency room and they decided to check to ensure that I did not fracture my penis. The surgery they did involved cutting and peeling my skin down from the top to the base to chack the inner sheathing for breaks. Luckily no breaks in the shaft inner structures, but I did burst I vessel whcih they stiched up. Now 2.5 months from surgery I still have large patchs of numbenss and discoloration on the shaft and tip of penis. The operating urologist ensure me that sensation will return and that no nerves were cut. I am not feeling confident after consulting with PCP. Is this typical numbenss? Is this just part of the healing process? Also, is it possible that numbess duringt he healing process could fluctuate? Are there any treatments I could do to help the sesnation back as it heals?Thanks!",
