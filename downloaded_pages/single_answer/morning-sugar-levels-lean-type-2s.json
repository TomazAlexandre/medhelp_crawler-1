            "answer": "Hi,There are certainly thin people with Type 2 even though the majority of them are overweight. The two tests we use for determining Type 1 diabetes are anti-GAD antibodies and Anti-islet cell antibodies. Sometimes one is positive but the other is not, so you should have both tested if one alone was negative(especially if you did not respond to oral medications).The recommendation by the ADA for BS at night is to help guard against hypoglycemia while sleeping while\u00a0\u00a0still trying to keep levels controlled. Individuals\u00a0\u00a0can go higher than this or lower by morning, depending on many factors including what medications they take, how much insulin they produce on their own, the \"dawn effect\" where our bodies normally produce more glucose in the early morning hours, and sometimes (strangely) as a reaction to a low that may have occured in the middle of the night. It may take some detailed questions and even some middle-of-the-night testing to fugure out the cause of your particular pattern.\u00a0\u00a0The effect of your Lantus may be running out before morning(it is not necessarily a true \"24 hour insulin\"), so discuss moving it to night instead of the morning to bring those AM sugars down.Hope this helps, take care.",

    "question": "I, too, like Rogue621 always seem to have higher fastings.\u00a0\u00a0I am a LEAN, Type 2 Diabetic (I only weight 116lbs and stand 5'5\" tall with a slender build) and do not respond to oral medications.\u00a0\u00a0Only within the last 4 months did my sugar levels start to reach the 200s and that was usually at night or after any meal with sweets.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on insulin (Lantus - 2 units in the AM) and it seems to be helping - my levels are down by 10 points and I usually run a postprandial of anywhere between 135 - 151 depending on what I eat.\u00a0\u00a0(Before the insulin - I was usually in the 165-185 range at the 2 hour mark)\u00a0\u00a0What I dont understand is that most of the time - if I go to bed with a \"higher\" sugar level than the recommended 140 or below then I wake up with a fasting in the high 120s to the mid 130s.\u00a0\u00a0If I go to bed with a sugar level as recommended by the ADA then I wake up with a 130s to 140s fasting.What is that all about?????\u00a0\u00a0Also, I should note that I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 2 months ago (prescribed Lyrica but afraid to take it) and that I am a recovering alcoholic (2 years sober) and have no gallbladder and I am a smoker.\u00a0\u00a0I realize that these things play into the diabetes but how?\u00a0\u00a0why?\u00a0\u00a0My current endo. is absolutely useless!\u00a0\u00a0I have posed these questions to him and he has no answers.\u00a0\u00a0And why am I so THIN????\u00a0\u00a0 I have had a test on the Islet cells and they ruled out Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0My last HC1A was 6.1 with no medication or insulin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My pancreas is still producing insulin - at last count (back about 6-8 months ago) I believe the number was 5.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested, prodded and poked and no one can seem to figure out what is going on....Please help!Thanks",
