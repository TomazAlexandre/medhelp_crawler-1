    "question": "Hello,Im a 23 yr old with no prior health issues. family history of diabetes and hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0One night after laying in bed till about 2am i started noticing chest pains. i got up and felt dizzy, disorentated, hot flases, nauses.. everything that would indiate a cardiac problem. so i went to the er. several ekgs and blood tests later i have no heart related issues. they checked my thyroid.. that was fine.\u00a0\u00a0then after about two weeks of this\u00a0\u00a0my arms and legs started becoming heavy and weak and shaky. i feel like i have no strength to hold anything up and im always dropping things due to this. then my finger tips and toes started becoming numb and i would get wierd buzzy sensations in different places of my arms and legs including muscle twitches all over. when i lay down i notice this more as well as RLS. my eyes get blurry and hard to focus on objects and i also have been suffering from vertigo. Also im really jumpy and sensitive to noise and bright lights\u00a0\u00a0and i shiver really bad to any kind of temperature change.\u00a0\u00a0i have went to the er and family doc serveral times for this and they did tests to make sure i had no signs of stroke. they can not find anything.\u00a0\u00a0ct scan was normal, xrays normal, blood tests normal. my face got a wierd burny numb feeling. My head also feels like its on fire with a fever but i have no fever.\u00a0\u00a0All these symptoms i feel cause me to have anxeity so they put me on celexa, trazadone and lexapro.\u00a0\u00a0They do not help at all.\u00a0\u00a0 just recently i started loosing control over my bladder functions and i have had loose stool and more frequent bathroom visits. Also i have alot of pressure type pain on my head above my ears. i also feel like my ears ach alot they checked them and nothing is wrong there eaither.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been able to go to sleep at night normaly\u00a0\u00a0i end up sleeping otu of exhaustion and when i do i wake up several several times due to my legs,and arms going numb and having really vivid disturbing dreams.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i feel so frustrated when i go to my doctor because he is convinced that i just suffer from anxiety but something in side me says there might be something else wrong. Also, the muscles in my jaw and stomach are always sore due to contractions. i have felt like this for several weeks now and i explain to him that there hasnt been a time where i felt okay. should i push this issue anymore? could there be something else wrong?",
