            "answer": "She absolutely needs to loose weight: we know that this is the biggest risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. In fact she or he has non-insulin-dependent diabetes, which more than most people would equate to having coronary atherosclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0This morbid obesity not only increases the risk of her developing coronary artery disease, but severely limits her activity level and so diminishes the likelihood that she will experience any symptoms from the coronary atherosclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0This means that she is less likely to know that she has any cardiac problems.\u00a0\u00a0She doesn't have to lose hundred plus pounds to experience a benefit in her a glycemic control: losing 30 to 40 pounds may be sufficient to improve her diabetes control.\u00a0\u00a0She should make sure that her thyroid function is normal with thyroid replacement, as this can certainly cause morbid obesity.\u00a0\u00a0I would consider her to be at the highest risk for development of serious and life-threatening coronary artery disease.",

    "question": "Hi, I wasn't too sure which specialty to ask this but I decided on the most logical, cardiology.\u00a0\u00a0My mother, who is 58, is far more obese than she was just a few years ago, I think she may be pushing 350+\u00a0\u00a0She is so big that in fact she had to move to a handicap equipped apartment because she has trouble getting around.\u00a0\u00a0She is also very physcially inactive, and isn't too motivated to change.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway, I am wondering that as she is approaching 60 do you believe she is in imminent danger of rapidly developing heart or other conditions?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She is already non-insulin dependant diabetic and is hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So even with no big problems yet, what do you foresee with the 350 pound, inactive 60 yr old woman?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
