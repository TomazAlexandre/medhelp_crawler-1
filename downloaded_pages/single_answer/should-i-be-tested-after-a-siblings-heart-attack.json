            "answer": "I agree that you should be concerned about your own risk of cardiovascular disease after your brother's heart issues.\u00a0\u00a0While I think the smoking was a major risk factor which you do NOT share, the family history, obesity and hypertension are very important issues.\u00a0\u00a0You cannot do anything about family history, but the rest are all areas to be addressed.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend the following:1. Diet and exercise with aim for significant weight loss (BMI to 25-30).2. Check your cholesterol and make sure you know the goal numbers.\u00a0\u00a0I would strongly consider going on a statin medication IF your LDL is too high.3. Check your hemoglobin A1c, which tracks long-term blood sugar levels in the body. IF you have signs of insulin resistance or early diabetes, then you should control blood pressure and cholesterol even more aggressively.4. Check a high sensitivity CRP to gauge the level of inflammation in your body, as this could contribute to heart attacks.5. If you were a patient in my clinic, I would also recommend starting a low dose (81mg) aspirin.I do not think another stress test would be helpful at this point.\u00a0\u00a0A coronary calcium CT might help you further stratify your risk, but I do not it would ultimately change your risk profile.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck.",
