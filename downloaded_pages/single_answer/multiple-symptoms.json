            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your symptoms seem to be due to nerve compression and peripheral neuropathy. Have you been tested for B12 deficiency and diabetes?Since all your blood tests have been normal for autoimmune diseases, it also important to look at other neurological causes also like demyelinating diseases of brain. I would suggest you to consult an experienced neurologist. In the meantime you can try physical therapy under a trained instructor and see if it helps you with your symptoms.Take care!",
