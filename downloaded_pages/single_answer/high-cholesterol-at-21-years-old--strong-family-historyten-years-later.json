            "answer": "With the family history I would have taken the advice of your first Doctor. From a teenager I had very high cholesterol (genetic) and high blood pressure. Doctors ignored it in those days, but I sure am paying for it now. As well as cholesterol, you need to keep your blood pressure in check, avoid as much stress as possible and definitely never take up smoking.",

    "question": "Hello. When I was 21 years old, my cholesterol was about 250. It may have been higher, but I can't remember the exact number. I know it was not lower.My doctor told me I would have to change my diet and if that didn't help, go on Lipitor.I changed doctors. I go to the same practice but to a different doctor. My current GP is a minimalist and never mentioned this.I have a strong family history--dad had major heart attack before age 50, grandmother had a major one in her 40's, type one diabetes is in my family (uncle), mom has issues, heart tumor for another relative, etc. The list goes on and on...Well, I just wanted to ask... Is it really bad that I have had no blood tests for ten years and let that go for so long? I never changed my diet. I'm going to the doc today and I'm going to come clean about my family history and see what he says.Any advice?",
