            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Treatment for neuropathic pain (pain coming from nerves) includes neurontin and lyrica, and medications such as elavil (which is an antidepressant but has actually been found to be helpful with neuropathic pain as well).Alcohol can cause a neuropathy. However, I would highly suggest you followup with a neurologist to be evaluated for your condition to ensure that there is not another process occurring (such as diabetes, etc). Also, as you know you should cut back on the alcohol.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
