            "answer": "Hello,Tingling sensation of the penis can be due to anxiety, contact dermatitis, traumatic damage to the nerves of penis, diabetes, prostatitis, genital herpes, urethritis and STD\u2019s like Gonorrhea and Syphilis but they are less likely in your case.I would suggest you to keep the area clean and wear cotton underwears. Also apply a mild steroid cream on the penis. If the symptoms persist then the above said conditions have to be ruled out. Please consult a urologist in that case.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "So I was worried about STD's and went and got tested - so far everything is clean at 6 weeks with plans to get tested again for HSV at the 10-12 week mark. I was tested at 2 and 5 weeks with everything looking ok.I never had any visual symptoms (redness, discharge, sores. etc) but had noticeable testicle pain so I went to a GP who said i had a mild case of epididymitis and gave me some NSAIDs for 10 days and some cipro just in case.I have also been taking doxycycline 2x/day just in case for 14 days.So the testicle pain has all but subsided, but I have this constant tingle in my urethra - it seems to go away for a bit after using the bathroom but is noticeable most of the rest of the time. If I lay down it seems to alleviate it somewhat as well. My question is what could this be? Do I need to worry about yeast or urea/mycoplasma?I am only 30, is prostasis something that I should worry about? Are there other things this could be?What should I ask my GP, he thinks that I am fine.Help??",
