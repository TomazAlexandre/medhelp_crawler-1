            "answer": "Hello,Increase in frequency of urination can be due to due to many reasons like polydypsia ( excessive intake of water)and\u00a0\u00a0polyuria ( excessive urine production) which occur due to diseases like diabetes mellitus and\u00a0\u00a0diabetes insipidus. Excessive intake of coffee and cola drinks can be another reason and you need to check this out. In men prostatic hypertrophy can cause this. You need to get some tests done to diagnose the underlying problem.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "Hey Guys.Lately I have felt the need (just the normal need anyone has) to pee more often than usual, when I used to go only once or twice a day. The pee is still a normal amount It is sometimes after I have a drink (I drink water, one coke at dinner, and a lot of tea).But sometimes I go to the toilet and then feel the need to go again in less than a few minutes, and only a little bit comes out. I am almost 13, and although my parents have noticed once, I still feel worried, embarrassed and unsure if it is serious enough to ask about, or just let it blow over my head.",
