            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Sharp pain in chest and back can be due to pinched nerve or shingles. It can also be due to costochondritis and muscle pull. Since you also have a headache, pinched cervical spinal nerves should be considered. Gastric reflux is another possibility. Blood in urine can be due to UTI, stones, bladder polyps, infections or cysts, vaginal and cervical infections (in females), prostatits (in males), affection of kidney as in diabetes and hypertension.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
