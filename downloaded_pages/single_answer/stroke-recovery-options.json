            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. Therapy for stroke is with rehabilitation and medications. Depending on the patients need, rehabilitation may include physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy and recreational therapy. Medications are given to control any high risk factors like diabetes or hypertension. So, for now she will have to continue with the rehabilitation protocol her doctor has advised. As she is showing an improvement, her condition should improve. Also, discuss with her doctor about the cause for the bleed and take precautions to prevent further episodes. Good luck.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hello,My 89 year old grand mother, residing in India, has recently suffered a hemorrhagic brain stroke. She lives at home, but stays on a bed for the whole day as she does not have much control. When we talk to her she cannot respond and tears leak out of her eyes. She can now unconsciously move her legs and her right wrist. When we bring a glass (she only takes liquids) near her mouth she opens her eyes and her mouth a little so we can pour some into her mouth.\u00a0\u00a0Every morning a nurse comes to clean and groom her and sanitize the area. A physiotherapist also visits to help her gain body function. He says that it would take 3 years for her to recover with the options available in India, but perhaps treatments available in other parts of the world may shorten her recovery time to 1 year. It is difficult to see her suffer. Are there any options or ideas that would enhance her recovery and suit her age? Any help would be greatly appreciated!Thanks!",
