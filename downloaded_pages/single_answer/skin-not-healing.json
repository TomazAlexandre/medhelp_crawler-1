    "question": "I am a 21 year old Caucasian female. In the last year or so, I have noticed that minor grazes of my skin has not healed but rather turned into scars.\u00a0\u00a0All of my blood tests have been normal for iron, sugar levels, etc. I eat very healthy, exercise regularly, don't smoke/drink, take vitamins, don't lay in tanning bed, and have no history of diabetes in my family. Any ideas?",
