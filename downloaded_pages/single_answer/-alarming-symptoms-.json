    "question": "I am a 22 year old male who runs\u00a0\u00a0and stays generally active. Recently I noticed I have been feeling very lethargic and generally drained. I cut back my workouts to see if it was from going to the gym too often. That has not helped. I also have noticed my water consumption has sky-rocketed the past two days I have easily drank 20 bottles of water. Besides my hands and feet hurting the most alarming symptom came last night while I was driving I grabbed a snack at the store that included a candy bar, a bottle of water, and a bag of pretzels. Within 10 minutes of finishing my little snack I was feeling really ill and sleepy, my vision also started to go through phases of extreme blurriness along with a strong headache. I eventually pulled over at a rest stop and slept it off. What could this possibly be, and should I seek medical attention asap?",
