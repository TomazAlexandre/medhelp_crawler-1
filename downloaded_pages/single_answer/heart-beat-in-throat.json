    "question": "I have felt a heart beat in my throat it use to be rare that I would feel it, but recently I would feel it more than usual, even when I'm just watching tv. I do have anxiety and stress alot. I try not to but ever since my car accident I freak out when people get too close behind me when driving so that's where my anxiety came from. My father died of a heart attack and heart disease runs in my family along with cancer and diabetes.( my accident happened 4years ago but it was very tramatic I was hit from behind at high speeds and flew across the other 3 lanes on a bridge and hit and slid down the wall)I was reading on here about other people experiences with having flutters of heart beats in the throat and some people came up with some ideas of what could be the problem..pvcs and canon a waves..do you get them from anxiety and stress and gastric problems? When I do feel the heart beat in my throat I breathe different sorta out of breath for a second or two then I'm fine, but I'm concern that it is happening more than ever. I'm only 27 and I exercise more and I have been eating more healthier for 6 months now and drink water and take the right vitamins. I just also had a physical and my ekg was good, my cbc and cholestrol was good, and chest xray were fine and nothing bad in the complete blood test came up all were fine. I also have been getting dizzy spells when I get up to fast my vision blurred and I get light headed and sometimes I lose my balance. I also use to experience heart beat in my left ear, that use to happen all the time but now I hear it sometimes..so I know there is alot of things on here but I appreciate if you take the time out and give me some suggestions. (i'm sorry but I have been dealing with a supposely pinched nerve at least thats what my doctor said..its more in my left shoulder/arm and left side of the neck alittle bit down in my back, I figure I add this since they are all happening at the same time)",
