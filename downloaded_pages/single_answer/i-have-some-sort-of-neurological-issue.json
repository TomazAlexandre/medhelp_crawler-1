            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms, though this sounds like an issue with the internal ear that controls the equilibrium. You could either continue with the medications prescribed by the neurologist or consult an ENT specialist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management plan.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I have had disequilibrium since September 20th or so including nausea, headaches, ringing in the ears and slight loss of hearing in one ear. I went to the doctor and she said i had an outer ear infection so she cleaned out my ears and then gave me ear drops, nausea meds and meclizine. The nausea meds worked at first until my stomach began to reject it and caused me to throw up every time i would take one. The motion sickness pills made things much worse so i stopped taking them. I put the drops in my ears for 2 weeks which apparently took away the swelling in one ear and the other was fine. Regardless of this, i was having headaches, loud ringing in my ears and serious disequilibrium and slight vertigo.I went in again and she told me to just take high blood pressure meds and anxiety pills. The beta blockers help to calm me a bit, It is now over\u00a0\u00a0a month in and I went to see a neurologist after my primary care doctor did blood tests for thyroid issues and diabetes of which both came back normal. The neurologist said i have migraines and BPPV. She prescribed steroids along with the proplynol and clonapine.\u00a0\u00a0I have taken all of this and I am now not even able to walk around outside without holding on to things. Just taking a shower is difficult because my head twitches and shakes. Whenever I move out of bed, I twitch and look at the ground since looking up causes more twitching. I i also notice that if i push my head backward against my spine, I will shake and its not a fun feeling.\u00a0\u00a0 I have had to drop my school courses and social life because I cannot function outside of laying in bed sleeping or on a computer. I am going to the doctor again because I believe I have an inner ear infection that has not been addressed. This neurological issue has really shot my life down and I want to know what it is, how to cure it, and how to keep it away. Finally, the current symptoms are a very light ringing in my right ear, twitching and difficulty walking straight. Head shaking, and feelings of\u00a0\u00a0being hungover.",
