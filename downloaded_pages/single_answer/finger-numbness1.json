            "answer": "Hi Fushia,How are you feeling?Symptoms of pain, tingling and numbness are suggestive of neuropathy. Nerve involvement may be single (mono-neuropathy) or multiple (poly-neuropathy).This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your case it could be due to ulnar nerve compression or nerve irritation at the elbow level.I think you should consult your PCP to rule out above mentioned causes and discuss regarding further reference to a neurologist for further assistance.Hope this helps.Bye.",
