            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. Increased night time urination can be due to increased intake of fluids at bed time, sodas etc. Also, hydrothiazide is a diuretic and needs to be taken day time to prevent nocturia.In certain disorders like diabetes mellitus or ADH deficiency there is a possibility of nocturia.I would suggest that you consult your physician and discuss the above mentioned possibilities for further work up and assistance on treatment.Best.",

    "question": "Hi,I'm a 62 year old woman who has been getting up in the night to go to the washroom for years. I can get up as much as seven times. I had a can of soda water before bed so I can understand why last night I was up seven times but I was up four times in 1 hour. I am on the hydrothoride pill for high blood pressure and was taking them in the morning. I'm not going to the washroom in the daytime as much,maybe 5 times all day so I tried changing it around so I take it at night instead but there is no change. I still have to get up in the night. I have one decafe coffee in the morning, take a large cup to work(which I sip on all day) at lunch a soda water or milk and the same for dinner. I tried on time to have nothing to drink from noon and still got up at 3:00 am to go. I must also add that these are full bladders and not small streams. It's like my body is saying O.K. it bedtime lets go to the washroom. I can only remember once going to bed and waking up to morning. Was that ever refreshing. Any help you could give me would be very much appreciated.Thank you",
