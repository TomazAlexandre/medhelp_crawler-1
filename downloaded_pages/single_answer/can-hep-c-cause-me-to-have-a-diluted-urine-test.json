    "question": "I am currently in a treatment program and am tested at random. The facility has our urine samples tested for there creatnine and if it falls below their cut of 15 they consider it a diluted test. I have had hep c and heart issues for years and the conditions seem to be getting worse. My liver is constantly hard swollen and burning and I wanted to know if having hep c could cause me to produce a diluted urine sample as I just had a dilute come back a couple days ago and I was not trying to flush my system. Any info or advise would greatly appreciated.",
