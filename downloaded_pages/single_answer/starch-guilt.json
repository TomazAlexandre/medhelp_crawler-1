    "question": "I'm eating too much starch, I think. Between pasta, potatoes, corn, etc...I'm just worried that I'll end up with gestational diabetes eating like this. I've been craving potatoes non-stop, and I try to make sure I'm eating protein and veggies and stuff too, but I'm still a little concerned. Is anyone else overindulging on starches? I'm also craving salt, and I'm a little concerned about that too :(",
