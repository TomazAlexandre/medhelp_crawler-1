    "question": "I have a teenage son who has been suffering from stomach pains and extreme fatigue for the past several months.\u00a0\u00a0He is being seen by a pediatric GI and has multiple tests.\u00a0\u00a0Occassionally his white blood cell count is elevated but other than that all tests have come back with no concerns.\u00a0\u00a0Recently he became very lethargic and was taken to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually he got to a point where he appeared to just sleep and remained that way for hours. Again all tests and cat scan were negative.\u00a0\u00a0He did need oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0However after two liters of fluid he just woke up. The doctor said he must have been dehydrated but I dont buy that.\u00a0\u00a0He hadnt been out in the heat and he drinks mostly water. Are there any know illnesses or diseases with those symptons that we should be checking for?",
