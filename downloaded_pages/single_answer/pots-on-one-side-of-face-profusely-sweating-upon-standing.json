            "answer": "Hi,How are you? It is good that cardiac problems have been ruled out by your doctors. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is an autonomic disturbance that is characterized by the clinical symptoms of orthostatic intolerance,\u00a0\u00a0light\u2010headedness, fatigue, sweating, tremor, anxiety, palpitation, exercise intolerance and near syncope on upright posture. It can be classified\u00a0\u00a0to primary or secondary types which are caused by conditions such as diabetes, amyloidosis or\u00a0\u00a0Sjogren syndrome. Majority of patients respond to a combination of physical methods as well as pharmacotherapy. Take medications as prescribed and\u00a0\u00a0lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, drinking plenty of water, wearing strong support tights, and avoiding excessive standing and sitting, heat and alcohol may help. If the symptoms persist, have this evaluated further by your doctor for proper management. Take care and do keep us posted.",
