            "answer": "Hi,My liver enzymes came back elevated on Wednesday too, not has high as you but ALT was 42 and AST was 40.\u00a0\u00a0My endo didn't address the issue an it has me worried so I am headed to a GP on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0I too am an avid exerciser and take synthroid and vitamins.\u00a0\u00a0I am not overweight at current time but struggle with my weight too.I am a weekend wine drinker. We are kind of similar in our habits!!I started researching causes of elevated liver enzymes and did find that it can happen with thyroid disease and I did read something about iron causing it as well.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently taking Iron to raise my ferritin.\u00a0\u00a0Are you supplementing with iron?I am starting to wonder if synthroid is hard on the liver since it is one of the places we convert T4 to T3 which makes me wonder why we only replace with T4.\u00a0\u00a0I know T3 has a shorter life in the body but they can make it slow release.\u00a0\u00a0(I'm not bitter at all...just kidding!!)\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely talk to your doctor and maybe run the tests again.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you figure it out.\u00a0\u00a0My endo didn't even bring it up even though it was flagged high...I wanted to hit him when I got the copy of my lab work!!Marianne",
