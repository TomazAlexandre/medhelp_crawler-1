            "answer": "Hi!Sadly yes. Prolonged exposure to mold, and especially to toxic mold can start a chain of autoimmune reactions in the body. This is usually in form of pneumonitis with severe cough and wheezing, but autoimmune hepatitis can also start. In autoimmune hepatitis the body attacks its own liver cells causing inflammation and destruction, and hence yes, it is a serious disease. It can eventually lead to scarring of liver and liver failure.However, if caught in time, it can be managed with steroids and other immune-modulator drugs and has a slow course spanning several years. Often other autoimmune diseases like diabetes, thyroiditis, nephritis, anemia, and ulcerative colitis co-exist. Do discuss in detail with your treating doctor. Take care!",
