            "answer": "Hello,Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing paraesthesias are rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis. I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Kind regards.",

    "question": "I am currently experiancing sensory paresthesia from head to toe on both sides of my body. I have had an MRI with Gad that showed no MS or tumors ect. Also CT scan showed nothing. Bloodwork all comes back good with slightly elevated white blood cells. I also feel like my concentration is fleeting. So far no weakness. I doze off while looking at my computer.(not normal for me). Lyme came back negative. Dr. says it seems to be viral ? Syptoms are only getting\u00a0\u00a0worse. I got a static shock the other day and it traveled up my finger into my neck and felt very abnormal. Ive had bad sinus problems and possibly exposure to toxic mold. (getting tested for that tomorrow). Any Ideas?",
