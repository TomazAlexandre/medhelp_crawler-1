            "answer": "From the measurements you wrote down, his weight is just below the 25th percentile and height is between the 90-75th percentile for his age. If it is in the normal range then it is fine. Our bodies will 'burn fat' (Ketones) if there are no carbohydrates (glucose) in the body system from the lack of intake. It is not healthy if it occurs regularly due to a disease state, such as diabetes, or from one starving themselves. Suggest he eats a balance diet of carbohydrates, protein, and fat foods for all his meals to grow, and have regular MD check-ups. Hope this helped you.",
