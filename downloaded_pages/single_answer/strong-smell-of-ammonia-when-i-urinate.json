    "question": "I did a lot of water mostly carbonated flavoured water as I don't like plain water much. I've noticed that my urine smells a lot ammonia, I tend to go to the toilet a lot especially at night time and sometimes when I go it's only a little bit that passes. I've also started experiencing lower back pain so I'm worried this maybe a bit more than a uti I also suffer from incontinence problems due to a previous autoimmune disease. I've booked a doctor's appointment which is not for another week but I'm worried I'm leaving it to late should I go to a&e instead and what could it be? I know it's not diabetes as my mum has diabetes I've not lost any weight and I check my sugar levels on her machine which all seems normal. Please help thanks",
