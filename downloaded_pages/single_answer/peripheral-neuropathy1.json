            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to identify the cause of peripheral neuropathy in your case. It can be due to vitamin B 12 deficiency, Thyroid dysfunction, and diabetes. Certain medications can also cause peripheral neuropathy. Nerve compression in the lower lumbar spine can also cause these symptoms.I would suggest you to undergo a complete neurological evaluation as soon as you can. In the meantime you can take B complex supplements for relief and do some gentle back exercises.Thanks",
