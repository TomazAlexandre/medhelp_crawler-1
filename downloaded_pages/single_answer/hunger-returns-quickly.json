            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms are suggestive of hyperphagia(increased hunger) and early satiety(feeling of fullness even before completion of meals).Causes for such symptoms are gastritis,gastroparesis(delayed gastric emptying,a disorder in which the stomach takes too long to empty its contents),gastric outlet obstruction,heartburns due to acid reflux(GERD),irritable bowel syndrome,diabetes,hyperthyroidism ,cushing\u2019s disease and rarely GI esp stomach tumors.Try raising the head of your bed about four inches with blocks. It also might help to avoid eating or drinking for two hours before you lie down. Eat small nutritious meals at frequent intervals instead of a heavy single meal.To help control the stomach acid, one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them, or eat chocolate or spicy or greasy foods .Take some OTC antacid like Mylanta.You can also take zantac(ranitidine)or prilosec(omeprazole).These will help.Also keep your fluid electrolyte balance optimum by drinking lots of fluids.If still the symptoms persist then pls get the above possibilities investigated by a gastroenterologist.Also get your blood sugar levels and throid profile evaluated.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
