            "answer": "Hi,I know it can be very embarrassing. Adult onset bedwetting at night usually occurs due to to en enlargement of the prostate gland. There\u2019s a collection of urine in the urinary bladder behind the obstruction and there can be overflow incontinence at night. Hence, will suggest you to make your husband consult a surgeon and a physical examination will rule out enlarged prostate and an ultrasound examination will confirm the findings.The other possibilities are infections of the urinary tract and diabetes which can lead to similar symptoms. Asleep study may help as it has been observed that those who have a very deep sleep tend to lose their voluntary control over the urinary reflexes and tend to pass urine while sleeping.I sincerely hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Warm regards.",
