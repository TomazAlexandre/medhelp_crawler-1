            "answer": "Hi!Generalized weight loss cannot be due to pinched nerves in lower back. Wasting of calf muscles and leg muscles and twitching in these areas can be due to pinched lower spinal nerves. Unintentional and unexplained weight loss is definitely not good. One possibility is that you have an eating disorder. In which case taking help from a doctor specialized in treating eating disorders will help. There are many other causes like worms in stool, depression, anorexia nervosa, AIDS, cancers especially colon cancers, drug abuse, infections and loss of appetite. Loss of appetite can again be due to certain medications, drug abuse, depression, AIDS, acute and chronic infections, cancers and hypothyroidism. Either you do not eat well or there is increased metabolism as in hyperthyroid states, HIV, cancer etc. Poor absorption as in irritable bowel syndromes and malabsorption syndromes too is possible. Malabsorption syndromes are seen in intestinal tuberculosis, HIV, tropical sprue, parasites in stool and Whipple\u2019s Disease. Diabetes too can be the cause. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "I have some very quick moving symptoms and headed to university. Blood work fine , EEG normal but a ton of twitching started in calf and now everywhere at random tiles. Than the atrophy started , thought I had reherniated my disk .. Skin crawling and buzzing. Lost most of chest muscles and neck muscles. 2 Nuro dr say no ms and no als.. Curious about the weakness issue. I don't have much and pass all strengh test. Just touch off balance . I have been very strong from tennis and still feel very strong. I've gone down 2 sizes in a couple months. It's like the fat and muscle are reshaping my body. Because I have had a pretty big back surgery they are putting it off as back issues. My family Dr says no way and sending me to Seattle.",
