            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Shooting pains and numbness in the foot can also be a sign of peripheral neuropathy which can occur in diabetes and due to B12 deficiency.Pain in the temple can be due to allergies or TMJ or sinusitis also. Do you have a history of allergies?It is important to rule out all these causes. Please discuss these with your doctor. Meanwhile please relax as stress will only make your symptoms worse.Good luck!",

    "question": "I have had a constant pain in the left side of my head (about 2\" above my ear) for 5 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0During the last 3 weeks I have had shooting pain from that same spot going through my head to the right side.\u00a0\u00a0My hearing has been very sensitive so I went to the doctor thinking it may have been an ear infection.\u00a0\u00a0After a week on antibiotics I am worse.\u00a0\u00a0I have numbness in my left foot (across the top from my ankle to my toes). My balance is off and the sooting pains are unbelieveable.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a neurologist and he said it sounded like a pinched nevrve coming from my neck.\u00a0\u00a0He sent me for a MRI of my head and neck.\u00a0\u00a0I will get the results Monday.\u00a0\u00a0I peeked over the radiographers shoulder (which I don't recommend doing) and I saw a white spot on the side of my brain.\u00a0\u00a0I went online (which will convince you that you have every disease known to man) but everything I read online doesn't match a \"pinched nerve\".\u00a0\u00a0I haven't had any neck trauma and I am not convinced it has anything to do with my neck.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions to ease my mind so I can get a restfull nights sleep between now and Monday??",
