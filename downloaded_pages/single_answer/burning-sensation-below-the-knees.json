    "question": "I have burning sensation below the knees when I sit too long and/or in air-condition environment. My feet don't like anything touching it. I was tested on sugar level and it had been in between 6 & 7. The family Dr thinks I am on border line of being diabetic. My feet are perfectly ok when I am standing up or walking in hot weather places like Hawaii & Florida, wearing short pant and in sandles/slippers (just nothing touching or constricting the skin of the lower legs). So what problem is this? Bad circulation or neuropathy? Thanks in advance for any advice.",
