            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms it does not look like a scar as scabs after wound do not last so long. It can be a condyloma or seborrheic keratosis (benign growth of skin) and for the differentiating the two I would suggest you to get a biopsy skin done. If it is either of the two then they have to be removed by different methods.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello, and thanks in advance for looking at my question. This is probably going to seem strange, but here it goes: About 10 years ago (before I had any sexual contact so I know it isn't STD related), I cut what I think was a hair follicle on the shaft of my penis trying to shave that area for the first time. Unfortunately that cut never healed properly. It's not a scar, however - it's more like a permanent small circular black scab. Probably once or twice a year I end up tearing the scab off (it's small; only about 1 mm in diameter) in an attempt to try to start the healing process over again. It always forms back the same way though - as a small black permanent scab. With all the blood flow that goes to this area, why didn't this ever heal properly? Cuts and such on the rest of my body heal normally. I actually cut my finger the other day and it's pretty much completely healed already, so I know I don't have any auto immune disorders or diabetes or anything else of that nature.This is really just a cosmetic issue and has no effect on function or carries with it any other symptoms, so I guess my questions are these: What is it, how do I get it to heal properly, and if it's too late to have it healed is there any way I can have it laser removed or something like that - I'd much rather have a normal skin tissue scar than a black scab.Thank you again for your time.",
