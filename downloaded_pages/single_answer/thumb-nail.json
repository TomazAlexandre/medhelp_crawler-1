            "answer": "Hello,This horizontal ridge can be due to Beau\u2019s lines. They are horizontal and going across the nail. It may be caused by an infection or problem in the nail fold, trauma, coronary occlusion, hypocalcaemia, skin disease, and may be a sign of systemic disease. It may also be caused by an illness of the body, such as diabetes, psoriasis or certain medicines. I would like you to consult a dermatologist and get investigated for all these causes.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
