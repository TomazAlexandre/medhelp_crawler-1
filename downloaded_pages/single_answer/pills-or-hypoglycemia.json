            "answer": "People who turn to food for comfort do so to fulfill an inner need not associated with hunger or diabetes. You should see your doctor to address this issue and also ask for a diabetes test to rule out the latter. Inform your doctor that changes in your appetite has occurred since this is a mild side effect of Zoloft.",

    "question": "Hello,I get really hungry in the middle of the night, usually around 4 am and\u00a0\u00a0so I need to get up and eat something otherwise I cannot fall back asleep. Also, my mouth is very dry so I wake up every few hours and drink a lot of water. I noticed that if I only take a little bit of sugar, my hunger goes away and I feel better. Could this be hypoglycemia? I am currently taking Zoloft 50 mg in the mornings and Ambien before going to bed. Could these pills make me hungry?Thank you",
