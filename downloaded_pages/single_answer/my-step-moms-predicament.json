            "answer": "The sweetener in the chocolate or carob will be the issue. So she needs to read the carbohydrate count for all of these foods. If she is a type 2 diabetic, taking oral medications and trying to control her diabetes with diet, she will probably be put on a low carbohydrate diet. She can use sugar-free chocolates, but needs to read the carbohydrate contents in the sugar-free foods, for many of them contain more carbohydrates than \"free\" foods such as celery or green beans, and therefore must be worked into her carbohydrate count for each meal. If she is put on insulin, then she won't be on a low-carb diet as such, but will have to count her carbohydrates and take appropriate insulin. So she probably should look for ways to get her chocolate \"fix\" without overloading on carbs. I am a type 1 diabetic, and I use sugar-free chocolate mix to add to my milk for calcium. It works well, but I must count the carbs and make sure that they are worked into my medications. So no more snacking on chocolate whenever she wishes -- she needs to do the chocolate as part of her regular carb intake.",
