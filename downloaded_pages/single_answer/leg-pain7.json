            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!You probably have venous pooling due to faulty deep vein valves or due to deep vein thrombosis. This causes fluid to accumulate in the calves and thighs.It could also be due to water retention as in low protein in blood, kidney problems, heart problems, pressure on the dorsal aorta, severe anemia, deep vein thrombosis, liver diseases etc. It could be due to hypothyroidism too. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
