            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched after the trauma. In addition condition may worse due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes and due to stress/anxiety. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first for radiograph and clinical examination. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

    "question": "I fell almost 2 mos. ago. I landed on my left leg just below my knee cap real hard. I had swelling and was black and blue for weeks. I had numbness on this area and most of the area has proceeded to get better. I can not apply pressure when exercising in that area. I have started to feel discomfort in this area in the past few days. I feel a very small bump now in that area. I did not get this checked out. I know I did brake or fracture any thing but may have chipped a bone, not sure. Should I have this looked at?",
