    "question": "My 3yr old has NOT been diagnosed with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0At this time I *only* suspect she may have some type of blood sugar issue.My question is for those of you that experience a urine odor.\u00a0\u00a0What is it like??\u00a0\u00a0My 3 yr old daughter's urine is incredibly foul.\u00a0\u00a0It literally smells like a nasty men's bathroom at a truck stop.\u00a0\u00a0I guess that could be a stale or old urine smell??I have six children, and she is the ONLY child to have this issue.\u00a0\u00a0It smells so strong in the morning, it about makes me sick!Thanks for any insight you may have.\u00a0\u00a0All the tests show \"normal\" at this point, so my hunches may be way off!Rebecca",
