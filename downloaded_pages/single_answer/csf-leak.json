            "answer": "Oh man....Do you have coffee filters at home? Take some of the fluid and put on a coffee filter. I heard if it makes rings in the filter, it is CSF and you need to get back to the doctor.Caffeine and laying flat are supposed to help. There is also a med (ask?) to help stem the flow.I had a slight case of leak after which was a mess, and the doc was just about to give me a med, when it ended. Yippee.As for the boogies - amazing! Who knew those were up there!",

    "question": "Hi I had a petuitary cyst drained Feb. 6th during surgery I had a csf leak. I was only supposed to stay 1 night but ended up staying for 6 because of\u00a0\u00a0the packing they used dislodged and was coming out, diabetes insipidis, sodium lvls and a few other things to do with my blood work. I was out of the hospital 2 days and another large amount of the packing came out so they had me come back for 2 more days. Tuey went in with a scope and did an mri. They said I still had a small leak but it should heal on its own.since tuen I jave woken up several times at night with a wet pillow and a wet face all around my right nostril. I had my check up appt with my neurologist today and he sent me to the ENT dept. They went in with the scope and cleaned a bunch of very large boogies out. And said it looked ok.\u00a0\u00a0Once I got home.ky nose started dripping like crazy. It is a clear liquid which I know\u00a0\u00a0they say could be csf but is it possible that now that they uave cleared the way it could be.mucus?? Anyone have this before? Its a pretty continuous drip like a very runny nose but its more clear than anything and I did not have a runny nose before my appt....any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
