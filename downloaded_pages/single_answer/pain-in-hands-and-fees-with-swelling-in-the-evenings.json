            "answer": "Hi,The symptoms which you have described are classically described as \u201cGlove & Stocking neuropathy\u201d in medical science and it can result from different underlying pathologies like diabetes mellitus. I hope you got your blood sugar checked. Vitamin deficiencies like deficiencies of Vitamin B1, B6 and B12 can result in similar symptoms. Even if your tests of peripheral neuropathy have come out to be normal, I\u2019ll still advise you to take drug preparation containing these multivitamins as I have seen many of the patients actually responding to the symptoms despite their tests of peripheral neuropathy coming out to be normal.I sincerely hope that helps.Please do keep me posted.Kind regards.",

    "question": "I am 60 years old (female), never had any significant illnesses in my life, and am having sever pain in my hands and feet. It started in the tips of my toes and progressed to my feet and then to my hands. The tops of my feet and hands are very sensitive. My feet and hands feel like hot water has been spilled on them. In the evenings my feet and hands swell slightly and the pain is increased. My tongue feels like it is coated and gums are slightly reder than usual. My doctor says the symptoms are called periphreal neuropathy. I had extensive blood tests, and nothing showed up. I have had my nerves tested for damage, and none detected. My reflexes are super sensitive, and I twitch quite a bit. I have to take strong pain medicine constantly. I have had these symptoms for about a month. I have seen a neurologist, and no specific diagnosis, just anti-inflamatory medicine and physical therapy. Anyone have similar symptoms. Diagnosis?",
