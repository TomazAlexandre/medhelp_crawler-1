            "answer": "I'm not sure either what is meant by vessel rejecting stents.\u00a0\u00a0There are risks associated with stent implants that include allergic reaction, stent thrombosis (blood clot in the stent), death, reactions to antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications or to dyes used during placement. I quess it could be any of those reactions.You ask can heart and blood vessel disease be inherited?>>>>Yes. A tendency toward heart disease or fatty buildups in arteries seems to be hereditary. That means children of parents with heart and blood vessel diseases may be more likely to develop them. Also, a family history of diabetes, gout, high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol also increases the risk of heart disease.When there is a family history of heart disease one should absolutely reduce the risks of heart disease by controling weight withn proper diet and exercise, avoid smoking, excessive alcohol, etc. Also, see a doctor regularily at a younger age to watch for any early signs of heart disease.Thanks for sharing, and if there any further questions you are welcome to followup.",
