            "answer": "The \"palm bubbles\" could possibly be due to sustained water exposure but, even more likely, could prove to be a response to soaps or detergents used in the shower, doing dishes and washing the dog.\u00a0\u00a0This sounds like a contact dermatitis, but if there truly is scarring, that is worrisome.\u00a0\u00a0You should try wearing water-proof gloves and also observe if this problem occurs when the only exposure is to water and not to soaps or other materials.Some skin disorders can be a sign of systemic disease, such as diabetes and alcoholism.\u00a0\u00a0If the \"scarring\" is leading to a permanent contracture, it could be Dupytran's contracture.\u00a0\u00a0You definitely need to see a dermatologist.\u00a0\u00a0When you do, ask about this and the question of systemic disease.",

    "question": "Whenever I get out of the shower, do dishes, wash the dog, or am in contact with water for longer than five minutes, the skin on my palm bubbles. It started about 5 months ago with a tiny little spot, and now covers most of my palm. The skin actually stretches and bubbles, making my pores look huge and causing deep creveses. It goes away in about 15-20 minutes once I dry it off. Now it has moved to my other palm. I went to two doctors, and neither of them knew what to tell me. It doesn't hurt, it's just weird and annoying and it makes it difficult to make a fist when it bubbles. It happens so much now that the center of my hand is becoming scarred. I have been trying to find a dermatologist, but they can't see me for three months. Is this something strange, or is there a simple explanation?",
