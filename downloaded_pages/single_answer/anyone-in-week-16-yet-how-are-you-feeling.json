    "question": "Hello All you greats moms and moms to be!!!I have a question because each month to wait and go to the doctors is annoying and i would like to know how are you guys feeling in you 16th week or are your pregnancies progressing. Here is my past i have a son 6yrs old and i actually found out i was pregnant with him when i was in my 16th week and i can't remember my pregnancy because i was working in the hospital 12hrs a day. Well now i am a stay at home mom and have had 2M/C's and this pregnancy is so incredible that i want to know i am supposed to feel this great while pregnant. I'm in my 16th week and have no symptoms, no bump, no cravings, except for for some bad acne or pimples. Anyone in their 16th week yet? How are you ladies doing? Feeling? Any bump, carvings, symptoms? Its scares me sometimes because i said i might of had a m/c but have no symptoms because i can't feel no flutters or any movements. Please help if any info, thank you so much in advance ... Goodluck to you all",
