            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Increased frequency of urine could be due to excess intake of fluid, during pregnancy, UTI, STD, diabetes, tumors in the bladder etc.As your history suggests that you have been experiencing this problem since your previous delivery due to use of catheter, I would advise you to get a check of the badder. Sometimes an overactive bladder can cause frequent urge to pass urine and discomfort on retention.Also get a STD panel done along with urine analysis.Consult your urologist with reports.All the best.",
