            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Bedwetting in adults could be due to\u00a0\u00a0a small bladder, lack of hormone ADH or diabetes mellitus.\u00a0\u00a0Bladder irritants such as alcohol and caffeine, can also contribute to bedwetting by increasing urine production. Treatments include bladder training, enuresis alarms, and medications. His pauses in breathing could be due to Obstructive Sleep Apnea, wherein during sleep there is an obstruction to airflow due to laxity of the throat muscles during sleep and this could cause impaired air flow and apneas.\u00a0\u00a0So, I would advise you to consult your primary care physician for further evaluation. He may then ask for a sleep study called polysomnography for further evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "My husband has recently had a few problems during the nighttime.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past three months he has wet the bed 4 or 5 times, and after doing a bit of research it seems like nocturnal enuresis.\u00a0\u00a0He is a healthy, fit 29-year-old who doesn't smoke.\u00a0\u00a0He DOES have a drink, sometimes water, sometimes alcohol, before bed.Another problem that I've noticed is that he appears to stop breathing and sometimes it also seems like his heart has stopped beating during sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I am pregnant, and therefore get up to urinate frequently throughout the night.\u00a0\u00a0When I wake, I look at him and notice that he's sleeping on his back and honestly appears dead.\u00a0\u00a0It scared me beyond belief the first few times and I'd roughly jostle him awake.\u00a0\u00a0I only noticed it when he was sleeping on his back.Our concerns are as follows:1.)\u00a0\u00a0His body doesn't wake him up when he needs to urinate.2.)\u00a0\u00a0He seems dead-to-the-world sometimes when he sleeps.\u00a0\u00a0I'm concerned that these symptoms may be indication of something more serious.Any insight or help would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
