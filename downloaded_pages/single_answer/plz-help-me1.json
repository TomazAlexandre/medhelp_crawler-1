To date, human cases of avian influenza have been reported in six countries, most of which are in Asia: Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam.If you live in an area that is known to be endemic with avian influenza (H5N1) AND your father came into contact with raw poultry or a live bird, AND he has symptoms of fever, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or chest pain, he should seek medical care immediately.The incubation period for H5N1 avian influenza may be longer than that for normal seasonal influenza, which is around two to three days. Current data for H5N1 infection indicate an incubation period ranging from two to eight days and possibly as long as 17 days. http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/avian_influenza/en/#clinical~\u2022~ Dr. ParksThis answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice.

    "question": "last week my father touched some food which belonged to some poultry and he saw a pigeon that seemed infected of bird flu. so he's so scared of being infected. and he doesn't want to see a doctor but he needs to know the famous symptoms of it and the period of the disease. I'm afraid about him cuz he has diabetes and blood pressure and he has phobia from death. so his condition becomes worse day after day cuz he read the symptoms on the internet and thought that he has most of them..",
