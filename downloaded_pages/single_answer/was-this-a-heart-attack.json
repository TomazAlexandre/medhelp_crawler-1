    "question": "Was admitted to hospital with rapid heart beat and shortness of breath with chest pains. Was converted to sinus rthym and put on coumidin to thin the blood. Had a cardiac cath done which showed blockage in one of the arteries but not enough to do a stint. My EKG showed positive for septal myocardial infarction, low voltage. Does this mean i had a heart attack. I have other factors such as hypothyroid, diabetes and lupus. Am 51 and have a family history of heart disease. could this be part of a lupus flare-up?",
