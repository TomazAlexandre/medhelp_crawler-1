            "answer": "Hi there.The most common causes for these headaches are still stress and lack of sleep.\u00a0\u00a0Other conditions would include primary migraines which can be treated with standard anti-migraine medications.\u00a0\u00a0Also make sure that other conditions are ruled out especially high blood pressure, or metabolic problems such as diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Neuropathic pain, or pain arising from the nerves themselves may also be the culprit, and is still may be secondary to stress or nutritional deficiencies (like the B vitamins).Regards.",

    "question": "2 times in the past 2 months I have had sudden and severe head pain while riding in a car.\u00a0\u00a0I am not prone to headaches normally so I am concerned. The incidents both happened when nearing the very bottom of an elevation change, however, I have been flying and driving with elevation plenty of other times in the past 2 months.During the event, I started hollering bcs it was so acute and sudden and my husband pulled the car over. The pain does not seem deep inside, but very sharp and mobile on the back and top of my head.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of times I felt it in my face or ears and neck.\u00a0\u00a0The headache eased both times after about 20 minutes but held on less sharply for several hours afterward.I am only 30 with gluten (foods) sensitivity and no other health issues. I do travel a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a sign of known major issue that I should have tested?",
