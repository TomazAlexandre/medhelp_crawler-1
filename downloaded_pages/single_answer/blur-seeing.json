            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. You are a young individual and I assume there are no associated symptoms other than occasional blurring. It could be secondary to fatigue, lack of adequate sleep, exposure to outdoors for a long period, certain mediations like over the counter anti histamines etc. do you have any headaches or known migraines? Did you have any eye infection? It would be wise to consult a physician to examine you for systemic ailments like diabetes or hypertension, particularly if there is a family history. Consult an ophthalmologist if it doesn\u2019t resolve with adequate sleep and no systemic illnesses are detected. You can write again if there are any other significant details that you missed in this post. Best wishes to you.",
