    "question": "As I posted before, my sister is prediabetic. She was diagnosed last year. Since then she is fighting it strongly or you can say with extreme difficulty but without drugs, only with diet ad exercise. But unfortunately sometimes she weekens in front of food and her readings fluctuates until 250-300 and at times with excercise she drops to 130 etc... Lately she read that magnesium and chromium reduces blood sugar. So she took it and in no time her reading yesterday was 60 even with eating some bread. She is amazed and asks:1. Whether she was deficient in these two minerals and that was the reason of her becoming prediabetic, although she tends to be obese2. Or that that these two metals can be used to cure from diabetes.if no 2 is correct, why then diabetic people take drugs if it is enough for them to take these 2 metals ??thanksEzz",
