            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!Triglycerides increase in poorly controlled diabetes, hypothyroidism, kidney problems, fasting or skipping meals etc. Certain drugs like steroids and birth control pills too cause high triglycerides.I think you should discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated further. Do let me know if there is any thing else. Take care!",
