            "answer": "Bev,I would suggest that you stick to it with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0People who transition from stable angina to unstable angina are at a very high risk of suffering a heart attack within a few weeks of onset of symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Very often, the source of the transition is a blood clot that may partially or fully clog the affected arteries that are already sensitive to changes (spasmatic).\u00a0\u00a0The goals of unstable angina treatment are to decrease the symptoms and prevent any more blood clots from forming. To accomplish this, a person with unstable angina will be hospitalized and given medicines through an IV.In up to 85 percent of patients, this emergency treatment will stabilize the angina symptoms. The person can then have a cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, or heart bypass surgery (known as coronary artery bypass surgery or CABG for short) to look for and/or fix the causes of unstable angina. Emergency angioplasty or open heart surgery will be needed in those people for whom symptoms do not get better with IV medicines.Please follow-up.\u00a0\u00a0A simple \"stay the course\" will not suffice in this instance.",

    "question": "I've had stable angina for 15 years.\u00a0\u00a0For the past 12 weeks I have had about 24 episodes of severe chest pain, bp raising to 240/140 and a pulse of 140.\u00a0\u00a0These ease after about 25 minutes and 4 or 5 nitro sprays.\u00a0\u00a0These are occuring at rest now, not on activity.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on 4 bp meds and Imdur 30 mg and these keep my bp normal except for these break through episodes.\u00a0\u00a0My cath, stress tests are normal - no blockages.\u00a0\u00a0 I've been instructed to just hold the course if the nitro spray stops the episodes; however, I'm very concerned.\u00a0\u00a0At my request, I get a 30 day event monitor tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 60 year old with diabetes and a history of idiopathic pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0I do not feel my cardiologist is as concerned about this problem as me and my family.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions or advice?",
