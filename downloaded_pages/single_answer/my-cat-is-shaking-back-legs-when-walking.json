    "question": "I have an 11 year old black cat who just yesterday started shaking his back legs when he would walk.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't want to move much now.\u00a0\u00a0One of his pads looked red and swollen last night and when I looked again this morning it looked back to normal. But he still won't move much and he is still shaking both of his hind legs like he's trying to get something out of his toes, but he's cleaning them both and I dont' see anything there.\u00a0\u00a0Should we be concerned?",
