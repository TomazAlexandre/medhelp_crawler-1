            "answer": "HI,Being overweight and having little physical activity does put you at risk for diabetes in general. Your blood sugar\u00a0\u00a0of 101mg/dL after eating was just fine. Some of those symptoms you describe are quite common especially in young women.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to some lifestyle changes( eat balanced diet but rich in fruits, veggies, complex carbs, low in fat, sweets and junk foods), try to start increasing your physical activity to get to a goal of about 30 minutes 5 days a week. This should help in some weight loss which is the ultimate best way to prevent diabetes.Take care.",

    "question": "Hello!I am a 17 year old Female, and I'm kind of overweight and sedentary.I'm not sure if I have all the symptoms of Diabetes or any at all, but Ever since I was 15 I've felt very lightheaded and weak until I ate something, or something with protein in it. And it happens all the time. Its driving me nuts! My doctor said that I am at a little risk for Type 2 Diabetes, but it's not serious you know? It's like I get dizzy, then I eat something and it goes away for a short period of time and then its just an ongoing cycle. i already went to the doctor and they tested my Blood Sugar and it read 101, and that was about an hour after eating some crackers. Is that normal? Am I at risk for Pre-Diabetes?",
