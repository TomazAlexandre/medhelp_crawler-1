    "question": "my mother in law was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis 1.5 years back.she is 64 and a patient of\u00a0\u00a0diabetes . she had suffered from jaundice at an early age.she is non alchoholic and in insulin ( human mixtard 20-25 everyday).in jan 2010 she suffered edema and ascitis in stomach but was cured with diuretics( lacilactone).since then she was absolutely stable.A couple of days back she experienced stomach ache which was subsided without any medicine.but the next morning she vomited blood in a very large quantity. she vomited 5 times in a duration of 4 hours. also Malina was observed. the first thing they did at the hospital was an endoscopy followed by colonoscopy and CT scan of abdomen, esophagus and PNS ( paranasal sinusitis).astonishingly all the reports were absolutely normal.Doctors were surprised to see no traces of blood during both scopies.as we all were guessing that varices could be the cause; reports sweeped the possibility of it! Doctors have still not found out the cause of this severe bleeding neither they are able to find out from where bleeding occurred.can anyone pls tell us if there is any further examination required?",
