    "question": "I recently noticed that ants gather in my 7 year old daughter's used underwear. She does not wash after passing urine during her regular school days and it is on these days that the ants gather on her removed underwear. But when at home, she washes each time after she passes urine and on these days the ants do not gather. Could it be that she is suffering from diabetes? Could it be that the ants are gathering due to high sugar in her urine? I am very upset..Kindly advise. Do I need to consult a doctor or test her sugar levels?",
