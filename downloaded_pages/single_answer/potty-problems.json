            "answer": "Diabetics are more prone to bladder infections, so you may want to ask her if she has any discomfort. If her glucose levels have been high, she may be feeling thirsty (symptom of uncontrolled diabetes is thirst) and may just be drinking too much because of it. See if the behavior changes when her glucose levels are normal. If not, it may not hurt to have her doctor run a test for bladder infection just to be safe.",
