I will say don't worry about weight, just make sure to drink lots of water, eat a healthy snack and meal and to engage\u00a0\u00a0in light physical exercise. Some\u00a0\u00a0woman may gain weight more than\u00a0\u00a0others which can be due to medical reasons ( like diabetes..etc)\u00a0\u00a0or some may retain water weight.",
