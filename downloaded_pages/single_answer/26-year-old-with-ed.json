    "question": "So, my boyfriend and I just moved in together and, for the last, I guess, few years, he has had quite an issue with diabetes. He is now trying to get back into shape and eat better and finally started taking his pills again... For a while, he just didn't care what happened, but now we're doing better on that. I was wondering if his diabetes has gotten too out of hand and thats causing the ED or if it could also be the pills? Hes taking Metformin 500mg tablets. His mother died of diabetes and his father now has to take insulin. Also, is there any danger to having sex until he can get to his doctor and get checked out? He hasn't been in quite a while and hes only taking the pills that he had left over from a year ago or so. Should he be being more careful and maybe see his doctor before taking anymore? Or continue?",
