            "answer": "Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I cannot tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.I understand that it can be very difficult to understand the medical jargon in those MRI reports. I will try to explain them to you.Regarding MRI report:There are multiple causes for so called plaques (or white matter abnormailities as in your case) in the brain. Most often, these are due to what is called \"chronic small vessel disease\", literally meaning diseased small vessels that supply blood flow to the brain. This is not an uncommon process in the brain and increases with age. This is not a disease in and of itself but rather is a reflection of unhealthy blood vessels, damaged by years of plaque build-up. This is most often due to a combination of several factors including the following: high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol. If these factors are well controlled, the damage to the brain can be stabilized and further damage prevented.While the presence of small vessel disease does not predict dementia per se, it may increase risk of a type of dementia called vascular dementia.What most predicts a future risk of dementia is not plaques but is atrophy: shrinkage of the brain. Other factors that increase risk for dementia including age, a family history, a history of heavy alcohol consumption, head trauma, and others. In your case the MRI did show \u201cdecrease in volume\u201d but this decrease was AGE APPROPRIATE so even though some brain atrophy was there it was not abnormal for your age.Other causes of plaques in the brain can be migraine. People with migraine often have plaques on their MRI that are of unclear cause or significance.Other causes of plaques on MRI can usually be distinguished based on history and symptoms, such as symptoms of neurologic deficit (for example arm weakness or difficulty walking etc). These can also be distinguished based on the MRI appearance. These include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, other demyelinating disease, and inflammatory processes such as vasculitis.In your case, the most likely causes are that the plaques are likely due to chronic small vessel disease if you smoke, have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes. In that case it is imperative that you stop smoking, take medication to control your blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes, eat a healthy diet, and exercise.Or they are due to migraines, and are therefore likely inconsequential, or they are.It does not seem from your MRI report that you have had any strokes in the past.Regarding the MRA results, no aneurysms were seen which was the primary reason for getting the study so that is good. As for all the other comments about the different arteries, you just happen to have a slightly different circulation than most people, your brain circulatory system is also normal. To give you an analogy, 10% of people are left handed. Even though the majority are right handed, left handedness is accepted as normal too. Just like that you have a slightly different brain circulation but it is still in the realm of normal. It is not diseased. It does not give you an elevated risk of strokeIn summary, you should put your mind at ease. The white matter abnormalities on MRI are common findings in people who are old and have vascular risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol and smoking, if you have any of these then please control them. The MRA is negative for aneurysms and normal.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "I am 64 year old female with history of migraines and fibromyalgia.\u00a0\u00a0Family history... Father mild stroke, no damage, died at 78 of massive aneurysm;\u00a0\u00a0Mother several TIA's and late stage dementia, died at 88 of unrelated infections.Because of family history my doctor ordered an MRI.Results:\u00a0\u00a0The volume of the brain is decreased, but age appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0No ventriculomegaly, shift in midline structures, restricted diffusion, intracrainial hemmorrhage, or intracranial neoplasm is identified.\u00a0\u00a0There are multiple small FLAIR hyperintense foci in the cerebral white matter bilaterally.\u00a0\u00a0The brainstem is free of signal abnormality.\u00a0\u00a0There is trace mucosal thickening of the ethmoid sinuses.\u00a0\u00a0The temporal bones, central skull base and craniovertebral junction are unremarkable.Impression:\u00a0\u00a01)There are several small nonspecific FLAIR hyperintense foci in the cerebral white matter bilaterally. Age related leukoarainosis/old microvascular ischemic disease and migraine headaches are leading considerations. 2) No acute infarct or intercranial hemorrhage is identified.\u00a0\u00a03) The vascular flow voids show no gross evidence for aneurysm.\u00a0\u00a0Consider a circle of Willis MRA for further evaluation for cerebral aneurysm, if clinically warranted.My doctor ordered a Willis MRA.Results: The anterior circulation has normal caliber, course and configuration except for developmentally hypoplastic right A1 segment.\u00a0\u00a0The origin of the right posterior cerebral artery is seen with associated aplastic right T1 segment.\u00a0\u00a0The basilar artery and distal vertebral arteries bilaterally are congenitally hypoplastic.\u00a0\u00a0No aneurysm or vascular malformation is identified.Impression:\u00a0\u00a01) No aneurysm is seen.\u00a0\u00a02) Anatomic variations as discussed above.My doctor is very difficult to understand and she had a tough time attempting to explain the results to me.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure what all of this means.\u00a0\u00a0It seems from the MRI there is some slight damage to the white matter of my brain, exact cause unknown?? Perhaps combination of age, small stroke and migranes???\u00a0\u00a0Does this damage make me more likely to expenience additional mini strokes?\u00a0\u00a0I really don't understand the results of the MRA?\u00a0\u00a0Except that no aneurysm's were found, does the MRA say I have something wrong?\u00a0\u00a0Is this normal and does it make it more likely that I could experience strokes in the future?\u00a0\u00a0Also from the results of both the MRI and MRA and family history, am I more likely to develop Dementia?I would greatly appreciate your help in explaining the results of my test.",
