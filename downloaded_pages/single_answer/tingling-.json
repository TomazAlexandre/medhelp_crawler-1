This nerve compression could be at the level of the cervical region.Another cause can be diabetes and B12 and B6 deficiency. Both these conditions can cause peripheral neuropathies.Excessive anxiety, fatigue and stress can also cause tingling sensations.An X ray or CT scan of neck will help in making the diagnosis of nerve compression.Hope this helps!",
