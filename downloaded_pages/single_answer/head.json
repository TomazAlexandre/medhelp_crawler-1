            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!First get your blood pressure checked. This could be due to high blood pressure. The other possibility is clot in some blood vessel. This can also give out heat sensation without there being any temperature. Hyperthyroidism, diabetes, temporal arteritis are the other possibilities. It can also be an allergic reaction to some soap or oil etc. It could also be due to menopause so get all female hormones tested. Take care!",
