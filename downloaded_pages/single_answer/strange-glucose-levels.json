            "answer": "Your blood sugar upon admission to the hospital of 4.9 (88.2) is totally normal. 8.5 on the other hand which is 153 would be high for a non-diabetic. Most non-diabetics rarely go above 120 no matter what they eat or drink. Yes, an A1C of 5.9 is considered pre-diabetic. You should be working on diet, exercise and weight loss if you are overweight to control your blood sugars and consider getting a meter so you can see how different foods affect you. Anxiety does contribute to higher blood sugars in diabetics (not in non-diabetics).",

I have frequent urination problem during the day but\u00a0\u00a0I never need to wake up night times .Yesterday night,I ate\u00a0\u00a0 a bit large meal and exactly after 4 hours I felt light headness and dizzy , I Rushed to hospital and checked my blood glucose levels. It was 4.9 mmol\u00a0\u00a0at tht moment. I took one cocktail juice drink from the canteen after 15 minutes I checked glucose levels\u00a0\u00a0and it was 8.5 mmol. Doctor said it is okay though it is near the border line.I dont understand why I have strange glucose controlling system . I am afraid , may be these are early signs of becoming a diabetic soon . I have diabetes family history. Two months back my h1bac was 5.9 .and fasting blood sugar level was about to reach border.\u00a0\u00a0Anxiety has something to do with glucose controlling system ?. I think i am pre-diabetic and not being diagnosed properly.",
