            "answer": "Hello,The liver is the primary target organ for glucagon action, where it promotes glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis or you can say it plays a major role in controlling blood sugar levels.So if there is any liver disease then blood sugar rises.On the other hand,diabetes can increase risk of some types of liver disease. For example, poorly controlled blood sugar increases the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can lead to scarring of the liver (nonalcoholic cirrhosis). Other medical conditions related to diabetes such as high cholesterol and obesity can also increase its risk.So in way both are interrelated.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
