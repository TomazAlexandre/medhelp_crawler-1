            "answer": "There are a number of reasons that the A1c does not \"match\" your husband's fasting blood sugar readings, but the most likely is that his daytime/overnight blood sugars are higher than they should be.\u00a0\u00a0He may be spiking quite high after meals, and it is taking most of the night for the lantus (and his pancreas' own insulin production) to bring his blood sugar back down to normal.\u00a0\u00a0Consider checking blood sugar levels before and after each of his meals for a week or so to get an idea of what his control really looks like.\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively, he could wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for 3-7 days to see what the patterns/trends look like all day and night.\u00a0\u00a0Ask you doctor if he has a CGM system that you could use.\u00a0\u00a0I his blood sugars are truly spiking high after meals, he may require additional medication, mealtime insulin, and/or education on managing the carbohydrate content of his meals and incorporating timely physical activity into his day.",
