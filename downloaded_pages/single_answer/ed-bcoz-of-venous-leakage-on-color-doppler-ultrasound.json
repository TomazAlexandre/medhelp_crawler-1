            "answer": "Hi!Usually there is no surgical treatment or medical management of venous leakage. Patients are advised to use vacuum devices to generate erection as this is the best treatment method. However, of late some centers and surgeons are doing a new technique called embedding the deep dorsal vein of the penis (EDDVP). This has met with good rate of success.If the venous leak is due to diabetes, then correcting diabetes, and keeping sugar under good control can help improve the situation. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
