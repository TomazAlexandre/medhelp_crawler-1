    "question": "HelloI had unprotected sex 5 weeks ago, and after 10 days I started to get a pain at the tip of my penis when urinating. I immediately went to a local sex clinic and they tested me for Chlamydia,and Gonorrhoea. The results came back negative but was prescribed single dose of azithromycin.After a 4 days the stinging at the tip of my penis was still present and they decided to prescribe me 7 days of doxycycline. I completed the course but due to my lack of faith in this private sex clinic I then went to the (UK) NHS sexual clinic for more tests and they FIFA swab and urine test plus blood test. They could not find any signs of Chlamydia, or Gonorrhoea, HIV, urine infection or Trich but also suggested it was a NGU.I have now been prsecribed metronidazole (5 day course) and azithromycin (single dose). The pain when urinating had stopped but just have a tingling irritation.Can you tell me:-I'm a type 1 diabetic (well controlled) if I do have NGU would my diabetes interfere with the recovery rate due to the fact it's location being in the penis area?-If the girl I had sex with has come up negative could this still be a possible NGU as has been sugested?-I am an avid cyclist - do cyclists suffer from cases of uretithritis conditions ( reason I ask is one health provider said no and another said they thought it could be from the cycling)?- Not sure on the technicality of discharge but I had and now somewhat decreased what appeared to be tiny drop of urine at the tip of my penis (I'm circumcised) as if you just finished urinating and then milked the penis to get more urine out (is that discharge or just urine because the urithra is inflamed?) - though discharge was coloured or sticky.- how can one know for sure there is a problem if results are negative but being prescribed antibiotics on my symptoms?- if it is/was a urethritis infection, and I have completed the course of my antibiotics is the symptoms/irritation around the tip of the penis due to perhaps post stress there is a healing period (I had the pain for 10 days but stopped a few days ago, and now just mild stinging - oddly stopped as soon as I took the metronidazole and azithromycin).- is there a website forum you may know that provides advice dealing with STDs for those that have diabetes (googled and can't find much linkage - maybe my reason for the several antibiotics is a poor imune system and the fact it's on the penis slows down the recovery rate).Appologies for the confusion but it's difficult as Dr's at the clinics seem to say different things and as I have not really come up positive for anything (aside from the symptoms, and unprotected sex) I feel like I'm being given all these antibiotics on the hope it will resolve these issues.",
