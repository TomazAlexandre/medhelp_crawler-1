            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Looks like you are under a lot of stress. Dizziness, decreased appetite, random pains and throat constriction could all be due to anxiety. Metabolic disorders like diabetes or hypothyroidism can cause these symptoms. Sometimes a sleep disorder obstructive sleep apnea can produce lack of sleep, dryness of mouth and early morning headaches. In addition she seems to have lost weight.. If other conditions can be ruled out, then her symptoms can be attributed to anxiety.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
