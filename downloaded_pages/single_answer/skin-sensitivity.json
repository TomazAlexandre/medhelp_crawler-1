            "answer": "Hello,There are many possibilities for such kind of symptoms. These abnormal sensations that you are having are parasthesias Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol? Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also occur in peripheral artery disease, Peripheral nerve trauma, Peripheral nerve compression or in head injury patients.Another possibility is of temporal arteritis.It is an inflammatory disease of blood vessels (most commonly large and medium arteries of the head). It is therefore a form of vasculitis.Firstly, I\u2019ll request you to get your blood sugar/HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) tested to rule out Diabetes mellitus. You may also need tests like Nerve Conduction Velocity,CT and MRI head and biopsy of the temporal artery.My opinion is to get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.Take care and do keep us posted on how you are doing.",
