            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Positional variation of pain is unlikely to be due to the heart. The pain could be due to renal stones. The other causes for the pain could be infections of the bowel, prolapsed intervertebral disc or inflammatory diseases of the colon. Please consult your primary care physician who will do blood tests, x- rays and may ask for an ultrasonogram to find out the cause for the pain.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
