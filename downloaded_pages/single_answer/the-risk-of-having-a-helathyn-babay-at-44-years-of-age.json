            "answer": "Hi!All your well meaning friends could be partially right. Actually the risk of all genetic disorders, congenital anomalies etc along with small for date baby, maternal high blood pressure or diabetes etc all increase as the age of mother increases. While it is true that the risk is highest for a woman who becomes a mother for the first time at age 44 than a multipara woman like you, you cannot rule out the risk of the same in your case. Also, at your age the chances of hormonal imbalance are pretty high. So, please let your Obs and Gyn monitor this pregnancy well and do all the required fetal scans to rule out any anomalies. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
