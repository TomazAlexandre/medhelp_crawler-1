            "answer": "1)\u00a0\u00a0The refraction is used for calculation of IOL power depending on the formula used.\u00a0\u00a0If the refraction is used in the formula (Holladay II), then the previous refraction should be used.2)\u00a0\u00a0Regarding wearing glasses and contact.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like your left good eye is very myopic and has an early cataract.\u00a0\u00a0You might ask your doctor to do a BAT test and see if the vision decreases to the level insurance will pay.\u00a0\u00a0One option is a Crystalens which does not split light and will give you the same vision as a monofocal lens and some near.\u00a0\u00a0Many doctors do not want to use Crystalens in a diabetic who may need retinal surgery due to the silicone material. I have put in Crystalens in proliferative and nonproliferative diabetic who have had laser treatments. One of my patients had PRP and macular laser treatments 6 or 7 times before Crystalens implant. I have also done retinal surgery before and after Crystalens implant.The real question is the visual potential in the right eye.\u00a0\u00a0It is probably not the best investment if the macular is damaged to the degree that it does not have a potential for good vision.I am somewhat bothered by the fact that there is still persistent macular leakage.\u00a0\u00a0Is the cataract so dense that more treatment is not possible?\u00a0\u00a0Have they also considered Avastin injection?I would recommend preteatment with Xibrom and predforte a few days before surgery and continue for two months post op no matter what type of lens you decide on.A final note I would recommend you diabetes be in the best possible control before surgery.\u00a0\u00a0HgA1c at 7 or less.",

    "question": "I am 48 years old and have type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0As a result of the diabetes I had leaky blood vessels in my macula that caused minor swelling behind the retina.\u00a0\u00a0My Retinologist used a laser to sear some of the blood vessels to reduce leaking.\u00a0\u00a0The swelling is nearly gone, things are, and have been stable for some time now.\u00a0\u00a0She has given be the green light on cataract surgery since I can barely see through my right eye.MY FIRST QUESTION is regarding the information that my eye specialist is using to calculate the specifications for the lens.\u00a0\u00a0About six months ago, I had a refraction before the cataract got so bad that I could no longer see.\u00a0\u00a0This was used for a new perscription for my glasses.\u00a0\u00a0About a month ago, another refraction was done.\u00a0\u00a0This time I could barely if at all tell the difference between different powers, since the cataract had gotten so bad.\u00a0\u00a0When I ask the person who was doing the tests for the lens implant about which refraction they would use, the response was \"we use the distance from the front of the eye to the retina, and information about the topograghy of the cornea to determine the perscription.\u00a0\u00a0The refractions (taken earlier) have very little to do with the new lens selection.\u00a0\u00a0IS THIS CORRECT, OR SHOULD THEY HAVE USED TO OLDER REFRACTION THAT WAS TAKEN WHEN I COULD STILL SEE WELL?MY SECOND QUESTION regards the recommendation for which lens to implant.\u00a0\u00a0I will be receiving financial assistance for the lens and doctor portion of the surgery, and I don't want to opt. for something that is less than best just because of my finacial situation.\u00a0\u00a0I have a great need of near vision with the type of work that I do, and would rather wait and do things the best way, than settle for mediocre right now.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor says that he is not recommending a premium lens because they have not been tested on people who have had laser surgery such as mine.\u00a0\u00a0My other eye also has a mild cataract and I wear a very thick perscription.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor says that I cannot wear wear the thick lens (nor would I want to), but that I should wear a contact.\u00a0\u00a0He already expects that I will still have to wear glasses after the surgery, so will I end up wearing glasses and contacts at the same time?\u00a0\u00a0DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY INSITE ON MY SITUATION.Thank you,soundguy100",
