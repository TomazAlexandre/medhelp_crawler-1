            "answer": "Dear Steve:It sounds like you put too much pressure on your right ulnar nerve.\u00a0\u00a0This nerve leaves the brachial plexus in the shoulder area and swing around the elbow.\u00a0\u00a0It is likely that you put too much pressure on it during the telephone conversation.\u00a0\u00a0I would try and keep yourself from putting long duration pressure on your elbows.\u00a0\u00a0It may be that due to your body structure (am I correct in thinking that you are not overweight????) you may be prone to such pressure events.Keep good tract of your health.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can increase the chances of this occuring, in and of itself.\u00a0\u00a0It can also induce a polyneuropathy which can give the same symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0But yours sound like it is event related.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "I am a 30 year old male in good health but have numbness in my left hand pinky and ring finger. Last Sunday during a 3 hour phone conference my left hand, which was holding the phone, fell asleep. Since then my 2 fingers have been tingling and numb although they do have feeling. Also, it seems that my feet and arms are susceptable to falling asleep easily when I cross my legs while sitting or extending my arms such as driving in the car and resting my arm on the passenger seat. Adult onset diabetes runs in my family. Thank you in advance for your response.Steve",
