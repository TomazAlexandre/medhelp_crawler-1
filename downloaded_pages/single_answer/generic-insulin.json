            "answer": "Type 2 Diabetes typically occurs when the insulin that the body produces is less efficient at moving sugar out of the bloodstream.\u00a0\u00a0Some sugar is moved out of the blood, just not as effectively compared to a person with normal insulin efficiency so you get high blood sugar.So you're probably producing more than enough insulin. It's only occasionally that someone with type II is placed on insulin and most times that really doesn't seem to do a great job. Diet, exercise, weight loss, and in some cases medication are the treatments of choice for Type II diabetes.",
