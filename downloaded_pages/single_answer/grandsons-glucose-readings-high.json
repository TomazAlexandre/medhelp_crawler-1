            "answer": "Boy, with a family history like that I would test them first thing in the morning if you're concerned (and I would be). That's the reading that will tell you the most. Mine is around 79 and my husband is around 120. They say that a reading of 125 or higher first thing in the morning would be an indicator for Type 2 diabetes and require further testing.So sorry to hear of the tragedy in your family. How awful for your sister to be sick and have nobody know.Keep a good eye on those grandkids of yours!!!!!!",

    "question": "First let me say that both of my parents were borderline diabetics. I have two sisters with type 2 diabetes and a niece that has had type1 since she was 4 years old. She had been in several comas in her lifetime, she's 29 yrs old now. Finally she takes good care of herself but now has trouble with her eyesight and kidneys. One of my sisters has to have dialysis now.\u00a0\u00a0I also had another sister to die when she was 16 years old with type 1. They didn't know she had diabetes till they did an autopsy. I can remember she always was very thirsty and had sores on her mouth, and cried a lot. My parents rushed her to the hospital and the dr. said she was having a nervous breakdown and gave her a sedative shot which put her in a coma and she died. That was back in 1957 when they probably didn't have insulin. Everybody in my imediate family lines up and we test them every so often. My two grandsons ages 8&9 had readings of 150 &170 two hours after they ate. I just wanted to know if this is normal for them?",
