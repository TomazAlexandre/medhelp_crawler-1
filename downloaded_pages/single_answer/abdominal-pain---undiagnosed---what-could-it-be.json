            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, this does look like a yeast infection that is not going. Yeast infection or thrush is at times very difficult to treat. You may need to take oral antifungal pills twice a week for 3-4 weeks or may be more and a combination of antifungals would be required. Also check and see if you have diabetes. Widespread or persisting fungal infection can be due to high blood sugar.The diarrhea or constipation too could be due to fungal infection of the gut. However, it could also be due to IBS or irritable bowel syndrome.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello.For the last 2 weeks on and off, I have a dull ache that is pretty far below my belly button, this ache also cramps.\u00a0\u00a0It doesnt last long, but sometimes radiates through my stomach.\u00a0\u00a0I have had diaheria and loose stools for the last month, with an occasional solid BM..\u00a0\u00a0I eat well, drink a ton of water and have an appetite.. I have no nausea, but just this aching sensation with cramps and then it goes away.\u00a0\u00a0Consistent for the last 2 weeks.I have seen my Dr and have had xrays, bloodwork, and a urine sample.\u00a0\u00a0My urine sample came up abnormal, I have yeast, bacteria, blood, and squamous epithelial cells.. Everything else was fine (blood work), my x-ray showed a little constipation and gas.\u00a0\u00a0I also submitted a stool sample, but no results yet.I have a long medical history.\u00a0\u00a05 surgeries in 3 years..\u00a0\u00a0ectopic pregnancy, c-section, lipotripsy for kidney stone, desmoid tumor removal (which was benign), and most recently a bowel obstruction caused by adhesions.\u00a0\u00a0I actually felt really good after my bowel obstruction surgery then out of nowhere got these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It is not the same pain as a bowel obstruction, that will be a hard one to top.My Dr. is very unclear and I feel that I have some sort of bladder or internal yeats infection..\u00a0\u00a0I always seem to have yeast, blood or bacteria in my urine.. Sometimes burning, sometimes not..\u00a0\u00a0I took a dilfucan 2 nights ago and to my surprise the pain went away and then today after I saw my surgeon and he probed my stomach, the pain came back.I dont know what else to do.. Any suggestions or ideas to what this might be??Thanks.MTR80",
