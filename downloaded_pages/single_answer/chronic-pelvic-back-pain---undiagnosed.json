            "answer": "You have had a pretty comprehensive workup thus far.I agree with the MRI and orthopedic workup.\u00a0\u00a0Epidural blocks are an acceptable approach for the pain, in light of the MRI findings.\u00a0\u00a0Obtaining a second opinion at an academic medical center can also be considered if the symptoms continue.Right-sided pain can also be caused by a hernia, irritable bowel disease or inflammatory bowel disease.\u00a0\u00a0A colonoscopy, imaging the small bowel, or abdominal/pelvic CT scan can all be considered if these causes are suspected.\u00a0\u00a0A GI referral can be done.If the diagnosis continues to be non-revealing, going to a physiatrist (rehabilitation MD) or a pain clinic can help manage the symptoms.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patients education only.

    "question": "I've had chronic pain for 7 years.\u00a0\u00a0In 2000\u00a0\u00a0I had my first laparascopy.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr. diagnosed me with endometriosis.\u00a0\u00a0The pain cont. & I was given a 6 mnth course of Zoladex.\u00a0\u00a0Once off the Zoladex, I got prgnt and the pain disappeared.\u00a0\u00a0The pain returned after I started ovulating.\u00a0\u00a0I became pregnant with my 2nd child & the pain was gone until I started ovulating again.My dr gave me seasonique but the pain continued so he recommended a hysterectomy for endometriosis and adenomyosis.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 32 yrs old.\u00a0\u00a0I opted for surgery in the Cayman Islands by a trusted Dr.\u00a0\u00a0 He performed a laparascopy, hysteroscopy and cystoscopy based on the symptoms I described.\u00a0\u00a0 After surgery, I was told that I had NO endometriosis.\u00a0\u00a0He found pelvic adhesions & removed those & administered the Spray Gel Barrior to prevent the adhesions from reforming.The pain returned so he suggested that I go to see a back Dr. since I have a great deal of discomfort in my lower back.\u00a0\u00a0The spine surgeon did an MRI and found that L5 was torn and that I had a cyst in my left ovary.\u00a0\u00a0 We did a discogram & it was positive for a some of my back pain but it was unable to replicate the pain that is in my groin and shoots down my legs.\u00a0\u00a0He just did 2 epidural blocks on L1 and L2 to try to rule out that those disc are causing the leg pain.\u00a0\u00a0 He also ordered a 24 urine collection test for porphyria which I will do this Saturday.Here are some of my major symptom and basic information:* lower back pain that is always worse on my right side and radiates to my groin, then my inner thigh and eventually to my knee* pain is always worse mid cycle around the time I would ovulate.* the pain is worse if I keep a full bladder* Sitting too long triggers the pain in my legs and groin* I have controlled Type II Diabetes (my A1C is 5.6)Please give me some ideas on what direction I should be looking and any advise that you have.\u00a0\u00a0 Sabrina",
