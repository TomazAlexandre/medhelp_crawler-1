            "answer": "Thank you for your question. The complaint you are suffering from could be orthostatic or postural hypotension. Here the patient feels dizzy due to sudden decrease in blood supply to the brain upon standing. The probable causes which may lead to such condition need to be sorted out in your case. They are Addison's disease, atherosclerosis, pheochromocytoma (multiple endocrine gland disorder including thyroid, parathyroid etc.), diabetes and some neurological disorders like spontaneous intracranial hypotension due to CSF leak, etc. I would advise a lipid profile check (to rule out atherosclerosis) and an endocrinologist\u2019s consultation in this regard. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "Lately, every time I stand up ,no matter how fast or slow I do so, I become extremely dizzy. My vision goes completely black, I have to hold on to something to keep from falling and I can't hear anything for about 5-10 seconds.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been experiencing jerky, twitchy movements in my arms and legs and shakiness in my hands. I would also like to know if these symptoms are related to the fluttering heart beats I get when I lay down that cause me to have difficulty breathing?",
