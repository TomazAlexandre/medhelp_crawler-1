            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0You need a current X-ray of the leg and foot to see if there is a fracture again. Also, the symptoms could be due to pinched nerve, deep vein thrombosis, intermittent claudication, arthritis of foot or due to a fracture of any bone of foot.You may need to consult your doctor regarding osteoprosis, low vitamin D, low calcium, diabetes etc. All these can delay bone healing and cause bone pain.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I fractured my tibia playing softball. the doctors did mri's and x-ray's and didn't figure out what was wrong until I had already fractured it again. That has been over a year ago. It still makes my leg swell, and it throb's. Now my foot, on the same leg of the fracture, pops constantly. I don't know if there is a relation there. I was on crutches for two weeks. they never did a check up, or anything.",
