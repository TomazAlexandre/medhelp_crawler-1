            "answer": "Hello RainbowDove,As you may know, we're volunteers here & not medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0We're all very experienced with diabetes ourselves and/or for our family members.YOu've asked a really interesting question and I have not heard about others who have the connection.\u00a0\u00a0That doesn't mean the connection isn't there, but I've not come across folks who shared their stories.For many Type1s, our diagnosis is the first/only one in our family altho' sometimes after \"the first\" diagnosis, there are others in the ensuing years.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 is known to be an autoimmune disease, and since cancer treatments do affect one's immune system, perhaps no one can really rule out the connection in your case.\u00a0\u00a0For those of us with Type 1, our immune system has become hyper-sensitive, and over-reacts to the presence of some of our cells.I've attended some research presentations intended for \"regular folks\" where the researchers shared the incredibly complex set of issues that may combine to result in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The path to diabetes is not a straight path, nor is it the same for each one of us who ends up with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us can recall some health or physical trauma soon before diagnosis -- some researchers are trying to identify any patterns there, too.I hope that you are healthy now -- even with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your pen-name \"RainbowDove\" brings to mind grace & beauty even thru dark times.\u00a0\u00a0That's a great image!",

    "question": "I have had type 1 diabetic for the last twenty years and there is no history of diabetes in my family. When I was 12 I had leukaemia and subsequent cancer treatment, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. I feel that the drugs used to cure my cancer caused damage to my pancreas and the cells that produce insulin. Has anyone else out there become diabetic after cancer treatment ?",
