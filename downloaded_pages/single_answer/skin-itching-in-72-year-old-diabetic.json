You didn't tell us about your blood sugar levels - preprandial and postprandial - or your last A1c test results so we can only speculate.Causes of night time itching -\u25cf High blood sugars left uncontrolled and/or ill-managed.\u25cf Pruritis\u25cf Bathing or showering in hot water drying out the skin\u25cf Liver disease\u25cf Bed bugs\u25cf Thyroid problems\u25cf etcSuggest you see your doctor and get tested for hidden diseases that only testing can uncover. If non exist and Pruritis is suspected [happens with seniors w/diabetes] topical ointments are available by Rx. Also, daily application of a skin moisturizing cream helps along with bathing in luke warm water. Your doctor may refer you to a Dermatologist for further evaluation. Good luck -",
