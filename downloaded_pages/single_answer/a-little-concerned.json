    "question": "I have had these incapacitating pains in my lower abdomen...they are sharp sometimes and feel awful...sometimes it feels like an air bubble or something and it feels like somehting \"popped\"....sometimes they are just dull pains...they start either on my left side or right and sometimes radiate to the other...(when i say the pain is lower abdominal it is where i would think my ovaries are....the part where underwear cover and the area below my belly button...never above my belly button..either on my belly button or below...)I've had frequent missed periods so i went to a gyn and had an ultrasound done where i\u00a0\u00a0found out i had poly cystic ovary syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0she said that PCOS does not cause pain and she said i needed to go to a physician to get that looked into. she said there were trace amounts of endometreosis but i would have to get a surgery to be sure and she said that it wasnt necessary for the trace amount she thought i had...she also wants me to get tested for diabetes....im not sure if the pain is linked to female parts or if it is my intestines...lately when i take a bm, there is blood that is not necessarily \"in\" my stool but is in the water...and if i pass gas when taking a bm it sounds wet like and it turns out that the reason why was because it was blood....there was a time when i thought i had to make a bm but it turned out to just be blood...it was like clotty and dark and some was bright...almost like if i was menstrating heavily from my rectum...i am tired of having these pains and i am going to go to a doctor, but i am just looking for some sort of advice now...i dont know if these pains are linked to rectal bleeding or if i have more female reproductive issues..maybe endometreosis...im not sure...im just looking for something so when i go to the doctor i can say \"test me for this, this, this, etc...\" just to get to the root of the pain...female reproductive problems like cervical cancer and pcos and other things run in my family as does colon cancer...(i am 20 years old, and a little overweight)",
