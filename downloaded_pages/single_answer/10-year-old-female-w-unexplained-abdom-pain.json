    "question": "My 10 year old daughter has had 8 straight days of abdominal pain. The pain was sudden onset below belly button, with in 2 days, it moved to the right upper quadrant. She describes the pain as 8 or 9 out of 10, sometimes spiking to a 10 causing her to cry. It is constant pain. She does not have diarreha, fever, nausea or vomiting. Pelvic ultrasound(to rule out a ruptured ovarian cyst) was negative, urinalysis was negative, blood work showed \" some elevations indicating some inflammation\" per the doc report. 3 months previous were thyroid test, diabetes testing, cholesterol-with some elevated levels. Initial ER diagnosis was constipation. That is not correct as she is having regular daily bowel movements. There are no known allergies to foods. Thank you for any information.",
