    "question": "My mom had a urostomy performed after 2 years w/ an indwelling foley catheter. Her bladder failed to empty urine any longer- could not find cause- possible overstreaching from retention, diabetes, severe spinal stenosis(?) The urostomy began to drain small amts of urine. On day 4, she went into septic shock. They put the foley back in and the bladder emptied a lot of urine. She recovered but the urosomy still only drains about 2o-30 cc a day. It has been 6 weeks. Her foley continues to drain about 1000 cc a day. The urostomy drainage recently turned a brownish color. The urologist states he is going to pull the foley next week. I am concerned that the urostomy does not work and she will go into shock again?Can you offer some advice about what you think is going on? Thanks.",
