            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.I am sorry to hear about all your troubling symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Since it sounds like you have had a multitude of tests with no results, i think you should continue with the consult in regards to the chronic lyme.\u00a0\u00a0The only other option that i thought of would be to see a hematologist in regards to the persistent increase in your WBC's and your sed rate.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and i hope you find some answers soon.Bridget",

    "question": "For the last 6 mos My WBC and Sed rate have been elevated. With this I have been getting problems I never had before and feeling worse I have had every blood tests ,blood cultures, urine tests, urine cultures, even a bone marrow biopsy, colonoscopy and endoscopy all tests negative.They found an ulcer but it should be healed by now with the med. My type 2 diabetes was under control with janumet but now it is worse and I have to take insulin. I am getting worse and nobody has an answer. Can't eat unless I take pain and nausea pills, and then only a little. I have lost 25lbs, needed to lose but not this way.\u00a0\u00a0I always get pains in different areas of my stomach. I am now very tired, have to take thyroid medications, and there is a vitamin D and B deficiency, elevated liver enzymes which they biopsied. The other strange .this is that after a fine needle breast biopsy where they removed something minor, I now have red patches over both breast in the size of either a dime and some the size of a quarter. I also now have asthma. My friend who is a nurse and has it as well, thinks it is chronic lyme and I am moving within a month and found someone who believes in this theory. I was just hoping for other tests or what things to check while I am still here",
