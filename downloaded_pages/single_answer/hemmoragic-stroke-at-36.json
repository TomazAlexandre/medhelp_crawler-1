            "answer": "Hello and sorry for the late reply.If you are completely mobile and work out, then losing weight will be the same as other people who did not have a stroke. To lose weight you have to either cut down the calories in your diet or increase the loss of calories through exercise. Unintentional weight loss gain can occur with hypothyroidism, diabetes, certain medications, depression, eating disorders, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. These can be detected by a simple blood tests. Check with your doctor to rule out these conditions.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
