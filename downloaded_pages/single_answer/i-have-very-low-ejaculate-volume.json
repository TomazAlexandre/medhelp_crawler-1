            "answer": "Hi there,There are several conditions which can lead to a low ejaculate volume. Low volume ejaculates are caused by ejaculatory dysfunction, genital tract obstructions, or congenital anomalies. Diabetes mellitus, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, medications all can cause ejaculatory dysfunction. Genital obstructions are caused by prostate cysts, infections, inflammatory disorders etc.A detailed history, physical exam, laboratory assessment, and semen analysis can help the physician in evaluating the exact cause. Seek the opinion of a urologist. Do keep us posted.Best luck and regards!",

    "question": "I'm 24, in good overall health and active lifestyle. I don't have any problems getting erections or having an orgasm. But the amount is at most a drop, but usually it's dry. I took a serum testosterone test and I had normal levels. It's always been like that and I don't have \"wet\" wet dreams, so I don't think it's mental. What are possible causes? What would a doctor do to diagnose it? Any idea how much it would cost without health insurance? Since it's a problem I've had from the beginning, is there much a doctor can do?",
