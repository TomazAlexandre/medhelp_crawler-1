            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling now?I think your symptomatology suggest some spinal disc pathology.I think you should consult a neurologist and an orthopedician and decide regarding further line of management.MRI spine is a must in your case to further refine and define your case.Nerve Root Pain - nerve root pinching / irritation / compression / trapping is always associated with signs of nerve dysfunction (not working properly) such as pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness. This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.Hope this helps.Bye.",

    "question": "Hello,I'm a 24 y/o male.\u00a0\u00a0For months I have been experiencing a tingling/tightness on the left side of my face, head and neck.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I feel it in my ear, or throat, or sometimes all over the left side of my face.\u00a0\u00a0Went to the doctor, had allergy testing done (all negative), took nasal sprays, Singulair, etc. for a few weeks at a time with no improvement.\u00a0\u00a0Had a ENT examine me, but with no findings.\u00a0\u00a0 Was tested for Lyme's, came back negative.I also felt a general floatiness and dizziness that came and went.\u00a0\u00a0Saw a neurologist, who suspected a brain tumor or MS.\u00a0\u00a0Did an MRI of the head with contrast, found no evidence of either.\u00a0\u00a0He suggested it was unexplainable peripheral neuropathy and that it was harmless and would go away in time.\u00a0\u00a0Recommended treating the symptoms with anti-seizure meds if I felt that it was necessary.As time passed, other symptoms have cropped up.\u00a0\u00a0I often notice a soreness/tightness in my upper left back.\u00a0\u00a0Also, in the past few weeks, I have had a constant dull ache in my lower left back/groin/thigh region.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I've been badly constipated for months, but none of the doctors I saw seemed to think this was in any way related to the neurological symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I feel shooting dull aches in my forearms and wrists that radiate out through my ring finger... The way I would expect carpal tunnel might feel.\u00a0\u00a0Also, sometimes I feel like I need to push when urinating.I recognize that these are all vague symptoms that I can fairly easily live with, but they have persisted for months, and have shown no signs of improvement (they have in fact worsened).\u00a0\u00a0I hate going back to the doctor because every time he says that it's harmless and I should ignore it.\u00a0\u00a0However, it's my body, and I truly feel something is wrong.\u00a0\u00a0I would greatly appreciate any advice on what ideas I could discuss with my doctor on my next visit.Thanks very much!",
