            "answer": "Hi!To stop the vaginal itch, you will have to find the cause and treat it. Vaginal itching may be due to chemical irritants (such as detergents, fabric softeners, feminine sprays, ointments, creams, douches, and contraceptive foams or jellies), drop in estrogen, pin worms and stress. Vaginal yeast infection which can be brought about by antibiotics, birth control pills, pregnancy, menstruation, condom use, sexual intercourse, diabetes, and a weakened immune system, can cause vaginal itch. Also, vaginitis can be caused by other infections, including sexually transmitted diseases. Have this checked by your gynecologist for proper evaluation. Diagnostic tests including culture and microscopic exam of vaginal discharge, PAP smear and urine and blood studies (including hormone levels) may be done to help with the diagnosis. Take care!",
