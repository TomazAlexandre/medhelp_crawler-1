            "answer": "Hello. Thank you for your question.Often times, patients may feel lightheaded or dizzy after standing. This is often due to a drop in blood pressure, not a rise in blood pressure. This is called orthostatic hypotension. Patients with this issue should be evaluated with orthostatic vital signs in their physician's office. Here, pulse and blood pressure are measured in 3 positions. Laying flat, sitting up, and standing up. Abnormal orthostatic vital signs occur when the pulse goes up by 10 beats per minutes (bpm) or blood pressure drops by 20 mmHg with any of these positional changes.Patient's with burning pain in their legs may have an neuropathy. Most common cause is due to diabetes, but there are many other causes. Often times, patients only notice them with laying down before bed because there isn't any distracting stimuli. Evaluations for causes of neuropathy are best made by a patient's primary care physician or neurologist.Very Respectfully,Dr. S",
