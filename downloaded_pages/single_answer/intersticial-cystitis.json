    "question": "I pee all the time, and I have had a specialist test me and they did do an outpatient surgery on my bladder to enlarge it which helped a lot but my grandma has intersticial cysitis and I have all sorts of other things going on. MY QUESTION is could this be related to my other problems I have done research and seen the link between fibromyalgia, and diabetes. I have lost about 8 lbs in the last 3 months. I also have scoliosis which also causes me other pain, so I wonder what is really going on and if I can get some free answers. I am not insured.",
