    "question": "I had bloodwork done in the beginning of August. When the results came back there were 2 concerns. My doctor told me that one of my liver enzymes was elevated. It's normal range is 35-65 or so she said and mine was at 68. She informed me that my thyroid was slowing down. She couldn't give an answer why. She said it was nothing to worry about right now. I'm only 28 years old. I'm in good health. I don't have high bloodpressure or diabetes. I am overweight I weigh 255lbs. I want to know if I should be concerned since she wasn't and if I should look for a new doctor who can give me the answers I need?",
