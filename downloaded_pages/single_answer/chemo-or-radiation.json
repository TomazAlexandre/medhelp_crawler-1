            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0The appropriateness of chemotherapy or radiation therapy would depend on what stage your mother's tumor is in, as well as your mother's \"performance status\".\u00a0\u00a0Performance status refers to how strong your mother's body is, and how well her body can withstand the effects of treatment.\u00a0\u00a0If your mother has a lot of other chronic illnesses, like heart disease, kidney disease or diabetes, these could all have a negative impact on her performance status.\u00a0\u00a0If you can give some additional information regarding her stage and chronic illnesses, I may be able to give a clear answer as to which is the better treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Offhand, chemotherapy which is placed directly into her bladder (called intravesical chemotherapy) may have lesser adverse effects on other nearby organs (e.g. the gastrointestinal tract) than radiation, but whether or not the treatment will be effective will depend on the stage of the tumor, as I have said earlier.",
