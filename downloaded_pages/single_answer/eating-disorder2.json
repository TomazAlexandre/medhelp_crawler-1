            "answer": "Hi!If you are gaining weight, and follow a modeling career, then naturally you are perturbed. Instead of trying all types of dieting, it is best to find the cause of weight gain.When one is overweight and knows this and wants to reduce then the pattern of eating you face is common. It is not uncommon to be depressed, not eat for periods of time and then go for binge eating.What you need to do is eliminate the common causes of increase in weight such as overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. Anemia, low proteins, adrenal gland problems, kidney and liver problems and Cushing Syndrome has to be eliminated. Late night snacking and poor sleep patterns too cause weight gain. Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain. Polycystic ovary too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out by an ultrasound of abdomen.If the above causes are eliminated then you can join a weight trainer and a nutrition expert and follow their advice and lose weight under their guidance.Take up yoga, deep breathing exercise, walking and remain strong and determined in your effort to do away with this habit. Music and aerobics are also good stress busters. Also the diet should contain more of green leafy vegetables, fruits and protein and less of spaghetti, potato etc.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 19 year old female, 173cm, 58kg and this is the heaviest I've been in my life, and I never really had an ed. When I started modeling they asked me to loose around 1 or 2cm in my hips which I did and then I bounced back around 6cm. I am very obsessed with losing weight, even if I'm trying to fight it every day. Some days I don't eat almost anything, others I binge, and others I'm a normal person. I'm afraid this feeling will never go away, even if I stop modelling, and I don't even know if it's an eating desorder, is it?",
