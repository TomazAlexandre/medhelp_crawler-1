    "question": "Dear Dr. Lupo:In Oct. 2008, I was diagnosed with hypothyroidsim (TSH over 4 and free T3 and free T4 low normal).\u00a0\u00a0One of my symptoms if erectile dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0I am 43, exercise often, not overweight, and eat a balanced diet.\u00a0\u00a0My mother and her mother are hypothyroid and both take Synthroid.In Oct. 08, I was started on 30 mg of Armour Thyroid, zinc, selenium, and aloe vera juice injested.\u00a0\u00a0I was later put on iodine.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed no results until I saw a new doctor who doubled the Armour to 60 mg in March 09, and dropped the rest.\u00a0\u00a0Five days later, my ED improved for about 7-9 days, after which it returned.Yet, at that time my TSH was 0.95 and my free T3 and free T4 were normal.\u00a0\u00a0In my latest test, my TSH was 1.35, free T3 was high, and free T4 normal.Since the Armour increase, I cannot sleep until after midnight only sleep about 5-6 hours at best.\u00a0\u00a0My energy is high.\u00a0\u00a0I have also lost weight and it does not seem to be exercise or diet related.I have been checked for the ability to metabolize very long chain fatty acids and that is normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have been checked for thyroid antibodies and that is normal.\u00a0\u00a0My total cholesteroal is consistently below 150. I have been tested for diabetes and that is normal.I have done the adrenal injection test three times where they take a blood-level of cortisol, inject something, wait an hour, and then take the cortisol again.\u00a0\u00a0 My doctor claims that he is not seeing the rise in cortisol that is normal, yet\u00a0\u00a0all the other tests that he has run on my adrenals have comeback normal.\u00a0\u00a0I did take Rhinocort AQ for six years, sometimes two to three times daily.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if that has had affected my throid and/or adrenals.I am quite frustrated.Do you have any recommendations?Am I now hyperthyroid or showing some of its symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Might I have nodules? Should I return to the 30 mg ofArmour? Should I drop the Armour and try Synthroid?Sincerely,lfcoutreach",
