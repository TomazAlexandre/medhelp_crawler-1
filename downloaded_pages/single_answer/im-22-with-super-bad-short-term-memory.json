            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. The memory loss could just be due to concussion which at times persists for years and all of a sudden disappears and the person remembers everything. This does not have any long term complications. The person just needs support from family members and has to learn to live with the memory loss. This would involve learning to cope with memory loss, finding new ways to remember things, improving concentration, keeping the brain active, eating healthy and exercising.Post traumatic stress, anxiety, work or study related stress, improper sleep, anemia, low vitamin B12, metabolic disorders like diabetes etc can also worsen the memory. Hence, these aspects should be looked into. A neuropsychiatric consultation along with complete evaluation of the type of memory loss will help work out a plan best suited to help the individual.Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I've always had kind of perfect memory in general,like in high school and varsity etc. I never really had problems with memory until recently. I forget the most simple things! Like I would sit and think I have to do \"this\" quickly and I get up and immediately and completely forget what it is I want to do and I've noticed it for a while now. I don't drink(well accept for occasional partying),I don't smoke and I'm not on any type of medication. I do however suffer from migraines from time to time but that's that. So I tried to figure out what has caused this and I can only think of my sister's wedding in which I was maid of honour 7 months ago, it was quite stressful and at the end of the day I was exhausted and had not even been drinking.I guess I stress a lot aswell,I get very anxious and I also once slipped on the wet floor in the kitchen and bumped my head pretty hard which resulted in an instant migraine. I don't understand why I have memory lapses and its pretty bad, I can't even state an incident I just know I have them. What do I do? I feel like I'm losing my mind :(",
