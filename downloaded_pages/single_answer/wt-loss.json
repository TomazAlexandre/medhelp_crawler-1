            "answer": "Hello,Your wife should try to lose weight in a scientific way for long term benefits. A slow and steady approach will be helpful. Drink lots of water every day. Drinking water helps you feel full and also flushes out fluid from your kidneys, which may reduce bloating. Avoid eating salty fast foods, candies and cut down on at least 500 calories per day. Avoid intake of hidden calories in salad dressings, cheese, butter etc.Include fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean meats and fish. Consume fruits rich in vitamin C as it is a fat burner. Get a diet chart made from a nutritionist. Indulge in brisk walking or jogging. This will help in burning calories faster. Avoid lift and prefer walking the stairs whenever possible. Increased weight can cause heart problems, joint problems and increases your risk of acquiring diabetes mellitus. Keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",
