    "question": "I am in a lawsuit with a car insurance company and I live in an area that doctors do not like to have to deal with lawsuits from car insurances because they do not want to go to court.\u00a0\u00a0This has caused me to be misdiagnosed and almost cost my life.\u00a0\u00a0The accident was in April of '02, due to me not having hypertension, no diabetes, never smoked or drank and was 39 years old at the time.\u00a0\u00a0After the impact from the impact of my chest with the steering wheel in which it broke off,\u00a0\u00a0I immediately began to have chest pains.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors said that it could not be my heart.\u00a0\u00a0I described my symptoms which where my chest felt like it was going to blow up, my arms and hands would go numbed, and throb terribly, I would feel faint and would have to lean over until the pain in my chest and arms would lift.\u00a0\u00a0It scared me all day.\u00a0\u00a0I would go to the emergency room weekly with the discomforts and would be sent home after a night stay.\u00a0\u00a0They would immediately give me aspirin, and nitroglycerin sprays and yes the pain would lift but come back.\u00a0\u00a0After 15 months of going to hospital, cardiologists, orthopedic surgeon, chiropractors, physical therapy, I began to have a heart attack at 1 am July of '03 and my husband rushed me to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I told them not to give me any medication until the EKG was given, at that time they did as I asked and the EKG had shown some problems and I told them that I want a stress test and heart cath before I go home this time and it was done.\u00a0\u00a0I was unable to get through 21/2 minutes without pain and the EKG and blood pressure rising to a scary level.\u00a0\u00a0They now began to believe that I was not making things up.\u00a0\u00a0I was given an emergency heart cath and found at that time a 95% blockage in the left ventricle and was told I should have been dead.\u00a0\u00a0I then was sent to another hospital to put the stent in but they could not due to this hospital finding two more blockages of 85% and 90%.\u00a0\u00a0I had to have an emergency triple bypass surgery due to doctors in my area not diagnosing the problem correctly.\u00a0\u00a0From this accident I am still have chest spasms, heart artery spasm, angina, chest pressures and tightening, breast numbness, and chest pain.\u00a0\u00a0I am on 3 high blood pressure meds, pain med to help control pain to keep my blood pressure down.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that the blood pressure is there due to the chronic pain in my chest and sternum pain, not because I have it.\u00a0\u00a0I still have no diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have been researching for the last five years about this impact and it connecting to my heart problems. The doctors are now realizing that the accident has caused me more problems than they once believed and that the accident could have cause all of my heart and health issues.\u00a0\u00a0Could you tell what would you say about the connection to my heart problems and steering wheel impact?",
