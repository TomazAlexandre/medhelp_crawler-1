            "answer": "The top illness contenders for your cat are: hyperthyroid, diabetes, kidney disease, and cancer.Please have the blood tests performed because hyperthyroid and diabetes are highly treatable.\u00a0\u00a0Even with kidney disease or cancer he could still have a good quality of life for awhile with appropriate treatment.Many veterinarians offer a reduced price for a senior profile which includes a CBC, Chemistry, Thyroid test, and urinalysis.\u00a0\u00a0These tests would determine function for the kidneys, liver, bladder, blood production, whether your cat is anemic, or has thyroid disease, or has diabetes, and more.",

    "question": "My cat is about 12 years old and he's always been a very large cat, both in overall structure, and weight.\u00a0\u00a0Not obese, but far from skinny.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway....the past coupla years he's gotten very, very skinny.\u00a0\u00a0I've never detected any worms, although I've went ahead and treated him for them anyway.\u00a0\u00a0He's strictly and indoor cat.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't act like he feels bad or anything.\u00a0\u00a0Acts normal and wants to eat all the time, which he's always been a food begger.\u00a0\u00a0Occassionally he vomits, but sometimes it's just hairballs, I think, as he has very long hair and doesn't groom himself well, so he gets matts, which I try my best to keep up on.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just worried this may be worms or his thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just not sure.\u00a0\u00a0I can't afford an array of expensive tests.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any suggestions?Greatly appreciated,Chris",
