    "question": "I have a 10 and 1/2 Yorkie Maltese. She has been a very healthy 10-11 pound dog until June 2013.\u00a0\u00a0She started drinking water like crazy, losing her footing, and just didn't seem like herself.\u00a0\u00a0I took her to the vets, but it wasn't til the second time that the diabetes showed up.\u00a0\u00a0I think I noticed the change in her sooner than her blood! That's how close we are...She was peeing in the house.\u00a0\u00a0I knew she knew better.\u00a0\u00a0I could see it on her face.\u00a0\u00a0She was so sad that she did it. I knew she didn't mean to. I knew she wasn't feeling right. So, the diabetes...I thought, phew! we can do this.2 weeks later...pancreaitis.\u00a0\u00a0severe pain. I couldn't stand seeing it.\u00a0\u00a0She's on opiates. She doesn't walk anymore, bark at the mailman, I have to carry her everywhere...How do I know when I'm being selfish?? This is just horrible. Is pancreaitis recoverable??? I cant get a straight answer from the vet.",
