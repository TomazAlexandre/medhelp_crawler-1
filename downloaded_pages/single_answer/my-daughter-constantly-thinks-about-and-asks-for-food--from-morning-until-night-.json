Have you tried increasing her physical activities, such as dancing, zumba, and sports? Increasing daily activities (be consistent) will help toning up her body and decrease the inches. Thank you for your question.",

    "question": "My daughter is 11 years old and since she was a toddler she has been obsessed with food. We don't eat out, I cook from scratch, I don't buy junk, and we're physically active. I have had her thyroid and metabolism tested. I've had her tested for diabetes and insulin resistance, I've taken her to a nutritionist, who told me everything I'm already doing, I've tried charts, tracking, weight watchers, counselor, and the last thing was a psychiatrist who just prescribed zoloft (which I'm not willing to give her). She loves to dress cutsie...and it's impossible to find clothes that look cute. She's a women's size 12/14 and her feet are so fat I can't find shoes that fit. I'm at a loss. I need help and don't know where to turn.",
