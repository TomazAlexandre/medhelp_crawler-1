            "answer": "I also suffered with underactive thyroid & currently take 300mcg prior pregnancy they reduced it to 250mcg.. When I found out I was pregnant my GP requested urgent bloods to routinely check my thyroid as your levels can change due to baby taking everything. My levels were completely off the scale & for this reason I was classed as high risk of having a miscarriage. It's only if your thyroid is not controlled it poses a risk, I was urgently seen by the endocrinologist in the combined pregnancy clinic that week & was monitored throughout my pregnancy. I'm currently 36+4 & have been discharged because it has been stable throughout. Baby appears very healthy. I would ask them to recheck it now you know your pregnant & you should be seeing the consultant so they can monitor you. I was also told due to my thyroid I had an increase risk of gestational diabetes but luckily that was negative. Regardless I believe you should be closely monitored by the combined pregnancy clinic so the endocrinologist can keep an eye on you.",

    "question": "Hi everyone. I'm 29 years old and fell pregnant with my first child at the end of last year. Sadly I moscarried at 12 weeks in Sep 16. Since then we have been trying to conceive and I have just dropped on! I am 5 weeks today and petrified that I am going to loose this child too! Since my miscarriage I read about underactive thyroid causing issues in pregnancy such as increased risk of miscarriage and still birth and difficulty conceiving. I have had an underactive thyroid hypothyroidism since birth and I have been taking 150mg of thyroxine medication all my life. My Nurse checked my T4 count a fews weeks ago and said all was fine before I knew I was pregnant. I'm hoping for some advice on what I'm looking for in healthy blood results and similar positive stories to try stay positive! Thanks in advance!",
