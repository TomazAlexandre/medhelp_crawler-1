            "answer": "You mentioned taking herbs for diabetes, are you a diabetic? Have you been monitoring your blood sugar levels? Frequent urination and dry mouth are classic signs of diabetes. As far as the dry lips, do you breathe through your mouth when you run? You may not notice it, but breathing through the mouth rather than through the nose will dry out your lips fast. The skin on the lips is very thin and fragile. Try using Caramex when ever you notice the dryness. It will heal the chapped and shredded lips in a few days to a week if used several times a day.(use the little pot, not the tube. It's a beezwax base and will stay on your lips longer)You can find it at any Walgreen's for around $2.\u00a0\u00a0And drink plenty of water, even if it makes you pee more. That's how you flush impurities out of your body. But really it sounds like most of your symptoms are diabetes. Get checked out to make sure your keeping your sugar levels under control.",

    "question": "Original post:I have recently been going through a number of tests to get to the bottom of my symptoms. I would say for years now I have noticed a difference in bowel movements, weight loss, fatigue, when I would stand and yawn i would feel dizzy like i was about to fall over, i started to sweat alot and i mean alot. All of these things I kind of put off because they werent noticeable but for about 2 1/2 years now I have had the worst case of chapped lips. Around the time i turned 17 I use to get dry lips and white stuff around my lips when running and the only thing that could help me was if i chewed gum. That also lead to my skin on my bottom lip pealing off when i would finish. I would take a wash cloth and wipe the excess skin off no problem. Now when i turned 18 i started smoking and the problems continued but when i turned 19 I quit smoking because my lips were starting to get dryer and dryer which made me stop to see what would happen. Even using a warm cloth to wipe the skin didnt work, I would have some skin that peeled and other parts that didint, making it even worse in appearance. I went to see a dermatologists who prescribed me alclometasone dipropionate and later mometasone ointment that had no affect. I went to take a blood test for kidney, liver, urine analysis and these were the results that came back abnormal: ldl calculated 115.8, urea nitrogen (BUN) 7, protein total 8.7, globulin (calculated) 3.9, bilirubin, total 1.6, platelet count 132, protein trace, ur wbc 0-1 if you can tell me what that means I would appreciate it.I noticed my semen has become yellow and cloudy it also is very lucid as a liquid and turns cold as soon as it comes out. This prompted me to take std tests that all came back negative so its not from an std but the main problem is my bottom lip. the way the skin grows and the extra dryness and chapping of the lips are truly embarrassing.New Post:I have been taking some Chinese herbs for diabetes and 1 thing that has happened is my blood has been circulating extremely better. I can tell because when I lift weights I feel my arms get tighter but it doesn't constrict my veins to the point I have to stop as was the problem before. My kidney seemed to improve because I do not go to the bathroom as frequent as I use to. It seemed every time I would drink especially water with in 20-60 minutes I would urinate. I seem to have been feeling better, my nails are not as brittle although they are still kind of hard everything has improved except the MAIN PROBLEM! my lips (bottom lip especially) has been still very chapped when hard and when soft very damaged and peeling. No matter what state its in hard or soft its a problem. Im leaning toward Sjogren's for 1 because when I brush my teeth I have to wet the tooth paste a few times to get it started because there isnt enough saliva\u00a0\u00a0to do it on\u00a0\u00a0its own also I have a hole in my back tooth which came out of nowhere but i believe its due to dryness of mouth. Now I know you gave me a list of problems so what do you believe could be the problem due to every thing stated here? I appreciate the feed back thanks doc...",
