            "answer": "Dear Rossi,The use of coumadin or aspirin for the treatment\u00a0\u00a0atrial fibrillation is to prevent stroke. If a person is under the age of 65 with a structurally normal heart,\u00a0\u00a0no history of hypertension, diabetes, prior stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIA) or heart failure they would be considered low risk for stroke and treatment with 325mg of aspirin would be reasonable. However all other patients should be treated with coumadin if bleeding risks are not a major concern. If a person is in atrial fibrillation, he/she should be on a medication such as a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker for rate control. If one is on an adequate medication regimen and followed closely by a doctor, exercise should be fine.Thanks for your question,CCF-MD-KE",
