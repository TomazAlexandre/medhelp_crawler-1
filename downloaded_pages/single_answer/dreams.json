            "answer": "Hi there. Dreams arise from Rapid Eye Movement REM sleep in which brain is as active as it is when the body is awake. You need to be evaluated for bipolar disorder or diabetes, since both can cause vivid dreams, anti depressants, sleep medications; over the counter drugs all can interrupt REM sleep and affect body\u2019s ability to separate dreams from waking perception. The various causes of strange vivid dreams can be anxiety and stress, spicy foods, fat content of the food, alcohol and drugs like antidepressants, barbiturates, narcotics, ketamine, an anesthetic, illness like flu, sleep disorders like apnea and narcolepsy, all can increase the frequency of bad dreams and nightmares. Consult a neurologist and a sleep therapist for intervention and a detailed sleep study after avoiding the factors like foods and stress. Take care.",
