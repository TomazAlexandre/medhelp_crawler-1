            "answer": "Hi!The symptoms could also be due to anxiety. The numbing pain can also be due to a boil or infection. Contact dermatitis due to coming in touch with spoon, glass, food, tooth brush, plastics, toothpaste etc could be another cause.\u00a0\u00a0Low calcium and hypoparathyroidism could be the other causes. Vit B and iron deficiency too should be looked into. Undiagnosed diabetes could be another possibility. Dehydration and electrolyte (sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium) imbalance too could be a cause. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss this with your doctor. A few blood tests to rule out the above mentioned conditions may be needed.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",
