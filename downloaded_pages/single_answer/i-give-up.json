            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are two possibilities which should be seriously considered if anemia, hypothyroidism and diabetes are ruled out. One is a sleep disorder to be confirmed by sleep studies and the other is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).\u00a0\u00a0You may sleep for 10 hours and not get up refreshed. cfs usually presents with widespread myalgia and arthralgia, headaches, chronic mental and physical exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, concentration difficulty and memory problems.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Hope this helps. Take care!",
