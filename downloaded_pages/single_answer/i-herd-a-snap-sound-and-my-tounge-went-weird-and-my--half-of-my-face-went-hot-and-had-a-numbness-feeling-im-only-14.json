            "answer": "Hello,There are many possibilities for these type of symptoms. Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness are called parasthesias and are usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. Parasthesias are common metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism.Other possibilities are multiple sclerosis(an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination.It can be diagnosed by MRI brain and MRS of the brain.),TIA(a temporary loss of blood flow due to partial blockage of the arteries supplying the brain) and stroke(permanent loss of blood flow).They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Another possibility is of Neurofibromatosis2 which is a tumor on a nerve. This disease most often affects teenagers or young adults.Trigeminal neuralgia can also cause such kind of symptoms.In my opinion,you need a complete neurological examination along with blood tests and CT,MRI and EEG brain.For that pls persuade your mother to take you to a neurologist.Hope it helps.If you have any additional queries,then pls post us.Take care and regards.",
