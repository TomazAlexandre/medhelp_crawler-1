    "question": "my tounge has small white worm type growths coming out of it and they continue to multiply. I have tried to shave them off my tounge with a razor and have pulled hundreds of them out with tweezers. some of them are up to 3/8 inches long. They are very strong and are sometimes hard to pull out. I have congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease, diabetes, and hypertension, I continue to brush my teeth & tounge several times a day and rinse with hydrogen peroxide and listereen. What can I do to end this pain and agony?This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/421019\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/421019</a>.",
