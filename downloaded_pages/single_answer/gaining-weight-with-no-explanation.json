    "question": "I am 23 yo 460lb. Sounds scary I know. I have has several doctors in the past who have not even attempted to assit with a diagnosis. All they did was blood work and send me on my way. In the past year I have found a dr who is willing to help and even accepted on testing me for stuff I have researched on. I keep gaining weight and so far the only the diagnosis to come out of it is the diabetes,I have not had a period in 2.5 years, there is fluid in my legs, but I do not have congestive heart failure. All my blood tests have came back normal, my organs are in great health lungs,kidneys, heart all. I am actually a healthy adult, I like walking,and just being out doors. I do have acute asthma but its not bc of the weight gain had a dr say it was due to the smoking. I have some small bone structure.Most of the weight is in the mid section and my back. I have been tested for cusings syndrome but the test came back negative.They are currently testing me for polysistic ovarian syndome so far they cant find the ovaries. There is no fluid in my body except my legs. My thyroids are even considered fine per dr.I am at wits end and afraid its going to send me into depression, Last week end I was playing and rolling down hills with my lil cousins and there is\u00a0\u00a0just to much I have to live for. I have tried diets, changed eating habits even though I have been told by drs I dont eat enough. It is not due to overeating and as i was once told my a former pcp even though it is hereditary i should weigh as much. I am considering the lap band but dont want to do the surgery if it is something else. I am asking for some advice bc it has gone unexplained for to long and Im not ready to give up just need a push in the right direction.",
