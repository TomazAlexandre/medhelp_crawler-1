            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis).Other conditions cause itchy skin as well. Skin conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "Anyone experienced all over invisible itch? It's all over my body and has been going on for over 6 months (but had been off and on for three years). I've done steroid treatment when hives have erupted but most of the time it's an invisible skin itch. It's so bad that I scratch places raw. I've been tested for common food allergies but they all came back positive. Antihistamines do very little. I don't think it is allergies because I take a daily allergy pill, nasal steroid, and do daily sinus rinses. Those allergens shouldn't stand a chance.I've been to a dermatologist who told me to take Zantac as an alternative type of antihistamine.I've been told it's just stress and it will go away.I've been told that it's seasonal allergies. This is the season with fewest allergies and it's still raging.Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.",
