            "answer": "Hello,Various reasons for recurrent or persistent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Treatment resistance can be overcome by applying a cream with a combination of antifungals (Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1% and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%).However for this abdominal tenderness, you have to get it checked from a dermatologist and get any shingles ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

Joint pains which have subsided and i barely notice them.Now I have had for a month jock itch which turned into skin tears on my thigh folds. I was given fulcanozle that helped but its still there. I have been told to keep putting on the ointment and I am doing that for another week and see what happens.I have also seen at my abdomen when I try to stretch my skin it hurts like its torn from the inside it just at my abdomen and on top of my cheeks no rash or anything? Is it normal?",
