            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!In all probability the symptoms are due to menopause. You need to get complete hormonal assessment to know which hormone is causing the problem. Also you need to get the thyroid and diabetes checked. Blood pressure should also be monitored. You need a complete gynecological check up regarding this.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do discuss these possibilities you\u2019re your doctor. Correct diagnosis and treatment will swing your life back to normal. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

I sweat so bad during the night that Im not getting enough sleep. I take naps through out the day. I was just put on a hormone medication called Andriol, Im also taking Effexor XR 150 mg. I have been put through a stress test and told I passed with flying colors. I have had a heart monitor on three times ow and it never fails that when the monitor is on that I dont have these spells.
