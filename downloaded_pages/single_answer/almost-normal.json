            "answer": "An increase in the medication is reasonable but most research suggests that people don't feel much different with a TSH of 1.9 vs 0.5, but it is worth a try.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to avoid over-medication and a significant low TSH (ie <0.2 for most otherwise healthy young patients).The next step would be to try a combination of T4 and T3 -- ie, add cytomel to the synthroid -- remember, the dose of synthroid must be decreased to make room for the cytomel (T3).\u00a0\u00a0Research suggests this is not superior to T4 alone but many patients feel better with the combination.Weight gain of 20-25# is the average after treatment for Graves -- this is b/c the hyperthyroidism makes people lose weight inappropriately so this weight is gained back and often some more in addition, depending on the hypothyroidism treatment timing.\u00a0\u00a0The amount you have gained is somewhat unusual and I would imagine that there are other factors -- ?family history of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Careful attention to eating/drinking habbits and regular exercise (eventual goal of 5 hours/week) are the cornerstone for weight -- in thyroid patients and non-thyroid patients.You have had many other tests it seems, so there is not likely another disease in the background.Hope these comments help, from a hypothyroid treatment standpoint, would look into T4/T3 combo therapy -- it's not for everyone, but may be worth a try.(ps -- I think you already spoke with my office mgr)",

    "question": "Diag Graves in May 05, RAI Aug 05.\u00a0\u00a0Just had 1st blood work that is close to normal. TSH 1.928, 6 wks ago is was 3.8 on 150mcgs of synthroid, (0.350-5.500), FT4 1.46 (0.61-1.76), FT3 3 (2.3-4.2).\u00a0\u00a0Taking 162 mcg of Synthroid. I am feeling better than several months ago, but can't seem to tackle the final hurdle of feeling normal and able to live normal life.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what to do besides beg my Dr. (family prac.) to increase the synthroid another 12 mcg and see if that does it.\u00a0\u00a0I am 31, gained 65-70 lbs over the last 2 years and I am either exercising on a good day or in bed on a bad day.\u00a0\u00a0I have been an athlete my entire life and I don't have enough energy or stamina to workout everyday and If I my walk is 2 or more miles...it takes days to recover to barely function.I don't know what to do and I refuse to accept that I will feel like this the rest of my life.\u00a0\u00a0I want children, but the thought of being pregnant and taking care of them is so exhausting.\u00a0\u00a0I have had every blood test imaginable in the last year and nothing else seems to be wrong w/ me.\u00a0\u00a0I live in Kansas but I am about ready to hop on a plane and come and see you.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have the strength to \"will\" myself thru another year of feeling like ****.\u00a0\u00a0It's been 3 years since the symptoms originally started.What can I do to finally kick the symptoms and get back to my life?\u00a0\u00a0Are you taking patients?",
