            "answer": "Dear ali_jaber:Flu is a viral infection caused by influenza virus. With reinfection and/or flu vaccines, you are more likely to recover faster this time around.Severity of the flu may range from mild to severe, depending on risk factors such as age (older than 65 y.o. and younger children), pregnant women, and certain chronic medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease.If it is mild, the symptoms are similar to the common cold. Most people will recover from the flu in a few days or within 1 - 2 weeks after infection. However, complications, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus and ear infections, may occur, especially in people with risk factors. Make sure you seek medical attention if you are not feeling better.It is important for you to get plenty of rest and treat the flu symptoms accordingly. However, it is difficult for me to recommend medication without knowing what symptoms you are trying to treat.Symptoms may include:1. temperature of 101\u00b0F or above2. cough and sore throat3. muscle ache4. headache5. chills6. tiredness7. stomach symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhea may occur, often more common in children than adults.Panadol Cold & Flu has several products. I don't know which one you are taking, since there are Cold & Flu Day, Cold & Flu Night, and Cold & Flu All in One. They all have paracetamol (to treat pain and fever) and phenylephrine (a decongestant). Make sure you take the medication accordingly to what is recommended and NOT to exceed max dose. Do not consume alcohol with paracetamol, for you may be at risk for liver damage.Please read the drug label and ask your pharmacist and physician if you have additional questions.
