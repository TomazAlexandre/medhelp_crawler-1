            "answer": "You need to see a urologist who specializes in sexual dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0I worked for a group of urologists for years, and the ones who had an interest in helping men with these problems were much more helpful to patients than those who specialized in other areas of urology.\u00a0\u00a0One way to find this out would be to call a urologist's office during business hours (I always ask if I'm talking to the office or the answering service, just to make sure I'm not asking the wrong person a personal question!) and ask if they have a urologist who specializes in sexual dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0If they don't, ask if they know of a urologist in your area that does.\u00a0\u00a0If the receptionist has worked there long, she should know things like that, and it should be a very normal question.Then hopefully your insurance is accepted by that MD.You're young - find out what's going on so you'll know what your options are.",

    "question": "Hi again, think I posted under wrong topic last time. Well, here is the deal...I am now fairly certain I have penile nerve damage. My original post is here:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/661231I recently had blood and urine tests confirming what I already thought - fine and healthy. No diabetes, infections, liver problems etc. Which leads me to believe it is penile nerve damage.I am a 16 year-old male, and I am very, very healthy. I am hairy and growing quite quickly, voice has dropped - well into puberty. Nevertheless, I cannot ejaculate when conscious. I have very rare nocturnal emissions, but when I try to masturbate, I can NEVER cause myself to come, and never have.I get an erection, but it's not always great. In fact, masturbating gives me very little sensation at all - I do it because I know I should be driven to, not because I am actually driven to. I have little to no penile sesitivity.Furthermore, on the glans of the penis are little clear-white patches. I don't know whether thats normal or not. Could be dried up urine, dried up semen or skin growth, who knows, just thought I should chuck that in.It was the family doctor I checked in with, and even though I should have, I didn't bring up the whole urological problems, for obvious reasons, just got the tests done. I am sure you are going to say I have to go back into the doctor about them, which I shall, but I am just wondering before hand... Assuming it is penile nerve damage, just for an overview, is there any treatment for it, and if so what is likely to be given to me? Also, is there anything I can do in the meantime to help? Is there anyway I am ever going to be able to overcome impotence?Any help is appreciated.Thanks so much!",
