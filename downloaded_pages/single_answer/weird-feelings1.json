    "question": "i was diagnosed with diabetes in1997. Controlling it with diet only.I do not remember exactly when, but maybe about 4-5 years back I had my teeth removed and was given upper dentures which has changed the whole outlook of my face and since then I have been feeling weird. My head feels weird, sometimes i am ok, This is weird, but suppose if i walk with my feet dragging i feel that buzzy feeling in my body. Feeling tired all the times. Eyes feel like they are crossed when I look at a person. I am 46 and this all started happening after my dentures. Can anybody explain this",
