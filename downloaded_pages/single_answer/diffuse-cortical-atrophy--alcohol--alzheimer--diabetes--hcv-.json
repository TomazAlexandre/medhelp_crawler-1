    "question": "I\u2019m 59 years old, male, Portuguese. A week ago in a routine CAT I found the following result (my best attempt to translate into English in an accurate way):\u201cThe encephalic appreciation shows diffusely enlarged spaces sulcus-cisternal, without notorious asymmetries, but constituting a pattern of diffuse cortical atrophy, of cerebral predominance although also attaining in the cerebellum vermian sulcus and superior cerebellum hemispheric. There are not relevant focal asymmetries, namely there are not signals of subdural hematoma\u201d.Since I was not suspecting of anything, without any symptoms, and did the CAT only because I insisted with my doctor because a friend of mine died a year ago with cerebral cancer, now I\u2019m very concerned with these unexpected CT findings.Due to my profession, I still develop an intense intellectual work, as a consultant engineer.Eight years ago I got the HCV, but I recovered by myself and the virus disappeared completely. I consume alcohol (wine, beer, whiskey) may be a little bit more than the acceptable amount, but there are periods that I stop drinking, for a month or two.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t smoke. I\u2019m a pre-diabetic \u2013 I control my diabetes only with exercise. My mother was 78 years old when she died 6 years ago with the Parkinson disease.As soon as possible I will speak to my doctor, but I would appreciate very much if you could tell me what this may mean. Is it an indication of Alzheimer disease? Shall I stop drinking alcohol definitively? May it have a relationship with my mild diabetes or be a consequence of my HCV episode?Many thanks for your help",
