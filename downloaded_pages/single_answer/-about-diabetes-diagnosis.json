The A1c has been the gold standard for diagnosing diabetes since its recommendation in 1976.\"I don't want my daily readings to be high constantly \"This really is in your hands. Medication can only do so much. If the patient ignores the disease, the methods to control it, lives an mismanaged lifestyle it only worsens the degree of the disease.Get a home glucose meter and test1. When you first awake in the morning and not had anything to eat nor colored liquids for 8-10 hours prior. No late night snacking either.2. Before each meal to get a baseline measurement.3. Two to three hours after a meal to see how the foods you ate affect your glucose. You should be less than 180 mg/dl, some doctors want less than 140 mg/dl. If you go over, avoid those foods.\"to find out in a few years that i've got some irreversible damage due to high levels not treated.\"Do the aforementioned home testing along with proper nutrition, weight control and daily exercise. These all play a huge role in controlling your glucose [blood sugar] levels.Most important is to talk with your doctor if you have other health issues going on, taking other medication, and have undo stress in your life.",

    "question": "I have PCOS which affects my body in all sorts of ways, I've been on Metformin for a few years now to help keep things in line a little and hopefully help with blood sugar issues.\u00a0\u00a0I recently had another 3 hr GTT which i failed on all levels..my a1c the doctor said was 'ok' (i didn't have my followup appt yet to get the exact #)..so he recommended so far to just continue the met as is. My question is, when I was seeing an endocrinologist years ago for fertility issues and we went through all of this she told me that the a1c is not to be used as a way to diagnosis diabetes, that we will always use your fbs and gtt results to medicate..hence the insulin with my gestational diabetes...is that still the same? I don't want my daily readings to be high constantly but the met to be 'helping' that out just to find out in a few years that i've got some irreversible damage due to high levels not treated.\u00a0\u00a0I'd appreciate all your insight on this! Thank you!",
