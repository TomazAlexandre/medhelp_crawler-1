            "answer": "Hello,Such crawling movement on tip of penis can be due to an allergic reaction (say to body lotions, condoms, soaps etc) or it can be a skin condition like eczema, dermatitis etc or it can be a fungal infection. Other than that it can be a simple bacterial infection or balanitis or parasthesia skin. If you are sexually active get a complete STD panel done. Otherwise get your blood sugar levels and vitamin B 12 levels also done as diabetes and vitamin B 12 deficiency can also cause such crawling sensations.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
