            "answer": "Hi!It depends on the appliance. Treadmills, exercise bicycles etc can cause weight loss. However, for this you must be physically fit to exercise that much and have no heart disease, anemia, high blood pressure, diabetes or hypothyroidism which can either prevent you from exercising or may make weight loss difficult.However various belts and other such appliance should not be used as they can cause more harm than good. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
