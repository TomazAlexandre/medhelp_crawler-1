            "answer": "Hi,These symptoms could be due to a migraine variant. Migraines can occur with or without headaches characterized by dizziness, photophobia, and tingling numbness. Alternately it could be peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or thyroid dysfunction causing easy fatigability, tingling and dizziness. This requires further evaluation. I would suggest you to consult your GP about it and undergo a clinical evaluation.",

    "question": "Hi guys.. I need help from you all.. I have been experiencing tingling sensation most of the time when I cross my legs, it gets a funny tingling feeling which is unbearable that I feel it's very irritating. The funny tingling feeling gets better when i uncross my legs. I have never ever experienced this kind of irritating feeling before in my life while crossing my feets.. It's been hindering me for the past few months and I hope to find a stop to this nonsense =(. I tried vitamins b6, b12 and vitamins e to solve my solutions, but none of them worked. I also tend to yawn a lot, and also unable to take certain brightness in my vision. I have some dizzy spells and fatigue, but as soon I as take a nap or sleep it gets better. I hope to get some advise from smart people like you all. Thanks!",
