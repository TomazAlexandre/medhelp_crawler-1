            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. This wet and cold sensation is due to the affected nerves secondary to nerve compression in the back, chronic endocrinopathies like diabetes mellitus, which can affect nerve function, immune mediated neuropathy, and deficiency of vitamin B deficiency, which preserves normal nerve function. Consult a neurologist for a complete evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0MRI scan of the spine, blood tests like glycosylated hemoglobin, vitamin b complex levels and immune panel may be required. Management would depend on the diagnosis. Wishing you all the best.",
