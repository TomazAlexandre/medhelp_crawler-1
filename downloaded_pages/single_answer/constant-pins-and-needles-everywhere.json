            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. The sensations of sleeping foot, sleeping hands and legs (or numbness as some may describe it as), pins and tingling (needles) or paresthesia are generally due to peripheral neuropathies or vascular pathologies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies like deep vein thrombosis have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. There are several causes for peripheral neuropathies including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Nerve conduction studies should be done along with blood tests for above mentioned disorders. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis is another possibility but less likely in your case.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "So for the past 3 months I have gotten pins and needles on and off. Mostly in my hands and feet. At first I thought it was guillian barre syndrome or MS ( I am a major hypochondriac). I called an ambulance and physician did a neurological exam and said it was \"excellent results\" and said it was probably anxiety. Does anyone have this as well?",
