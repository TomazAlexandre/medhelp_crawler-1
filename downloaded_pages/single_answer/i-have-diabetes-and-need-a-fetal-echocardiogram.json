They only sent me to a specialist last time before my miscarriage because my a1c was 10.3 but it way better this time. I guess just ask lots of questions or call ahead and ask questions",

    "question": "I went to the Dr. this past Mon.. Since I'm a diabetic- not taking insulin, just a pill, my specialist is sending me to get a fetal echocardiogram. She said she didn't see anything abnormal, she just sends ALL of her diabetes patients to have 1, is this normal? Has anyone had 1 and is this really routine? TY",
