            "answer": "I am not a doctor, but, I would say that if your heart is healthy and structurally normal, I doubt if the faster rate will do too much damage. Of course, having a faster heart rate does make it work harder, but, if you do not have high blood pressure and your blood fats are within normal range, I would say you do not have too much to worry about. Your rate is a wee bit high, but, some folks have one higher and live normal lives.Have you asked your physician this, he/she would be better qualified to give you a definate answer and put your mind at ease, plus, if he/she knows your entire history, then the doctor will be able to tell you for sure what to worry about and what not too. :)Hope this helps, and for now, try not to worry, I would say it will be fine.",
