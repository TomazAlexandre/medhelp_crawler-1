    "question": "So this is a strange problem that I have been trying to fix but cannot. My general practitioner doesnt know nor seem to care how to fix it.So my skin tastes like marijuana, but I do not smoke nor ever have smoked pot. I know that it can happen if you do smoke pot chronically, but I have never touched the stuff. It started about 5 months ago. Basically it happens when my girlfriend and I have having sex, if she kisses or sucks any part of my skin her breath tastes and smells very strong of weed. I can smell it on her breath from across the room and if I kiss her after then I can taste it in my mouth very intensly. Now it started out just as a faint taste and is gradually getting very strong. Its at the point already that it is affecting my sex life, we dont have as much sex because its such a problem. Just yesturday she just sucked my stomach to test it for a couple seconds and her breath was so bad and when I kissed her for just one second to see if it taste... I almost gagged it was so strong.So my diet has not changed at all, I've put a lot of thought into that. I dont smoke pot or cigaretts, I rarely drink. I've tried changing my shampoo, soap, deoderant, perfume. Tried these pills called \"body mints\" and they didnt work. I'm not on any medication. The only thing I can think of is that a year ago I lost 10lbs in less then a week and have not been able to gain it back. I am currently 112lbs loosing about a pound every couple months, but for the past 7 years I have always been 120 at the lightest, and I dont have an explination for that.I am desperate for some answers and possible things I can do to help this problem. I have a friend that has some experience in the medical feild that is trying to help me, but she doesnt know much. My doctor is not helping me, just blew the problem off completely. Soon I am going to a new doctor because its really taking its toll on me and I need to figure it out.",
