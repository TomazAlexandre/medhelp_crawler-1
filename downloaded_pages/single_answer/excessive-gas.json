    "question": "I have been diagnose with type 2 diabetes since 2009.\u00a0\u00a0I take 500mg 2x day of Metformin. My Dr. watches this\u00a0\u00a0by doing an A1C every 3 to 6 mos. & I have always been under 7.0 as is his bottom line for me. My question is I have had excessive gas for some time & it is truly embarrassing as I don't seem to have any control over this.\u00a0\u00a0Could the Metformin cause this?",
