            "answer": "Although I am not a doctor, it sounds like you are OK for now.\u00a0\u00a0Your blood sugars seem to be in normal range and your doctor has given you the \"OK\".\u00a0\u00a0I understand that with your history, you are naturally concerned and keeping a close eye on yourself. That is good because if you do develop diabetes, you will catch it when it first appears and be able to get it under control quickly.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, don't drive yourself crazy waiting for it to happen becasue that will just get in the way of you\u00a0\u00a0enjoying your life today. It certainly doesn't hurt to start developing healthy habits; eating healthy,exercising and taking good care of yourself in general.\u00a0\u00a0Should you become a diabetic someday, you will already have good habits.In the meantime, tiredness and weight gain could be a result of getting older, a slowed down metabolism, or just plain working too hard and eating on the run.\u00a0\u00a0Once you have gotten the OK from your doctor, as you have, it may be time to relax and take a look at your lifestyle to see if there are changes you might make that might help you feel better. Goodluck to you.ES",

    "question": "I am not a diabetic, but have a family history of it, my mom,uncle, grandmother, and great grandmother have it and we are American Indians.\u00a0\u00a0Lately I have been extremely tired, hungry after eating a full meal, weight gain, and have starting checking my blood sugar, not always consistant.\u00a0\u00a0I can wake up in the morning after not eating sometimes for 10-12 hours and have a bg reading of 109-121.\u00a0\u00a0At bedtime it has been as high as 149.\u00a0\u00a0During the day I have checked here and there and it is usually around 110-129.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor says this is fine and has checked me for anemia and checked my thyroid, tests came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0He ordered the oral glucose tolerance test where I had to drink the orange drink after fasting.\u00a0\u00a0Have not yet got the results.\u00a0\u00a0I checked myself that morning out of curiosity at around 7:00 and it was 121, I am sure it dropped before my blood was drawn at 9:10. During the test I felt aweful, almost got sick and could have fell asleep, I am sure this is normal.\u00a0\u00a0I just was not sure what normal bg readings should be for non diabetics and if I need to worry.",
