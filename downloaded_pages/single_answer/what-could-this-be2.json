            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms can be due to hypoglycemia or low blood sugar, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalance, gastric reflux, low or high blood pressure, or due to peripheral neuropathies, vitamin B12 deficiency, pinched cervical spinal nerves or a combination of these.You will need blood tests, and probably nerve conduction studies to rule these out.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
