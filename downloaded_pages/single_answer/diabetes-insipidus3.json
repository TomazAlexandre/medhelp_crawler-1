            "answer": "Hi,This is usually for Diabetes questions but I can answer your general endocrine question as well.Damage to the pituitary during surgery can lead to loss of many hormones, so you may be lacking several. If your urination is not well controlled on your current dose of desmopressin and/or you are having trouble keeping up with your urine output, you should speak with your Endocrinologist right away. Becoming dehydrated is a serious possiblity if you cannot keep up with your water loss.The diabetes insipidus may be the casue of frequent weight fluctuations if related to your water balance, But you may also have thyroid imbalances as well as adrenal /cortisol deficiencies that can contribute. From your note it seems as though you are not doing very well,so I strongly suggest speaking with your doctor soon about your desmopressin doses as well as your other concerns. It can be a tough road after pituitary surgery but hang in there. It does get better with good medical management.Take care.",
