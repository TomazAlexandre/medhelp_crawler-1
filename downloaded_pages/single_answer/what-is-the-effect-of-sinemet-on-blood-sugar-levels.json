Ask your doctor before you change your diet or the dose of your diabetes medicine.\"-- but nothing about it causing levels to actually be effected.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless- it's important to be in touch with your doctor about the changes you have seen since starting to take the medication.\u00a0\u00a0It's certainly something that you don't want to over look!",

    "question": "I started taking Sinemet about 3 months ago and my blood sugar levels, insulin resistance are all over the map.\u00a0\u00a0In the morning I fight to get my BSs down and now, in the afternoon, I often have BS crashes into severe hypo territory.\u00a0\u00a0I've been to the emergency twice these past two weeks - a week ago Friday with hyper, ketones and this last Friday with a severe hypo with 5 units still active!!!\u00a0\u00a0Apparently, the Sinemet and Parkinson's mess up the hormone releases in the circadian rhythm, especially norepinephrine and cortisol, both of which increase glucose levels.",
