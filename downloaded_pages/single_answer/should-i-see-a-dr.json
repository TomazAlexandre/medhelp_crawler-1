            "answer": "Hello,These symptoms can be due to a UTI or interstitial cystitis. The cause of most UTIs is bacteria that initially settle (colonise) around the urethra (urine tube), and then ascend into the rest of the urinary tract. Factors that can cause this to happen include incomplete urinary emptying, hygiene of the urethra, prostate inflammation, urethra narrowing, bladder reflux disease (usually due to leaky valves between the bladder and ureter tubes that connect to the kidneys and diabetes etc.You should consult a urologist and get it evaluated.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 43 yr old woman, I've had a child (he's 15), and a hysterectomy about 4 yrs ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have noticed over the past year or so that when I urinate, I have to wait a few minutes as I often have a little bit more- my bladder doesn't empty fully all in one go.\u00a0\u00a0If I don't wait, I often just end up feeling like I need to pee again, especially after wiping.\u00a0\u00a0I've been living with this, it isn't a big deal, I just give myself extra time when I go.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that yesterday (and once 2 days ago) I had significant discomfort in my urether (sp?) just before I needed to go.\u00a0\u00a0It got fairly intense as I tried to relax and start the stream.\u00a0\u00a0It helped to push my fingers into my lower belly, just above the pubic bone and lift a little?!?\u00a0\u00a0It took a little to get started, but was ok after a moment.\u00a0\u00a0The pain was also present if I had to pass gas, or if I needed to have a bowel movement. I've increased my fluid intake, added pure cranberry juice - today hurts less when I go, but there a more persistant dull ache.\u00a0\u00a0No other symptoms - no cloudy or smelly urine, no blood, no increased need to go.\u00a0\u00a0I did have back pain yesterday, but it is gone today so I think it is just coincidental (I often have back aches).\u00a0\u00a0My question is are these symptoms sounding at all like a UTI? A kidney stone? A prolapse?\u00a0\u00a0Or just something that we 40+ women get to look forward to :-)\u00a0\u00a0Should I be seeing a doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
