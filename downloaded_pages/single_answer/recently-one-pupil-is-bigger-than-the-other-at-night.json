    "question": "Recently ive noticed one of my pupils is larger than the other. this usually occurs late at night and when im tired. When it is at its largest incomparison to the other i feel really dizzy and feel like im about to fall over. During the day my pupils seem to be really small but of similar size.Ive also recently been having pains in my chest and panic attacks. I had a resting ecg and this was okay, just waiting back on the 24hr ecg results. But i feel its more in my head than my chest as ive been having really bad headaches, and pressure accross the bridge of my nose. I took a trip to the optitions and they told me my eyesight is fine and that i do not need glasses.I am now really worried, as i feel dizzy everyday, and periods where im walking for quite a while i feel as though im about to fall over to the righthand side and feel extremely dizzy. sometimes it feels like its a stuggle to walk and i have to force my body to keep moving. the same thing occasionally occurs with my speech, i can still speak but i have a feeling as if my body is forcing me not to speak.Along with these symptoms, my eyes have been of a really dark yellow which i think has something to do with gilberts syndrome that i have but it seems worse than usual, i have little energy, my skin is bruising more easily, especially on my legs, i have ringing in my ears, occasionally have blurred vision, especially if i eat and walk at the same time my vision moves up and down, theres also like a clicking/sucking noise behind my right eye, this only happens again late at night when im tired etc.Any ideas on what these things could be? i have been feeling unwell now for 8 weeks, and havnt really got anywhere with the appointments at the doctors. its starting to really worry me.",
