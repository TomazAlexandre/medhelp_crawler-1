            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, your body does react abnormally to cold stimulus. This could be due to underlying hypothyroidism or diabetes. Hence first consult your doctor and run blood tests to rule these out.Another thing that may help is go back and see whether you ate something common on these episodes. It could be possible that there is an associated food allergy.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "When I'm sleeping, and my foot or arm or stomach or anything is sticking out of the covers, they get warmer or colder. When this happens, I recieve an incredible attack of abdominal pain. Then I have the urge to use the restroom. The first time this happened ( a few years ago) I thought i just really needed to go. But now I know that the cold is key. When I use the restroom, I suddenly have diarhhea, and I'll be in there for thirty minutes or more. A few minutes into it I start to shake very severly. I put towels over myself now to keep myself warm, because if i dont, as i learned from the first few times, I will throw up all night long. This occurs almost every other day. I try to keep myself warm but sometimes there's just no stopping it. Why do i have this reaction to uneven body temperature when most everyone i know says they dont?",
