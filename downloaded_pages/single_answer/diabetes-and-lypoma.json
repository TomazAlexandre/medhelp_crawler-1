    "question": "I'm suffering through diabetes since close to 3 years. Also I have a number of lypomas in my body (arm, chest, stomach & back). I'm suffering through sleep disorders and through muscle pain (in my neck, shoulder & lower back). My diabetes is not very high and I'm not taking insulin. I'm not sure that my muscle pain and the sleep disorders are due to diabetes or due to lypoma. Are these two related to each other. Please let me know.",
