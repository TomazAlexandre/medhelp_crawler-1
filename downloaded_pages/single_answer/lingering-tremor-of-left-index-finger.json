            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.Your numbness symptoms could be related to diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, Vitamin B complex deficiency, neurological disorder or if you are any vibration jobs (like drilling etc). Nerve studies and nerve test may be helpful to further evaluate the condition. I would recommend evaluating the possibilities here with the help of a doctor. Further referral to a neurologist or endocrinologist may be required to assess the condition. Hope this information proves helpful to you.Take Care & Regards!!!",

    "question": "I'm not sure how to categorise this. For the last four or so weeks I have been noticing a tremor in the index finger of my left hand. At first I thought that it was related to nervousness but has occurred when I am calm and not using my hands for anything. I have also had some minor aches in my legs over the last two weeks including a cramp in my left leg during the night. I don't know if the two are related but I am really worried about the finger tremor as it hasn't gone away on its own or in a reasonable time frame. I am a T2 diabetic but have never heard of it affecting people in this way. The tremor is without pain although I feel a slight numbness.",
