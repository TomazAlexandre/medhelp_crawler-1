    "question": "I had just been hospitalized due to left side weakness...I had numerious of test done and still need more...I am a diabetic and has been for 24 years, I am on the insulin pump and knock on wood been doing wonderful with my diabetes....I had an MRI done that shows, I have problems from the starting of my neck all the way down my spine, the nerougist is concern with the neck area because the MRI shows something is pressing on the spinal cord...The Dr's are not filling me in with too much details, it's follow up with this dr and take these medicine...My question is, now that I know I have issues in my neck and back, can my spinal cord issues cause me to go paralized eventually? I am praying it will be something they can correct but i am so lost right now...Thank you for any feedbacks. Kim",
