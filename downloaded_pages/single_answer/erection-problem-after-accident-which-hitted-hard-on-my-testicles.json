            "answer": "Hello,Erectile dysfunction in your case can be due to trauma to the genitalia. I suggest you to consult a urologist and get an ultrasound scrotum and penis done. You may also need to get a NCV (nerve conduction velocity) test done if the problem continues. Other than that, other causes also need to be ruled out. . The causes are many like diabetes, depression, autonomic nervous system problem, excessive alcohol ingestion or tobacco smoking etc.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
