            "answer": "I am not a doctor, only a volunteer who has diabetes, so please understand that my answers are not based on any medical knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0I think having any chronic illness, and diabetes certainly qualifies for that, can cause depression in some people.\u00a0\u00a0When first diagnosed, it can be very difficult to accept that you have an illness that you will have probably for the rest of your life.\u00a0\u00a0As time goes on, for some it may get easier, but for others the realization of how much effort it takes to manage diabetes every day and that even with all the effort, you are not always successful, can cause further depression.\u00a0\u00a0For others, depression is a part of their chemical make-up and really has nothing to do with having diabetes except that it is one more chronic problem they have to deal with. Neither depresion nor diabetes are easy to manage or live with.Fortunately there are new and effective medicines for both illnesses. Your question is a good one and certainly should be asked of your endocrinologist and the person prescribing meds for the depression.\u00a0\u00a0There are medicines that could impact your blood sugars and that is definitely something your doctor would be able to tell you about.\u00a0\u00a0There are many differnt drugs for treating depression and your doctor should be able to find one that works for you with minimal impact on the effectiveness of your insulin and other medications.Again, I don't know the medical impact of STDs on insulin or other drugs.\u00a0\u00a0That is another good question for the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that those STDs which are viral can affect blood sugars when there is a flare up, just like any virus will.\u00a0\u00a0I guess what strikes me most about your question is how very stressful and difficult it must be to live with what sounds like three chronic illnesses...diabetes, depression and an uncurable STD.\u00a0\u00a0The diabetes alone could cause some depression.\u00a0\u00a0This is a lot for anyone to deal with.\u00a0\u00a0I would encourage you to get all your questions answered by your physician, but also to get yourself some support, either in a group or individually.\u00a0\u00a0Having had diabetes for nearly 40 years, I know that going through difficult times becuase of your health can be very depressing and demoralizing, but going through all of this alone can be unbearable. There are lots of people out there who can really empathize and understand what you are going through and you certainly deserve some support.\u00a0\u00a0I know that the medical issues, although difficult, can be worked out.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you are able to find the support you need to address the other issues.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you well,Es",
