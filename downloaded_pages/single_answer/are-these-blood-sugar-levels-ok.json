    "question": "I am a 45 year old woman, i exercise 5/6 days a week and am of average weight for my height. I have noticed recently when exercising i am experiencing numbness in my toes and cramp, also a couple of times my feet feel like they are burning and painful. I was advised by a friend to test my blood sugar levels so I tested myself yesterday and this morning. My results were 11.0 early evening about an hour after dinner and then a couple of hours later 11.2. Before I went to bed it was 7.3 and then this morning I did a test after fasting over night and it was 7.1. Is there a correlation between these results and my feet etc? (I did have gestational diabetes controlled with Insulin injections in 1989)",
