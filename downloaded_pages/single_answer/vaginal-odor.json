            "answer": "Hi there and welcome.\u00a0\u00a0Well, YES.\u00a0\u00a0You should always be properly diagnosed before taking an antibiotic.Couple of things come to mind.\u00a0\u00a0You say you had this smell when pregnant and that was the last time (amazing you can remember back that far to identify the smell)---\u00a0\u00a0could this be hormonally related?\u00a0\u00a0As we get into our 40's, our hormones do change.\u00a0\u00a0That could change our smell.\u00a0\u00a0We also can sometimes not have as great of pelvic floor muscles and urine can leak (which is also common during pregnancy).\u00a0\u00a0Typically yeast infections not only have a bit of an odor but also have a thick discharge and itching along with it.\u00a0\u00a0and it is said that sometimes what we can eat can affect our bodily smells for sure.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can change the smell of our urine and could cause this situation as well.In truth, I think you should see about going to the doctor for a proper diagnosis of this.\u00a0\u00a0While it may feel a little embarrassing, it is best to get to the root of the problem.\u00a0\u00a0wishing you lots of luck dear",

    "question": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 44.\u00a0\u00a0About a week ago, I started getting this unusual odor 'down there'.\u00a0\u00a0It's the same smell I had when I was pregnant 17 yrs. ago--& haven't had that since then--until now.\u00a0\u00a0It's not fishy or real bad, just unusual.\u00a0\u00a0 No itching, burning, pain, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I take a shower every morning & wash using feminine wash as usual.\u00a0\u00a0I notice this smell even at work while sitting at my desk, so I'm worried everyone else may notice.\u00a0\u00a0I've taken 5 days of Bactrim (I know, I should ask a Dr. first)\u00a0\u00a0that I had here in case I have an infection.\u00a0\u00a0So far, it's not working.\u00a0\u00a0Could it just be a simple yeast infection?\u00a0\u00a0I bought the 3 Day Monistat yesterday hoping that may help!\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks for any advice.\u00a0\u00a0(ps:\u00a0\u00a0this may be a long shot, but I had been eating garlic chips, garlic crackers, salsa daily, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I buy anything that says garlic or jalapeno.....)\u00a0\u00a0 I just want this gone and be back to normal\u00a0\u00a0!!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0:-(",
