            "answer": "I'm not sure if diabetes can cause mood changes to this extremity when the medications for it aren't taken as prescribed but given the severity of diabetes when medications aren't taken as prescribe that can be dangerous. Also if things worsen with potential age onset dementia, forgetfulness (including to take medications) irritability, mood swings and what appears to be irrational behavior can easily occur. The best thing to do would be to follow up with a gerontologist to see what the cause is and what medications should be adjusted. As well there are specific medications for dementia such as Namenda that can be given within a doctor's discretion if they believe that is the cause and that treatment is appropriate.",

    "question": "Do any of you have bipolar disorder and also diabetes?The reason I'm asking is, if yes, do you find that your moods are more variable day to day when you 1.) don't take your diabetes medication and/or 2.) when your blood sugar is high/eating is off?My Dad, who is now 85, was diagnosed with probable dementia and possible bipolar disorder in February. For decades, we've suspected he's bipolar and also may have a personality disorder (narcisstic personality). He lives out of the country (still refuses to move back) and now says he is only sometimes taking his diabetes pills (as well as his blood pressure and heart pills.)His moods the past month or so seem to vary more than ever before. One day he whines (sounds like a 10-year-old) and is very needy, wants my help, etc. ; the next day he is on top of the world--having \"business\" meetings, etc. His moods now change a lot within the course of a day, too.We're wondering, is it the diabetes? Is his bipolar problem getting worse? Is his dementia getting worse? Is he sleep deprived some days and that's making all of the above worse?Any ideas or thoughts?Thanks for your help,Yvette",
