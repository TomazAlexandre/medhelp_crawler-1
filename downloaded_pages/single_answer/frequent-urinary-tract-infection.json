This makes it a great environment for all types of infections to reproduce. Diabetics, especially those that are not as controlled as they should be often have a greater incident of UTIs and other infections. They are also more difficult to treat.Amoxicillin and Amoxiclav are not the exact same drug though they are very similar and have many of the same actions.

    "question": "My mom who is 75 years old has diabetes but is not insulin dependent. Lately she's been complaining of pain on her lower abdomen. She just had her bloodsugar checked and it shows 227mg/dl. and she has urinary tract infection based on her urinalysis. Is it really usual for diabetics to be prone to that kind of infection? She's had it quite a number of times in the past. Is amoxicillin and co amoxiclav the same? what proper dosage should be taken for this type of infection?Thank you very much for your advise.msnone",
