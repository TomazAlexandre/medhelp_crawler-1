            "answer": "Hi,I understand your concern regarding your blood pressure. I recommend that you have regular daily BP monitoring and have diet modification. If your BP reading reaches 160/100, this warrants further evaluation. Target goal for patients with no co-morbid conditions such as diabetes or kidney conditions is below 140/90. Other factors such as your medical history and symptoms are also important considerations. Check with your doctor also for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I had a physical about 4 months ago and they commented that my blood pressure was high, but not high enough for meds. Then a few days ago I had 130 over 90 for my pressure which is also high I was told. Someone online also showed me a chart where 140 over 90 was considered a normal high. At what point should I get concerned with my blood pressure?",
