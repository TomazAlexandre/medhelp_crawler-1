            "answer": "Hello,I will address to your symptoms one by one.Cold lower limbs while rest of body being warm can be due to stress and anxiety, Reynaud\u2019s disease(disorder that affects the flow of blood to the fingers and sometimes to the toes), diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis,peripheral vascular disease and underactive thyroid.So pls get yourself evaluated for that.Regarding your allergy to wheat,if you are allergic to wheat,then avoidance of even the constituents of wheat has to be done. Wheat contains thiamine (which is also found in Pork, beef, liver, legumes, nuts), riboflavin (also found in Milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, meat, leafy green vegetables), niacin (also in Meat, peanuts, legumes),iron(in Red meat, fish, poultry, shellfish, legumes, dried fruits) and folic acid in fortified wheat(also in Liver, green and leafy vegetables, lentils, oranges) in addition to carbohydrates and proteins.Frequent urination may be commonly found in diabetes or urinary tract infection(associated with burning micturition).Other causes may be drinking too much before bedtime, especially caffeine or alcohol ,prostate problems(in males) and bladder dysfunction.Pls get your blood sugar levels done.Also consult a physician and get these possibilities evaluated to reach a confirmatory diagnosis.Hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing if you have any additional queries.",
