            "answer": "Hi!Feeling cold patches can be due to hypothyroidism, liver diseases, low Vit B12,\u00a0\u00a0adrenal insufficiency, liver failure and as a side effect of some drugs. Of these vitamin B12 deficiency is the commonest cause. Low intrinsic factor in gut that hampers absorption of B12 and causes pernicious anemia is the commonest cause of low B12. If this is so then increasing intake of B12 will not help, and you will need to take Vitamin B12 injections at regular frequency as prescribed by your doctor. Other causes are parasites in the gut, diet poor in Vit B12, Crohn's disease, IBS, or poor metabolism by liver are the causes behind it. Please consult a doctor to rule these out. Take a diet rich in Vit B12 which should include meat and animal products, cheese, such as beef, liver, salmon, cod, and eggs. Take B12 supplements and breakfast cereals fortified with vitamin B12. Finding the cause is important.The other possibilities are diabetes, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, poor sleep, smoking, , severe anemia, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon and pinched cervical spinal nerve.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
