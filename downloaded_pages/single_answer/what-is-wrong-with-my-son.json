    "question": "I have a five year old son and I dont know what to do, he is always doing the craziest things (ex: if i tell him not to do something he will completely disobey me and do exactly what i said not to without knowing it.) Tonight i asked him to get out of the tub and he stood up and started playing in the water.It's like he pushes me to the edge and he doesn't even know he does it. It's not just me its his dad and my sister. I dont know what to do and i feel like im at the end of my rope. I have two kids and its really hard to explain what he does without showing but its frustrating\u00a0\u00a0me? I f i tell him no he will scream in my face or go to his room and kick his feet on the ground and scream at the top of his lungs for something small.\u00a0\u00a0Please dont think hes a brat cuz hes not they are raised to b well behaved and they are punished when they do wrong. I have asked about ADHD, and diabetes but get no answers. When i put food in front of him he will literally have his plate and drink gone within two minutes, and want more. Hes never full, or if he is hes being greedy. He will choke on his food from shoving so much in his mouth.That i have to tell him to spit it out until he chews. My family yells at me for not letting him eat until hes done, but if i do he wont stop until he is getting sick.When hes at school he does not listen unless i tell him every morning that he will be punished if he doesn't behave even than it dont work. Can u please help me i am afraid something is wrong with my son or i am doing something wrong. I can barely sleep at night because he gets up in the middle of the night to get into things and th fridge definetly. Sorry to bug but help....................................",
