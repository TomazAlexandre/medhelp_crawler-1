            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. White or cloudy urine is most commonly due to phosphaturia (phosphate in urine), which is a benign condition in which excess amorphous phosphate crystals form in urine. Phosphaturia is usually intermittent, occurring following a meal or after ingesting a large quantity of milk. Also cloudy urine can happen due to presence of protein in the urine. Some amount of protein is normally present in urine. But if it is present in excess then complete evaluation is required to find the cause and treat appropriately. The most common causes are nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, diabetes, exercise etc.White urine is sometimes due to pyuria (white blood cells) in association with an infection of the urinary tract or rarely due to chyluria (lymph fluid), resulting from a communication between the lymphatic system and the urinary tract. High urinary phosphorus occurs in primary hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, renal tubular acidosis, diuretic use and Fanconi\u2019s syndrome.Simple urine tests and correlation with the clinical symptoms should be able to clarify the problem. A 24 hour estimation of protein in urine would be a optimal test to detect proteinuria.Hope this information helps.Best.",

    "question": "Lately every morning i have been peeing in a transparent glass to find what looks like a whitish cloud that suspends and forms in it in the upper part after 15 or 20 minutes. I\u00b4ve taken several exams with respect to my urine and blood, but they have all come back NEGATIVE, a month ago one test showed negligible amounts of proteins were found and the doctor then advised me no to worry about it. I have no typical UTI symptoms and wonder if this is normal or if it is the herbs i take in the morning that are cleansing my kidney and showing up in the form of a cloud.",
