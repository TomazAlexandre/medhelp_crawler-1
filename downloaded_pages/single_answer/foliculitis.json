            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms are suggestive of folliculitis or boils. Folliculitis starts when hair follicles are damaged by friction from clothing or blockage of the follicle. In most cases of folliculitis, the damaged follicles are then infected with the bacteria Staphylococcus (staph).Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle. Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders. So please get your blood sugar evaluated.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

These bumps are not a typical acne type bump where it comes to a head, can be squeezed and heels.\u00a0\u00a0These bumps are bigger. do not come to a head, are extremely painful, and cause the entire area around them to become painful.\u00a0\u00a0The glands also swell.I was informed by a Dernatologist many years ago that this is caused by bacteria in the nose, and it is not curable.\u00a0\u00a0Anti biotics were prescribed and I have now been on and off of Doxycylcine for 10 years. The condition now seems to be more serious than ever, or I have developed an immunity to the anti biotic.Have there been any advance for the cure of this condition or the elimination of this strange bacteria that lives in the nose.TxMike",
