    "question": "Last Friday morning I was at the gym at 5am as usual. I was just about done working out and I started getting shakey and dizzy so I quit and went home. I called my roommate on the way and told him to get his blood checker machine out. As soon as I got in the house I checked my blood and it was 107. I checked it this morning when I got up it was 86. I checked it an hour after lunch and it was 92. Is this normal or low. When I have gone to the cardiologist on a few occasions the nurse pract. has mentioned if I had diabetes because most of my evcess weight is in my midsection and she said at my age (53) it could be a sign of diabetes. I had test done by the endocronologist and it was mentioned I might be borderline.",
