    "question": "I failed my 1 hr glucose with a 149 (range is up to 140) and I am borderline on my 3 hr Test. I had 1 out of 4 that were abnormal and one of the others was \"almost\" abnormal. Usually to diagnosis gestational diabetes they say you need 2 out of 4 abnormal, so I was very close to failing. I was so looking forward to an easy end ouf my pregnancy because I know this one will be my last :(Honestly, I shouldn't be that upset, because there are much worse complications. Our friends just had a baby at 28 weeks last week and my husband's cousin's child had an awful birth defect in which the espohagus wasn't connected to the stomach, so I guess I should be thankful that this can \"hopefully\" be treated by changing my diet.My glucose values with my other two pregnancies were 101 for my daughter and 119 for my son, so I almost knew immeadiately when I heard my 1 hour result that something was up! Are there any other women out there with gestational diabetes? I've started my low sugar/low carb diet and I'm hopeful I won't require medication since I'm borderline.",
