            "answer": "Nodules don't automatically equal cancer. It probably does mean that your liver has a lot of scarring. Sorry to be blunt, but if you continue drinking, your liver will stop functioning very soon. You already have end stage liver disease, so there are only 2 ways to go. Stop drinking and there is no set limit on your life expectancy, or keep drinking and watch yourself go down in a year.I was dx'd with end stage from alcohol over 3 years ago, but I stopped drinking immediately. I am healthy as can be even after having bleeds, ascites, the whole nine. My life expectancy is basically normal now, but I am lucky. I took the hint.Please write me if you want to chat. Take care.",
