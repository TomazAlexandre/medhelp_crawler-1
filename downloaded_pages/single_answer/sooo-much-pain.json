            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Pain at the lower end of left rib when you swallow can be due to hiatal hernia, severe acidity with gastric reflux or due to gas.If you have a severe burning sensation with constipation then you could be having anal fissures. Please consult a gastroenterologist (a rectum and colon disease specialist if possible) and you may need an enema to pass the stool. Fissures or prolapsed hemorrhoids if diagnosed would need to be treated.Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber and also due to dehydration. Diabetes and hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc can all cause constipation.A proper investigation is required preferably by a gastroenterologist (a doctor who looks after the digestive system) to know what is the cause. The treatment will follow correct diagnosis. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
