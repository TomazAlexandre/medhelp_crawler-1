    "question": "My left eye has a mature cataract. I can no longer read AT ALL with my naked left eye (which used to be -5.5 and no astimatism) but can still see around me though blurry. I can still negotiate my way around when walking if I close my good right eye (also -5.5) as I can still see objects around me with the left eye. I cannot read the opticians letters board with my left eye. Does this mean my cataract is VERY\u00a0\u00a0mature and so will be more risky to operate? I am going for surgery in a month's time and am rather worried about the risks.\u00a0\u00a0I am 63 and relatively healthy - no diabetes etc.Thank you.",
