            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that nat. It sounds like your dad is, to be honest, on a suicide mission. Blatantly ignoring his diabetes and doing all the WRONG things will lead him to diabetic complications which are very serious. And I'm sure he knows this, but does he care? If his drinking problem is serious this may have something to do with his ignoring other aspects of his health and that needs to be dealt with. But how likely is that? Bottom line, unfortunately, is it is very hard to help someone who doesn't want help. All you can really do is let him know you love him and care about him and are worried about his lack of attention to his diabetes. Also that diabetes is a manageable disease and does not mean a death sentence UNLESS you ignore it.By the way you posted on the Type One forum, not Type II.",

    "question": "My dad is 51 and about twelve months ago was diagnosed with type two diabetes; however he does not take any medication what so ever, he has also stopped going to see his doctor and has not gone for his recomended eye check up. He smokes and drinks quite a lot. He also craves things such as crisps and fizzy pop which I think will only make his health worse I am very worried about him and don\u2019t know what to do",
