            "answer": "Hello,These symptoms can be due to metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. Since the MRI spine and brain have come out normal, we need to do a NCV ( nerve conduction velocity) for ruling out any peripheral neuropathy as well.Please discuss these possibilities with your neurologist and get these investigations done. Keep on taking the prescribed medicines as suggested by your doctor.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
