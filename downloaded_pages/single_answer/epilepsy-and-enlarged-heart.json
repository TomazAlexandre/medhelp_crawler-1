            "answer": "Hello!Epilepsy if not managed appropriately can lead to serious cardiac dysfunction, though it is a rare occurrence. In addition, some epilepsy medications have potential cardiac complications, further adding complexity to the management of patients with epilepsy. Cardiovascular disease and treatments can precipitate new seizures or even affect the management of pre-existing epilepsy. Conditions like vasovagal syncope, prolonged QT interval can mimic seizures so extensive evaluation of both systems is essential for an accurate diagnosis of seizures. Conditions like diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders can all lead to enlarged heart. Weight loss/gain can be an effect of antiseizure medications also. Get a complete clinical evaluation done. That may be really helpful.Good luck!",
