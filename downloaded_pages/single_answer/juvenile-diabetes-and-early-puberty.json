            "answer": "Dear Munckinpie,We are volunteers here & not medical professionals, tho' we do have a lot of personal experience with Type 1 diabetes.In general, I recommend that we work with physicians who are both highly competent and also have a personality with which we feel comfortable.\u00a0\u00a0By comfortable, I mean, feeling safe to ask questions like 'why do you recommend/test for/do\u00a0\u00a0XXX?' or 'what does YYY mean?' and 'why not ZZZ?' without feeling intimidated or being spoken 'down' to.I Googled the phrase 'Diabetes Early Puberty' and found a few sites from medical schools around the country.\u00a0\u00a0Here's one that provides some information on 2-types of early puberty as well as the common tests done if a child has the symptoms:http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/uvahealth/peds_diabetes/prcopbty.cfmSince both you & your son are uncomfortable with the exams procedure, I recommend that you consider going to another pediatric endocrinologist in your area for a second opinion on the scope the quarterly exams.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, I highly recommend that you reach out to the JDRF chapter or branch nearest you, where you can compare notes with other parents of young children with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0(Visit the JDRF website at:\u00a0\u00a0http://www.jdrf.org) and click on the link to LOCATIONS (midway in the top horizontal bar of links).Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0It's very important that you have confidence in the medical care your son is receiving; since he expresses his own concerns, if he senses you are equally concerned, then he (or you!) may begin to avoid going to his appointments.\u00a0\u00a0If your concerns are quieted, or if you use a different physician, you'll be better able to ensure he gets the care he needs.",

    "question": "My son was diagnosed with diabetes when he was 3 (he is now 11).\u00a0\u00a0When we go to his appointments with his pediatric endocrinologist every three months, the doctor insists on quickly examining his testicles (looks and feels). My son is not particularily comfortable with this. What is the doctor looking for and is it normal for pediatric endocrinologists to check this every three months?\u00a0\u00a0Kids without diabetes don't have to go through this, how is this related to diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
