            "answer": "Hello,The spinal cord injury can be responsible for this burning sensation in the anus because burning sensation is mostly due to neurological causes. For such burning sensations parasthesia skin should also be ruled out. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, spinal causes, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the burning is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.I hope it helps. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
