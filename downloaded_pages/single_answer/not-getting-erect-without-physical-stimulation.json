            "answer": "Hello,It looks like erectile dysfunction to me which can be due to injury to nerves; lack of blood supply to penis; in certain diseases like diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol; neurological problems like parkinsonism ,multiple sclerosis; stress ,anxiety, depression; too much of alcohol ,smoking ;injury to pelvic area etc. I suggest you should avoid alcohol and smoking if you have habit. Do sensual exercises, get counseling and eat healthy food.I suggest you to consult a urologist and get all these causes ruled out.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "i've been feeling impotent for the past 3-4 days. in the run up to this i was getting frequent erections but i didn't masturbate and it was about a week like this before i had sex. i was fine during sex but towards the end i was struggling to stay hard. i think i might have pushed a little too hard from an awkward angle so i'm wondering if this could be because of strained ligament or is it something more serious? i'm not sure if i should be concerned as there is a strong history of diabetes in the family and this state of impotence has emerged out of nowhere. i can still get hard and ejaculate but i would have to stimulate myself physically whereas normally i could get hard quite easily without this. also being erect isn't as comfortable for some reason as before. any ideas what this could be and what i can do to fix it? i'm 27 years old btw.",
