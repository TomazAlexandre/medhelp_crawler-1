            "answer": "Hello,It is not clear from your question whether you mean bruises or wounds by sores. Anemia and deficiency of vitamins C, K, B12, or folic acid are the common causes of easy bruisability apart from other systemic causes. Ask your boyfriend to take iron tablets and multivitamins for some days and see if the symptoms improve. If they are wounds then delayed wound healing can occur in vitamin C and vit K deficiency,diabetes,p-rotein deficiency,immunocompromised states and if the person is taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
