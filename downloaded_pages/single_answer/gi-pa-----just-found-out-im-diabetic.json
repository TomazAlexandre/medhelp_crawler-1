    "question": "I really didn't need this added stress right now but I have to deal w/it. I was just wondering, well, first of all DR is going to try diet first rather than pills, exc. Do you think that this may have been part of what was making me sick? I know the abdominal probs were more than likely due to the HCV but the cold sweats, dizzy, loss of sight,exc, Diabetes? By the way my abdominal probs are pretty much under control, thank God! The Nexium and Miralax together is really helping a lot. Have you treated peeps w/ Diabetes and HCV before? Are there any added probs? Thanks again for advising me to get myself checked out for any other probs before I went on TX again. I checked out your web sites, they are great! How you find the energy Is beyond me:) Take care! God bless you, Kelly.",
