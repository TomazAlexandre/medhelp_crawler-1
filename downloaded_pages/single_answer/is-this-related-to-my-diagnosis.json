    "question": "i was recently diagnosed with a sever vitamin d defiency. so low that it can't be measured. i had a\u00a0\u00a0right colon resection due to crohns. anyway, since then, i will wake up in the mornings and i am starving. i am so hungry really all the time. it gets to the point of nausea and crankiness. i crave real food (ex roast and potatoes). i doesn't matter if i ate a huge dinner the night before like right before i go to bed. i have been tested for diabetes and they have come back ok. i have also been diagnosed with really low testosterone level(i am a 35 yr old woman). i have gained weight too. could all this be related to my vitamin d defienancy.",
