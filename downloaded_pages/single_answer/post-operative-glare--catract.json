            "answer": "Your father's condition is not unusual. It is more common in light complected, fair colored eyes (blue, gray, green). Also in those with large pupils. Over the years as a cataract develops it turns the clear lens of the eye into a yellow-brown marble. This cuts down the light falling on the retina (like an internal pair of sunglasses) and washes out color especially blue.After surgery much more light gets to the retina through the clear implant and glare (photophobia) is a problem for some, to others things look \"too blue\" for a while.Abnormal things within the eye that might cause this include cloudy membrane behind the IOL (why he had Yag capsulotomy, decentered IOL, inflammation within the eye, some macular problems. A good eye exam by a Eye MD (ophthalmologist) should exclude these.While this generally get better with times it remains a problem for others. Things that can be done to help the problem include a hat with a brim outdoors, sun glasses or sun goggles that go over regular glasses and wrap over the top and around the side of regular glasses or transition glasses that darken and lighten.I am less inclided to blame the diabetes and blood surgal levels.JCH MD Eye Physician & Surgeon\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ophthalmologist = Eye MD)",
