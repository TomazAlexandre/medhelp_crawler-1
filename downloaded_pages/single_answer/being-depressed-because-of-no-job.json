I want to work and make my OWN money so bad but it's like no one is hiring because I'm type 1 (plus I have nueropaathy in my right foot). My question is \"What jobs are available to me?\" I'm a little frustrated with searching and never getting a call back after interviews. I'm kind of tired of depending on my folks for money, I wanna get out there on my own. I'm not that disabled!!",
