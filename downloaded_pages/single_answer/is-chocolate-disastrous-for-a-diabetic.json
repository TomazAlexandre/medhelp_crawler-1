            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Not chocolate per se. However if you are talking about chocolate candies/bars or any form of sweetened chocolate then yes, you should avoid them if you have diabetes. These are high calorie things that increase the blood sugar levels. However you can add chocolate powder to milk with an artificial sweetener. Chocolates are also available in the market without the sugar and with artificial sweeteners.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
