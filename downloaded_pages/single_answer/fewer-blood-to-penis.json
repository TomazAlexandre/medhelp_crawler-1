    "question": "Hi guys,I've had bad breath and a worsening body odor ever since I got in college and started drinking heavily. In august last year, i tried\u00a0\u00a0a ' liver flush' to cure this. This makes you drink olive oil with grapefruitjuice to flush out gallbladder stones and 'liver stones'-which are not proven yet, but I was pretty desperate.I didn't drink enough laxative and got a stone stuck in small intestine. I've had it stuck there for three days until i massaged it out with a lot of olive oil. Ever since I woke up on the first day, my penis was like very stressed, I've never had this before. My feces were very smelly and gray ever since but this has been going beter, just like the penis. By now it's just like there's way less blood down below, 24/7. When it's flaccid, it's smaller and i can see veins and it's way harder to get an erection. I've had appointments with a urologist and an endocrinologist who knew nothing, and I'm planning on seeing a specialist for the intestines and liver..",
