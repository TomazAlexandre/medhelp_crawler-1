            "answer": "Hi!The MRI is suggestive of ischemic changes which are causing loss of white matter. These changes do not appear to be due to chronic vascular pathology like diabetes or hypertension, but appear to be more like changes caused by inflammation of blood vessels caused by diseases like lupus/Lyme or due to a demyelinating disease like MS.If MS is suspected, you may need a CSF study. Tests should be carried out to rule out an autoimmune process like lupus.Please discuss this with your doctor. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi all, I believe I've visited here before. I've been getting MRIs of the brain for the last two years my symptoms are all over the place, thinking maybe ms, lupus..my symptoms mimic so many things. My first MRI showed multiple lesions likely from a demeylemanting disease, second showed more, third showed more with a neo plasm that has grew in size a little..so for they just keep telling me do an MRI every 6 months, I'm in bed up ward of 20 hours a day, I am trying to force my self to do some exercise, just no energy and the littlest things wipe me out. I also have been suffering quite a bit of memory loss which right now is the most bothersome thing to me. I don't see the neuro till Oct and thinking I'll see a new one...don't know about all here, to be they seem like a different breed of doctor as in not very emphatic. If anyone could enlighten me of my results I would be so grateful and I wish you all the best this I know is all very frustrating.sorry I had to add report as photo, if I need to I can type it in, any help would be so appreciate,thank yougoosegal",
