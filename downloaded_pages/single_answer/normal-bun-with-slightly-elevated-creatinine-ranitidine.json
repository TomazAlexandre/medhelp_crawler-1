            "answer": "Hi there!While ranitidine may occasionally cause mildly elevated levels or creatinine, this is unlikely to be a permanent effect. Though at 1.45 the creatinine would still be in the normal range and unlikely to be associated with medical issues one may consider looking at urine creatinine/ BUN levels to be on the safer side. I would suggest discussing the situation in detail with your treating doctor.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I'm a 41 year old male, and i hit the weights hard 5 days a week. I also am on a fair amount of cardio exercise. I'm pretty muscular but i am not on steroids or protein powders. I am a white male with no diabetes and kidney problems do not run in my family.On a routine blood check, i realized my creatinine was slightly elevated at 1.45.i had my blood rechecked several times throughout an 8 month period, and was still getting the same numbers.I have done all my own research, i traced all my steps back to the medication i was on \"ranitidine\" and found out one of the side-effects , low-and-behold, was possibly slightly elevated creatinine serum.So i stopped taking the stomic acid reduction medication, and watched my numbers start to come back to normal. another blood test a few months down the road showed the previous numbers at 1.45. My BUN has always been normal.Could the medication i was on permanently put me at 1.45?",
