            "answer": "Hi!If you are hungry all the time and not gaining weight, then this could be due to worms in stool, diabetes or hyperthyroidism. These three causes need to be ruled out first. Blood tests to rule out diabetes and hyperthyroidism and stool test to rule out worms will be needed. Though a rare disorder, pancreatic insulinomas should also be thought of in your case and have someone check your blood sugar while you have an anxiety *** hunger attack. The hypoglycemia in this is transient and there is a quick increase in blood glucose once you eat.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
