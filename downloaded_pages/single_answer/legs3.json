            "answer": "Hello dear, welcome to medhelp forum. You need to discern whether your husband cannot move his legs due to pain or numbness. There could be many reasons for difficulty in moving legs and you will need to elaborate more details to narrow the diagnosis. These could be muscle cramps due to dyselectrolytemias particularly low serum potassium. Low sodium, calcium and magnesium also contribute. There could be a protective muscle spasm due to injury in legs. Disc prolapse, lumbar or even cervical can cause numbness and weakness of lower limbs making it difficult to move and could require urgent medical attention especially to rule out cervical disc issues. the physician needs to examine the legs, could be a circulation problem, any clot in leg veins due to chronic immobilization can make it difficult to move the legs and risk of thromboembolism. Rule out diabetes, varicose veins and any swelling in legs due to fluid retention in kidney and liver problems.My suggestion is to consult a physician soon and have him evaluate your husband.You are most welcome with any further speculations. Take care.",
