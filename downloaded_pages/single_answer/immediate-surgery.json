    "question": "Here is my only tests so far.\u00a0\u00a0My ENT says because I have had breast cancer twice he thinks I should have surgery and forget about FNA because of the nodule size.\u00a0\u00a0I never had chemo or radiation or tamoxifen after my breast cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Currently I only take insulin for my type 2 diabetes, low dose aspirin and fish oil.What other test do you suggest I have according to these results before I have thyroid surgery? I haven't even gotten in to see a Endo yet to test for secondary hypopituitary problems.HISTORY:65-year-old female with decreased thyroid function.FINDINGS:The right lobe of the thyroid gland measures 4.5 x 1.8 x 1.9 cm.In the inferior pole, there is a heterogeneous nodule, whichmeasures 3.4 x 1.1 x 2.4 cm. No additional nodules areidentified.The left lobe measures 3.0 x 1.2 x 1.1 cm. In the mid lobe,there is a subtle hypoechoic nodule, measuring 2.1 x 1.0 x 1.1cm.The isthmus is thin. There is a subcentimeter nodule notedslightly to the left of midline.IMPRESSION:Bilateral thyroid nodules, the largest in the right inferiorpole. These are nonspecific in appearance, and, depending onclinical suspicion, either short-interval followup to ensurestability versus percutaneous biopsy could be considered.Blood TestTSH\u00a0\u00a00.20\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 normal\u00a0\u00a0.34 \u2013 5.60FT4\u00a0\u00a0 0.77\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 normal\u00a0\u00a00.6 \u2013 1.6FT3\u00a0\u00a0 3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 normal\u00a0\u00a02.4 -\u00a0\u00a04.2",
