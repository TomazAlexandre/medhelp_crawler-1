    "question": "My daughter is a diabetic and is having trouble with her legs.\u00a0\u00a0They are swollen and the skin is red\u00a0\u00a0. They hurt her all the time.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor had a\u00a0\u00a0ultrasound done to determine\u00a0\u00a0if she has a blood clot in her legs but nothing showed up.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor says he doesn't know what is causing it.\u00a0\u00a0She\u00a0\u00a0has been taking\u00a0\u00a0a diuretic daily\u00a0\u00a0for some time and that doesn't help. The person who did the ultrasound said she has a lot of fluid retention in her legs.\u00a0\u00a0 Is it possible that she could have plebitis?\u00a0\u00a0 I understand that you cannot give a definitive diagnosis, but can you suggest any possiblities?",
