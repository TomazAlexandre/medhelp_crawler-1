    "question": "Hello everyone. About a week ago, I smoked marijuana everyday for 5 days. I am a 19 year old male. I had my left testicle surgically removed at age 8 due to a torsion. A thing about me after I smoke marijuana is that I feel numb all around my body, especially my testicle. Right now, I still don't feel that I have recovered the full sensation of my right testicle. I can feel the testicle when I touch it (some parts less than the other). However, I don't feel it hanging down like I used to. Might be all in my head, but might be not. I went to a GP, he said that the testicle looks fine, but that he would refer me to a urologist if I wanted him to. Anyone have any idea what's wrong with me?",
