            "answer": "Hi,As mentioned from the other post, asymmetrical sweating may indeed be due to a neurological problem which warrants evaluation by a neurologist who specializes in the neurophysiology of hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis can be be primary which can be triggered by different factors or may be due to secondary issues or conditions like diabetes, hypopituitarism, anxiety, and drug withdrawal.If it persists, it is best that you have this evaluated for proper diagnosis. Take care and do keep us posted.",
