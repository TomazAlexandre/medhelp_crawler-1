            "answer": "You need to sit down and explain all this to your boyfriend. My suggestion would be to move out and get your own place. They don't sound very supportive and are causing you too much stress which impacts not only you but your baby. It sounds like a very busy household and what you need is somewhere that is calm and peaceful so you have your own space. Good luck",

    "question": "I never know what is me being irrationally hormonal and what is real so I usually ignore it. Right now we are staying with my bf parents Bc his mom is a shopaholic and blows all their money and my bf pays the bills. They are all from Chicago and have a VERY straight forward/borderline rude additide, where as I'm from the country and keep to myself. So every time I start to get irritated his mom acts all flabbergasted and offended and blames the baby so nothing gets solved.My issue is, not only is there 6 people in this house (no room for a baby at all) but his mom drives me INSANE. She has diabetes and heart disease, eats horrifically, and blames any bad days on the fact that her 26 year old son isn't giving her attention. She is nosey and stands at the door to listing to our convos,knocks every hour to bug us, puts herself so far up his *** when we leave the room that I can't stand it, and she's rude to me. And on top of all of her stressing me out, my bf literally plays his game 15 hours a day...I want out! I want to leave, I want to blow up and be straight forward with them like they are and just leave...I'm so emotional I can't even think straight",
