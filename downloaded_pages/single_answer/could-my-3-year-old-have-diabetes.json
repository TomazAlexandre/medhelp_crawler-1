            "answer": "I'm sorry, no, that is not a normal level. Normal fasting blood sugars are under 100. I would definitely have your doctor check him. He might do an OGTT which is a test that sees his reaction to a sugary drink over a couple hours and an A1C (which is the current standard to diagnose diabetes) which is an average of blood sugars over a period of a couple months. 6.5 and over is diabetic. If he is diagnosed, it will change your lives, and there is a lot to learn, but it is a manageable condition and they are coming up with more new technology daily. If that happens send me a private message and I'll give you the name of a website where you can read info from other parents and chat with other parents. Good luck.Zoe",
