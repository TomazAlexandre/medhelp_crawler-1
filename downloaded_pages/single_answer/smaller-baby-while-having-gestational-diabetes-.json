            "answer": "Are you controlling your diabetes better now than you did in the last pregnancy? Eating better? exercising? etc? That will make the baby WNL. But, 7 LBS 12OZS is not a big baby. Thats \"average\" size. You controling your diabetes will help the baby to be smaller but healthier. Every pregnancy is different. Every child/fetus is different. Do not base your childs health/sized on your first childs health/size. They will never be the same. Don't worry, the pregnancy sounds absolutely, wonderfully, right. If you feel that everything is ok, then it probably is. Trust your gut and your doctor.",
