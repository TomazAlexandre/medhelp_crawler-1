            "answer": "Hi.TSH of 6.5 would be too high, particularly if you have symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Most endo's would treat at this level.\u00a0\u00a0The old range was up to 5.5.\u00a0\u00a0New range is up to 3.5.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless your TSH is high (though not terribly high).\u00a0\u00a0Apparently most people feel best with a TSH of between 1 and 2.\u00a0\u00a0Some doctors however choose not to treat unless levels are significantly high.Worst case, you should be monitoring regularly.\u00a0\u00a0Repeat test in 6 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0If still high then consider treatment.You need to ask your doctor specifically about treating this.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment is thyroid hormone.\u00a0\u00a0It is just 1 small pill a day.\u00a0\u00a0Considering\u00a0\u00a0you have other things going on, I'd think it's important to make sure that thyroid is optimal.\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroid increases risk factor for heart disease (along with your high cholesterol AND diabetes), so I would think that you should treat this.In meantime read up on hypothyroid and see if any symptoms ring a bell.... you might feel surprisingly better if this is appropriately treated.Best wishes.",
