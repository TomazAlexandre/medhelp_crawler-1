    "question": "Posted By Pat Capwell on May 21, 1997 at 11:00:18:My father (64) has developed an eye twitch (both eyes)that over the past year has steadily gotten worse. I can't helpbut feel that it is nerve related. He states that when he is in thecar and his head is tilted back so that his neck is on the neck-rest, the twitching ends. He was diagnosed with diabetes lastyear and has had a weight problem for several years. He haslost weight over the past year and the diabetes appears to bein control. He speculated that the twitching might be related tothe diabtetes, but, I'm doubtful. This problem prevents myfather from socializing (embarrasement) and has also affectedhis spirit. It appears that the twitching gets worse when in publicwhich further makes me think that it is nerve related. I've decidedto inquire on the net to see if anyone has any experience withthis sort of problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
