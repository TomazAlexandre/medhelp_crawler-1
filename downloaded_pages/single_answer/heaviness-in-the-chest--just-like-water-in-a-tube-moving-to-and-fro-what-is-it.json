            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Personally, I do not feel your problem is related to heart. However do get a 12 lead EKG. Chances are that you have esophageal reflux (GERD), where the food in your stomach is thrown up into your food pipe or esophagus. Another possibility is hiatal hernia, where a portion of stomach herniates into the chest cavity through the diaphragm. Any antacid will ease the symptoms. Omeprazole is a good drug to combat this. Along with it you can try over the counter antacids. However I would recommend you see a doctor and take medication under a doctor\u2019s supervision. Avoid heavy meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Go to bed at least 2 hours after food.You can try this and see if these tips help.Another possibility is gastric paresis wherein the stomach contents are not emptied into the small gut within the required time\u2014that is 4 hours. For this you would need to consult a gastroenterologist. Diabetes and hypothyroid states are the commonest cause for this.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
