            "answer": "Hello,It is not necessary that all type of pustules and folliculitis are caused by bacteria. But yes they are caused by infection which may be bacterial or fungal in nature. Then it is called perifolliculitis scalp. It is characterized by small, very itchy pustules within the scalp, often most troublesome on the frontal hairline. The scalp should be washed with a mild normal shampoo as often as desired. Antidandruff shampoos containing antifungal agents such as ketoconazole or ciclopirox are sometimes helpful. Apart from that you need topical and oral antibiotics, antihistamines, oral steroids and topical tretinoin.My sincere advice is to get it examined from a dermatologist. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "For the last 8 months I've had what was told to be folliculitis on my scalp, it spread to my face and neck, a culture was done and found to be mrsa. I have taken many antibiotics and all of it has subsided but I still get 1-2 a week on my scalp, they usually go away in about 2-3 days, sometimes they have a white center and pop sometimes they do not. I recently had a culture done of one postule and it was found to be sterile. My Derm told me it was a sterile postule and recommended accutane if it bothered me. I have never had this before, I have been tested for HIV, diabetes, immune disorders and everytyhing comes out negative. My question is after so many antibiotics and so many negative tests why do I get these still? And what is a sterile pustule? I thought all pimples were some type of bacteria. Also everything is clear when I'm actually on certain bacterial killing antibiotics.",
