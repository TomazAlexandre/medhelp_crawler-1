            "answer": "Diabetes is a condition that varies greatly. I'm assuming you mean your blood sugar was 133? If that was a fasting blood sugar, yes, that is a diabetic blood sugar. The treatment for diabetes also varies greatly. First of all, you need to know if you are Type 1, LADA, or Type II. For Type II you will be treated with a combination of diet, exercise and possibly oral meds. For LADA (slow onset type 1) you may be on oral meds for awhile or put right on insulin. For Type 1 most people need insulin because their body no longer makes enough. But nobody on a website can prescribe treatment. You can start by doing some research and learning how to change your diet and there is much information online. But then you need to see a doctor or endocrinologist to be prescribed the correct treatment for YOUR diabetes. Good luck.",
