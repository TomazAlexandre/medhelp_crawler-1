            "answer": "This web site is set up to focus on type 1 diabetes, not type 2. However, many people who post questions and comments here seem to be type 2, so I would invite comments from other type 2 people.As you seem to be well aware, this level of close to 400 is dangerous. If you see numbers above the normal 70-126 range often, I would heartily encourage you to make an appointment to see your doctor and have a hemoglobin a1c test done to find out whether your \"average\" glucose numbers are OK or are running too high. If they are running higher than is good for your health, your doctor may wish to alter your treatment and diet.Diabetic people are encouraged to aim for a hemoglobin a1c number of below 7 (in the United States' measurement scale) in order to prevent complications from happening. There are so many treatment options available now that I really believe all diabetic people should be able to attain this goal. Our futures depend on it.",
