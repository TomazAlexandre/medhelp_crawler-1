    "question": "I'm new here and hope I'm doing this correctly.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping someone has some answers as my family and I are at wits end.My father has had Parkinson's for a little over a decade.\u00a0\u00a0Most of his symptoms have been maintained through medication.\u00a0\u00a0He also has diabetes and much to my chagrin refuses to change his diet to help that situation out.In mid April he had lumbar fusion surgery and while the surgery itself was successful, the aftermath has been nothing short of h-e-double hockey sticks.\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after he developed a paranoia that prevented him from sleeping. He couldn't get comfortable in any position, horizontal or vertical.\u00a0\u00a0The sleep deprivation began to affect his mind and he started making no sense.\u00a0\u00a0His doctors tried a multitude of different medications to try and get him some rest but none were successful.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, due to a multitude of complaints from him, his orthopedic surgeon did a nerve conduction (I think that's what it's called) test and found a pinched nerve in each leg.\u00a0\u00a0He received a cortisone shot in each leg and it seems to have helped but not completely alleviated the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Now he is basically unable to walk, has just become an invalid and just sits in a chair and has everyone do everything for him.\u00a0\u00a0He has moments of clarity and is fine and then others his mind seems to not connect.Throughout all of this his neurologist has been changing his park. meds and I know that can be a lengthy process.\u00a0\u00a0We just don't know where to go and what to do. He is 70 years old so I don't expect him to be doing backflips but to have back surgery and have his mind affected so severely just doesn't seem right.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any idea on where to turn?\u00a0\u00a0His GP seems to be of no help, his neurologist is aware of the situation but doesn't seem to be doing much.\u00a0\u00a0Just incredibly frustrated and confused.",
