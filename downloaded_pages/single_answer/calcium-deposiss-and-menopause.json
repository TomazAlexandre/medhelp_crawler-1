    "question": "I am 40 years old and have worn contacts for nearly 30 years. Never really had a problem with them other than having to be picky about the solutions I use. Over the last few months I would put in a fresh pair of contacts and within a couple hours they would be so covered with film that I had to take them out. The eye doctor was shocked to see so much calcium on my new lenses (a brand I have worn for years) and asked if I was in menopause or perimenopause. He said that your eye chemistry changes when that happens. I don't think I have started either but do have borderline diabetes (from my pregnancies). Does this sound correct? I really would like to continue wearing contacts if I can.",
