            "answer": "Hi, barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the cells of your lower esophagus become damaged. Barrett's esophagus is most often diagnosed in people who have long-term gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It can cause difficulty swallowing like GERD. But to diagnose this it is mandatory to have biopsy. Diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy and affect the digestive system, and cause problems with swallowing. It could also be TIA or transient ischemic attack, which as the name indicates there is a temporary lack of blood flow to a particular part of the brain. This usually recovers, but these people are more prone for strokes. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time. Good Luck.",
