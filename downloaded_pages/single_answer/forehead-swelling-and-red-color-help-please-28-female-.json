            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!First get your blood pressure checked. This could be due to high blood pressure. The other possibility is clot in some blood vessel in the head and neck region. This can be diagnosed by an angiogram or colored dopplar. This can also give out heat sensation without there being any temperature. Hyperthyroidism, diabetes, temporal arteritis are the other possibilities. It can also be an allergic reaction to some soap or oil etc. In females it could also be due to hormonal imbalance due to any cause\u2014especially polycystic ovaries.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Also consult a gynecologist.Take care!",
