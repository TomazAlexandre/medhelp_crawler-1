    "question": "I am 45 yers old with diabetes and a thyroid goiter. Now they have found that my thyroid has gone hyperactive, but what is strange to the doc is that my T3 and T4 are fine while only my TSH is very low.I have had panic attacks off and on for many years, only since they found the thyroid goiter. Last time 5 years ago my thyroid function was hyperactive and the panic attacks started . Have been panic free for the past 5 years, and strangely in Feb I was irritable, moody, wanted to scream, impatient, had tremors in my upper back and arms, hot flashes and finally 2 weeks ago my heart started beating 103-108 beats per minute and stayed there.They have given me a beta blocker for the heart and has dropped blood pressure nicely, but cuaisng other symptoms which I am panicking over :)Just wanted to know if anyone else wit hyperactive thyrpid has also issues with anixzyet, if thsi is common or not.Thanky ou",
