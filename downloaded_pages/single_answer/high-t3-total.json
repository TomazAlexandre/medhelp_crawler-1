            "answer": "I assume that the 84 is for Total T4, which would be on the low side.\u00a0\u00a0But much more important is the biologically active portions of Total T4 and Total T3, which are called Free T4 and Free T3.\u00a0\u00a0Free T3 correlates best with hypothyroid symptoms, while Free T4 and TSH do not correlate well at all.\u00a0\u00a0So you should always make sure they test you for Free T4 and Free T4 each time.Your Free T4 was 1.2.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to always compare the result to the listed reference range from that lab.\u00a0\u00a0Even without knowing the range, I expect that your Free T4 is somewhere near the middle of the range, which would be adequate.\u00a0\u00a0But to better assess your status, we would really need to know about your Free T3 level, and if you are having any symptoms that might relate to hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0So, for now, please tell us about any symptoms you have.",
