    "question": "I am technically a type 1.5 Diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed about 27 years ago as a type 2.\u00a0\u00a0At some point, and it is hard to say when, my Diabetes became Autoimmune (LADA). This was confirmed by a GAD antibody test about 5-7 years ago. As I am totally dependent on Insulin and that has been for about 12-13 years now, I feel more like a type 1. In fact, I have been on a pump\u00a0\u00a0for about 4 years now.\u00a0\u00a0What I was told in my situation I still produce enough Insulin based on the c-peptide test, however, my Diabetes acts more like type 1 because of the autoimmune factor.\u00a0\u00a0I can go from 50 t0 385 in 12 hrs time.\u00a0\u00a0I am seem to have a difficult time getting my Diabetes under control.\u00a0\u00a0My A1C's have been running around 7.5.\u00a0\u00a0However, the last one approached 8.\u00a0\u00a0I have many complications which include, heart failure, coronary artery disease, severe neuropathy, chronic kidney disease, retnopathy, anemia and others. Is there anything that I could do to try and get things more under control?\u00a0\u00a0I do eat too many carbs. Based on my pump, as I am a carb counter, I consume about 325 carbs daily.\u00a0\u00a0I am about 6 feet tall and weigh 240. I am not very active because of my medical conditions.\u00a0\u00a0I have been as low as about 385 on my daily carb consumption and as high as 385. Help!!!!!!!! :)",
