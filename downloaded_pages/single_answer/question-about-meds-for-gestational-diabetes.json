            "answer": "Hi, I had gestational diabetes with both of my children. Are you not able to diet control the diabetes? I was told that the only medicine that was possible to use during pg was insulin injections. My mother is also a diabetic and on glucifage. I asked about this with my first baby and they told me medicine like it were not safe to take. If you have not tried diet control I recommend it. If you have any further questions, you may email me at brandy_bodiford***@****. Both my sons were average weight. The first one weighed 7.13 and the second one weighed 6.14. I never had to use insulin. With the change in diet I was able to keep my sugar level down and I had no problems with it after they were born. Hope this helps.Brandy",
