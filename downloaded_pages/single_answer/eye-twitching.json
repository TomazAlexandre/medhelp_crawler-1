            "answer": "Hi there.At first, the eye twitching can just be benign myokymias which are related to stress and inadequate rest conditions.\u00a0\u00a0However the progression to other areas of the face may signal something more than just this condition.\u00a0\u00a0Other explanations include micronutrient deficiency such as the B vitamins or can be early signs of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS).\u00a0\u00a0Systemic problems such as hypertension or diabetes can also give rise to this problem.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you have these possibilities discussed with your doctors and probably be worked up for such.\u00a0\u00a0For now, relaxation, avoidance of stress, adequate sleep and balanced diet is in order.Regards and God bless.",
