            "answer": "HiYou have not mentioned if you have any itching, discomfort, discharge, or any other symptoms. A swelling in pubic area can be a mole or wart or abscess.If it was an abscess, strong antibiotics or surgical drainage may be required to heal it.Genital warts are usually found on the genitals, in the pubic area, and the area between the thighs. Since you have diabetes, your immune system has been weakened. This may have caused development of warts.You should discuss with you doctor about other treatment options such as surgical removal or removal by freezing (cryotherapy), burning (electrocautery), laser treatment, immunotherapy or some vaccine treatment.In any case you should not attempt to remove a wart yourself by cutting, tearing, picking, or any other method.Regards",
