            "answer": "I had ALT and AST elevated for years due to untreated Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Both liver enzymes dropped back to normal after taking thyroxine. Hyperthyroidism worsened my insulin resistance and caused pre diabetes. High insulin means the body is in fat storing mode. I don't have pre diabetes now and my insulin resistance has improved since I'm no longer hyperthyroid and I cut out refined sugar/carbs.",

    "question": "Diagnosed with Hashimoto's 10 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Took out left thyroid gland.\u00a0\u00a0Still have right gland, though it has several nodules.\u00a0\u00a0AST/ALT are elevated again.\u00a0\u00a0My TSH is almost at low (which is high) end of normal.\u00a0\u00a0When I was at this level (close to low-high) before, I had all the same symptoms of elevated ALT/AST, higher blood pressure, muscle pain, insomnia, irritable, and believe it or not, weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0For some reason, I tend to gain weight with I'm close to being hyperthyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I've always been a bit backwards :)\u00a0\u00a0Can't take muscle relaxers because they pump me up instead of make me sleepy.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I feel stupid talking to my doctor about lowering my dose from 88 to 75 mcg so I didn't take my pill today and tomorrow I'm going to start cutting them to 3/4 pill.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts?",
