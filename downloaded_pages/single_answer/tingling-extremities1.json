            "answer": "The symptoms you describe are non-descript and could be do to many causes. The symptoms in your hands could be related to carpel tunnel syndrome. Combining the symptoms would suggest possibly a peripheral neuropathy which could be caused by diabetes, vitamin deficiencies (B12 and folate), thyroid abnormalities, medications (including cardiac medications such as amiodarone), and inflammatory disorders. Based on the symptoms you have described I do not think they are related to your cardiac condition. I would recommend a consultation with a neurologist to have this evalauted. Good luck.",
