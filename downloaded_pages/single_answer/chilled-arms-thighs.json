            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!You should look at hypothyroidism and diabetes for diagnosis. Both cause problems with blood vessels causing peripheral constriction of vessels. Peripheral blood vessels can be studied by Doppler study to see if the blood is flowing through them properly.I think you should discuss this with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
