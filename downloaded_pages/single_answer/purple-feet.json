            "answer": "Hi!I think you have deep vein thrombosis of the deep veins of the leg or maybe valvular dysfunction of the deep veins of the legs. This could be causing venous pooling that is making the legs feel fatigued and heavy. The venous pooling could also be making the fragile spider veins burst causing easy bruising. This can be diagnosed by color Doppler or by angiogram of the leg veins or by duplex ultrasound.High blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, diabetes and hypothyroidism should be ruled out. Birth control pill is another cause of bruising. At times adrenal gland insufficiency results in bruising and chronic fatigue syndrome and this possibility should also be explored. It could also be due to pressure urticaria.\u00a0\u00a0Possibility of the bruise being rashes due to contact dermatitis too should be explored.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "I'm 52 and when I sit for about 10 minutes my feet turn reddish purple and start to feel numb. My lower legs are spotted and look like I have little bruises when I really don't. The bottom of my feet are spotted purple and white. The only other thing is where my arm meets my shoulder it really hurts when I lay down. .",
