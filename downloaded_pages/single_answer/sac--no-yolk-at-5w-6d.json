    "question": "hi, i went for an internal scan last fri which was 5w 6d pregnant, there was a gestational sac but NOTHING else there, no yolk, i had my hormone level checked, it was 19,000 which is really high as it should be arould 1900 at this stage, i went back yesterday and it was 24,000. they didnt expect it to doulbe as it was already high, i have to go back on fri 6w 6d for another internal scan to see if anything had developed. I know my dates are correct, my lmp was 23/02/08 and I know i ovulated around day 14 / 15.Has anyone been in this situation? What was the outcome? I am prepared for the worst.",
