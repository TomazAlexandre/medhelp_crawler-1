            "answer": "Hello,A glucose of 1010 is barely on the not-normal side if it was fasting. Normal is now in the range up to 99mg/dL and it is also known that many people can test just out of range on one day and perfectly in range on anther So the best thing to do right now is get yourself retested formally--with a fasting glucose and/or 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test.Do not worry about this too much right now. In the meantime try to do the best for your body anyway--get some exercise working your way up to 30 minutes five days a week, and dietary changes to increase fiber healthy foods and decrease simple sugars and junk foods. These are the changes you will make for diabetes anyway, so might as well get started on a healthy course while you figure this out.Take care.",
