            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Light fever on and off for 4 days could be due to fatigue, stress, anemia, diabetes, thyroid problems or due to viral infection. Drink plenty of fluids. Acetaminophen can be taken SOS when there is fever or you can even take ibuprofen if you are not allergic to it. Take rest. If fever does not go down in a day or two, consult a doctor. Watch out for any symptom such as pain abdomen, burning in urine, cough or cold.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
