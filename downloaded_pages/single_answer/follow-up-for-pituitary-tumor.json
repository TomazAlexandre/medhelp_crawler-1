            "answer": "You should ask for regular monitoring. Lab testing on the pituitary hormones and all the other hormones based on your symptoms (they are probably subtle - and the doc, unless she/he is smart will just gloss over them but likely you have some).Prolactin levels if they are elevated can be treated with medications - so surgery is not always the treatment of choice so a surgeon was not the best doctor to see for the tumor but a neuro-endo is the best doctor as they know the pituitary. Regular endos had a bit of study but not much.Pituitary symptoms usually cause symptoms that you think are something else - fatigue, not sleeping well, depression, period issues, headaches, eye issues, diabetes, acne, high cholesterol, weight issues... I could go on and on - the pituitary can make you look like a couch potato when you are not. One hormone can effect other hormones so you have to know which hormone is knocking the other off - for instance, they were trying to regulate my thyroid but could not as it was my cortisol that was messing it all up.Read up on pituitary symptoms and tests and get geared up before the appt. as well, get copies of the tests afterward.",

    "question": "Hi, about 6 years ago I was diagnosed with a 7mm pituitary tumor.\u00a0\u00a0I had a CT then an MRI saw a neurosurgeon who determined that there was no need to operate, just watch it.\u00a0\u00a0I've really had no symptoms or problems that I know of.\u00a0\u00a0Although my prolactin level was elevated before my CT, it was normal by the time I had my MRI.\u00a0\u00a0They have never diagnosed the type and since there have been no symptoms I've had no other follow-up.I asked at my physical 2 yrs ago for a referral for a follow-up just to see what's going on with the tumor.\u00a0\u00a0I've finally got my appointment with the endocrinologist and it's in a couple weeks.\u00a0\u00a0(I'm in Canada and wait times to see an endo are huge especially if it's not urgent).\u00a0\u00a0I've never seen an endo before as I was previously referred to a neurosurgeon.Are there any questions or tests that I should specifically ask for?",
