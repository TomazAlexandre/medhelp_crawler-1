            "answer": "How are you? Diabetic neuropathy is a peripheral nerve disorder caused by diabetes. The symptoms are often slight at first and may go unnoticed for a long time. Numbness, pain, or tingling in the feet, or legs may, after several years, lead to weakness in the muscles of the feet. The goal of treating diabetic neuropathy is to relieve discomfort and prevent further tissue damage. It is important to bring blood sugar levels under control by diet and medication. Another important part of treatment involves taking special care of the feet. It would be good to discuss your worries with your doctor and he may give you proper medications for pain management.I hope this helps. Take care and keep us posted.",
