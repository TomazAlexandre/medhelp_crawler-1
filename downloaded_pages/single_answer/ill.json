            "answer": "We need reference ranges for any results posted, since ranges vary lab to lab and have to come from your own lab report.I also, always have a hard time accepting \"fine\" or \"good\" in relation to blood tests, because so many of them can be \"in range\" and still not be fine or good for the patient.Well, since you test positive for H Pylori, that's one diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Did your doctor recommend something for that?Since your A1c is flagged as high, that does indicate diabetes; have you had fasting blood glucose levels tested or a glucose tolerance test?\u00a0\u00a0Are you monitoring that at home?\u00a0\u00a0Has your doctor given you anything (metformin or other medication) to control blood sugar?What are your actual iron and ferritin levels?\u00a0\u00a0Looking at IBC and iron saturation, the first thing that comes to mind is hemochromatosis.Thyroid Peroxidase is an enzyme used by the thyroid to convert T4 to T3.\u00a0\u00a0Elevated TPO is a marker for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, but can also be slightly elevated in other autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren's Syndrome, Lupus, RA and Pernicious Anemia.\u00a0\u00a0In early stages, Hashimoto's is often characterized by periods of hyperthyroidism, which is indicated by the low TSH.Were there any other thyroid tests done, such as Free T3 and Free T4?\u00a0\u00a0Those are the actual thyroid hormones and are much more important than TSH.\u00a0\u00a0If those were done, please post the results and reference ranges, even if they were \"in range\".\u00a0\u00a0Do you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism, other than being tired?The positive ANA indicates an autoimmune disease, which could be any of the above, along with Graves, MS and others.\u00a0\u00a0The speckled pattern is often seen with Hashimoto's.Have you had a thyroid ultrasound to test for nodules?\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, nodules leak hormones, independently of the thyroid.Did you have a Thyroglobulin Antibody test?\u00a0\u00a0TgAB is also a marker for Hashimoto's and both it, and the TPO (TPOab) test are needed for a diagnosis, since some people have higher levels of one or the other.\u00a0\u00a0Your TPO isn't really terribly high, so pretty much leaves in question just which autoimmune you might have.\u00a0\u00a0A TgAB test might confirm Hashimoto's.Additionally, you might want to have a Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglogulin test done.\u00a0\u00a0TSI is the definitive test for Graves Disease, which is associated with hyperthyroidism and should be tested, because of the low TSH.",

    "question": "Hello,No surprise that the title for my question is \"Ill\".\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure what I'm suffering from, but it seems to involve quite a bit of my body and I'm very very tired of it.\u00a0\u00a0Ho\u00a0\u00a0ho ho.\u00a0\u00a0\"Tired\"\u00a0\u00a0who isn't?\u00a0\u00a0Just found the test results from my last blood draw, done by a woman who is now my former doctor, but if it isn't listed the results were fine.\u00a0\u00a0I understand that some drs will look at results that are borderline also, but since I have so many borderline, I'll skip them:H Pylori\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0PositiveHemoglobin A1c\u00a0\u00a05.9HUnsaturated IBC\u00a0\u00a0301HCalculated $ iron sat 19L(as an aside, my kidneys don't produce enough EPO)ANA TITER\u00a0\u00a01:80H\u00a0\u00a0(Speckled pattern, homogeneous pattern?)TSH\u00a0\u00a0.1(L)Thyroid Peroxidase 32HThis blood work was drawn the first time I saw this doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't have a copy the next time I saw her, but nothing was mentioned, except her vague mention about diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I've had a period of extremely\u00a0\u00a0high (for me anyway) blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I am being treated for hypertension, but all I received was another med from the on-call dr on the phone one weekend.\u00a0\u00a0My numbers were 190/110 at one time.\u00a0\u00a0I was at\u00a0\u00a0my pain specialist and she just said she didn't work with blood pressure and mine wasn't enough to stroke\u00a0\u00a0me out.\u00a0\u00a0I am aware of exactly when my blood pressure surged.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately I believe it's happened again.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried to mention pheochromocytoma or some other type of tumor that could be causing a lot of my problems.\u00a0\u00a0I've tested positive for this 3x in the last 30+ years.\u00a0\u00a0Though the next test (5HIAA, VMA etc) always comes back normal.Does anyone have any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0I've hit a brick wall and can only hope the doctor whose name I found on this site, listens.Thanks and good luck to all of you.\u00a0\u00a0I know how frustrating it can be when one is suffering from 'something' that can't be 'seen'.",
