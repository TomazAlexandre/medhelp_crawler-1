            "answer": "The main thing would be to make sure that the diagnosis of a \"rare form of pneumonia\" has been correctly diagnosed and is being treated appropriately with the best medicine available.\u00a0\u00a0You should request that she be seen in consultation by an Infectious disease specialist, if she has not already been seen.The combination of diabetes, heart failure, respiratory failure and kidney failure, with pneumonia and failure of her white blood count to come down, in response to therapy, is very worrisome and, with that many things going on, she may not survive.That is out of your hands but what you can do is insist that she be seen and cared for by the best doctors available, for her multiple conditions.You might ask her doctors if her kidney failure is acute and possibly related to her unresponsive lung infection or if it is chronic and on the basis of the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The latter would be more ominous.\u00a0\u00a0Also ask if they have, with some degree of certainty, identified the cause of her pneumonia.\u00a0\u00a0If not, what else could be done to make an accurate diagnosis?Is her breathing on the respirator being supervised by a doctor with expertise in such treatment:\u00a0\u00a0a pulmonologist or a critical care specialist?Finally, you should ask which doctor is in charge of her care and then ask that doctor for his/her frank opinion about her likelihood of survival and if she is getting all the available, necessary care required, if she is to have a chance to survive.Good luck.",
