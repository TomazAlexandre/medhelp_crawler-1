    "question": "Hi Quix,\u00a0\u00a0I read the link posted on the Dylem. diseases thread, and I wondered if you could tell me.. how will my Neuro determine in his mind if I have MS or if it is the cerebrovascular disease by the MRI?I also can't figure out why I am having strokes, I know I have diabetes which is a risk factor. But since the Dka and being diagnosed I have kept tight control. I can't keep the numbers any lower than I do. I have had the heart and all thoroughly checked with all the tests and they said all that looks good, no buildup, ect.My cholesterol is great, has been this entire time, the good and the bad are in the good range. I do not smoke, do not consume alcohol, ect.The only things I have are the diabetes, type 1 and the CEbv (and the damage from all of that).Why I am I continuing to have strokes if that is what is causing the damage to my brain? Would you have any ideas? None of this ever occurred before the Dka, I was pretty normal and healthy.I did also have the Evoked Potential test this time around, so the results of that might add new info?I would just love to hear any of your thoughts.Thank youJazzy fizzle",
