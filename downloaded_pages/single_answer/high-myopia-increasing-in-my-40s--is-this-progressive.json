            "answer": "It is unusual to see myopia progressing in your 40s.\u00a0\u00a02 reasons could be early cataract and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Nuclear sclerotic cataract (a yellowing and hardening of the central part of the lens) can cause an increase in myopia as the cataract develops.\u00a0\u00a0Elevated blood sugar in diabetes can also cause onset or worsening of myopia.\u00a0\u00a0These 2 conditions should be considered.\u00a0\u00a0High myopia does increase the risk of retinal detachment and glaucoma; while these cannot be prevented, they can be detected and treated by your ophthalmologist.\u00a0\u00a0You need to be examined by the EyeMD immediately if you have sudden light flashes or onset of many new floaters in either eye; these are symptoms of a possible retinal tear.\u00a0\u00a0Glaucoma usually has no symptoms, but is diagnosed by with a careful exam of the optic nerve and other tests.\u00a0\u00a0Tendency to high myopia is usually hereditary, and there is some evidence that hard contact lens wear may slow the progression.",

    "question": "I am 48 yr old female with high myopia of Left: -8 Right: -9.\u00a0\u00a0I was stable for years but in 2008 it started increasing again, it averages 0.50 each year. I do see an opthamologist who did all the test and said it all looks good but said the ncrease is unusual for my age group, mentioned although the number is high it come down to the health of the eyes, he said you can have 10 patients who are all a -9 but each one will be a different size/shape.\u00a0\u00a0My optometrist said it's just myopia, he said he's had some patients when getting into their mid-40's show signs of changing, so it could be age but said when I asked if this is progressive myopia, he said it is not because it averages about 0.05 each year.\u00a0\u00a0This has left me scarf and confused especially with the thought of retinal detachments, glacome among other things. I would like to know:1). Would this be considered progressive myopia even though I was stable for years but it started again 5-yrs ago?2) can some people who are stable but enter there mid-40's start\u00a0\u00a0increasing again due to age?3)\u00a0\u00a0a friend in healthcare said as you enter your 40's and start getting not readers, the constant focusing for distance, then refocusing for up close work, then back to distance again can cause a temporary blurry in distant and can be a possibility of an increase in vision changes.\u00a0\u00a0How true can this be?I worry about this everyday and each night, I'm always searching for information.\u00a0\u00a0There seems to be no stopping it, at this rate, in 15-yrs I'll be a -15 and just can't live with the thought of waiting around for my retina to detach or glacome or anything else these increases cause,it's just to stressful, I would be happy if it would just stableize again.\u00a0\u00a0Will it ever just stop Increaseing?\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything that actually help stableize ?",
