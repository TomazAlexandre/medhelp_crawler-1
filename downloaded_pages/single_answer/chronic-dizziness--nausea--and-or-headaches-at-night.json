            "answer": "Hi,Before a diagnosis of a migraine is given , all other possible conditions need to be ruled out first. Headaches and dizziness may be caused by cardiac or heart problems. Problems with blood vessels in the neck or the spine may also cause headaches and dizziness. An inner ear problem should also be ruled out as well as problems with vision. A systemic disease like uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes should also be considered.I suggest that you have a complete assessment done to rule out these other conditions.Although at this point a primary differential will be migraine headaches without aura.Have your headaches classified first by a neurologist.A CT Scan will be able to exclude any intracranial involvement.If it is a migraine, you may discuss with your physician the advantages of preventive migraine therapy.",

    "question": "I've been having problems with migraines for the past couple of months and just recently, about three weeks ago my headaches have been alternating with dizziness and nausea about an hour or so after it becomes dark at night. I have gone to the doctor and had sinus x-rays done for the headaches and everything was normal but I haven't heard back from her since. I drink loads of water, have been eating much healthier, and no matter if I spend all day out of the house or in it, like clock work, each night, I get dizzy or a headache. My headaches start in my temples, usually my right side, sometimes its a throbbing like a nail going in and out and my right eye feels like its popping in and out as well. I'm just frusterated and want some ways to get rid of this, please help!",
