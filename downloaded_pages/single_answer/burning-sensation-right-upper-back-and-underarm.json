            "answer": "Hi there. If all the blood work for tingling and burning sensations in limbs is negative, you need to be investigated for a compressive neuropathy. get an MRI scan done which would show if there is any bony impingement, spondylolisthesis, disc degeneration, prolapse etc. I assume workup for diabetes, hypothyroidism, B12 deficiency have come negative. If this is inconsequential, certain autoimmune disorders need to be worked up, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These are basically diagnosis of exclusion. A Detailed neurological examination is warranted before any treatment is started so consult a neurologist soon. Take care.",
