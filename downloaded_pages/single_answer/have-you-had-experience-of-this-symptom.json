            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Body odor is seen in medical conditions like thyroid disorder, carcinoid syndrome and taking drugs like antidepressant.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes too could be the cause as it allows organisms to grow on skin. Moist smell is usually due to fungal infection and this is common in diabetes and more prominent after the area becomes wet. You could be having fungal infection of skin like Tinea versicolor.Also if the diet is rich in cheese, then a bacteria of staphylococcus type acts on the sweat and causes this smell of vinegar.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral to a skin specialist.Take care!",

    "question": "My wife noticed that around my chest area I have an unusual smell. I dont tend to sweat or have problems with other body odours and dont wear any deoderant ( i dont have a need). This smell we descibe as foist which is like that horrible damp on unmanaged clothes washing smell. (When damp wahed clothes are left too long without being dried).The smell is new and distinctive has occured in the last few months and immediately after I shower it soon emerges even after extensive soaping. I am suffering from mild diabetic symptoms and have regular gout flare ups, I\u00a0\u00a0am 56 .The problem is definitely getting worse since my wife mentioned that the smell now fills the room and I'm showering more than once a day.Any thoughts ?",
