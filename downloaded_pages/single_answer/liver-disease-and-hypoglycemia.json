Simply put,\u00a0\u00a0the liver helps regulate the sugar and carbohydrates in your blood. If you have liver problems, you may have trouble with hypoglycemia. Liver disease can also lead to diabetes. Is your doc a hepatologist? Some docs would NOT advise a high protein diet, as this makes the liver work harder. You might consult a RD (registered dietician) for a good, liver-friendly, anti-hypoglycemic diet. hope this helps - SandyPosted by HFHSM.D.-D.M. on April 23, 1999 at 17:44:21Dear Susan:I appreciated your interesting questions and I",
