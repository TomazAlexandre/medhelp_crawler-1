            "answer": "Yes, heart attacks can last many hours. There are two different kinds of heart attacks and one which is caused by almost but not complete obliteration of flow in a coronary artery can cause smoldering symptoms which are sometimes mis-interpreted and not acted upon with sufficient urgency. Resolution of pain in this scenario also does not indicate relief from the heart attack, as sometimes the heart attack causes death of the nerves which cause the sensation of the heart attack. This is commonly seen in people with diabetes which may not even have signs directly linked to the heart damage.",
