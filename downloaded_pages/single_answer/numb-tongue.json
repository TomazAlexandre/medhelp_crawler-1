            "answer": "Hello WoostockWoman,The skin sensation of partial numbness or \"pins and needles\" or a type of \"burning\", \"tingling\" or \"creeping\" sensation of the skin, is known as a \"paresthesia\". Symptoms may start as a tingling (paresthesia) and change to a numbness, or there may be a combination of decreased sensation (numbness) but with heightened sensations at certain times or with stimulation. Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. Causes depend on the exact location of the paresthesia sensations, but typically include a physical nerve injury type condition (e.g. a nerve entrapment or some type of pressure being applied to a nerve directly or to the spinal attachment of that nerve), or a disease condition affecting the nerves (e.g. neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and others).Refer: http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/sym/tingling_tongue.htmBest",
