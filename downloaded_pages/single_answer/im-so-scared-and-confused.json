            "answer": "Nobody on this board is a doctor, and I would follow your doctor's suggestion regarding your son's history of seizures and the need for an EEG, which is a simple and non-invasive test.\u00a0\u00a0If you feel there is a blood sugar issue, it would certainly be easy enough for the doctor to test your son's blood sugar and if necessary do an OGTT or A1C test to see if diabetes is a possibility.",

    "question": "So my son has had these episodes that after he plays he becomes lathargic,confused, dazed, his pupils become dialated and non responsive. My husband gave him an apple and about ten min later he was back to normal. My doctor wants to run a EEG because my son has a history of Febrile seizures. But I feel that these recent episodes are related to his blood sugar and are a totally different issue.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any thoughts or opinions? Is the EEG necessary?",
