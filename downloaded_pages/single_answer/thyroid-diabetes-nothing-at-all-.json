    "question": "Hey There.I'm been to doctors a few times with a few conditions that have been ongoing for some time now. Its only recently that I've thought to string all the sympoms togehter and see if it's anything worth worrying about. I didn't fancy putting it into google as I put in I have a runny nose and it says I have swine Flue, so I thought i'd ask someone on here.Symptoms; unable to sleep but when I'm asleep I have problems getting up. My hands shake like tremors, I get mood swings and accesive anger and feel rather anxious and a little depressed. (which could just be a result of lack of sleep). I have a fungil infection on my feet (mainly towards the toes and ball of the foot that won't go away, I have possibly oral thrush or hairy tongue sindrome and lack of appetite where I can rather happily go a week without eating, (obviously drinking fluids).The best I got from my own GP was he said it ay be insomnia, although the symptoms don't fit, for the tremors he put a piece of A4 paper over my hands and after watching it shake like a leaf said its genetic but he didn't know what ot was. My feet he just decided to give me cream after cream and antibiotic after antibiotic with no joy.With all the sympoms put together family believe it sounds like a thyroid problem or diabetes, any clue? My doctor regardless of how many times i've been hasn;t put me in for a blood test or anything so may just be family over reacting but who knows(by the way, sorry for the bad grammer and spelling)",
