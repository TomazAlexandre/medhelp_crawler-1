            "answer": "You have posted on the Type II board, but don't say if you are Type 1 or 2. Is there a \"complete cure\" for diabetes? No. Can it be managed to avoid complications? Yes. A combination of diet, exercise and possibly oral meds for Type 2's and insulin for Type 1's as well as good diet is the way to do this. People might have opinions and ideas but nobody can say if or when there will be a cure. Meanwhile we have far better tools and knowledge to manage our disease than people did years ago.",
