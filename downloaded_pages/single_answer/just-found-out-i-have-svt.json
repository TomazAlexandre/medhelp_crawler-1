            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Aside from medications, another option in preventing\u00a0\u00a0episodes of SVT is Catheter ablation treatment. A catheter\u00a0\u00a0or small wire is usually passed via a large vein in the top of\u00a0\u00a0the leg into the chambers of\u00a0\u00a0the heart. However, this is only suitable if the exact site of the trigger can be found by special tests, and be located accurately by the catheter tip. This can be very successful, and after the procedure you will not need to take medication to prevent SVT. Factors such as your medical history as well as results of other diagnostic tests and your over all health are important considerations.\u00a0\u00a0It is best that you discuss this with your attending physician also for proper evaluation and\u00a0\u00a0to\u00a0\u00a0ease any worry. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Just received a kidney transplant Mar 25/13, and was sitting at home, all of a sudden my heart rate was near 200 called 911. When they got there I was still having the symptom's, the gave me something in an IV, and a ekg, which in turn was luckly (the doctors were able to tell me right away what I had.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen a specialist in this area He said a lot of people experience the first in their 50,s might not ever have again, or could come often. It was up to me, if I wanted to go on drugs or have the procedure, I decided to go with the procedure as I am on so many med's for anti rejection also have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Little concerned re the procedure, I have read that they freeze the heart ,so if they get to close to something they do not want to touch, they can stop right away without damage done to the heart, anyone hear of this I am in Canada, and at a loss. Have always had high pulse rates and no one bothered to look into this.\u00a0\u00a0Now I find out my 14 year old niece has it also?",
