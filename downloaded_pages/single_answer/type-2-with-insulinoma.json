            "answer": "Your comment indicates that you are having a very tough time with your diabetes management. I am not sure what your patient-doctor relationship is between both your family practioner and the endo doctor who threw you out of her practice. If your doctor believed that you possibly had an insulinoma they could probably arrange a fasting test.As you have probably discovered diagnosing a insulinoma is not easy, see hyperlink:http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec09/ch131/ch131l.htmlBottom line is if you can't get your docs to perform the test you will either have to accept their medical decisions or look for doctors in another town. Here is a question for you---what if you don't have a insulinoma? Can you accept that and work harder on controlling your glucose levels through proper diet, medications and controlled exercise?",
