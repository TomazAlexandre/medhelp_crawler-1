    "question": "My 81 year old father has had diabetes for about 10 years. Not too bad - he was mostly on Glucotrol and only on a small dose of insulin for about 6 months. He started dialysis 6 months ago for renal failure. During the past year, he has fallen several times - probably 15-20 times during the last 2 months. Sometimes, he trips, but mostly he just stops walking and leans against something. Right before he falls, he starts jerking, seems to loose awareness of where he is, and then just collapses on the floor. This happens about 30 seconds after he stands up from a sitting position. They have run MRAs, Brain ultrasounds, Carotid Arteriagrams - results of about 50% blockage in the left artery, 10% in the right artery. Since starting dialysis, he has not had to take any glucotrol or insulin and his sugar level averages between 90 and 150. He fell last week and broke his ankle very badly, having to have pins put in. Dad also has CHF and has had two bypass surgerys. Doctors say this isn't caused by his heart. He also has emphysema. We haven't gotten a good diagnosis yet. Some doctors say it is attributable to his diabetes. Do you think this could be so? If so, have you got any ideas on how to treat it, or what we could do to keep him from loosing control and falling?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks very much for your help! Billie",
