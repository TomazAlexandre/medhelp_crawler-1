            "answer": "Hi!First of all congratulations! Yes, blood sugar levels can go up as pregnancy proceeds. Please be in constant touch with your diabetes specialist, dietician and Obs and Gyn. Also, exercise regularly. You can also opt for yoga and do exercises which can benefit you during pregnancy. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
