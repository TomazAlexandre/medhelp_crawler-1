            "answer": "Hi there,It may be possible that you are suffering from Glossodynia or burning mouth syndrome .In this condition there is a burning or tingling sensation on the tongue, lips or entire mouth. On physical examination there may be no discoloration or any visible sign. The possible causes are nutritional deficiencies, type 2 diabetes, chronic anxiety, dry mouth, Sjogrens syndrome or damaged nerves associated with taste. Patients may respond to treatment with alpha lipoic acid .This is only a possibility. A clinical examination is necessary for correct diagnosis. Do seek second opinion and discuss this possibility. Hope it helps.Best luck and regards!",
