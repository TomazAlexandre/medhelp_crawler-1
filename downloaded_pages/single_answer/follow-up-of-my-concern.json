    "question": "Doctor EWH,Thanks for your response. could you please clarify the following concerns and i will be done and i will close this site. I am so tired searching for answers.1) You did not mention anything about the hydrocortisone cream that i used for the face and diabetes medication and a combination of all the therapies, surgery and medicines that i used.2) I was under lot of stress during the 3 months, did not sleep, did not eat, my mind was breaking. I also read that stress causes immunesuppression, will that effect the HIV antibody test result?3) Talking about my recent exposure, i went to a strip club, and she kissed me on my cheek, two times, and i had sharp grown hair(slight beard) on my cheeks, and then she did a lip to lip kiss for a second or maximum two seconds, closed mouth. The problem was that i had chapped lips, broken lips and cuts on my lips, it was open, but nothing was actively bleeding. I was scared because what if her lips had blood from kissing me on sharp grown hair on my cheek and then kissing me on my cut lip. So it would become a blood to blood contact. That is why i am so worried. I have a one year old daughter, i cant concentrate on anything. Please answer.",
