            "answer": "I am not an expert and by no means should you take my advice as such, but what you are describing sounds a lot like a panic attack--especially when diarrhea follows.\u00a0\u00a0Are you a nervous person?\u00a0\u00a0You don't have to answer that on this forum, only to yourself.\u00a0\u00a0If all of your tests in the ER were fine, were you relaxed afterward?\u00a0\u00a0A panic attack can be really devastating if you have never had one.The only thing that would make me think otherwise would be your eyelid swelling--do you have any seasonal or food allergies?\u00a0\u00a0Does your doctor treat you for low blood pressure?I wouldn't think it was a brain tumor first, I would want to know about the shortness of breath and eyelid swelling.Are you taking any medications, either prescribed or over-the-counter?\u00a0\u00a0You can have a reaction to a medication at any time, not when you first begin them.\u00a0\u00a0II would talk to your primary care doctor and find out about your meds (if you are on any)--DO NOT stop taking any medications unless directed by a licensed physician treating you.Good Luck to you.",

    "question": "I'm 40 year old female. About 10 days ago I started to have shortness of breath, heart palpitation and dizziness. I also have mild headache and eyelid itch/swelling for about a month. They all come and go. But when a bad course of the symptoms come I feel almost faint. It lasts about 30 minutes to 1 hour but sometimes I stay sick the rest of the day with a little dizziness and shortness of breath. Also at the end of this attack sometimes I feel like I'm getting diarrhea. It seems to happen more in the morning when I'm driving.About 5 days ago new symptoms started. Thirst, frequent urination and lower back pain.I was drinking water all day but after urination or bowel movement I felt more dizzy, off balance,\u00a0\u00a0shaky and lower backache was worse. With other symptoms I got scared and went to ER. They tested my blood, urine and chest X-ray. Everything was normal (not anemic, no sign of diabetes) except I was little dehydrated. After ER I got bad headache for 3 days and had to take aspirins.I also saw a cardiologist and he thought my heart was fine but scheduled for Echo Stress test.My medical history includes mild Barrett's esophagus (taking Protonix for a year), fairy large thyroid nodule (biopsy negative, TSH - a little higher side but normal range and T4 normal, size hasn't been changed much), ovarian cyst surgery in March, 06 (lost right ovary).I have had the bad course of attack a few times in the past. Also after my surgey I had shortness of breath, chest tightness and dizziness for a while. My blood pressure is always lower side.My primary physician ordered thyroid scan but I'm more worried about brain tumor or pituitary gland problems. Please help!!!",
