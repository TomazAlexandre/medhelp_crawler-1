            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!From your symptoms alone I think you have cubital tunnel syndrome.\u201cNerve compression problems behind the elbow are called cubital tunnel syndrome. The ulnar nerve passes through the cubital tunnel which is a bony passageway. When you \"hit your funny bone\" and have tingling in the small and ring fingers, you are hitting the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel.\u201d\u201cYour complaints may result from either sensory or motor (muscle) nerve compression. For example, your symptoms may primarily involve numbness and tingling in the little and ring fingers, the side and back of the hand. These complaints occur or worsen when the elbow is bent, as when: 1) holding a telephone in the hand, 2) resting the head on the hand, 3) crossing the arms over the chest, 4) curling the arm under the body during the night. Your hand may also become cold or numb when it is on top of a steering wheel.\u201dWHAT YOU CAN DO:Test for diabetes and arthritis first.\u201cWith elbow bending, the nerve is pulled up between bones into the bony groove, causing increased pressure on the nerve. Every time the elbow is bent the nerve is tightened and the blood supply to the nerve is reduced. A straight elbow has less pressure on the nerve. You may be able to avoid surgery by keeping the elbow straight as often as possible. Clearly this cannot be done throughout the day because you need to bend your elbow to do many tasks. Regular daily activities must be altered. Avoid crossing your arms across your chest. When talking on the telephone, watch how much your elbow is bent. Those who need to use the telephone frequently should get a cradle attachment or headset. You may have to alter your sleeping position with pillows. Adjust your chair and desk so that when writing, working at a typewriter or a computer keyboard, the elbow is flexed no more that 30 degrees and the wrist is in a neutral position. You may need a night stand for bedtime reading so that the book is not always held with the elbow bent. Most of these changes are common sense and require you to pay attention to your daily activities. We can make a splint to keep the elbow straight or slightly (30 degrees) flexed. I often suggest that you fabricate your own elbow extension splint with soft toweling or use hockey elbow pads, which prevent elbow flexion. In addition before considering surgery, we will need to manage contributing medical conditions such as arthritis and diabetes.\u201dHope this helps. Try out these remedies and let me know. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!Refer: http://www.plasticsurgery4u.com/procedure_folder/cubital_tunnel.html",
