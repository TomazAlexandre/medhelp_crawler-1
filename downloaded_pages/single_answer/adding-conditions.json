    "question": "Now a dx of Diabetic Type II has been made based on a 3-hour Glucose Tolerance Test.\u00a0\u00a0Told that Dr a year ago there was more going on that merely Thyroid and Perimenopause.\u00a0\u00a0Was I ever right!Turns out that in an overview of regular blood tests, I don't indicate any problem.\u00a0\u00a0Fasting blood glucose is still in the Normal range despite it takes 3 hours on the GTT for my glucose to get back to a normal level.So curiously, what considerations are involved with Hypothyroid and Diabetes?Thanks!",
