            "answer": "Hello,Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?such symptoms are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing paraesthesias are carpal tunnel syndrome transient ischemic attack or stroke, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "To: EveryoneThis is me: I have \"episodes\" of my left side tingling from my cheek to my foot...all the way down. It's like a rush. and my left arm going totally numb. This lasts for about 5 secs and its over. This has been going on for about 9 months. I'm starting to jerk slightly now when it happens and my left leg gets really week. But again, it only happens for a moment.I've had a spine and brain MRI- nothing showed up, I've had an EMG (which was the worst test EVER)and EEG, again...no problems there have shown up.My episodes happen when I'm standing up and using my arms. I've been texting, untangling something, putting water in a vase, looking at clothes in my closet, scratching my leg, etc.I'm sooo tired of this. I drop things during it and I have to sit down from being weak.Does this sound familiar to anyone? I've never heard of anyone else having these exact symptoms. I have no pain, or dizziness.Help:(",
