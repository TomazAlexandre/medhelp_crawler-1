            "answer": "Hello,Welcome....To me it sounds as if it is\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0projectile vomiting, although you said it was clear thick mucus...so it is coming from the stomach? is it just a one time and done ...till the next time\u00a0\u00a0or....does he continue to throw up.....several things here because of his history....If he is sniffing in and swallowing all that mucus created by the copd...when he coughs and some comes to surface FROM LUNGS....DOES HE SWALLOW OR SPIT? That could be the cause for the mucus coming from the stomach....now, there are a few conditions of the stomach and or intestines that would cause the PROJECTILE vomiting and that is the part that concerns me....had he ever had any gerd or acid reflux...I would definately get an appointment with PP and he can direct you from there...It can become something life threating if allowed to continue and if it stops great but please keep us updated...Have a Blessed day!!!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GOD BLESS!!!!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 loimmarmar",
