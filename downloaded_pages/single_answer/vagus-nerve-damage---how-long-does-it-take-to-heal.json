            "answer": "Hi. It sounds possible that it could be his vagus nerve, but it could be many things. The vagus nerve certainly regulates the stomach and digestion, but I don't think it ever repairs if damaged. If malfunction is being caused by diabetes or anything else, then getting those things under control certainly helps. If the nerve was going to repair, I would suspect it would have by now. I think a further test would really be useful, to see if anything else is causing his problem. Is it every meal he brings up? Is he losing weight?",

    "question": "My husband had cardiac ablation in early Feb. 2015, and his stomach was impacted.\u00a0\u00a0After a few days of light eating, he had a regular meal, and that resulted in \"violent\" vomiting - his dr. put him on medication for his stomach.\u00a0\u00a0It's been 3 months, and he is still experiencing nausea and vomiting (he vomited today before going to work). He did see a gastroenterologist, who said they could do a test (put a tube down his throat to his stomach) to make sure it isn't \"something else (other than Vagus nerve damage).How long does it take for the Vagus nerve to heal from damage caused during a cardiac ablation?",
