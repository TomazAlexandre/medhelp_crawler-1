            "answer": "You may want to see another doctor for a second opinion just to be safe. Did you see your regular doctor, gynocolgist or a hormone specialist? I saw my gynocologist first and then a hormone specialist and ended up with the conclusion of PCOS from both and I am be treated for PCOS.Birth control might help but if you plan to ever stop taking them you may need to address the problem before you jump on the pill.",

    "question": "I'm 17 and after going to the doctor about male pattern growth and recent irregular periods, she mentioned PCOS.My blood work back came normal--normal fasting glucose, insulin, testosterone. I also have no cysts on my ovaries.My family does have history of diabetes and miscarriages, so this makes me think twice if this is or isn't a misdiagnosis.Do I have PCOS or is this a hormone imbalance than can be treated with birth control?",
