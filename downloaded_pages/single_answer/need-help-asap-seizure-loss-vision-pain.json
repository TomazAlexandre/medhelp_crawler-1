            "answer": "Hi Anna!This loss of vision in the peripheral visual field can be due to optic nerve damage caused by glaucoma, high internal eye pressure, retinal detachment, occlusion of blood supply as in eye stroke, optic neuritis, and optic nerve edema. Tunnel vision is also possible after a history of head injury, concussion, brain damage and stroke.Similarly loss of color vision can be due to diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, cataracts, macular degeneration, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, side effects of certain drugs, head injury, sickle cell disease and leukaemia. You need a MRI of brain, EEG studies, and blood works for diabetes, vitamin B12, thyroid disorders, kidney function, liver function and vitamin D. Maybe you suffered a head injury in past that you do not really recollect.The cause of high blood pressure needs to be found out which could be hyperthyroidism, renal artery stenosis (by dopplar studies or MRI), abnormal kidney function (by kidney function tests), hyper function of adrenals, Cushing\u2019s syndrome, abnormal liver function etc need to be ruled out. You could also be having essential hypertension (without a cause), which needs to be treated with medication. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please consult your doctor regarding this.I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health.Hope you get well soon! Good Luck and take care!",

After my second one I lost color vision( I only see shades of black, white and grey) I still to this day don't see color. I am in pain 24/7 and nauseated 24/7 and even that has been getting worse. I had a spinal tap done( doctors thought it was fluid build up) that didn't help.
