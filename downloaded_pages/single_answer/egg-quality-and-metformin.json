            "answer": "I don't think women with PCOS have lower quality eggs as a rule. Our issue is usually lack of/irregular ovulation. I've never ovulated on my own, but was able to produce 30 eggs during a medicated IVF cycle and ended up with 5 beautiful embryos. Transferred one and got pregnant! The quality of your eggs largely depends on your age, and you are young so you should be ok in that aspect.I've also been on Metformin for the past year, and it's supposed to get your insulin under control (the root cause of PCOS), which in turn MAY make you start ovulate. It didn't work that way for me but my dr. kept me on it anyway. However, it is also supposed to lower your risk of gestational diabetes during pregnancy (we're at a higher risk of it), so I hope at least it's going to help me with that. Wish you all the best :)",

    "question": "i have pcos, i do ovulate and have a period every 33-35 day's, after tcc for 8 months i conceived naturally and ended up with M/C \"blighted Ovum\"at 11 weeks. its now been 40 days since the M/c D&C. The Dr. put me on metformin 1000mg a day right after D&C, i was trying to wait to ttc after 1 cycle, but i still haven't got my period, so yesterday i felt like i was ovulating so we went ahead and baby danced! i got tired of waiting for my period so i gave up and started ttc again. Am just wondering if metformin will help me to get a better quality egg? is my hormone right now more stable after M/C? am just scared, i dunno what causes that blighted ovum, i've heard that women with pcos have poor quality egg and that's what am afraid off. i don't want conceive again and end up with M/C, also if u thinking why am not taking Clomid, my Dr dont want to put me on it. Tell me what's ur opinion and experiences plz.",
