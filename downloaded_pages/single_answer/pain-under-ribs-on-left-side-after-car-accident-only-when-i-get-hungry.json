            "answer": "Hi!Since the pain worsens when you are hungry, please check and find out if you have diabetes and H. pylori infection of the stomach. Both can worsen the pain. Also, eat healthy meals, small portion sizes, ant 2-3 hours intervals.Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "good morning i was in an accident about 4 years ago and have been living with extreme pain now everyday. it starts when i get hungry, if i wait to long the pain will become unbearable. sitting or kneeling down does take the pain down or away almost immediately. the doctors ive seen cant find anything wrong with me. i dont see how that is possible with this much pain. Any ideas????????",
