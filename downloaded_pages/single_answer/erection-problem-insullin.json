            "answer": "Hi,To my knowledge there is no direct effect of insulin on erectile function, and given that your problems started two months after beginning the insulin, I htink it is more likely a coincidence. Diabetes is definitely linked to erectile dysfunction, so that is more likely the explanation. I also suggest reviewing your medications, especially blood pressure pills, as some of those can contribute to erectile problems. There are several medications that can help this issue, so discuss it with your doctor if you have not done so already.The main side effects of insulin are low blood sugars(if the dose is too high) and weight gain. People can also have skin reactions/allergic reactions to the preparation, just like any other medication.Hope\u00a0\u00a0this helps,take care",
