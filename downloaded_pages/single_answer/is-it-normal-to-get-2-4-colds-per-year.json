    "question": "Hi. For the past 2 years I have been getting more colds than usual. So far this year I've had 2 colds already. It ALWAYS stars out with a sore throat for the first day or two, then progresses to a stuffed nose for a day or two, and finaly sneezing, which means I'm almost over it. The entire cold lasts a little over a week. Is this normal? My parents are always around me but almost never get sick. My dad has diabetes which makes him more prone to catching a cold, but even he doesn't get sick as often as I do. Is there something wrong with me? Thank you.",
