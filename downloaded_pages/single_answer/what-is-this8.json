            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Low hemoglobin too can cause headache and dizziness.There are many causes of dizziness, lightheadedness, passing out, blackouts etc. It is difficult to comment without examination. I am just enumerating the possible causes. You can discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Dizziness could be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position), internal ear problems and cervical spondylitis or compression of cervical spinal nerves. All these cause dizziness when you get up from lying down position or when you change position that results in a change in the level of your head. Cervical spondylitis and ear problems also cause dizziness on changing the position of the neck.Other causes are anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling.Certain types of epilepsies and seizures too can cause similar symptoms. If you have an accompanying headache then you must also look at benign intracranial hypertension. Heart problems have also to be be ruled out in your case. If all other tests are normal, maybe an ECHO should be done to rule out mitral valve prolapse.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been having these \"episodes\"\u00a0\u00a0(rarely) over the last decade or so (maybe once a year) and recently they have been increasing (4 times in 2 months)...I begin to feel very hot, feel as though I can't get enough air and become very dizzy. The dizziness increases if I stand and if I try to walk I become very uncoordinated. Occasionally I pass out completely for several seconds (one time for several minutes). After a few minutes I am back to normal, although recovery seems to be taking longer each time. Additionally, I have been having terrible headaches that last for hours or sometimes days. So far bloodwork has only revealed slightly low hemoglobin.",
