            "answer": "From the weight you wrote, her weight and height are just below the 75th percentile for her age which indicates she is normal and not overweight (unless the weight is not correct). If you are concerned, suggest bringing your daughter to another MD to get her checked. It is recommend increasing children's physical activities (play, dance, sports) to lose weight, and not lower calorie intake due to the need of calories for growth. Limit time in front of the TV or non-active-video games. There have been studies showing the longer the length of time a child sit in front of the TV, the greater the weight gain. Limit high sugar drinks/snacks, and try replacing with low fat milk/yogurt or fruit/popcorn/low-fat cheese. Additional suggestions: cook only low fat meats (chicken, fish, loin of pork) or non-meat sources (soy products, nuts), low fat vegetarian combinations (rice & beans, pasta & beans, low fat cheese & pasta), fat free or low fat dairy products (skim milk, 1% milk, low fat cheese, low fat yogurts, low fat soy milk/yogurt), use plant oils, non trans-fat margarines, and eat a lot of fruits, salads, and vegetables. Eat daily high fiber breads and cereals (oatmeal) and limit \u2018junk\u2019 foods. If she has a constipation issue, suggest the above high fiber and using Benefiber which is natural and safe for children. Hoped this helped you.",

    "question": "My 10 yr old daughter has been gaining weight and since March has had rapid weight gain and it shows by the EXTREME amount of stretch marks on her body. When we ask her what she is eating she says they go out all the time (she lives with her mom). She said they ate IHOP for 2 weeks straight. She is the sit and watch TV type if you let her get away with it so we would understand how she would gain so much weight so fast. Recently her mom told us that she has been prescribed Miralax (1dose/day for a week then 1/2 dose/day every 3 days for 3 weeks) and can only have 1 sugar and 1 dairy per week. The manufacturer of Miralax specifically warns against using with the pediatric age group and advises against long term use and there are customer reviews on this medication that say this medication has long term effects and has caused \u2018ticks\u2019 and brain function problems in children. When we asked if they tested her for thyroid or pancreas issues or diabetes she said no they will do that after she completes this treatment. Also when we request written instructions from the DR she says the DR won't provide them as \"the parents know what to do\". Why would a DR put her on a laxative for that long without putting her on a diet or exercise program first and if there is digestive issues why wouldn\u2019t they do a fiber rich diet? Also why wouldn't they test her for thyroid or pancreas issues or diabetes before doing anything? Please help, this is really concerning!!",
