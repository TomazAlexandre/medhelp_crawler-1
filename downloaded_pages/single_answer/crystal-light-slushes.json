    "question": "This may be a dumb question but i was just diagnosed with gestational diabetes over a week ago.i have a huge sweet tooth so its been a fight but going well! Been controlling it with diet so far.\u00a0\u00a0ANYWAYS my hardest fight has been with slushes as they are my favorite and with the weather getting hotter again its hard to deny. Then i came to the realization that there are crystal light flavors of slushes!! Anyone try these out with GD? Ill live if its a no go but if i could get away with that even every once and awhile it would make this so much easier!!Thanks!",
