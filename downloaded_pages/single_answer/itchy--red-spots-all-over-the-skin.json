            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin all over the body can be due to allergies or viral infections. You can apply some calamine lotion at the rash as it will help in soothing the skin. She can take some OTC oral antihistamine medications like Benadryl or Claritin and see if it helps. If the symptoms persist then she may need topical or oral steroids for which you have to consult a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
