    "question": "Well I have stationary diabetes. But since yestersay I have been cramping and all bloody mucus nonstop. Checked today at 3.5 cm so doctor told me either way he doesn't let diabetes patients go past 39 weeks. I'm 38 and 2 days so if I don't get 5 minutes apart contractions,\u00a0\u00a0water breaking,\u00a0\u00a0or blood like a period, I'll be induced this weekend. However he said, either see you tonight or tomorrow :) I'm excited and hoping for natural labor no later than tomorrow :)",
