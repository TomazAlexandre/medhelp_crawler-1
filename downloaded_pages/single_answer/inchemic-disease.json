            "answer": "Hi.Before you undergo diet modification and exercise, it is necessary to determine any risk factors for small vessel ischemic disease leading to a stroke. This includes hypertension, diabetes, smoking, hyperlipidemia, carotid stenosis, and atrial fibrillation. If you have any of these risk factors, they should be managed properly to prevent any stroke from occurring in the future.A generally balanced diet is, first and foremost, essential in preventing any further progression of disease. In small vessel ischemic, diet modification should include decreasing carbohydrate (in diabetes-affected persons) and cholesterol intake. You are doing good in staying away from fried food and sodas. You could add vegetables and fruits to your diet as these are healthier and contain needed vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants helpful in treating diseases.If you are not regularly exercising, you should start as soon as possible. It doesn't have to be heavy exercise. You could start with brisk walking or jogging for a short distance and increase the distance as time goes on. Stretching exercises are essential also before and after jogging to help get your circulation going. If you are into swimming, it would be great as this gives the body a full workout.I hope these information helps you.Good luck.",
