            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations on your pregnancy!\u00a0\u00a0One thing to remember about blood sugar is that exercise will make your blood sugar lower without the need for insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Adrenaline causes your muscles to absorb glucose from your blood stream without needing insulin, and the effects from that adrenaline can last for a couple hours.\u00a0\u00a0Hard and sustained exercise like swimming can most definitely cause the lows you are seeing.\u00a0\u00a0Eating more and more often would definitely be a benefit to you.I have never heard of, nor can find any information on there being any higher chance than normal that your child will be hypoglycemic.\u00a0\u00a0With any diabetes (or hypoglycemia), there appears to be a genetic component, but it also doesn't appear that the genetics always causes the condition.",

    "question": "I am currently 24 weeks pregnant & last week I had my 2nd hypoglycemic incident in a month.\u00a0\u00a0The strange thing was that it happened 10 minutes after I ate a meal.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had that happen before, it is usually if I haven't eaten enough.\u00a0\u00a0The other noght before bed, my blood suager was 39 & tonight about 1 hour after eating & a 1/2 hour of swimming laps it was 76.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor wants me eating every 2 hours & says I should be eating more protein.So, my question is since high blood sugar has an effect on fetuses & produces heaveir babies, can the same be said with people with low blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0Is my baby going to be hypoglycemic too or have problems when she is born?\u00a0\u00a0I am a little worried because both my mother & her mother have type 2, which I believe is not heriditary, right?",
