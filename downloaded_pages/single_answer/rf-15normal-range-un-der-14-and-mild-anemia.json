    "question": "To an oncologist-I have been feeling ill with malaise,nausea, pelvic pressure and gerd for over one year. I had a total hysterectomy becuse of the pelvic pressure and\u00a0\u00a0I just had a parathyroidectomy due to hyperparathyroidism. I also have ileitis that they say is not Chrons as no diarhea/constipation. In this past year, I have developed pre-diabetes with no family history.\u00a0\u00a0Is a RF of 15 high enough to possibly be leukemia/lymphoma? Although I have had mild anemia for over 1 year on and off, my white cells and platelets have been within normal range. ESR and CRP are normal and LDH is low. What could be wrong with me?",
