            "answer": "Posted By CCF CARDIO MD-APS on April 27, 1999 at 14:29:31Dear Lou,1,2. In general the risk for death in undergoing open heart surgery(OHS)is about 4%.THIS NUMBER OF COURSE VARIES FROM ONE HOSPITAL TO ANOTHER, ONE SURGEON TO ANOTHER, AND FROM ONE PATIENT TO ANOTHER.Here at the Cleveland Clinic our mortality (risk of death) rate for OHS is about 1%, and that is a very impressive number considering that we do surgery on older and sicker patients.I can not be any more specific for your case since the patient's comorbidities and not just his/her history factors in to the number; in general though, the older and sicker (diabetes, heart failure, etc.) the patient, the higher the risk for death with open heart surgery.\u00a0\u00a0It is very important to get this number/estimate of risk from the surgeon since you will be weighing it against the risk of not having surgery.An Aortic valve area of 0.7cm2 is right on the fence between moderate and severe aortic stenosis(AS).\u00a0\u00a0About 50% of patients with severe AS will be dead in 5 years time without surgical therapy (a study some years ago was done comparing medical and surgical therapy in AS.)\u00a0\u00a0The fact that your mom has no shortness of breath is a good sign, however the high RVSP is concerning (i.e. making one think that now is the time to take the risk) and certainly she is not getting any younger, i.e. this might be her best shot at adding years to her life (in regards to the heart.)3. With the amount you have told me, if this were my mother, I would be leaning toward surgical treatment now, but I certainly would not have it done just anywhere, rather I would want it performed at a center that is highly experienced in complicated (older, sicker patients) cases.4. IF your mother has coronary artery disease as well as the valve problem, then NO she is not a candidate for minimally invasive surgery; of course, every \"valve only\" surgery is considered for minimally invasive approach here at the Cleveland Clinic-BUT there are other excluding points such as those with chest bone deformities.\u00a0\u00a0Without an evaluation (i.e. your mother having a second opinion here) I can not be more specific.I hope this information is useful. Information provided in the heart forum is forgeneral purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Only your physician can provided specific diagnoses and therapies.Feel free to write back with further questions. Good luck!If you would like to make an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center, pleasecall 1-800-CCF-CARE or inquire online by using the Heart Center website atwww.ccf.org/heartcenter. The Heart Center website contains a directory of thecardiology staff that can be used to select the physician best suited to address your cardiac problem.Follow Ups:Aortic Stenosis - Valve Replacement for a 74 Year old lady with Diabetes etc. Lou 4/29/1999(1)Re: Aortic Stenosis - Valve Replacement for a 74 Year old lady with Diabetes etc. CCF CARDIO MD-APS 4/29/1999(0)",

    "question": "Posted By Lou on April 26, 1999 at 01:10:32Decision Time !My mom 74 years of age has diabetes II, Hepetitis C, and Mylodispasia (chronic anemia). Her medications are Glucotrol XL 20mg and Rezulin 600mg (for diabetes), Normadyne 200mg, demadex 50mg, prinivil 40mg, Spirono Eq Aldectone 25mg. She also gets a weekly injection of 10,000cc Epogen/Procrit.Aside from her slow gait, she manages to do her dialy chores (cooking, cleaning, and shopping) from 6am till 8pm. She is not short of breath or in any pain. A recent Echocardiogram indicated that her aortic valve area to be .7 cm2, Peak Gradient at 49 mm Hg, peak Velocity at 3.5 m/sec, and her Tricuspid Valve RVSP at 79-84. Her cardiologist classified the above as \"Moderate vulvular Aortic Stenosis\". He further indicated that she needs valve replacement surgery but that he is unsure if she is a candidate for surgery as she has these other medical conditions. He further recommended that she be evaluated at a major teaching hospital in New York. We had her evaluated at the NY Hospital and the Cardiologist there confirmed the Echo readings and agreed that Valve replacement surgery is necessary and that she IS a fit candidate for same. He stated that doing nothing is \"worse than cancer\".I further inquired if mom is a candidate for the Minimum Invasive Procedure as performed at the Cleveland Clinic. His stated NO and that her percedure requires the full Monte (so to say).Question 1, Do you know of the mortality rates for an individual with the above condition ??Question 2, How does the patient and family proceed to reason and conclude whether to go ahead with the surgery or not ??Question 3, Based on the information provided (not having her medical records) do you think that we should proceed with surgery ??Question 4, Is she a candidate for the Minimum Invasive proceedure ??Any suggestions and further help would be most appreciated.",
