    "question": "Hi I met a guy on online dating site. He gave me protected oral sex. We engaged in unprotected mutual masturbation. After that I didn't take bath for two days. When I went to take shower after two days, I saw a little redness on my glans penis (i am uncut). Now the redness has gone after 2 days. But I observed inflamed penis on one side. I am using a new body wash too, It is highly scented. I stopped using that body wash and started cleaning with face wash. It was little itchy for few days.Two weeks after meeting the guy, I had one liter of local beer. Next day I had redness and itch on glans and foreskin. I went to doctor that day, he diagnozed it as balanoposthitis. He gave me candid-b to apply and augmentin as anti-biotic. But he said balanoposthitis can be caused by diabetes.How much is balanoposthitis related to diabetes. I will get tested after completing my anti-biotic course.",
