            "answer": "Brain is a small organ put into a skull for protection as it is the most important organ and controls the body. So the disadvantage is any lesion in brain is space occupying and compresses the normal healthy functioning brain and you have many symptoms.Eg: A pin ***** in the brain may cause paralysis of half of your body. Due to your hydrocephalous and Chiari malformation you might have developed most of the symptoms and it is continuing. You have to understand at this stage that you are doing your best and fighting all these symptoms and please continue doing that and follow your neurologist/neurosurgeon for further advice. Take care!",
