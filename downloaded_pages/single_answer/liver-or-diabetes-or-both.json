    "question": "I have been feeling very ill over a few years now, but getting worse daily. I had hepatitis 15 years ago and took an overdose 24 years ago, which could explain the bad liver. I have a slightly enlarged fatty liver, high cholesterol, high uric acid levels, insulin intolerance, ibs and at the moment depression. Lately I have terrible pains after eating, bloated tummy, heartburn and a killer thirst. I have no appetite, but try to drown the nausea with all the bad foods, hoping to feel better. I feel tired, lethargic and I think my brain has gone on vacation (mild short-term memory loss). I was in hospital for a week 2 years ago, while they ran tests. They found liver enzymes to be high, had to go back for more tests, but here I sit. Please can someone shed some light.",
