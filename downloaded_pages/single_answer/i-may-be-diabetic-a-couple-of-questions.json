The expiration date should be on the container somewhere. If either is out of whack you will get false positive readings.Your symptoms can be diabetic but only blood tests will prove that - fasting glucose and HbA1c. Until you do get tested, stop working yourself into a tinzy. Eat healthy and stay away from the bad carbs, sugary treats, and canned foods. These are sugar bombs. Over worry causes stress, stress can lead to a foggy head.",

    "question": "This morning, my glucose monitor showed 140 after waking up, but two minutes later I took another blood sample and it was 128. Not sure why two different readings within two minutes.On average, throughout the day I seem to be in a 120-160 range and this concerns me. There is no family history of diabetes, I'm 44, I'm 5'7\" 135lbs, get daily excersize and I eat healthy. No other health problems except feeling dazed and the high glucose. In the past, I've had blood work done and was told everything looked perfect range except maybe the glucose seemed a bit on the high side. But both doctors told me it was probably nothing because my overall health is great. They dismissed it.\u00a0\u00a0But here it is, a couple of years later and I need to know what's going on.Question 1:\u00a0\u00a0I won't have insurance for a while, but when I do I need to address this. My husband is concerned that if I take a specialized glucose screening and if I'm borderline, then the doctor will by default stamp my file as diabetic, and that will forever affect my insurance. If we ever choose to purchase our own insurance, they will discriminate against me and it will cost thousands more per year simply because of that one diagnosis - no matter how healthy I am otherwise or if the glucose finally is managed properly and goes down to a healthy level.\u00a0\u00a0Is this true that insurance companies will charge so much more based on one diagnosis?Question 2: Let's say I am diagnosed as diabetic. What is the first thing they will do? Will it mean insulin? And if so, do you feel relief from dizziness and fatigue after taking the insulin?\u00a0\u00a0Do you feel a lot better?One way or another, I want to resolve this dizzy feeling because I cannot live a half-life in a daze. I'm not as sharp as I used to be. I'm not a drinker, but it feels like I'm slightly drunk at times and I hate this feeling.Appreciate your input. Thank you.",
