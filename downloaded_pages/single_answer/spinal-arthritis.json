            "answer": "If you have a pinched nerve due to a herniated disc, that explains the weakness.\u00a0\u00a0When you exercise, the tissues get inflamed and swollen and put even more pressure on that nerve so it's not able to send a full signal to the rest of your body.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could tell you there is more to be done, but aside from surgery, you're already doing it.\u00a0\u00a0You could try different NSAID meds and see if one works better than another.\u00a0\u00a0Before exercising, use heat to slowly warm up, and then cold packs to cool down.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes a TENS unit will help as well.\u00a0\u00a0A referral to a pain management doctor wouldn't hurt either.",

    "question": "I went to the doctor complaining of back pain and weakness so an MRI was done. I was told that I have a buldging disc, a pinched nerve, and spinal arthritis. I was referred to a Neurologist and he told me to stop exercising so that I could heal and he put me on anti-inflammatory meds.I'm back exercising and at times I feel very weak after exercise. My doctor said that the weakness that I feel in my legs and arms are from the arthritis in my spine, so what can I do to ease these symptoms? I'm 35 years-old and was in great shape, been through a police academy and exercised daily until this has come up.I had a complete physical and he ruled out other possibilities. At first we thought that I was having hypogylcemic episodes during the exercise but the numbers were normal when I checked (65-75). No family history of diabetes and was told that the blood sugar is normal.",
