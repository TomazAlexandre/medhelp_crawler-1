    "question": "Hi there, busy weekend so hope yours was great, you asked if I was having the baby at McGee in Pittsburgh, I am having the baby in Uniontown, my husband is in the medical field and he feels comfortable that as long there are no complications between now and when I give birth, he feels Uniontown should be fine, plus I have a great doctor who probaby worries a little more than me (I did not think anyone out there worries more than me!!). So how are you feeling? I feel good,except for the last two days, I think the constipation is back, I tell my DH all this food I eat, where does it go???? Here is a question for you, I have gained about 7lbs and I am 5 1/2 months. My pre-pregnancy weight was 118. With your last two pregnancies including this one, was your weight gain different? My last visit the DR says the baby is growing on target, but it seems I should have gained more weight, ( I definately eat).Hope to talk soon and have a great day to you and your baby!",
