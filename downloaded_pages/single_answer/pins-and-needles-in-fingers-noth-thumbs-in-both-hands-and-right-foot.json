            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Pins and needles sensation is often associated with a condition called neuropathy, but other conditions are in the differential. There are 2 types of nerves that provide sensation to the feet and hands, large nerves and small nerves. A problem with either of these could lead to tingling. There are many many causes. They include but are not limited to most commonly diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune disorders such as lupus or a disease called Sjogren's, certain types of neoplasm, and certain toxins (such as lead). Also, there are several other genetic, metabolic, and hereditary disorders that cause neuropathy, and what tests need to be ordered depend on the history and physical examination. With small fiber neuropathy, the EMG/NCS test which measures how nerves conduct electricity and how muscles respond to them may be normal. In large fiber neuropathy, it will be abnormal. Small fiber neuropathy can be diagnosed with a skin biopsy and with a test called a QSART. If neurontin does relieve your symptoms, which it sounds like it does, this suggests that your pain is neuropathic, meaning arising from the nerves.Additionally, symptoms present on one side of the body versus the other, or in just one limb. Causes could include a stroke or the condition multiple sclerosis. These would best be excluded by an MRI.If symptoms migrate (move from one place to the other) and are intermittent, causes might include seizures, migraine disorder or metabolic problems such as low calcium.Often these symptoms may reflect emotional/psychiatric problems related to stress (what is called somatization disorder). The latter is a true medical condition whereby instead of a patient experiencing depression or anxiety, they experience physical symptoms, and once the stress is addressed, the symptoms resolve.These are just some causes tingling. Continued follow-up with your doctors is recommended. Evaluation by a neurologist, if you have not already done so, is recommended.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
