            "answer": "Hi!Bleeding under finger nails could be due to fragile capillaries caused by high blood pressure, diabetes etc. It can also be vasculitic rashes associated with lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
