            "answer": "Hello,There are a few possibilities for this kind of rash.It can be a fungal infection(Tinea cruris) or a contact or irritant ( xerotic) dermatitis.Keep your pubic area dry and keep a separate towel for yourself. Most forms of fungal infections respond to over-the-counter products, which contain any of several basic ingredients: miconazole, tolnaftate, terbinafine, and clotrimazole.But if however the symptoms persist then other possibilities have to be ruled out. Other possibilities are xerotic eczema,senile pruritis,atopic dermatitis,contact dermatitis,parasitic infestations,diabetes and liver or kidney pathologies.In that case a dermatologist\u2019s evaluation will be the best.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional doubts.",
