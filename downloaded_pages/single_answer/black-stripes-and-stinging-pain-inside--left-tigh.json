A few months ago I started experiencing sharp stinging pain and three blackish/blue dpiderlike striations about 3 inches long\u00a0\u00a0on an area of my inside thigh approximately 7 inches down from my groin.

I do take 325 mg of aspirin at night and drink 6 ounces of water before laying down to sleep. Any ideas as to what it might be.\u00a0\u00a0I looked up P.A. D. but the images do not seen to match. Could it be a D.V.T?",
