    "question": "My 15 year old daughter had her sugar drop in October, 2009 and it would always drop low during her basketball games. She is now playing summer league basketball for her high school but her sugar level starts around 90 and ends up between 150-180 by the end of the game. She has never been diagnosed as a diabetic but I don't know what else to do. She is very active on a daily basis and we have adjusted her diet to see if that helps which it has not. On game days she is eating a high protein/fiber diet with little to no carbs and no simple sugars. This has helped a little but not enough to deal with. We are at a loss and need suggestions to control it.",
