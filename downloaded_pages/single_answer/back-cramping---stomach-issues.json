            "answer": "Hi, its unlikely that the cramping at the back is due to stomach issues. It could be due to other cause like cervical spondylosis. Some metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders are known to simulate these symptoms. Please consult your primary care physician who will carry out blood tests and x rays to rule out these conditions. Regards.",
