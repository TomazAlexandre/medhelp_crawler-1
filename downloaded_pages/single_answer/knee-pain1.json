            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. First, I would like to let you know that knee is quite sensitive structure and more prone for re-injury. Frequency of re-injury increases if already was being damaged severely. Therefore, before resuming to strenuous activity, it is required to consult a physiotherapist for strengthening exercises. Additionally, your symptoms could be due to pinched nerve due to scar formation and neurologist's consultation is advisable to avoid worsening. Hope this helps.",
