    "question": "I'm a sixteen years old swimmer with no previous major health issues, but I want to make sure before talking to my mom.\u00a0\u00a0For the last month or so I've been feeling exhausted, constantly hungry, moody, slow to respond, and a bit lethargic.\u00a0\u00a0I constantly get nicks in my fingers but lately they've been healing very slowly.\u00a0\u00a0I'm constantly thirsty and have to pee often,\u00a0\u00a0yesterday it bumped up to every half hour.\u00a0\u00a0When I sleep I'm completely out and because it's break no one wakes me up so I'm dragging myself upstairs around noon, which is way abnormal for me because my body used to always wake me up around 10-10:30 regardless of how late I was up.\u00a0\u00a0For the last week I've had a terrible headache that refuses to go away.\u00a0\u00a0I've always had headaches, but never like this.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't lost weight as far as I can tell, but can that be from swimming?\u00a0\u00a0I shake a lot and have had a few emotional break downs.Everyone I try taking to blames it on my period, being new to swimming (even though it's been four months), lack of sleep, stress, or end of the year depression (which I've struggle with before), but this doesn't feel like any of those.\u00a0\u00a0It just doesn't feel natural and it's beginning to scare me but I don't want to seriously approach my mom if its just me over-dramatizing.",
