            "answer": "The elevated alkaline phosphatase level may indeed be due to the depo medrol injections.\u00a0\u00a0Depo medrol is a long acting steroid which should be used as a last resort for allergies.A better choice for allergies may be the oral medication, Atopica, which can be used long term without depo medrol's potential risks of diabetes or other endocrine disorders.Milk Thistle, Sam-E, Alpha Lipoic acid, Dandelion and\u00a0\u00a0Burdock root are nutrients that can help to lower liver enzymes, such as alk phos and are perfectly safe.",

    "question": "Our dog is in excellent health and exhibits no symptoms of any illness. No changes in health, diet or bodily functions. She is however receiving steroid treatment for an allergy on a quarterly basis. Her last treatment was approximately two weeks ago. She received a 20mg/ml x 3 Depo-medrol injection. Could the elevated AP be due to the steroid injection? If so, how long should we wait before retesting her blood to eliminate steroid effect? In the meantime should we have any other tests or procedures done?",
