            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to rule out history of smoking and alcohol intake as both these conditions can cause white matter spots in the brain. Also it is mportant to rule out history of chronic headaches.Your symptoms are non specific and at this point it is very difficult to say if they are due to demyelinating disease like MS.Do you have a history of viral encephalitis?I think he best course of action would be to wait and watch and get another MRI done after 6 months to see if the lesions have grown in size or numbers because as of now it is very difficult to give a diagnosis because your symptoms could well be because of fatigue, chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia.",
