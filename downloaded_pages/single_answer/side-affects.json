            "answer": "Lets look at it again.You visited a psychiatrist (what problem?) 2 yr back, who diagnosed Bipolar disorder and prescribed you Citalopram and Lamotrigine.Third day you found your ears (both) were ringing. You were asked to stop the medication.The ringing hasn't subsided as yet. You have been to ENT specialists and treatment towards this was not effective.The ringing may or may not have been caused by the medicines, difficult to say. One would expect it to subside once the medicines were stopped, that too after only 3 days of use.What were the findings and investigation results in ENT check up?Hope you are not having any other ailments, like hypertension or diabetes. What is your age? What is your work like?What medications have they tried for 'ringing in the ears'? What medicines are you now on?Your suicidal ideation may be due to depression or the depressive phase of bipolar disorder and has to be dealt with immediately with professional help, if you haven't done that already. What to do, even if it is against your wishes, in the best interests of your health, you have to be seen by an expert in the field.Hope this helps.Best rgds,Thomas Antony",

    "question": "Please someone help me. I have seen ENT doctors about my problem and they could not help me.. Almost 2 years ago I saw a psychiatrist who felt I was bi polar, He prescribed 2 medications Lexapro and Lemactil. On the third day of taking this medication my ears began to ring and ring LOUD! He told me to discontinue the medication and it would eventually subside. I have been trying to live with this for almost 2years now. My regular doctor and all others seem to think it will go away. My life was not a bowl of cherries but it was a life. The ringing is from the medicine it started when I took the medicine, although the prescribing doctor feels perhaps its from somthing else. I wish! I cannot concentrate on anything I lost my job, my girlfriend, and my sanity. I have tried lipo flavanoids and any remedy I could find online. Frankly I think its a miracle I havent took my own life. I dont want to die, I want to live but what I am doing now is suffering day in and day out. I dont know if this helps but the loud tone in my head will occasionally change a little, and I feel pressure in there. Please if you cant help me refer this post to anyone who can. I am done\u00a0\u00a0being mad at the prescribing doctor, but the drug company someone must have had this side affect! I can honestly say that if I dont get some kind of help with my problem......\u00a0\u00a0I have been thinking of suicide daily, it is the ringing it wont stop. I have never thought of suicide in my life and I believe if it wasnt for my family I would be dead.. But now I am at the point where they feel bad for me but cant help. This side affect from these medications have alienated me\u00a0\u00a0from my family and society... If it does not stop I fear the worst... I also understand these medicines help certain people, However if they get the same affect as me its a death sentence! Please if you can help me or know somone who can you can literally save someones life.",
