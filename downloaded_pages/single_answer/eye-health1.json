            "answer": "This \"spot\" could be numerous things. It could be a freckle, a small heme from a previous injury or complication due to another disease.. diabetes for example. I can only assume it's not an active heme as you didn't mention being sent to a retinal specialist. If they believed this to be an active bleed, they would have reffered you to someone else. I doubt it's causing the specific problems you mentioned. Your eyes work together. So even if this \"spot\" was causing a blind spot in your line of vision, you would still be able to see these things out of your other eye. You didn't mention any problems with your right eye. I'm also not seeing any mention of your age. Reading at near begins to become a challange around 40, gradually getting worse. As for the tv light, I'm not sure of the cause of this.",
