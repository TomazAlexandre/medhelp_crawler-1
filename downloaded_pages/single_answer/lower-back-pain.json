    "question": "Eight years ago I had a lumbar laminectomy. My Neurosurgeon has since retired. I am having pain again in my lower back and in my right hip. I have also been having a \"pinch\" going from the inside of my left thigh to my knee. I am having a lot of trouble just sitting. When I stand up and walk the pain in my hip is very bad. I have also had a pinching feeling go down my right shin. I remember this from before I had surgery. My doctor had told me that there was another disk going bad but could not do anything for it at the time because of health insurance. I just started a new job 8 months ago, am I going to need surgery again? I have also been diagnosed with Periphial Neuropathy in the back of my left shoulder. I do not have Diabetes. Please give me your opinion. I would really rather not have surgery since I haven't been at my job that long. Any other alternatives I could use? I take Aleve every day. It has gotten to the point where nothing helps. I am not overweight either. I appreciate your time.Thank you.",
