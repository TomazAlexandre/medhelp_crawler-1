            "answer": "Since the diagnosis in the 90's have you changed your diet/loss weight? Eating heathier since then could mean that you no longer have a fatty liver. Have you had a ct scan or ultra sound of the liver to verify it's condition? Do you drink alcohol on a regular basis?These are all important questions needing answered before your question can be answered. This is an important issue and you have good reason for concern. Tylenol is just fine for a healthy liver but we don't know if that is the case. If you take other medication they could also be the cause of the elevated ALT score. One thing is forsure that something is irritating your liver.Talk to your doctor and make sure they know about your diagnosis. If they then tell you not to worry then I would think there is no reason for concern. It would be a good idea to have a ct scan since it has been nearly 20 years. Take care.Randy",
