            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.What was the cause of your miscarriage? Chromosomal abnormalities, infections, lupus, diabetes, thyroid disorders, infection, and hormonal problems all can cause a miscarriage. If it was a treatable cause get it treated. I think you and your partner both should see an infertility expert. A clinical examination and tests like hormonal assay, pelvic scan may be helpful. A sperm analysis of your partner may provide some clue. I sincerely hope it helps.Best wishes and regards!",
