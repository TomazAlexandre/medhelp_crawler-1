            "answer": "Some can control it with diet and exercise, but others (like myself) end up insulin dependent. I know people who have had it and only had 6-7lb babies which is average. Mine on the other hand were 8lbs 6oz (the first, but I didn't take insulin with that pregnancy and I passed on gluc test and failed one so they let me slip under the radar). With the second I wasn't so lucky I had to take insulin and she was 8lbs 9ozs and 2wks early! I know a girl who had a 10lb 4oz baby boy. Anywho, what I'm saying is everone is different. Also since I was on insulin my dr. says that there are some test that can be done to detect it early( I'm 8wks 5days) so, maybe I can avoid it this time.GOOD LUCK to you!",
