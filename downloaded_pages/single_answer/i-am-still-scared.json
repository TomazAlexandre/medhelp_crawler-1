            "answer": "What was your exposure? I'm sure you know by now, but symptoms don't mean jack here. 9 weeks is an excellent indicator of your serostatus, but the CDC, test manufacturers, as well as many here, will notify you that 12/13 weeks is considered conclusive. Good luck, you should be cool, though.",

    "question": "Has an encounter on the 6th of April. Had a bout of stomach reflux with general weakness & fatigue around 25th and it continued till mid May. In the meanwhile read about HIV and really got scared - no thrush or oral symptoms (I know that does not mean anything). Went through a master health check-up which detected initial signs of diabetes (I know it is stress induces as I kept thinking about my life if I was to test positive). Finally got myself tested on 11th june ( 9 weeks) at Apollo (a partner hospiteal to Harvard Medical School). They used a HIV 1&2 (ELFA) test and reported a \"non Reactive\" test result. I am still scared especially after reading about the 6 month deadline today.Can I still be infected?Should I get another test performed? If yes, now or some time later?I want to get this out of my head once and for all - what should I do?Really Confusedvery",
