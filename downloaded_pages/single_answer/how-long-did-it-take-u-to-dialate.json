    "question": "So I'm 39 weeks on saturday. I have to deliver my 39th week due to diabetes. When I went to the doctor on friday. I have not ripened, the baby isn't engaged yet,\u00a0\u00a0no dialation,\u00a0\u00a0no braxton hicks or contractions. So the doctor said I'm not even inducible.\u00a0\u00a0It wont.wotk becuase my body isn't sent ready. But isn't set I want to try I can.\u00a0\u00a0He would induce me give me 6 hours to see if my body reacts. If it doesn't work then he would do a c section. Or I can just schedule a c section. Since I have a few days to spare he said he would recheck me on Monday and we will decide from there.Has anyone had any progress in 3 days.? I'm hoping something gives by monday so that I can be induced and at least try for a vaginal birth.",
