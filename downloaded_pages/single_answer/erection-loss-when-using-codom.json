            "answer": "Hi,For your testostrone levels is this in ng/dl or ng/ml? Pls check.The rest of your blood tests appeared to be within normal range. You have noted of an erectile problem only when you place a condom? Does this happen in other times as well?If it does ,does an erectile problem take place at least 25% of the time?Further evaluation may be needed if no hormonal problems have been noted. Vascular and neural problems involving blood vessels and nerve pathways have to be assessed as well.Do you have any underlying systemic disease condition like diabetes or thyroid problems?Any problems with your relationships? A psychogenic problem also has to be considered.",

    "question": "Hi Doctor:I am 38 yrs old, two kids. I recently noticed mild loss of erection when stopping to use a Codom. I went an urologist and he requested an LH, FSH, Prolactin & testosterone test. Results: LH = 5.0 mIU/ML, FSH = 2.55 mIU/ML, Testosterone 3.57 ng/ml & Prolactin10.2 ng/ML. Is this OK? I exercise, 6'0\" high, 175 lbs., no medical problems, no drinking, no smoking. Could it be venous leak causing this?",
