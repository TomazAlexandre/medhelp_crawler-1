            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Can you elaborate on the character and\u00a0\u00a0location of\u00a0\u00a0your chest tightness? Any chest discomfort warrants further evaluation to rule out cardiac issues. If this is associated with headache and occurs upon waking, imaging studies may need to be done also and complete neurological examination by your doctor is needed. Your medical history and presence of o-morbid conditions such as hypertension or diabetes are also important considerations. Take care and do keep us posted.",
