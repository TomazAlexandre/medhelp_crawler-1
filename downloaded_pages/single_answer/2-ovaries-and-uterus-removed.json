            "answer": "Hi Elyssa.\u00a0\u00a0I just had a complete hysterectomy and can tell you that the physical affects depend on your health prior to the surgery, how the surgery was performed (laproscopically, open surgery?).\u00a0\u00a0I had a pretty big dermoid cyst on one ovary via open surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I have alot of health issues, diabetes, obese, HBP, etc., and had open surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I was released from the hosp. 4 days later.\u00a0\u00a0I have trouble getting up & down (alot of pressure on the muscles & tendons in my lower stomach.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry to be graphic, but I also can't always tell if I have to move my bowels or just have gas (gas, gas, gas).Getting up from the toilet is especially tough for me, so I rented a toilet seat higher-upper (I have no idea what they're called).\u00a0\u00a0I also rented a bath chair for fat chicks, and can sit in the shower until all the hot water is gone and it just feels so good.Emotionally, I feel GREAT!\u00a0\u00a0I am 46 years old, premenopausal.\u00a0\u00a0I'm only 6 days after surgery, but the doctors are holding back on giving me any hormone replacement therapy (HRT) because they say my body should be ok without it.\u00a0\u00a0They advsd that I may experience hot flashes & other menopausal symptoms, and IF I do, we'll start something.\u00a0\u00a0One interesting thing I learned is that your body will use your fat as a resource for making hormones, so being fat is a blessing, in this case.\u00a0\u00a0FAT chicks can create estrogen better than skinny girls!\u00a0\u00a0na na na na na na!I wish you the best with your issues, and hope my experience gives you a bit of re-assurance and information.Morrowville",
