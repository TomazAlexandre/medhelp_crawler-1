    "question": "My husband has many symptoms that I believe are associated with Diabetes. Years ago, he was diagnosed with hypoglycemia, but he will not tell his doctor all of the sysmptoms he is experiencing. His next appointment is next month and I am going with him and will talk to the doctor myself. I would like to be better informed before our visit. His symptoms include, thirst, hunger (he's always snacking on something), frequent trips to the bathroom (even at night), PLMD, he's tired all the time and will nap any time the opportunity is there, when he eats something sweet he goes into a deep sleep and I have a hard time waking him until he has \"slept it off\", also he has started having eretion problems. I have done alot of research on his individual symptoms and every one of them says diabetes. Please tell me if all of these symptoms are also symptoms of diabetes. Thank you.",
