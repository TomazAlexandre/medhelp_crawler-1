    "question": "I've been a type 1 diabetic for 25 years and have currently started experiencing all over body pains. My back has shooting pain, my fingers hurt to bend and stretch and my right wrist has lost range of motion. It throbs and burns more than not and my hips are constantly stiff.Does diabetes cause things like this? What could it be? I am losing valuable lifetime due to pain and need answers. Doctors don't seem to understand that this is wearing me down emotionally. I just can't live like this anymore.",
