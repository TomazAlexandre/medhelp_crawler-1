            "answer": "Hi lindaday,I'm not a medical professional and I have never taken Actos. However, as far as I know, Actos (Pioglitazone)is a drug prescribed for Type II diabetes to help control blood glucose when diet and excercise is not enough. Actos is not recommended for Type I diabetic patients. Below are a couple of links to websites where you can find more information about Actos:http://www.fda.gov/cder/consumerinfo/druginfo/Actos.HTMhttp://www.drugdigest.org/DD/DVH/Uses/0,3915,742%7CActos,00.htmlhttp://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a699016.htmlhttp://www.worstpills.org/results.cfm?drug_id=796The above websites give you an overview of the drug, as well as both positive and negative effects of taking Actos.Hope this helps! Take care.",
