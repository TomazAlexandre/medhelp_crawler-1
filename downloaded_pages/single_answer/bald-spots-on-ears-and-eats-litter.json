    "question": "We took in a kitten that showed up on our doorstep. He appeared healthy; except had bald spots on ears and ate the Swheat Scoop Litter. I changed the litter so he wouldn't eat it, and took him to the vet. The vet has tested for ringworm, parasites, worms, FIV, diabetes, mites, etc. Everything has come back negative. We know it's not a food allergy, because despite isolation now 2 of my other cats are losing hair just on the ears and are going after the litter. They've never tried to eat anything but food or plants before. The spots are getting bigger, but they aren't red, itchy, crusted over, or anything - just no hair.Any help you can give is greatly appreciated.Thanks!",
