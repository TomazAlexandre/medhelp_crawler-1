As you have mentioned the symptoms start when you are sleeping, we have to rule out any faulty sleeping position which may be leading to a compressed nerve in the arm or the forearm.Alternatively, you may have a bulging disc in the cervical spine.Have you had your blood sugar checked for Diabetes?Regards",
