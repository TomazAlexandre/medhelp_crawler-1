    "question": "For the last 3 days I have at tingling in my hands and feet. The sensations commenced about an hour after some physiotherapy treatment on by back which I had previously injured about 6 weeks ago. My physio believes that he may have stimulated my sympathetic nerve which has caused the tingling.I have recently been tested for type 2 diabetes which was negative and do not appear to have any other sypmtoms of MS. I was previoiusly on Zocor which I stopped about 3 weeks ago as it was resulting in an elevated CK.Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated",
