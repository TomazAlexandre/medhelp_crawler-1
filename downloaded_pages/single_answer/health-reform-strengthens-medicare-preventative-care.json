    "question": "Health Reform Strengthens MedicareJuly 27, 2010 at 4:46 pmAs the Wall Street Journal reported recently, some seniors who receive Medicare coverage through private \u201cMedicare Advantage\u201d insurance companies rather than traditional Medicare are concerned about the health reform law\u2019s impact on their benefits.\u00a0\u00a0They shouldn\u2019t be worried: health reform will strengthen Medicare while protecting all beneficiaries.Contrary to critics\u2019 claims, the new law won\u2019t cut the benefits that Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover.\u00a0\u00a0The plans will still have to provide overall coverage that\u2019s at least as good as traditional Medicare.\u00a0\u00a0And they\u2019ll no longer be able to charge more than traditional Medicare for certain critical services, like chemotherapy.Instead, health reform will take strong steps to eliminate waste in Medicare Advantage.\u00a0\u00a0While private insurers were supposedly brought into Medicare to reduce costs, they receive 9 to 13 percent more per enrollee than traditional fee-for-service Medicare.\u00a0\u00a0These overpayments cost taxpayers $44 billion between 2004 and 2009.A large share of the overpayments goes to padding insurers\u2019 profits rather than providing additional benefits to enrollees.\u00a0\u00a0Among one type of Medicare Advantage plan \u2014 private fee-for-service plans \u2014 less than a fourth of overpayments go toward additional benefits on average, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, Congress\u2019 expert advisory body on Medicare payment policy.In fact, these plans are so overpaid that there\u2019s no pressure on them to be more efficient and find better ways of providing care. The health reform law will phase down these overpayments starting in 2012 and use some of the savings to provide bonus payments to plans that provide higher-quality care.Reducing the overpayments will also help enrollees by making Medicare\u2019s long-term finances more stable.\u00a0\u00a0Along with other Medicare changes in the new law, it will extend the life of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund by 12 years and keep beneficiary premiums lower.Medicare Advantage plans need to start competing based on quality and efficiency, and that\u2019s exactly what the health reform law encourages them to do.January AngelesHow the Health Reform Law Improves Access to Preventive Care ServicesJuly 27, 2010 at 12:45 pmToday, we sat down with Health Policy Analyst Sarah Lueck to discuss the great news that millions of Americans will soon be able to receive preventive health care services free of charge because of the new health reform law.Audio clip: Adobe Flash Player (version 9 or above) is required to play this audio clip.

You also need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser.Sarah, let\u2019s start with a basic question: what is preventive care?Preventive care includes things like screenings, vaccinations and regular doctor visits that keep people healthy.The White House recently issued rules to help implement the preventive care provisions of the health reform law. Can you tell us about these new rules?Under the new rules, insurers will have to provide screenings for chronic illnesses like diabetes and cancer, routine vaccines for adults and children, and other recommended care for kids, such as regular doctor visits. As a result, we\u2019re likely to see fewer unnecessary deaths from diseases like cancer and diabetes, reduced spending on costly and avoidable illnesses, and a healthier population overall.How will the new rules help the population become healthier?People don\u2019t seek preventive services like colonoscopies and screenings for cervical cancer as much as they should. The out-of-pocket costs that people must pay for these services under their insurance plans are one reason why.Better access to preventive care should help more people to stay healthy, and miss fewer days of work or school due to illness.Research also shows that some preventive services even reduce health costs over time. One example of this is vaccinating children to help avoid costly illnesses.When do the new rules kick in and how many people will they help?The rules take effect on September 23rd of this year. Insurance companies will start to cover these preventive care services at no charge when their new plan years begin, anytime after that date.The Administration estimates that about 41 million people will be enrolled in plans subject to the new rules in 2011.Are there any plans that aren\u2019t covered by the new rules?The new law does not apply to plans that are \u201cgrandfathered.\u201d Those are plans that existed on the date the Affordable Care Act was signed into law that haven\u2019t changed a lot since. The law exempted grandfathered plans from some of the new requirements so that people can keep the coverage they have if they like it. These new rules also do not apply to Medicare and Medicaid, which have their own requirements related to preventive services.Sarah, what\u2019s the bottom line?This is one of the first provisions of the new health reform law to take effect and it\u2019s going to help millions of people access care and stay healthy.You can download a podcast of this conversation here or on iTunes.
