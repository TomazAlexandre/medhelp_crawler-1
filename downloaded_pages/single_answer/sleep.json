            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history from your mother, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.It depends. Does your mother have any abnormalities that are alarming other than the deep sleep, e.g., is she weak on one side of her body, having sensory changes, having speaking/visual problems, etc? Is she arousable with minor stimulation?The other concern is her medical history. Is her blood sugar okay? Does she have kidney problems related to the diabetes?I would highly suggest you have your mother evaluated by her primary care physician. She will need routine lab work performed. If everything is negative, she may benefit from further studies such as neuro-imaging and/or EEG. This will be at the primary physician\u2019s discretion.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
