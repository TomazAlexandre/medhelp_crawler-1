            "answer": "Hi anniemack,As you may know we are not medical professionals on this forum. I have been living with Type I diabetes for 12 years but I am not too familiar with the insulin level test. However, from what I can gather in doing some research is that an elevated level of insulin means that your body does not use insulin well, even if your glucose levels are in the normal range. I don't know exactly what the normal range is for an insulin level, but it seems like your daughter may by hypoglycemic. Has the doctor formally diagnosed her with it? Please speak to him/her about it and if you'd like to read more about hypoglycemia (especially in non-diabetics) refer to the following website: http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/hypoglycemia/Good luck and take care!",
