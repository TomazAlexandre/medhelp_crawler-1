            "answer": "Since all the standard diagnoses are not being substantiated, I wonder if this is an allergic reaction, either to a substance that comes into direct contact with your penis (soap, cologne, condom, douche chemical, spermacide) or to some medicine that you\u00a0\u00a0take intermittently that results in this reaction. This last is called a fixed drug eruption. I think that you should see dermatologist\u00a0\u00a0when you are in the midst of one of your outbreaks. You may need to have a skin biopsy to get the answer.Good luck!S.A.Liroff, M.D.",

    "question": "I am a 45 year old, un-circumcised male, married 18 years, never engaged in any risky sexual behavior.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last 5 years I began having recurring bouts of what appears to be a form of Balanitis, Diabetes tests negative, Herpes tests negative, bacterial cultures negative, yeast cultures barely anything.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot figure this out, it gets very painful, head of penis covered in small white ulcer type lesions, recessed, not blisters.\u00a0\u00a0Noticeable offensive odor, I have tried Clotrimazole, courses of Diflucan, Nystatin powder, etc...\u00a0\u00a0None of the Antifungals seem to help.\u00a0\u00a0My GP put me on Acyclovir, he said in case it is viral Herpes, for which I said I tested negative.\u00a0\u00a0This is very frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0I posted a picture under the name irritated2 which gives a very good look at it.\u00a0\u00a0Seems the worst as far as pain is right behind glans at rear most section of penis. Where the foreskin bunches up when retracted.\u00a0\u00a0When it is at worst, I cannot even retract it.\u00a0\u00a0Seems strange it began happening 5 years ago and never before.\u00a0\u00a0And I never really spent much time on extra hygiene all those years, but now everyone is telling me I need to wash it like it's a BMW or something.\u00a0\u00a0I don't get it, please help, as it seems to take over a month to clear up, and this time it is worse than ever before.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
