            "answer": "Don't worry! We are all in the same boat, I looooove sugary treats, can't resist them, started baking less sweet, healthier alternatives. Got me a used stationary bike, and looked at it happily for a month. Two days ago I downloaded this app and now really counting my calories. We eat very high calories esp dinner past 8, all home made. Today I decided after doing the math that I have to take charge before I get diabetes. So do you, don't find any excuses for a better you, hang your older pic and keep ur inspiration high. Treat your self with baking without refined sugar, use brown sugar and drink lots of green tea, esp with lemon, no sugar.Also eat lots of green apples as thou can, they help in fast digestion. I am telling you the secret but telling myself as well that this is our solution. I must lose weight now, before my knees refuse to carry me. Happy fitness!",
