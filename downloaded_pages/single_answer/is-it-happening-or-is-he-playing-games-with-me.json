    "question": "Hi ladies, so just wanted to hear your advice or experiences.I'm 38el and have been booked in for induction next Wednesday due to diabetes and a big bubba inside my tummy.On Tuesday my doc did a stretch and sweep, yesterday morning I woke up with back pain, not so much an ache. But over the first few hours of the morning it grew from a pain from feat I thought wad a bad sleep to that lovely burning back ache that is Oh so familiar from my other births.I lost my mucas plug at 10am and slowly had a build up of contractions all day. By the time I was ready for bed I was very uncomfortable and to say the least did not sleep well. I found myself watching tell at 2am ad I could not lie any longer. Hubbub found me passed out on couch at 6 and when I awoke I realised all the pain wad gone! And I could walk again.Spent the whole day as per usual, cleaning, being mummy etcThings seem to be getting uncomfortable again and my contractions are slowly starting to get a little painful again.What do you think, do you think my boy is trying to come out? Has this happened to anyone else, and how long did it take til bub arrived.This is my third preggy but was induced with both so never went into natural labour at home. So not sure what to expect.",
