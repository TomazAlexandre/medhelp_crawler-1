            "answer": "Hi,You seem to have had a good work-up thus far. Your\u00a0\u00a0blood sugar of 65 is actually not considered low in an otherwise healthy young man. Addison's disease usually shows some electrolyte abnormalities but not always. Still, many of your symptoms do not point towards Addison's.\u00a0\u00a0There are a number of investigations that can be done to determine the source of your symptoms,some of which have already been done. Further suggestions would include(but not limited to):1)testing for a pheochromocytoma--this is rare, but should be investigated so it can be treated quickly if you do have it.2)holter monitor3)testosterone levels4)consider anxiety/panic disorder5)ACTH and cortisol testing for adrenal diseaseSome of these should be done by an endocrinologist, so please speak with your doctor about looking into these possibilities.This is just a small list--other specialists may have input that is valuable here.If you really are almost passing out completely, you shoud not be driving. In the meantime, try to rest and eat well, as much as possible. Lack of sleep may exacerbate any underlying condition as well.Good luck and take care.",

    "question": "Well I'm a 30 year old man and 3 months ago I had a heart flutter and near syncope, then a few weeks ago I started feeling bad in general...severe mailaise and weakness, nausea, irritability, lower blood pressure than I used to have...high pulse (120) alternating with low pulse (50),\u00a0\u00a0 near syncope usually with the high pulse and dizziness/weakness with the low pulse.\u00a0\u00a0Chest pain and heaviness, not worse with exercise, than comes and goes.\u00a0\u00a0Had one episode of suddenly awakening at night unable to get a breath of air but I sat up and was okay after 20 seconds.\u00a0\u00a0The severity seems to seems to come and go throughout the day, and I have also had sudden blood sugar drops...I'm not diabetic, but I have a sugar tester and it said 65 and I was horribly symptomatic, felt better again after quickly drinking a soda and chips and dip.I have had blood tests...CBC, Metabolic panel, electrolytes, diabetes screen, TSH and T4, Iron testing, PSA....Echocardiogram, EKG and head CT.... But nothing, and I mean nothing is abnormal except for my red blood cells being slightly high (which they have been for a few years already anyway).......Sometimes I think by research on the internet I have different diseases, but I always find a way to discredit the theory...such as I thought I had Addison's disease, but my sodium levels are normal..then I thought CHF but I'm not extremelly short on breath.....Me nor my doctor can think of what to do next?",
