            "answer": "Hello,The urge of frequent urination can be due to diabetes mellitus. Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, diuretic drugs and pregnancy.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography , pregnancy blood test, thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis. I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made. I\u2019ll suggest consulting a urologist for the same and getting the uroflowmetry test done which actually tests the emptying of the urinary bladder.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I've been getting a very strange pushing feeling just after I've urinated. Also, I constantly feel like I need urinate, I have visited my doctors, done wee samples and they all came back clear. I was so confused what it was. I'm at doctors again today as it re-occurs every single month, sometimes the symptoms die off but they always come back the following month. I had taken cranberry pills which helped which I recommend taking to anyone with a similar problem. However, I would strongly recommend that you drink as many glasses of water each day which will clear out your infection as usually this infection is caused by bacteria inside. As experienced there is actually no fast way of relief but your doctor should provide you with antibiotics to clear out your UTI bacterial infection.Hope this helps! Oh and if anyone knows anything else to ease the pain quicker then it would be very appreciative if you could post it. I wouldn't wish this pain and irritation on anyone!",
