            "answer": "Hi!Actually, neither omega fatty acids, not any multivitamins make you gain weight. It is quite possible that taking these supplements actually helped you recover weight in right proportion. You must calculate your BMI or body mass index to see if you are overweight or obese. If you are neither then you have actually achieved the right weight for your height, age, and bone structure. If this shows that you are overweight or obese, then you need to find the cause.Well if you have not been over eating or consuming high calories and exercising less or if there is no change in your routine or if there is no new medication that you have started, or you do not have diabetes, hypothyroidism or adrenal gland problems, then you do have unexplained weight gain.Menopause is also a reason for weight gain, along with polycystic ovary. So these need to be ruled out.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
