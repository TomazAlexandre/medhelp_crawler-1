            "answer": "Hi,There is no window period for UTI infections as they can occur at any time you have exposure to an infective organism in sufficient quantity to cause infection or when your immunity is low.STDs can cause pharyngitis which is an infection of the throat and it is usually a painful condition. If you undergo some amount of depression of your immune system, you can also develop candidiasis or oral thrush which can cause a white-appearing tongue.Increased frequency of urination can be caused in mycoplasma and chlamydia infections.If you have had re-exposure through unprotected sex in the duration since your last testing, you will need to be tested again.Do keep us posted on any further doubts in this regard.",

    "question": "Dear folks,Since last one month,\u00a0\u00a0my frequency of urination has considerably increased from the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0No burning sensation or blood nor pain in any area.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, for the last seven to eight months,\u00a0\u00a0I've also been having a whitish tongue, but not painful.The very first day of this frequent urge to urinate happened,\u00a0\u00a0I went to the doc and he did just a urine analysis.\u00a0\u00a0There seemed to be no UTI.\u00a0\u00a0He also checked my prostrate and mentioned it is okay and not enlarged.\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, he mentioned since he did not find any sugar in the urine, he did not suspect diabetes, and hence did not do a blood sugar test also.However,\u00a0\u00a0later,\u00a0\u00a0i had a different set of doctors who did a semen analysis (as part of a diff routine) and mentioned they found traces of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on two medicines - Doxycycline and Metronidazole.\u00a0\u00a0I have no idea what those bacteria mean.\u00a0\u00a0I just did some reading regarding the above medicines though and found out one of them is used in the treatment of a wide range of STD infections and the second one to treat parasites.\u00a0\u00a0I took both these medicines for 10 days,\u00a0\u00a0but i see no improvement in my urination problems nor my tongue issues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The docs also did test for thrush in tongue which was negative.I have had low risk exposures with unknown partners in which i sucked the breasts and had a handjob with lotion only, and also in one case my precum came in brief touch for a few 30 seconds or so with her vagina, but no penentration happened.\u00a0\u00a0I also happened to have a six week STD test only for the first encounter, but nothing after that.\u00a0\u00a0No other exposures apart from what i have mentioned.So, my questions are as follows:a) Is there a window period for the UTI infections to show up?b) Do any of the STD's\u00a0\u00a0the urination symptoms and white tongue.c) Should i get re-tested for diabetes or any STD'sPlease advise what could be my issues, since i am unable to overcome my anxiety.Do i need any further testing?PS: I am a 38 yr old male.Thanks and Best RegardsRoger",
