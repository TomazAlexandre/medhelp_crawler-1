            "answer": "Just wanting to rule out your \"normal\" B12.\u00a0\u00a0Vitamin B12 is essential to maintain the myelin sheath around the nerves.\u00a0\u00a0In Japan and Europe the lowest acceptable B12 serum range starts at 500 or 550pg/mL. For good reason...\"At least six neurological and psychiatric papers, in top medical journals, have shown that the normal range should be regarded as at least 500-1,300 pg/ml (rather than 200-1,100), since the cerebrospinal fluid level can be deficient when the serum level drops below 500, and neuropsychiatric symptoms often occur at serum levels between 200 and 500 pg/ml (VanTiggelen et al, Lindenbaum et al, Mitsuyama/Kogoh, Nijst et al, Ikeda et al, Regland).\" - Excerpt from Dr John Dommisse's article \"Vitamin B12 deficiency - symptoms, signs and optimal treatment\".",

    "question": "Hi, I am 42 yr old female with Graves Disease. About 3 months ago I started having tingling and numbness in my left hand. Then 3 1/2 weeks ago I had leftside only neck& shoulder pain,and it went down my arm & hand. At first my arm was only weak, then it started to get pins and needles. My leg and foot also became weak and tingly.I had trouble walking at times. My foot would fall asleep, sometimes my whole leg was just weak...other times my leg/foot was numb and weak. I have also notice symptoms becoming worse after I get out of the shower.I've had bloodwork done which ruled out Lupus, RA, Lymes,diabetes. My,calcium, potassium, B12 all normal.I saw a neurologist and he noted weakness on my leftside arm and leg. I also had an EMG/NCV only on my leg because it was too painful for me to continue to my arm and that was normal.I go for an MRI tomorrow and am wondering what my next step should be if it comes out normal? I still have numbness/tingling and pain, it isn't as bad as the first week the symptoms came on, but the intensity has stayed pretty much the same for the past 2 weeks. Does this sound like MS? I don't know what else to think. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.Thanks for your input :)",
