            "answer": "Hi!I'm not totally sure that I understand your time course, but I'll reiterate--IVF; transferred embryos 7/31.\u00a0\u00a0No preg (?) Stopped all meds 8/13.Now no period for 40 days.\u00a0\u00a0If you have PCOS, you ARE insulin resistant by definition.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't mean that you have diabetes though.Metformin could probably help you if you do have PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0Also, that is most likely the cause of your prolonged cycle.\u00a0\u00a0The light bleeding is probably the beginning of something.\u00a0\u00a0I ALWAYS recommend a pregnancy test though! If you were my patient, I would treat with 5 days of Prometrium and start you on Metformin.\u00a0\u00a0Then we could decide if you wanted to do another IVF cycle, etc.Good luck!Dr B",
