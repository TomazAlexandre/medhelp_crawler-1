            "answer": "Oh Heather, you need to contact her endocrinologist. If she doesn't have one, get one NOW!! I hope she has a glucagon injection next to her as well. I have been a type I diabetic for 20 years, have a pump and have never had a severe low with seizures until a couple months ago. My mom checked on me, went to get some test strips, then an hr later found me unresponsive. I started having seizures. My mom gave me my glugacon injection. It took the ambulance a while to get to my house. After what they gave me on the ambulance and the glucagon, when I got to the ER, my blood glucose was only 38. I still don't know what happened but I almost died. You cannot handle this on your own. You need a specialist. A doctor who has gone an extra four years to study the endocrine system. Plus, they can see her life from a different point of view. They are so intelligent, it's amazing! Anytime she has a low that is in the 20s or 30s, you need to call the Dr. That is the BEST advice!!! I hope and pray she gets her blood sugar under control.",

    "question": "My 16 year old daughter has type 1 diabetes. Recently (since it is summer) she has been sleeping in later and has had lows while she is sleeping. (the lows that cause her jerking are have registered from 39-52)While asleep she will begin to jerk slightly. At least this is how it started. The first few times it happened she was just slightly jerking and we were able to get her to sit up, drink some juice and get her blood sugar up. I lowered her basal rates for the sleeping in times and we have made it mandatory she is up by 10am. Things got better.However last night she had a slight high (in the 200's) and we think she overdid the insulin. This morning at around 8am my husband heard her bed making noise and went to check on her. She was not in a full seizure but it was much worse than previously.My question is once they start to jerk and have seizure type incidents, does the brain progess and next time it is worse?So far we have been lucky to be able to get her sugars up quickly and help her feel better. I am very worried that these incidents will continue to happen more and more.",
