            "answer": "As a former Air Force member I have seen a few people with \"Gulf War Syndrome\".\u00a0\u00a0I am so glad that I was very fortunate not to have to go over to the desert the 10 years I was in.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with Graves Disease in Sep 06 and thyca a few months later.\u00a0\u00a0I started getting night sweats after my TT and RAI, but that could also be cause by being kicked into menopause at 46.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like\u00a0\u00a0your husband's whole endocrine system is messed up.It's a shame the government won't admit to all the **** that those serving in the Gulf was exposed to.\u00a0\u00a0I co-worker of mine has memory problems associated from GWS.\u00a0\u00a0I tell her that's how I feel with my brain fog.Does your husband's endo specialize in thyroid problems?\u00a0\u00a0Some endo's specialize in diabetes and know have a good understanding of thryroid issues.\u00a0\u00a0My advice is for your husband to keep a journal of his symptoms as he experiences them since he has memory problems.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe this could help him explain to his doctors what he is going thru and help them provide better care.Sorry I can't offer much more advice than that.\u00a0\u00a0Just know that we are all here for you guys.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you might want to suggest to your hubby to come to the board himself.\u00a0\u00a0It really truly helps to know that your talking with people who are going thru the same kind of problems. We here to provide support to fellow thyroid disorder sufferers AND their loved ones.\u00a0\u00a0So ask your questions...we may not know all the answers, but we all know how to send lots of e-hugs and support.MJ",

    "question": "My husband was diagnosed with Graves Disease two years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, he has had both of his hips replaced due to osteoporosis (parathyroid problems) had his thyroid removed and has serious memory loss.\u00a0\u00a0He is 42 years old and prior to finding out about his thyroid problem was in wonderful health.\u00a0\u00a0Now we have very serious concerns about his testosterone levels.\u00a0\u00a0His doctor was trying to find out why my husband has bed soaking night sweats every night - he ran some hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0His testosterone level was low, so he started him on Andro Gel.\u00a0\u00a0Three weeks later they retested his levels and they were even lower!\u00a0\u00a0We see a neurologist, endocrinologist and now have two orthopedic surgeons that we deal with (my husband just went through shoulder surgery due to a compressed joint and numerous subchondral cysts).\u00a0\u00a0His current med list is Topamax 200 mg per day, Citalopram 40 mg per day, Calcium with D three times per day, Nexium, levothyroxine 250 mcg per day.He served in the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and was a patient at the VA for a couple of years until I found a job with health insurance benefits.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, the VA would never admit to my husband contracting any type of illness from his service in the war.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, we are all baffled as to what is happening and we could use any advice you could supply to us.\u00a0\u00a0We are afraid that he's getting worse and we don't know what to do.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
