            "answer": "Dear Stephanie,Well due your profession, you must have had used your shoulder too much.It's just a presumption.Not being able to sleep over the shoulder means that -1) Either it's forzen Shoulder, OR2) There is a rotator cuff tear due to early arthritis.Frozen shoulder is generally due to Diabetes.This means that you need to get your Blood sugars tested and rule out diabetes.If this comes positive then we are straight on the diagnosis and will require active physiotherapy and sugar controlHowever of that turns out to be normal then we need to think in terms of Rotator muscles. MRI scan would be required that time.So i would advice you to meet a good orthopaedician and get the investigations done.Please feel free to discuss more with me as a fresh post.Also , if you are satisfied with my answer, do refer your friends also.I have got other forums also (Arthritis , Back and Neck Surgery, Back and Spine Surgery, Brain Tumor Forum, Headaches\u00a0\u00a0, Hip Surgery, Knee Surgery , Neurology/Neurosurgery, Rheumatoid Arthritis. Trigeminal Neuralgia), where you can post other related queriesRegards",

    "question": "Hi, I started having left shoulder problem in Oct. It hurt most of the time and sleeping on it is impossible. I usually slept with it under my head, but no more. Don't have insurance till this Oct. Did finally go to doctor, who I am going to change, who told me had bursitis but did nothing to diasgnose which he does all the time, that's why i am going to switch. Gave me anti inflammatory which did nothing. Advil helps some. Now I noticed right shoulder is also less affected but both shoulders have begun cracking upon some movement.Doesn't hurt when it cracks tho. Just wondering if you have any input. I am 51 yr old female who has never really had anything physically wrong my whole life. Did not injure it either. I was a hairdresser for years and am on the computer alot. Any input would be greatly appreciated. O, I did ask doctor if he wanted me to get X-rays that I\u00a0\u00a0would pay for and he just said wait for insurance. Easy for him to say. I'd like to be able to sleep without pain. thank you, Steph",
