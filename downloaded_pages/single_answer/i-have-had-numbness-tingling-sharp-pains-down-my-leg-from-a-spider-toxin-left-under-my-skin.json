            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Most of the bites by a brown recluse spider are mild. There is a necrotizing ulcer at the site of the bite, headache, malaise, nausea and vomiting. The symptoms that you are describing are not the usual symptoms of spider bite. I would suggest you to get yourself screened for peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, or B12 deficiency and also for peripheral arterial diseases.Take care!",
