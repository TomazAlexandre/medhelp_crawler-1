            "answer": "Hi,There are 2-3 possibilities which need to be looked into. Firstly, it could be some rhythm disturbance of the heart which can lead to fainting as well poor functioning of the heart resulting in the shortness of breath. For the confirmation of the same, a 24 hr holter monitoring helps which is nothing but a continuous ECG monitoring in which the patient keeps on doing his routine work and ECG keeps on getting recorded. The other is hypotension (low blood pressure) which can also produce similar symptoms. This could be due to some of the drugs which you might be taking. Diabetes also needs to be ruled out by doing a blood sugar as numbness of the hands & fainting can occur in one of the complications of diabetes known as autonomic neuropathy. Please do consult a physician and get yourself evaluated. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
