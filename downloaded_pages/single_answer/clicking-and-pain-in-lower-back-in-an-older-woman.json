Members are\u00a0\u00a0here to provide assistance and support to individuals experiencing symptoms related to possible abnormal conditions of the spine. Advice given is non-professional and is primarily based on personal experiencesDegenerative disc disease is a normal process that occurs with the wear and tear of the spine as we age.\u00a0\u00a0Given your mother's age, it would be likely that she has degenerative changes which are a possible source of her current symptoms.The only way to determine the extent of this condition would be through a medical evaluation with your primary care physician and obtaining baseline x-rays as indicated.Other factors to consider are the loss of bone mass as we age which results in osteoporosis.\u00a0\u00a0A bone density scan may be appropriate if she has not had one.Her relative level of inactivity does cause the muscles to atrophy and it would be beneficial if she did do some gentle exercises to promote her general well-being.Start with your primary care physician for a clinical exam and proceed as indicated by his findings.Best wishes -----",

    "question": "Hi,My mother is 72, and she is complaining of a clicking feeling along with pain in her lower back when she moves. She has been taking medication for diabetes and high blood pressure for some years....and also has a hiatus hernia. This seems to be something new though. She doesnt excercise or walk much and prefers to sit in front of the television. Any idea what this may be due to? Any help would be greatly appreciated.ThanksCy",
