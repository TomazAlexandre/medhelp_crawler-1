            "answer": "Hi!You probably have probably Scalene Myofascial Pain Syndrome. When scalene muscle is the cause of pain, the pain is referred from neck to (either all or a combination of) chest, inner lining of scapula (shoulder bone), shoulder, posterior and lateral sides of the arm right up to the thumb and index finger. Treatment is by physiotherapy that involves indentifying the trigger points, and massaging them, and other exercises to relieve the muscle tension.\u00a0\u00a0In all probability your should be able to do these without straining your VAD insertion site. Also, since the site is not healing, get blood tests done to rule out diabetes, and a wound swab test done to rule out infection. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
