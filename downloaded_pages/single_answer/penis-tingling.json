            "answer": "Hello,STD\u2019s are the first possibility for penile tingling. If STD is totally ruled out, then the tingling you feel at the tip of penis can be due to an allergic reaction (say to body lotions, condoms, soaps etc), prostatic causes or it can be a skin condition like eczema, dermatitis etc or it can be a fungal infection. Other than that it can be a simple bacterial infection or balanitis. yourself tested for diabetes as presence of this can cause mild infection.You will need ultrasound, X-ray, and computerized tomography (CT) along with prostatic fluid examination along with prostate specific antibody.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
