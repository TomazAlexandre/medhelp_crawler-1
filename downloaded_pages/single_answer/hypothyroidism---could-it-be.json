    "question": "For months now I have suffered chronic constipation, which ended up in a fecal impaction. I was prescribed laxido, picolax, lactulose and dulcolax. Nothing worked for weeks until now. I am on 2x dulcolax per night and must take 2x 20ml lactulose every day. I now have chronic diarreah which gives me terrible stomach pain, I cannot sleep and am exhausted all the time. I am waiting on blood tests on 16th November but I have been taking time off work because of all of this.Should I return to the doctors or will they want to wait for the blood tests?If I don't take the dulcolax then I will not have a bowel movement at all, as I have already tried this.Thanks.",
