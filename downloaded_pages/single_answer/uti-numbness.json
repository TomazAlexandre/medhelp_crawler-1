            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.A complete medical history and clinical examination is important for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness indicates a sensory nerve being affected. Is the pain so severe that you are experiencing numbness? Any nerve entrapment, or pressure being applied to a nerve directly or to the spinal attachment of that nerve, or a disease condition affecting the nerves like diabetes mellitus, peripheral neuropathy can cause anesthesia in the\u00a0\u00a0area. If may take some time for your UTI to resolve. If you are not satisfied with the diagnosis seeking second opinion will be helpful. Treatment will depend on the exact cause. Keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with a UTI and started taking antibiotic cipro 2 days ago. It is no better and tonight my crotch area right around my urethra is numb. I've tried several different positions and even walked around. Still numb. I don't know if I should be concerned. I've been trying to wait and give the meds a chance. I've never had a UTI last this long after starting meds. Please help!",
