            "answer": "It's possible, because of family history, he could have had uncontrolled diabetes-although personally I've never heard of diabetes getting to that point. It's also quite possible that he had some kind of reaction to his adhd drugs. However it may be something else all together. It's really difficult to know the exact cause but hopefully the doctors can get him sorted quickly. All prayers for your family and your brother.",

    "question": "My 12 year old little brother complained for a week about strong stomach pains, when my family finally took him to go see a doctor they discovered that it was worse then just a stomache ache. Tests revealed that his pancreas or splean (cant rememebr which) had shut down and his liver was filling with blood! The doctors also infirmed us that mu,tiple arteries are clogged in different parts of his body This came out of no where! My brother does eat, and he is not at all very active, however he is not obese or seen as overwieght. Also, my mother is a diabetic does that have any part in his condition? He also took medication for over a year for adhd, could the drugs have effected him and are just now showing the results? Please help!",
