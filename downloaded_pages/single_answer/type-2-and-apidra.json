            "answer": "Hi,No there is no risk of making your diabetes worse on insulin unless you are not treated adequately. The fact that your blood sugars are going up means that you are not on high enough doses of the medication, particularly at night since you wake up with levels that are so high. You likely need a long acting insulin or a dose of another oral medication at night. Are you also making dietary changes to help?Having a fasting high blood sugar is part of diabetes, because your body cannot take care of the sugar that it makes during the night to sustain you while sleeping(the liver makes glucose for you).I strongly suggest getting in touch with your doctor today so that you can have your regimen changed because those levels are quite high. Stay hydrated with lots of water, try to watch what you eat, and also ask for a consultation with a diabetes nutritionist--they are fantastic help as well.Take care.",

    "question": "Im type 2 diabetic , latest ac1 is 9.5, I was on metformin 1000 mg and glypicide 10 mg, They have now added apidra 5 to 7 units after each meal, and taken me off the glypicide. My blood sugars are usually between 200 to 300 dome times\u00a0\u00a0they get as high as 400 for the last year, But the sugars are always higher when i wake up after fasting which doesnt make sense to me? Also is there any risk of accelerating my type 2 diabetes by injecting insulin at this stage?",
