            "answer": "Hello,This rash seems like an allergic reaction to levaquin. Also another possibility is stasis dermatitis which effects the lower limbs mostly. It is mostly from vascular problems in the lower limbs. Since you are having numbness of the hands, so I would suggest you to get evaluated for diabetes and any peripheral vascular disease which may cause such kind of symptoms. Please get your blood sugar levels evaluated and get an examination for any peripheral vascular disease from your physician. Also consult your doctor and get the medication changed from levequin to some other antibiotic.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have been on Levaquin for awhile. My doctor precribes it for sinus infection.About a two years ago I started getting a skin rash near my ankle after taking levaquin. I mention it to my doctor and was told it was pupura. I went to a vascular doctor and was tested . He was not sure what it was because my legs were not swollen. Sometimes I can feel the rash moving up my legs. It itches I have been using rosemary oil to help the itch. I have tried creams etc nothing helps.I have had dizzyness which and was told it was vertigo. It went away.The dizzyness came back from a sinus infection. My doctor precribed Levaquin again the re rash is spreading. I have a round red patch on both sides of my legs and still at my ankles were the rash started. Benadryl helps but makes me tired.I have notice my feet are giving me problems . I get lots of pain in my feet. I do have spurs but its worse that this.I get a lot of cracking in the feet. I notice my hands going numb and swelling when I sleep at night . I keep on getting up and can't sleep while on levaquin.I was told I am having liver problems and was thinking it was from the colestrol pills I'm taking.I also take blood pressure pills. I am on levaquin and the rash is spreading up my legs.I would like to stop the medicine and go on benadryl. Don't know what to do. My doctor thinks I took this medicine and its not the levaquin . I thing it is. Please help!",
