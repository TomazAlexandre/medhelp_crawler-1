            "answer": "It sounds as if he is having seizures.\u00a0\u00a0He probably does need to go back to the vet since he really needs a complete blood profile, and other blood tests, and urinalysis to ensure that the seizures are not caused by diabetes, for example,\u00a0\u00a0or other metabolic or infectious disease.His heart should also be evaluated, since syncope due to a cardiac cause has a similar presentation as epilepsy.\u00a0\u00a0Syncope is a fainting episode, or partial fainting episode that occurs when not enough oxygen gets to the brain,\u00a0\u00a0due to a heart condition.\u00a0\u00a0Most heart conditions can be controlled very well with heart medications.Epilepsy can also be caused by brain lesions.",

    "question": "My cat is an 11 year old tabby who just moved in with me about 10 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0He has never had any health problems until now.\u00a0\u00a0About a week ago she stopped eating and didn't want to go out.\u00a0\u00a0Took him to the vet who didn't have any idea but noticed he was a little tender on his spine, so prescribed him pain killers.\u00a0\u00a0Gave him the pain killers for a couple of days but then he started vomiting so I stopped them and he began to recover on his own.\u00a0\u00a0He came back to his normal hungry self but with more of an appitite.\u00a0\u00a0I guessed this was because he didnt eat anything for a week.\u00a0\u00a0However over the passed couple of days he has had some strange episodes.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen it happen three times now each time when I am feeding him.\u00a0\u00a0He kinda crouches down and looks a bit dazed, his back legs turn to jelly and he just squirms around on the floor for about 1 - 2 minutes, then its over and he is fine.\u00a0\u00a0I have not seen him have these strange episodes at any other time but he spends 50% of his time in the house and 50%\u00a0\u00a0outside. Has anyone else had the same experience, don't no if he needs a vet.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice welcome.",
