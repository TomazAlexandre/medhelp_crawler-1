If your child is drinking A LOT, peeing frequently, and losing weight and having blood sugar problems it is very likely he has type 1 diabetes. This weight he is losing is from water and of you don't have your child taken to the hospital the problems will proceed and get very bad.Source: my own experience",

    "question": "hi, my son has been out of sorts recently to the point that school have commented that he is easily upset.\u00a0\u00a0approx 5 weeks ago, my son came home from school stating he felt unwell and had stomach pains and felt dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0He was also very clammy.\u00a0\u00a0As my husband is type 1 insulin dependent, we tested his blood sugars and got a reading of 215, this raised to 225 later in the evening before dropping to 175 at bedtime.\u00a0\u00a0We checked his sugars in the morning before breakfast and registered a reading of 140.\u00a0\u00a0We checked the sugars over the weekend and they varied between 160 and 215.My husband took my son to see the nurse practitioner and was told these reading were normal and virtually told him off for testing my son's blood sugars and advised us not to test him anymore, which we did despite him still exhibiting the symptons on and off.\u00a0\u00a0He always complains of being hungry even after just having had a meal.\u00a0\u00a0He has lost 5lbs in weight recently and last night actually asked my husband to test his sugars has didn't feel right.\u00a0\u00a0He registered a level of 320 but this dropped to 140 at bed time.Should I be concerned about this, as he is not complaining of being thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0My son is 6yrs old and weighs 24 kg and is 49inches tall",
