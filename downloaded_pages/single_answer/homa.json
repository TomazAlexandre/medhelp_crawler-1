            "answer": "HI,The HOMA-IR is a calculated measure of insulin resistance, meaning how responsive you are to your own insulin. The higher the number, the more insulin resistant you are. Insulin resistance is associated with other problems like high blood pressure and diabetes, so it is always best to have it lowered if it is measured as high. Your number is just slightly high, but overall the best next step is to work on diet and weight loss as this is the first step to treating insulin resistance.Tae care.",
