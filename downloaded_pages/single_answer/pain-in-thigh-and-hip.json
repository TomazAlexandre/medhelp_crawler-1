            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling?I feel with the history of viruses around and your symptoms of pressure headache with nausea can be due to some infection.It can be due viral meningo-encephalitis.Alternatively, it could be due nerve entrapment at level of lower back, causing such symptoms.The nerve involved would be sciatic nerve and condition would be sciatica.An imaging study of lower back i.e. MRI of lumbar spine will help in coming closer to diagnosis.If diagnosis is in doubt you can get electro-diagnostic study done.Keep me informed if you have queries.Bye.",

    "question": "I'm not sure if this is the correct category for my question, but we'll see.About three days ago, I suddenly got a sharp pain in the outer side of my left thigh. It's hard to describe, but it like a stabbing sensation, and almost like being shocked. It laster about ten seconds, and was bad enough to make me jump out of my chair. But it subsided as suddenly as it had started, and I was fine afterward. Then it happened again a few hours later, and happened on and off that day and the next. Eventually the pain radiated up to the left side of my hip as well.Yesterday, before each attack of pain, my hip would become really stiff, then I would get 4-6 jolts of pain within ten minutes, and then the stiffness and pain would disappear for a few hours. Today, I've still been experiencing these symptoms, but also, duller stabbing pain in the same area more frequently. That pain is much easier to deal with, but the sudden sharp pains are bad enough to make my leg nearly buckle when standing.I've also had a kind of pressure headache on the top and back sides of my head for nearly a week now. I've experienced no numbness, though I have had some nausea. That may be unrelated since a lot of viruses are going around now, and I am sometimes a little sick feeling since my diet isn't exactly healthy, and I had my gallbladder removed in 2005.I haven't been diagnosed with Diabetes, or any other major problems. I have problems with my knees and ankles due to prior injuries, and I have a bone spur on the front of my left ankle.. But I'm not sure if it's related in any way. It doesn't feel like any type of pain I've ever experienced. The sudden onsets are almost like a mental shock as well, and cause me to perspire and shake for a few moments after.I don't have money or health insurance, so there's not much I can do in the way of seeing a doctor. I just though someone else may have an idea of how serious this is. I thought it may be related to being suddenly inactive, as I quit my job last month, and haven't done much in the way of exercise since. My mom is an LVN, and she didn't seem too worried when I told her about my symptoms. She gave me some Gabapentin/Neurontin and I've been taking Naproxen that I got when I sprained my ankle a few months back. It seems to help my headaches, but nothing else.",
