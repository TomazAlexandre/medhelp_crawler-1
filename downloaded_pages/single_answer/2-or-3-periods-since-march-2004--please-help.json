            "answer": "hello...you know what...i am kind of in a similar situation...i'll try to explain mine to you. I got my period when i was twelve...and like your mine was always irregular..i would get and then i wouldnt for months...so the same thing i was put on birth control was i was about 19...and then last april i had a surgery cause there was a cyst found on my ovary(i'm almost 25 now)...i decided to go off the pill until my body was back to normal...but ever since then it hasn't...it seems like every 3 to 4 months i'll get my period and sort of the same thing...it'll last a few days. My dr did some tests and seems to think everything is fine with me but im just not convinced. Also this past time i was experiencing some extreme sharp pains and then i spotted for about a week and now i've had my period for two weeks. So im thinking now i may have just a had a miscarriage. Other than that the doctor was telling me it could be a number of things from having whacked out hormones to diabetes to stress...it's just really frustrating that's for sure...let me know what you find out and if i find out anything i will definately let you know!",

    "question": "I started my period when I was 12 (I'm almost 25 now) and have had problems for the whole time. When I was 13-14 I bled for probably 4-6 months straight but I was afraid to tell my mom. I confided in a friend who told my mom. She got me into the gyno immediately, who at that time said that my ovaries probably just weren't matured, and I was put on the strongest BC pill available. This took care of the problem and I just had my period on the placebo week. Then when I was 19 and with my ex-fiancee I went off the pill for awhile. I had no period at all for 8-9 months, and we were using no birth control at all. I went back on the pill and began having periods on the placebo week again. I continued the pill till March of last year, when I was with my current fiancee. I didn't have a period till Sept-Oct of last year, and have had only 1 or 2 very short ones (2-3 days) since then - but the last one I had was so heavy I soaked through a super tampon in an hour, while sitting in a recliner with my feet up.Again, we are not using any birth control.FYI, I can only remember 1 time that I've ever had what could be considered cramps.Could this be PCOS, or does anyone have another suggestion as to what it may be? Thanks in advance!",
