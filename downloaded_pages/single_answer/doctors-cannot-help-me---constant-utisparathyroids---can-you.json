    "question": "I am 63 year old female, I have a very long & complicated medical history. I had 2 brain operaitions 22 years ago. For a tumour on my Pituitary gland and an abscess on the Pituitary cavity. Both operations caused life threatening post op problemss. Later on I learnt I had heart failure during/after surgery, fell into a coma, Potassium/low Sodium problems. A car crash 17 years ago caused Endocrinine problems to return head trauma. Not receiving help from doctors in this country, I wrote to Robert Knutzen, American Pituitary Network, who contacted a Professor of Endocrinology in London, he sorted me out. I had Adrenal failure, with other problems and started on a regime of a lot of medication.Four years ago I suffered a bad head trauma fainting and knocking myself unconscious. A few weeks later I started with Diabetes Insipidus problems, which is when the bladder does not know when to stop peeing out and you should get a raging thirst. I suffered from this for 9 months after my brain ops, but I got over it. This time was different, I was peeing out, between 13-14 pints a day and charted my Input and Output of fluids to show the Professor. Eventually he tested me for DI, but because I did not have a thirst he said I coudn't have DI, but he did start me on Desmopressin tablets, which immediately helped. 2 years ago I started with UTI's, I'd never suffered from them in my life. At first they cleared up with antibiotic's, then they stopped working. I've been on high and low daily doses of antibiotics for 18 months. I've searched the internet for help and found I could relate to Parathyroid problems, again I do not fit the criteria, I do not have elevated blood tests. Out of 32 symtpms, I have 28 of them, 18 causing me daily problems. I know you can fit symptoms into many illnesses/diseases but to be told by my Consultant Endo, there is nothing he or anyone can do for me, is gut wrenching. It's not just UTI's, but chronic fatigue, loss of interest, short term memory loss, dry mouth, dry/hoarse voice/throat, high acid, itching on my body. Pain in my limbs, wrists, depression, constipation, headaches, numbness on top of right thigh, I could go on. I am a very positive person, with a great sense of humour, but this is getting me down. I could write a book on my life as a Pituitary patient, so much has gone wrong. Can anyone help me?",
