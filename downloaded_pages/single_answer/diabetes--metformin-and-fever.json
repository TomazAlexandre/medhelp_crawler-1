            "answer": "Not everyone tolerates medication equally. In your case Metformin doesn't play nice with you. Call your doctor immediately and notify him/her that you are experiencing severe Metformin side effects [stomach discomfort, headaches, diarrhea] and wish to discontinue its use. Then ask for an office visit to have your low grade fever checked out. Your doctor will put you on another diabetes medication too. Be sure to ask the Pharmacist and/or Google for a list of potential side effects of the new medication. This way you will have a list handy at your disposal.",
