            "answer": "Hi there.Blackouts can have several causes, from primary neurologic problems to problems with the cardiovascular system or endocrine system.Neurologic problems would include narcolepsy where you feel a sudden and uncontrollable urge to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0Cardiovascular problems would include arteritis (inflammation of the arteries causing narrowing of lumen) which would deprive the brain with oxygen and can cause blackouts.\u00a0\u00a0Low blood hemoglobin through nutritional deficiencies can also cause these problems.In a significant portion of people, blackouts may be the initial manifestation of uncontrolled blood sugar (diabetes).As there are a lot of possibilities, it is best that you have yourself checked by your doctor and have yourself tested for the conditions I mentioned.Regards and God bless.",
