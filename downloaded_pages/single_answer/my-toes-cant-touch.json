            "answer": "Hi!Difficulty in keeping the toes together can be due to fungal infection. So check between toes and see if there is extreme dryness or oozing or scaling. All indicate a fungal infection and would need you to apply antifungal cream and consult a skin specialist. It can also be due to plantar fasciitis, diabetes, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, peripheral neuropathies due to hypothyroidism, lupus, or alcoholism, peripheral artery disease, sciatica, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis and high blood pressure. You will need blood tests, nerve conduction studies and dopplar studies to reach a diagnosis.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "Recently I've been having this issue where I can't let my toes touch so I have to spread them and often times cause pain to them to feel okay again. If I just leave them be it feels bad and, hard to explain, but I just can't do it. I'm constantly keeping my toes apart. What do I do?",
