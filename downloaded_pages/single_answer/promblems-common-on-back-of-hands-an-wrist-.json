            "answer": "Hello,It looks like a muscle strain.Apply some cold compresses on the wrist and hand and give rest to the hand for some days.You can also take some over the counter anti inflammatory analgesic(pain reliever) like ibuprofen(motrin) or diclofenac.Application of muscle relaxant on the hand will also help.For the tingling sensation,take some vit B 12.If the symptoms persist or worsen then pls consult you doctor to rule out other causes like gout ,diabetes,nerve entrapment or carpal tunnel syndrome.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
