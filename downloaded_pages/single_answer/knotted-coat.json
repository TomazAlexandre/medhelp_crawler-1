            "answer": "There are several possible causes for haircoat changes and increased dander. In an older cat, I would recommend senior bloodwork to screen for internal disorders such as kidney/liver disease, or diabetes. During the physical exam, your veterinarian can assess possible spinal pain or arthritis which can restrict movement/grooming ability, +/- perform spinal xrays of she seems painful. If all the labwork/exam are fine, then I would recommend:1. Trial treatment for microscopic cheyletiella mites, which can cause dry scaling on the back.2. Supplementation with a daily oral omega 3/omega 6 suppplement such as EFA caps.3. Bathing q 1-4 weeks (as needed for control) with a mild antiseborrheic shampoo such as Sebolux or Sebalyt, or if bathing is not possible, try a topical anti-seborrheic spot on such as Douxo spot on (available through many veterinarians).4. Regular brushing with a soft brush to remove loose fur before it tangles. Many owner like the Furminator brush.5. Making sure she is eating a high quality balanced cat food--cheap pet foods or food that has been stored too long, or stored in hot environments can be nutritionally deficient, as can home prepared diets.6. A reduced fat diet such as Purina OM, and Increased exercise to reduce her weight so it is easier for her to groom. This can include getting several tall cat trees for her to climb, daily supervised play times with her chasing a feather on a string, and walks outside on a leash (always a big neighbor pleaser).Good luck,Kimberly Coyner, DVM DACVDwww.dermvetvegas.com",

    "question": "For most of her life she was an inside/outside cat. 3 years ago I moved to a more suburban area, very close to the edge of the city where there is lots of woodlands. There are also a lot of coyotes, so I can't let her outside anymore, besides the deck off of my 3rd story bedroom. She has always loved getting outside and rolling in the dirt and grass, but would always clean herself off and had a beautiful healthy coat. Since moving, she still gets to roll in the dust on the deck or occasionally in the garage, but doesn't clean herself like she used to. Her coat is still really soft and clean everywhere except along the top of her back and tailbone, which is now always dirty, with TONS of dander, and gets knotted very easily. She's in great shape, besides being a little fat, but still has full motion, but just doesn't, or can't, clean her back. I am wondering if there is something else going on?",
