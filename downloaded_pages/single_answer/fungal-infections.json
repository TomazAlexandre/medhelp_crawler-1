            "answer": "How are you? The symptoms and appearances of a fungal skin infection depend on the type of fungus causing it and the part of the body affected.You're more at risk from fungal infections if you: have recently taken a course of antibiotics, have been taking oral steroids, have diabetes, obese; and\u00a0\u00a0have a history of fungal infections .It would be good to: dry your skin carefully after bathing, wear loose fitting clothes and cotton underwear, avoid sharing towels, hair brushes, and combs, which could contain skin fragments that have fungal colonies. Antifungal treatments are usually applied directly to the skin in the infected area.I hope this helps. Take care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "I took up swimming about a year ago and I seem to be more susceptible to fungal infections since, especially in my groin area. I recently got a fungal infection under my glans, beneath my scrotum and near my anus. Fungal cream clears it up, but within a few weeks it comes back. I am taking a nasal steroid spray for hay fever and read some place that this can make you more prone to fungal infections. The infections are not much really, just a little itchy some times and a bit embarrassing. Any suggestions",
