            "answer": "Hello~Anxiety can cause all kinds of itching, so can allergies. Have you changed laundry detergents or bath soap? Have you been checked for diabetes, this can cause lots of itching as well. food allergies and environmental allergies can also cause the problem. I would see your doctor and ask for some blood tests to rule out any serious blood disorder, diabetes, etc. They should do an allergy panel, a CBC, and liver function tests, they probably will have others as well.",
