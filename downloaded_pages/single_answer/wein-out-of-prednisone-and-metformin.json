            "answer": "A few days after you cease taking the Prednisone & recover fully from the allergy attack you should see your levels drop. A side effect of Prednisone is that it raises glucose levels. And then a side effect of an allergy attack is the body releases cortisol to help fight inflammation but in turn raises glucose levels, a primary function of cortisol. On top of that benedryl too can raise glucose levels.If it remains high speak with your doctor as insulin may be needed for a short period period of time. Good luck",
