            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. In many cases, prompt diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause can reduce the risk for permanent nerve damage. For example, controlling diabetes may reduce diabetic neuropathy and renal dialysis often improves neuropathy that develops as a result of chronic renal failure.Treatment options for reducing pain include medication, injection therapy, and physical therapy. Surgery may be needed to treat some causes of neuropathy.Duloxetine hydrochloride has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Although anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and topiramate and antidepressants such as amitriptyline\u00a0\u00a0are not approved by the FDA to treat neuropathy, but they are often prescribed to treat this condition.Consult your physician for further assistance in treatment.Best.",
