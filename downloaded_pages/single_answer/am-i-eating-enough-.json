            "answer": "Dear Betina,Ou have been going through quite a bit of change and stress there so I am not surprised you feel this way. But you did such a good job getting a handle on your heart condition, I am sure you will do the same for diabetes(which by the way is not nearly as acute, so is definitely more forgiving that your heart condition on the whole).Based on the food you reported I think you may need additional carbohydrates in your diet. That overall was not enough food for the day as well. I do not know how much you weigh or your height, or if you are trying to lose weight--all this will help determine how many calories you should take in per day.I encourage you to jump on board and take control with diabetes the same way you did with your heart condition--you can do this! I am hay you are taking the meds but you do need to check your sugars too to make sure you are in range--being too high or too low is not good for you or your heart(or others in the street if you get dangerously low while driving, think about that too).You are going through a lot--stay in touch with your docs and therapist, talk to someone about it. It is common that people get depressed after a diagnosed heart condition or chronic disease and you have both, so it is a mouthful to swallow. If you are really depressed, please seek help soon. Don't be alone, you don't need to be.Take care.",

    "question": "I was told 4 days ago while in the hospital for heart related problems that I have the evil D. Along with this I have CHF, A-FIB, a biventricular pacer with an ICD, and numerous other things wrong with my heart.\u00a0\u00a0I took total control of my heart condition...researching, etc, following a strict heart diet and fluid restrictions.\u00a0\u00a0Never once have I felt sorry for myself and keep a positive attitude and crazy sense of humor about my condition.\u00a0\u00a0I was in the hospital for 5 days after my ICD fired 8 times within 40 minutes and my heart was just a tad out of control (HA).\u00a0\u00a0It was while I was in the hospital that I was told that I have the evil D. Ever since then I have been so depressed I won't even leave the house.\u00a0\u00a0I live alone and don't have any children and my family lives out of state. I am on an antidepressant and my wonderful psych knows how I feel.\u00a0\u00a0I am in total denial.\u00a0\u00a0I take Januvia 50mg and Amaryl 1mg but I refuse to use the monitor as in my mind this equals acceptance of the evil D.\u00a0\u00a0I have no trouble following the D diet as it is almost like a heart healthy diet....I don't do carbs and don't like sweets.\u00a0\u00a0I am keeping a food journal and would like your opinion as to whether I am eating enough.\u00a0\u00a0EXAMPLE:\u00a0\u00a0TUESDAY BREAKFAST: 2 slices 5 grain bread with Smart Balance peanut butter,\u00a0\u00a0LUNCH: I spent most of the day crying and was so out of control I forgot to eat,\u00a0\u00a0DINNER: 1/2 of a small baked chicken breast NO SALT, 3/4 cup pinto beans NO SALT\u00a0\u00a0with1 tablespoon of low fat sour cream and fresh salsa, and a small bowl of fresh fruit...melons, strawberries, grapes, and pineapple.\u00a0\u00a0Am I consuming enough calories for my meds to do their jobs ?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for taking time to read my lengthy and boring question.Betina",
