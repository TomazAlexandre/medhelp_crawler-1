            "answer": "A one time high or occasional high is not dangerous; what is dangerous is prolonged highs which can lead to diabetic complications including loss of limbs, blindness and kidney failure. You don't say anything about how long you have been diagnosed or what you are doing to control your blood sugar. If you have Type 1 diabetes you need to be on insulin; preferably a combination of basal (long-acting) and bolus (short acting for your meals) and work on getting those blood sugars in target. See your doctor or endo to learn how to control blood sugar.",
