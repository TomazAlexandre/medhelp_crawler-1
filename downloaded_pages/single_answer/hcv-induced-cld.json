            "answer": "Based on your description, it\u2019s possible your mother has developed decompensated cirrhosis. This condition needs to be confirmed by her doctor. If this is the case, then further treatment with interferon is generally not allowed; it can worsen her condition.In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplant will likely be required in the future, unfortunately.She should be monitored for esophageal varices, and perhaps a course of beta blockers (nadolol?) could be initiated to manage portal hypertension.Additionally, if confusion becomes an issue, Lactulose might be considered for management of encephalopathy.Periodic screening for the development of primary liver cancer via AFP tumor marker and ultrasound imaging is also a possibility.Have her continue seeing her doctor for ongoing care. Good luck to you, your mother and your family---Bill",
