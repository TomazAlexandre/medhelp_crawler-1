            "answer": "HI,There are a number of reasons for a high morning glucose after stable ones the night before: the effect of your night/evening medication running out too soon, effect of a late night snack, a natural rise in blood sugar seen in many people, and possibly a protective effect if you happened to go low at night. You should review your blood sugar logs and medication schedule with your doctor to see if anything needs to be adjusted to prevent this because high morning glucoses have been shown to have their own damaging effects in people with diabetes.Take care.",
