            "answer": "Hi,It will help us to know the extent of damage and the location of 5th and 6th vertebra that were damaged in the accident.A CT scan or MRI of spine will help in assessing the damage. If the damage is severe enough to cause nerve compression and physical therapy is not helping then surgery needs to be considered.It is also important to rule out peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes and B12 deficiency and thyroid dysfunction. This requires a complete neurological work up so please consult a neurologist.Keep us posted!",
