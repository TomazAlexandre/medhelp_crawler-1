    "question": "I am 74 years of age and have type 2 diabetes ( for\u00a0\u00a0around 14 years). I am obliged to take 2 insulin injections (18 units units twice a day). My general health is pretty good , \\I take fairly strenuous exercise 3 times a week in a gym and consider that my mental health is also pretty good. I have developed iriitis in my left eye (3 weeks approx) and am being treated by\u00a0\u00a0the local hospital with eye drops (some sort of steroid)over this period.. I had iritis about 50 years ago which dragged on for a few months but never had a recurrence until now.My question is whether my diabetes and age could be contributory factors to this recurrence?I do not suffer any excessive joint pain and am pretty mobile am able to walk without difficulty and also swim as part of my exercise routine.Any observations you have on this would be most welcomeThank you\u00a0\u00a0Victor Greaves",
