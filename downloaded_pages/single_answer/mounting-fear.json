            "answer": "Check with your doctor about a referral to a cardiologist. You don't mention your age, but because your pressure is not under optimal control and because you may have a slightly compromised ejection fraction, a carido appt. might be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0The shortness of breath, fatigue and occasional chest pain should be investigated.\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever had a cardio workup?\u00a0\u00a0Is your diabetes under control?Sorry about the pneumonia.\u00a0\u00a0That could explain some of your current symptoms, but following up with your doctor as well as a cardio is probably still a good idea.",

    "question": "After a bout with pnemonia, my dr found that my heart was enlarged and had fluid. He ordered an echocardiogram and found that my ejection fraction is 50. He changed my blood pressure meds from Altace to Diovan. My blood pressure stayed around 160/95. The dr added Toprol XL at bedtime - my bp still is around 163/105 with my heartbeat sometimes to fast to even register on my machine. It averages 95.This has been going on for almost 2 months and I am continually short of breath, tired, and have some pain in my chest. Should I see a cardiologist? I'm starting to get a little scared. (I also had 2 small strokes 6 yrs ago and I'm diabetic.)What should I be doing to crrect my situation?",
