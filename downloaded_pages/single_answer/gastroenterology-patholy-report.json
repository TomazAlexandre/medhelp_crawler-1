            "answer": "Hi there,A complete medical evaluation is very important for correct diagnosis and management. Chronic gastritis may be seen in conditions like Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) gastritis or with gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) .Chronic gastritis may also be caused by other medical conditions like Crohn\u2019s disease, certain connective tissue disorders, and liver or kidney failure. If you are not finding any relief with the prescribed medications it is suggested to consult your attending doctor. I hope it helps.Best wishes and regards!",
