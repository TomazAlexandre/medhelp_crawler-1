    "question": "I have been feeling strange symptoms for the past seven years already though I don't experience heartburn or acid reflux.\u00a0\u00a0I often feel something in the area immediately below the junction of my rib cage comparable to the feeling of a clamped nerve, twisted stomach or tensed muscle which is uncomfortable but not painful.\u00a0\u00a0Hence, I don't do situp exercises anymore.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms becomes more intense when my stomach is empty and I'm taking deep breaths (especially when exhaling) while lying down in bed.\u00a0\u00a0It makes me feel debilitated at times so I would just sleep and the symptoms become milder when I wake up.\u00a0\u00a0My bowel is affected too.\u00a0\u00a0I would feel some discomfort in the area in the morning after waking up but the stool won't come out until I get up from my bed which means that I have lost the normal push to defecate and I am now dependent on gravity for my bowel movement.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, I have lost 10 pounds (I'm 5' 7\" and I used to weigh 130 pounds) even if I haven't reduced my food intake and I feel weak even after eating.\u00a0\u00a0Further, I noticed that I easily get tired and feel sleepy even after sleeping for 8 hours.\u00a0\u00a0There are times that I pass thin stools but most of the time my stools are shapeless.\u00a0\u00a0I had already underwent lower GI xray, transrectal ultrasound, abdominal ultrasound, stool examination, lipase test, liver function tests but the tests did not reveal anything.I would appreciate any feedback from anyone with similar symptoms regarding diagnosis and possible remedy. Thanks",
