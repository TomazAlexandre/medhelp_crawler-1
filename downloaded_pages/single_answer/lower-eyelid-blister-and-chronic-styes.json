            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Stye or hordeolum as it is medically called could be recurrent due to diabetes, recurrent touching of eye, poor hygiene, immunoglobulin M (IgM) deficiency, dry eyes, and chronic infection of eyelids. Warm compress, topical antibiotics and good person hygiene usually does the trick. It could be that you have a localized collection of pus in the lower eyelid which is acting as the source of infection. The bloody blister could be a capillary leak that has got localized. Please consult an eye specialist for confirmed diagnosis and treatment. Take care!",

    "question": "A few months ago I had a stye in my lower eye lid. I seem to get them pretty often lately. After I used hot compressess and erythromicin it went down considerably but I still had a small whitish lump inside my eyelid that never really went away. It doesnt hurt but I think I may have irritated it while sleeping and I have what looks like a bloody, painless blister inside my eyelid.I've had two styes in the past 4 months. What could be causing these chronic styes and what can I do about my blister? I never rub or touch my eyes with dirty hands and am very clean. I am an occasional smoker....maybe 3-4 times a week I wonder if that could be the cause? Please help!!",
