            "answer": "Hi. Just thought I would let you know that a low B12 can cause tingling sensations like you described. All they need to do is draw some blood to check your vitamin levels.\u00a0\u00a0So it's def. worth checking. You can google vitamin b12 deficiencies for more info. Don't give up to figure out the problem. I know all to well that it sometimes takes doctors too long to diagnois a problem.\u00a0\u00a0I will pray for you that it is nothing more serious.\u00a0\u00a0Try to relax and know you can get through anything. ~Praying for a cure~",

    "question": "I am a 33 year old male.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last week I have started to experience mild tingling in my left arm/hand and leg/foot.\u00a0\u00a0Also on the left side of my scalp.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have pain, headache, loss of vision, hearing, numbness, dizzyness, or muscle weakness.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 3 inner ear infections (I think) in the last 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0The tingling is intermitent in my arm and leg and the top left side of my scalp just kind of feels like something is sitting on it.\u00a0\u00a0I met with my Doctor and he did a basic exam, looking at my eyes, ears, throat and examining my back and neck.\u00a0\u00a0He also listened to my lungs.\u00a0\u00a0He did not seem overly concerned, but ordered an MRI of the neck and head to make sure.I injured my neck in high school and had an MRI and physical therapy about 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Before therapy, I was experiencing strong pain/numbness in my neck and left shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0The MRI showed bone spurs.\u00a0\u00a0I have only had a few issues with that since therapy.I lift weights about 3-4 times per week, and do fairly heavy vertical press weight with my shoulders in particular.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have a family history of cancer, heart attack, or stroke.\u00a0\u00a0My Grandfather does have type 2 diabetes.Hopefully this is enough info.\u00a0\u00a0I am very worried, but don't know if I should be.\u00a0\u00a0I of course am picturing the worst - brain tumor, ms, stroke.\u00a0\u00a0Can you offer me some words of wisdom or comfort?\u00a0\u00a0What might I be experiencing?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!!",
