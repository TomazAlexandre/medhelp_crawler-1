They tested for the causes you mentioned and found nothing.\u00a0\u00a0It has been 18 months, and after several nightmare I&D's, multiple antibiotics (unnecessary because there was no bacterial infection), prednisone, and a mastectomy that was cancelled at the last minute, I am now \"under expectant management\" (wait and see).",

    "question": "I have just been diagnosed with GM after a core biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0This is after seeing 3 breast specialists AND 3 rheumatologists (its taken over a year to finally be properly diagnosed).\u00a0\u00a0Mine is bilateral and extremely painful.I know very little about this disease as I am aware it is extremely rare and there is little on the internet about it. But what I have found is that GM can develop from TB, Sarcoidosis, Fungal and Bacterial infections, Diabetes and parasites (ie.bilhartzia which I was really surprised to read). My question is, has anyone on here actually discovered an underlying disease that has caused their GM?\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for TB and fungal and Bacterial infections but not the others.I diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis 4 years ago and I am on autoimmune suppressants and steriods (I know this is one treatment for GM) and although I am taking these drugs for my RA this has made no difference to my breast.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been on a course of antibiotics but that made no difference.\u00a0\u00a0So what next?\u00a0\u00a0My breast surgeon has suggested, due to my age at 42, bringing my menopause forward early as he believes my case is purely hormonal. Has anyone tried this?So fed up with this bloomin deep dull heavy constant pain.",
