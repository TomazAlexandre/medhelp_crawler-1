    "question": "My husband, who has Type I Diabetes, was recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II. His doctor prescribed Oxcarbazepine (daily) and Propranolol to use as needed for anxiety/mania attacks--but I see Oxcarbazepine AND diabetes drugs listed in the \"caution\" section of interactions for Propranolol. My question is, of course, are they safe to use in combination if he is also a type I diabetic, and secondly, why didn't she prescribe a more specific anti-anxiety medication like a valium? I worry that Propranolol seems more of a blood pressure med.Thank you,Jennirane",
