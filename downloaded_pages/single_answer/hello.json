    "question": "We just moved from Texas to New York and are still feeling our way around. We miss our family doctor and don\u2019t have any idea how to find the right physician here. My wife suffers from High blood pressure and my younger son has diabetes so they need constant monitoring. I am basically looking in NY area. A colleague suggested Walk in Clinic NYC but frankly, I have no idea what kind of doctors and services I can expect from there. Does it actually mean that I can walk in at a short notice without any prior appointment? or is there any appointment form on the website?If yes can i get the website",
