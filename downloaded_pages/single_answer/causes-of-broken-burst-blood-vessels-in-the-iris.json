            "answer": "Very unlikely for this to happen. It would be called a spontaneous iris hemorrhage. Causes: intraocular inflammatory disorders, malpositioned intraocular artificial lens, trauma (direct blow to the eye or eye socket), iris neovascularization (from diabetes for instance). Terson's Syndrome is usually from trauma to the crushing of the thoracic or abdominal cavity, but this usually causes hemorrhage of the retina or vitreous cavity.Best wishes,Timothy D. McGarity, M.D.",

    "question": "I have heard that blood vessels in the white part of the eye can burst/break (subconjunctival haemorrhage) due to strain like heavy coughing and sneezing etc ,but can heavy strain also cause blood vessels in the iris to burst/break? if so what would the symptoms be?",
