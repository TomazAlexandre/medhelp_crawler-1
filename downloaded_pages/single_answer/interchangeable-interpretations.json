            "answer": "The term neuropathy is an extremely general term for anything that could be wrong with the nerves. If however, you are referring to a peripheral neuropathy meaning the nerves in your legs or arms having symtpoms of numbness, tingling or weakness, then a workup for this disorder certainly would include lab tests to look for B12 deficiency/ pernicious anemia, diabetes, thyroid disease, muscle abnormalities, folate, syphillis, immune protein disorders among other things that can cause these symptoms. All of these things are done in an effort to find the cause for the neuropathy as each one can itself be the reason for the symptoms. Hope that helps.",
