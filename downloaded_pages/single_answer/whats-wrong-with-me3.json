            "answer": "Hi,If you get nocturnal erections, then one thing is sure is that you don\u2019t have any problem of erectile dysfunction. Hence, it seems like the problem is more of psychological in nature and there\u2019s unlikely to be any other pathology like diabetes, hypertension or any neurological disease which is interfering in the erections. The anxiety to perform is what leads to this erectile dysfunction. I think for the initial few times you can do mutual masturbation and then only progress to sexual intercourse. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
