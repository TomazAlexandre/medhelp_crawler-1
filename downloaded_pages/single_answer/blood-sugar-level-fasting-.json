            "answer": "It's called the Dawn Phenomenon and is fairly common in Type 2 Diabetics. If you search Dawn Phenomenon and Diabetes you can read on the mechanism. Good for you for losing weight and monitoring your diet. 128 is too high for a fasting blood sugar, unfortunately. You might want to be screened by your doctor, especially considering your genetics.",

    "question": "My father has had diabetes for 35 years now. My blood sugar level is higher while fasting than during the day. I have lost about 25 pounds in the last 2 years, and watch what I am eating.I am scared that I will become diabetic too. Last night before going to bed\u00a0\u00a0my reading was 112, while this morning 128.Is that normal? Anyone can explain why the blood sugar level is higher in the morning? Isn't it supposed to be the other way around?",
