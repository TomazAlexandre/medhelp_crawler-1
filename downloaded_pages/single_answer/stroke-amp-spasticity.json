    "question": "Posted By Wayne Crouse on May 06, 1997 at 03:18:03:Help please! I awoke one morning with numbness on the left side and was diagnosed as having suffered a \"mild\" stroke. I am a male, 50, with Type II diabetes well-controlled by diet. I am having a terrible time with knotted muscles on my left side. I believe this is known as spasticity. This condition saps my strength and is very persistent. Is this common in stroke? Are there medicines or treatments that are helpful. My physician admits he is not up on the latest medications.",
