            "answer": "Oh, I'm so sorry you're going through all this.\u00a0\u00a0I am going through the same thing, except that God blessed me with my now 4 year old boy.\u00a0\u00a0I have been dealing with PCOS for a long time too (not as long as you).\u00a0\u00a0Lately I have been letting things be without even trying to alleviate them because I'm dealing with other tough issues, but I'm about to start worrying about myself a little more. The very first time I knew something was wrong when I hadn't had a period in three years.\u00a0\u00a0I gained a lot of weight and do you know what helped?\u00a0\u00a0A low carb diet (usually no carbs or just a bowl of Corn Flakes in the morning and no carbs for the rest of the day) and I lost a lot of weight and started ovulating again pretty fast.\u00a0\u00a0I had my period back for a while and that's when I conceived my son!\u00a0\u00a0I'm very glad that I did of course.\u00a0\u00a0After I had him, I stopped getting my period again, but you know how it goes; life happens and you get busy with other things.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard to always maintain a diet so that you can keep ovulating, but it's possible.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to start again this coming week because even though I don't eat much and have no junk food, I still gained weight and it affects me emotionally.\u00a0\u00a0Try it out.\u00a0\u00a0Start a low carb diet and hopefully it will work for\u00a0\u00a0you too and you'll start ovulating soon. Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0I know it's hard, but try to stay positive.\u00a0\u00a0Stress only contributes to the problem and affects ovulation too.",

    "question": "I AM 31 YRS OLD. I HAVE HAD PCOS FOR 13 YRS. I HAVE HAD ONE MISCARRIAGE WHEN I WAS 17. I HAVE TRIED TO GET PREGNANT EVER SINCE. I HAVE THE WEIGHT GAIN, HAIR GROWTH, THINNING HAIR, AND THE DARK SPOTS. I CAN HAVE AN ORGASM BUT IT TAKES A WHILE, IT DOESN'T MAKE IT EASY WHEN YOU HAVE NO URGE TO DO IT. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HATE THE HAIR ON MY BODY I FEEL LIKE CRYING EVERYTIME I TAKE A SHOWER. I HAVE TRIED TO WAX IT BUT IT HURTS SO BAD. THE THINING OF MY HAIR ON MY HEAD IS NOT AS BAD AS IT COULD BE BUT I'M A HAIR STYLIST. I JUST WANNA KNOW WHEN THERE IS GOING TO BE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE THING. IT'S HARD ENOUGH I HAVE HYPERTENSION AND JUST BEEN TOLD I HAVE DIABETES. I WANT A CHILD SO DEARLY, AND I'M TELLING MYSELF JUST TO EXCEPT THAT I'M NOT EVER GOING TO BE A MOTHER. BUT MY HEART DOES NOT WANT TO HEAR IT. MY STEPDAUGHTER THAT I HAVE RAISED IS PREGNANT AND I WANNA BE EXCITED FOR HER BUT IT'S KILLING ME INSIDE. I JUST WANT TO GIVE UP ON DAILY THINGS. IT'S A STRUGGLE JUST TO PUT MY WORK CLOTHES ON. SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT TO DO?",
