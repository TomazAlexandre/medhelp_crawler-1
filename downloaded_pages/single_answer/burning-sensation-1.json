            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Hope diabetes has been ruled out. As your symptoms could be due to Small fiber sensory neuropathy (SFSN), which is a disorder in which only the small sensory cutaneous nerves are affected and is often due to diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism (i.e. early or pre-diabetic state) and may progress to typical diabetic polyneuropathy. This is usually not detected by nerve conduction studies and needs a skin biopsy to make a diagnosis. Other causes like vitamin deficiencies, alcohol consumption and certain medications can cause neuropathy. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
