    "question": "I have had UC for 30 years. I have had few flareups and my last colonoscopy a year ago revealed mild dysplasia. I had a very severe flareup from Feb. 2007 until June of 2007 during which time I was taking a decreasing dose of prednisone starting at 1mg/kg bid which I finished with around June 14. I was also taking mesalamine 1.2g tid.\u00a0\u00a0I had typical side effects from prednisone and have been loosing my hair probably due to the mesalamine. My GP recently ran a panel and discovered me to be pre-diabetic [fasting BG of 103].\u00a0\u00a0I have had no other diagnostics run around the pre-diabetes so I am not sure if it is due to life style/diet or is related to the long-term prednisone causing insulin resistance and resulting inbility of the pancreas to produce insulin.\u00a0\u00a0My gastroenterologist wants me to start azothioprine. I am concerned about the potential for blood dyscrasias and the association w/ pancreatitis. So - neither one of the drugs which would put me into remission feel like viable choices. What is your opinion about a pre-emptive colectomy?\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned that if I want until the next flareup the tissue will be so unhealthy that surgery might not be an option.\u00a0\u00a0Just looking for an alternative opinion. Thanks.",
