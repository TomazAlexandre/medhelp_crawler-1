            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The sensations of pins and tingling are generally due to peripheral neuropathies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. In your mother\u2019s case femorals would be a good place to start with. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism and diabetes. Get a thyroid antibody test too.Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis and G B Syndrome (not likely in your mother\u2019s case) are two other possibilities. Nerve infections as in Lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My mother has been having pain on her joints especially on the thigh bones radiating up to the hip bones. She has been on and off on anti-athritis drugs. Three days ago, she started developing tingling pain allover the body, headache and vomiting. Blood test was done to rule out malaria and she was negative. She was told by a doctor that she has bacterial infection. What could be the cause or possible diagnosis of her illness?",
