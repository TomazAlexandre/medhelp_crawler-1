            "answer": "Hi,Your problems seems to be of NOT Neurologic nature only.Overdependence could possibly cause muscle wasting .Have a close watch on your 'work-out 'programmes,do not over strain your muscles to the levels of becoming fatigue.If you lift too much of weight it can cause disc prolapse which in turn can lead to muscle weakness. Age related muscular weakness is another possibility.From Metabolic disorders and cardiac diesease to Hereditary causes, there are a gamut of reasons for leg weakness, Adrenoleukodystrophy is a condition which can cause leg weakness.A cardiac cause like Aortic Coarctation can cause leg weakness too ,conditions called 'Auto-Immune Thyroid dieseas' can lead to leg weakness too.Classic migraine can have symptoms of leg weakness.Please consult the general physician to rule out such causes in addition to a few other Metabolic disorders also.Blood related leg wekness like in Porphyria is to ruled out as well.The following Lab tests would help in diagnosing the causeBlood tests:Full blood count, platelets, ESR, ElectrolytesBlood sugar to detect diabetes which can cause peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve lesions, increased risk of strokesThyroid function test (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism may have muscle weakness)Lipid profile looking for high cholesterol can increase risk of strokesClotting screen if thrombotic stroke in young person or recurrent thrombotic disease to detect antithrombin III deficiency, protein C or S deficiency, lupus anticoagulant\u00a0\u00a0-Clots can cause lowering of blood supply to muscle tissues and then cause pain.Radiology investigations :Lumbosacral spine X-rayCT Scan or MRI of Lumbosacral spine - can detect nerve root entrapment in the intervertebral foramina of the lumbosacral spine or a disc prolapse.Carotid artery Doppler - to measure flow through arteries to brain.CT Scan Brain to detect stroke , brain massECG - to detect atrial fibrillation that may have caused a stroke; can detect a recent heart attack that can predispose to a stroke.Nerve Conduction studies:Electromyography - to diagnose entrapment syndromes of peripheral nerve.Apart from this other Hereditary reasons like Hereditary amyloidosis,Hereditary neuropathy and Hereditary spastic paraplegis should be ruled out.Good luck.",
