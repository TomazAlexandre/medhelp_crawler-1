Low levels can be due poor intake of folic acid rich food (green leafy vegetables, yellow fruits, avocado, beans, lentils, cauliflower etc) or due to malabsorption syndromes (IBS, tropical sprue, Crohn\u2019s, celiac etc) or due to eating disorders causing malnutrition.\u00a0\u00a0Supplement this through diet and medication and see if it helps.The symptoms are also seen in seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, hyper and hypothyroidism, lupus, and Lyme\u2019s. Multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonism, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, low vitamin B12 or low vitamin D, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. and certain epilepsies too could be the cause. It can be benign fasciculation syndrome if all causes are ruled out.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps.
