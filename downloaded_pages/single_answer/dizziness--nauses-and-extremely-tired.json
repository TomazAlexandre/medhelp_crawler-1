    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with Hypertension after I had an episode of extreme vertigo and was started on Benicar HCT 20/12.5 mg once a day. My BP on the day of diagnosis was around 150/100. Since I started on the medication, I continue to experience dizziness especially on change of positions, sometimes accompanied by nausea and I also have extreme exhaustion. My BP runs around 104/72 now. I was diagnosed with Diabetes type2 about a year ago which is now controlled by diet, exercise and metformin 500 mg twice daily.I am also experiencing delayed menstruation by about 16 days.What could be causing these symptoms? Should I ask my doctor for some more specific tests to rule out any illness/condition? I am a 40 year old female.",
