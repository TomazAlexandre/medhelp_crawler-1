    "question": "Posted By dan on July 14, 1999 at 13:12:15I am a 34 year-old male who has had insulin-dependent diabetes for 12 years.\u00a0\u00a0My diabetes is under excellent control, and I have absolutely no apparent complications from the diabetes, nor other health problems, other than the following condition.Two years after being diagnosed with the diabetes (i.e. ten years ago), I began to experience difficulty voiding - difficulty to start the stream, inability to completely empty my bladder, and reduced flow pressure.\u00a0\u00a0My doctors assumed that it was prostititis (i.e. not diabetes related), and treated me first with antibiotics, and then later with medication to relax the bladder opening and increase bladder strength. These treatments did not noticably improve my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Cystoscopy showed no obstructions, and after about 5 years of these symptoms, and with cystometrics showing that my bladder muscle contraction was very weak, I was put on intermittent cathertization - which I have continued (without problem) for 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0As I have absolutely no other symptoms or neurological complications, my doctors are not sure whether this has anything to do with my diabetes, or is some isolated problem.\u00a0\u00a0Two questions:1) In almost every case of neurogenic bladder that I have seen, there are additional neurologic symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any information on the possible causes (or treatment) for such isolated bladder dysfunction?2)\u00a0\u00a0My doctor feels that a complete neurologic work-up would be pointless, since after ten years with this condition, and no other symptoms or problems, whatever the cause of the problem is he feels it to be localized.\u00a0\u00a0Although the condition causes me relatively little difficulty, I am still uneasy though about what may be the source of it.\u00a0\u00a0Would any other tests be advisable at this time?Follow Ups:Re: neurogenic bladder - possible complication of diabetes HFHS M.D.-AT 8/10/1999(0)",
