            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0It is very difficult to say whether you can get total hip replacement or not. If there is persistent infection, then this needs to be treated first. Also, if you have diabetes or an immune system disease, then chances of persistent infection are high. Hence, this factor should be looked into. If your doctor ca control infection with intra-articular antibiotic injections prior to the operation, then maybe yes, you will be able to get total hip replacement. Take a second opinion regarding this.Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "After a girdlestone can you get another hip?I have had 6 hip replacements due to dislocations & infections. On the 7th year the Doctor was going to try to put a custom made prosthetic in but due to infection he had to do a girdlestone procedure instead.\u00a0\u00a0The infection only comes out when the prosthetic is put into the hip & it causes the ball not to adhere to it.It's been approx 1 year since the girdlestone was done & I've been living life from a wheel chair.My question is;\u00a0\u00a0Is there anyway (anytime) that I could have a hip prosthetic put in again one day?Thank youTerrarific",
