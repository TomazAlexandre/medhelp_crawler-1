    "question": "My dad had a bad eye accident. He fell on a sharp object that penetrated his eye. They were able to put the eye back together but he has lost his lens and his iris from the injury and had 20 stitches in the sclera. The retina was also detached and they performed a vitrectomy 10 days later to reattached the retina and put in silicone oil. The doctor mentioned that there was a lot of bleeding in the eye. After the surgery my dad was able to see a light and some shadows. Unfortunately 2 weeks later, the retina is detached again from the right and the bottom and there is PVR in the eye and bleeding. The retina is continuing to detach every day and the eyesight is almost non existent.The Dr is planning on doing a scleral buckle and a vitrectomy to remove PVR and reattach the retina but he is hesitant on the surgery and is not guaranteeing anything.\u00a0\u00a0My dad is 74 and overweight and he has COPD, sleep apnea, and mild diabetes but they are insisting on full anesthesia.\u00a0\u00a0So here are my the questions: 1) Will the injured eye handle such a complicated surgery? 2) Is it worth taking the risk for the surgery with his health conditions and full anestesia? 3) Will there be a lot of pain after the surgery? 4) Is Scleral buckle the way to go? 5) What happens if he does not do the surgery? 6) Will this affect his other eye (he recenty had catarct surgery in it). My Dad does not want to lose his eye or completely give up on his eyesight yet even though there is very slim hope. His eye hurts and\u00a0\u00a0is sensitive to the light.\u00a0\u00a0Please advise asap? Thanks in advance.",
