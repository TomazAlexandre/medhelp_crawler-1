            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I can understand your concern and believe me this needs a lot of investigations to know what could be wrong. To begin with you need a MRI of the brain and upper cervical spine to find out if there is a lesion or nerve compression. Blood pressure should be checked. Get blood tests for anemia, diabetes and thyroid problems as this can be the cause of fatigue and headache.If you do not have insurance, see if there is a walk in clinic you can approach.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
