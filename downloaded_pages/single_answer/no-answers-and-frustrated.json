    "question": "I have read many posts on here and sounds like many are going through similar concerns as I am experiencing so I definitely feel for you all.\u00a0\u00a0Mine started about 3 1/2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I suddenly got this weird ice/hot tingling sensation on my left shoulder blade as I was washing dishes one day.\u00a0\u00a0Since that day those sensation have continued in multiple spots throughout my body.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I have to check to see if I spilled ice cold water on myself as that is the feeling that sometimes it starts out as, then moves into a more warm sensation, very difficult to explain.\u00a0\u00a0I also have involuntary eye movement - horizontally back and forth - mainly when I am writing/reading/or move my eyes too quickly.\u00a0\u00a0My MRI was negative, also all Rheumatology blood work negative except for some inflammation present.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to forget about this for awhile but it seemed to not go away and more symptoms continued like eyelid twitching, muscles cramping mainly in calf, thigh, and abdomen, also muscle twitching all over, goose bumps on one side of my head, severe constipation in which no meds have helped and GI doc doesn' t know what the issue is, \"brain zaps\" through body, occasionally dragging my left foot to where I trip over it, restless leg syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen a 2nd neurolgist more recently - EMG was normal, blood work so far normal, and the only thing he has indicated is that I have hyperflexia.\u00a0\u00a0This is extremely frustrating, I am not in \"pain\" but whatever this is is very annoying and concerning.\u00a0\u00a0I do and I don't want a diagnosis - I want to find out what is going on but am scared of what that may mean.\u00a0\u00a0How do you all cope with not getting answers?\u00a0\u00a0I sometimes feel this is all in my head but then I know it is not - I cannot be making up this.\u00a0\u00a0What to do???",
