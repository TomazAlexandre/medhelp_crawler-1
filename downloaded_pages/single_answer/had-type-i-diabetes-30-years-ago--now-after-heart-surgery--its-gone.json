            "answer": "Hello LeeAs you may know, we're all volunteers here and not physicians.I'm assuming your cousin had Type 2, since those of us with Type 1 have an autoimmune disease which does not reverse.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms of type 2 symptoms can go away if folks lose weight, become more active and generally live within the limits of their stressed/impaired insulin using abilities.Needs for insulin are also affected by illness, infection, stress, etc.\u00a0\u00a0For many folks our insulin needs increase and yet for others they decrease.If your cousin has made lifestyle changes that contribute to his staying within range, encourage him to maintain that course.\u00a0\u00a0Also encourage him to stay in contact with his docs so they can track longer term numbers such as his \"a1c\" test that measures an average blood sugar over 3-4 months.At this point, none of the insulin he took is still working.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on the type he was taking, it would have had an effect for several hours up to a day or so.\u00a0\u00a0If he getting blood sugar readings within the target range while taking insulin, it was doing its job.\u00a0\u00a0If he was having a lot of low blood sugars, that should've been addressed *at that time* with his doctors and they would've adjusted his dosing.\u00a0\u00a0It's not uncommon that our needs change.",

    "question": "My cousin, age 65 was diagnosed with Type I diabetes in 1977. He was prescribed 18 units of insulin daily which he injected religiously. In January of this year he had bypass surgery performed. I am sure there were many drugs applied before, during and after the surgery. He has not had an injection since, his numbers are in the correct range, and the doctors are not able to explain what might have caused his pancrease to reawaken. He would like to know what is going on. Was he misdiagnosed? Is the admission of 18 units of insulin okay if you have a low level of insulin production? He would like to know. How may he find out? Thank you for responding.I am his 1st cousin on my Father's side. I am writing on his behalf because he is not Internet literate.Lee Calamaio",
