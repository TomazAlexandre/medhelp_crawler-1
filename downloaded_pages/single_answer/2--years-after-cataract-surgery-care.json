            "answer": "Consider this: each year that we get older the incidence of eye diseases like glaucoma, cataracts , macular degeneration, eye blood vessel disease increases. Also consider that diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure and thyroid disease, high cholesterol often show up in the eye.Consider: who would you rather take care of your eyes a MD physician that has a college degree, been to medical school, done an intership and has taken a 3 to 5 year residency/fellowship and can provide complete comprehensive medical and surgical care of the eyes AND is a physician.or see a non-physician, limited scope optometrist that has some college and has gone to optometry school and is limited by law to taking care of minor problems.consider also that the cost of the exam is usually very nearly the same and that if you see the MD physician ophthalmologist there is a much better chance your care will be covered under your health insurance.Why not see the ophthalmologist and treat your precious eyes with the best care available.JCH III MD",

    "question": "I had cataract surgery 2\u00bd years ago.My vision is good except for glare and poor low light contrast vision, which is just the nature of the intraocular lens beast. It's not bad enough to consider a YAG (not worth the risk to me).I have a crystalens and a Restor.My question is: Is it necessary to see an ophthalmologist for an annual exam, or will an optometrist do?I got my glasses from an optometrist who is not part of the ophthalmologist's practice.Thank you.",
