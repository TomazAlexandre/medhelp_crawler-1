            "answer": "Hi,Thank you for writing in on behalf of your Dad.Oftentimes, even after a stable period of glucoses, some persons with diabetes start having changes in their glucose control as their own obodies produce less insulin, and thus makes it harder to control. It may not have been anything that your dad did, or ate etc, but instead the natural course of his diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0That said, meeting with a diabetes nutritionist may help to ensure his carbs are spread throughout the day and his nutrition/meals are optimized for his situation.Also, be sure to check that new medications(even non-diabetic meds) may not be part of the issue.Herbals included.In regard to the low BS, the fact that he has few symptoms when it is low means that his body has gotten used to being low and does not react the same way anymore(this is called \"hypoglycemic unawareness\"). This is not a good thing to happen because although the sweating,trembling etc is frightening to patients and their families, it does serve as a good alarm system when glucoses are going low. Without that, your Dad's sugars can drop low without warning and this is very dangerous.Right now in my opinion, the most important thing is to get his hypoglycemia unawareness reversed if possible. This may mean letting his blood sugars run a little higher than normal for a while to \"re-set\" his body's alarm system. Speak with his doctor about this please.The next step would be stabilizing his sugars overall and I am afraid it may take, as your doctor said, some trial and error with different medication doses and combinations. Your Dad's best contribution to this would be continuing to take his meds at the same time everyday, spreading his carbs out evenly during the day, keeping track of what activity/exercise is doing to his sugars etc. It may take some work but it is worth it in the end.Take care.",

    "question": "hi! was wonderin if ne1 cud help me... am actually here 4 my dad. he's 54 & has been a diabetic for several years now. recently we've found that his blood sugar has been fluctuating like crazy. there have even been instances where d range has been as low as 40 with no other side effects whatsoever. have heard that when blood sugar drops so low there should be other symptoms ranging from shivering to loss of consciousness but he's experienced none of these.dad used to take 18 milli insulin shots every mornin & evenin combined with glucovance tablets (500 mg per 5 mg). with the onset of the fluctuations he's been trying to reduce his dose of insulin to 15 or even 12. but the readings are still not under control. his early morning tests show ranges newhere between 60-140 and his evening readings (before dinner) range from 100-220.our doctor said there's nothing to do but bring the levels under control by experimenting with different doses of insulin. but in d meanwhile im concerned bout d impact such fluctuations will have on his health. also id like 2 kno why dis problem arose all of a sudden. his blood suagr levels have been pretty constant over d years & he's meticulous bout a controlled diet & exercise. we\u00a0\u00a0havent made any drastic changes in diet or routine recently except mayb dat we've cut down a bit on d non-veg & he's started munching on water-soaked fenugreek seeds as we heard dis is good for diabetics... but cud dis really result in such drastic changes?wil som1 out dere please help a concerned daughter wid an explanation or suggestions for what to do next?",
