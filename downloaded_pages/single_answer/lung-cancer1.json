            "answer": "Hi,Your question is best answered by his doctor. Survival is affected whether or not he has a chance for surgery, his overall medical status (the presence of other problems like hypertension and diabetes), how much the cancer is affecting his daily living, and whether or not the blood clots in the legs will affect options for treatment. If we only use the stage information you sent, the 5 year estimate for a stage 2 lung cancer would be about 26%. Discuss the options with the doctor well, and establish goals of each option. Stay positive.",
