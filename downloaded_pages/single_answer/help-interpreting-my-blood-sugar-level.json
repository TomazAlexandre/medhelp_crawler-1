    "question": "I don't have diabetes, but I don't know exactly where my numbers put me.I'm 5'8, 125 (fast metabolism), and generally healthy.I had a blood test two months ago (fasting), and my Glucose Serum was 106, Mean Plasma Glucose 104, and H1Ac was 5.1%.I started panicking, so I changed my diet a bit, started to do more regular exercises, and got another blood test about a month later.The results were identical, except that my Glucose Serum went from 106 to 100. The H1AC was still 5.1 and the Mean Plasma Glucose was still 104.What does all this mean?",
