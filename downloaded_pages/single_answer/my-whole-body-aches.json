    "question": "Hi. I'm 35 years old and I'm feeling like I'm 100. At first my hands started feeling weak at night and when I woke up. It lasted about five minutes and then it would go away. I also felt tingling in my thumb and index fingers (both hands). It's been three months and suddenly I started feeling upper back pain, pain in my shoulders and arms and nerve pain in my neck, my fingers and sometimes in my toes. Sometimes mi finger and knees hurt too. I hade some tests done I know I don't have arthritis nor diabetes. Please, can somebody tell me what can be wrong? I'm really, really worried. Thanks : (",
