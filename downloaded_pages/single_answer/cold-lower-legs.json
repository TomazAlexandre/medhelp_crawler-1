    "question": "Hi When sitting my lower legs begin to get uncomfortable and cool to touch.The tempature is about mid 30c.The air conditioner is on and the air movement seems to cause my discomfort (I am sweating the rest of my body)I find that if I put trousers on the discomfort goes .I have also found that when I go swimming and the water is cool my lower legs hurt (not my feet as these are always warm to touch).I have type two diabetes which is well controlled.Blood pressure good.Could this be signs of neuropathy.Thanks",
