            "answer": "Hi, the three conditions may not be related. For the pancreatic cyst, therapy depends on the size and the content of the cyst. And if it is causing any compressive symptoms. With the gallstones your mother may need removal of the gallbladder. Atherosclerosis, a disease where the 'fatty' material in the blood gets deposited in the walls of the blood vessels.
