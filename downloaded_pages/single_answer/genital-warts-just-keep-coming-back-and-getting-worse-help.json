            "answer": "A weak immune system is a breeding ground for GWs. You need to boost that system via vitamins, supplements, exercise, plenty of rest, eating healthy foods, no alcohol, no cigs, no or reduced stress, meditation, etc. Given your current health, some of this may not be possible but do the best as you can for now.",

    "question": "Quite embarrassing to be honest. My cheating ex husband left me with Genutal warts. I've had them frozen, I've had antibiotics, cream and I've even had surgery to have them removed but they just keep spreading and growing! They are all over my vagina and anus inside and out and even spreading onto my legs, I've got a hospital appointment next week(earliest they could see me) but I need help now. I have type 1 diabetes so my immune system is already compromised. They have grown that much that I can't even walk in sit down and are now burning and leaking. This is my last resort I need help now! PLEASE!!!!",
