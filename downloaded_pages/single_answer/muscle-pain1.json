            "answer": "Hello and hope you are fine.The exact cause can be confirmed only after I examine you. Pulled muscle, arm strain all can lead to weakness, severe pain and inability to lift arm. A sharp underarm pain that comes and goes can be the result of a muscle spasm or pleurisy. Pleurisy is usually caused by an infection and is most pronounced when you take a deep breath. Decreased motion of the shoulder joint can be due to diabetes mellitus, shoulder injury, hyperthyroidism etc.A clinical examination is must for correct diagnosis. Schedule an appointment with a doctor. Hope it helps.Best luck and take care!",
