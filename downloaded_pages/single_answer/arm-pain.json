            "answer": "You don't have symptoms that suggest any kind of a heart problem. Please set your mind at ease! You aren't going to have a heart attack! A stress test is pointless. I don't have any idea what you do have however. The fact the pain moves around is puzzling. I would suggest when you have a pain in a specific area mark this with a magic marker so you can tell the physician where the pain was days later when the pain goes away. I would suggest Ibuprufin, because it is generic and inexpensive.",

    "question": "I have been having some pains in the upper back near the shoulder blade. It seemed to move around from one side to the next\u00a0\u00a0then it moved to the front left chest and up to near my neck. I went to my internist who sent me to get a chest xray. He siad the report was okay nd it may be pleurisy(not sure of the spelling) I was told to take two aleve tablets daily. I am in pretty good conditin with no prior heart problem. I am a young 63 not really overwewight, but the only thing I do suffer from occasionally is arthritis in my legs which when I take a couple days of celebrex it goes away for months. Thats about the only problem that I have. I am physically active and usually walk three to four times weekly and I am very active and sttill working. Last week during the episode of the back and chest pain, which hurt to the touch, I had a small amount of pain in the left arm between the elbow and armpit. Yesterday and today it seems to be getting worse, however the chest and back pain are gone. It feels like somone is testing my blood pressure and pumping the ball too tight. Its off and on with the level of pain. Should I be checking further by getting a stress test or could this be another form of arthritis? How can I tell? The doctor had lsitened to my heart when I visited him but he said everything sounded okay. What can be the problem. My mother had no heart history and died\u00a0\u00a0at 94. My father died at 64 with a heart attack. Most of my uncles and aunts died form diabetes, which I am free of. TG. Please adivse.. Thanks,. Rose",
