Whenever you count carbs, you don't look at \" carbs from sugar\"\u00a0\u00a0or anything, you just look at total carbs on the package. The only exception is if the carbs from fiber are more than five than you can subtract that from the total. Also remember to count the milk and any fruit you put on the cereal. Although people without diabetes think all we have to avoid is sugar, really it is carbs altogether. Many of us can not eat cereal at all without spiking too high and have to eat eggs or something else for breakfast.",
