            "answer": "Hi,The \"sweet\" odor is can be associated with having ketones in the body, a sign that there is not enough insulin present. The only way to know if this is related to ketones is to have your mother check her urine with a urine dipstick (you can buy these at the pharmacy). They are useful to have at home to let you know if there are ketones in the urine. If the test is positive your mother should seek medical help immediately because this means she is not getting enough insulin and could become ill very quickly. If the test is negative, the odor is not likely associated with diabetes or insulin.Hope this helps.Take care.\\",
