            "answer": "If I understand your description correctly, the nodules in question were found on a CT scan of the heart.\u00a0\u00a0CT scanning is ever so more sensitive at detecting nodules, than is a routine chest x-ray.\u00a0\u00a0And, so, it is possible that the nodules were present a year ago, not evident on the x-ray, but might have been evident if a CT scan had been done at that time.Please see the abstract below.\u00a0\u00a0It is with reference to nodules 10 mm or smaller and the applicability of their recommendations is not diminished much if at all because of one 12 mm nodule.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------AuthorsFull Name\tvan't Westeinde, Susan C. de Koning, Harry J.

[Review] [87 refs]Source\t\tLung Cancer. 60(2):151-9, 2008 May.Abstract\tThe high frequency of non-calcified pulmonary nodules (NCN) 10mm do not carry across to sub-centimeter lesions. Purpose of this review is to provide a 10-step approach for routinely detected sub-centimeter NCN on a MDCT in healthy persons in order to be able to make an optimal discrimination between benign and malignant NCNs. Recommendations are primarily based on individual cancer risk, the presence or absence of calcifications and nodule size. In nodules >4-5mm nodule consistency, margin and shape should be taken into account. Next steps in the nodule evaluation are the assessment of localization, nodule number, presence or absence of growth and volume doubling time. Growth is defined as a volume doubling time of 400 days or less, based on volumetry. For nodules <4mm, a follow-up CT at 12 months is recommended in high risk persons, whilst for low-risk persons no follow-up is needed. If no growth is observed at 12 months, no further follow-up is required. For solid, smooth or attached indeterminate NCN between 5 and 10mm we recommend an annual repeat scan, whilst for purely intra-parenchymal nodules a 3-month repeat scan should be made to assess growth. Growing lesions with a volume doubling time <400 days require further work-up and diagnosis, otherwise an annual repeat scan to assess growth is recommended. [References: 87]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I suspect that your doctors have applied the same or similar principles to their evaluation of the nodules and combined these criteria with the negative positron emission tomography (PET) scan, although a relatively small proportion of such scans are false negatives, either with or without diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor\u2019s recommendation of repeat evaluation is, thus, reasonable.\u00a0\u00a0However, they might agree to do additional, albeit limited testing at 2 months, to assuage your anxiety.Good luck.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. I had a bi-lateral mastectami, with clear margins, no lymph node involvement. On a recent heart ct scan they found several lung nodules, 1 measuring 1.2 cm. These were not on my chest x-ray a year ago.I had a pet scan, and the doctor said it didn't show any signs of cancer. I have read that with diabetes you can sometimes get a false negative. My blood sugars have been running between 200-300, do you think that further testing will be required to make sure this is not cancer? My doctor isn't planning to check it again for 4 months, and that seems too long to me.",
