    "question": "i had unprotected sex a couple times about a year ago with a girl. My first time, her second (the second was his first time also) I've had swollen lymph nodes for about 5+ months now in my groin, and neck. I've had a sore throat about twice since they've been swollen, not anything serious though, but i am always tired, i have no energy most days. i have also noticed tiny red bumps, barley even visable, they are scattered across my body mostley on my legs, arms, and hands. Not itchy just, or painful in anyway, and they will not pop.I went to the doctor and got a blood test for anemia/mono/diabetes, the test came back negitive for all 3. If i had a std would this show up on that blood test? or if anyone has any idea what it could be thanks.",
