            "answer": "Hi, if you are having repeated episodes of lightheadedness or dizziness, then you will have to check with your doctor to see if the stent is functioning well.\u00a0\u00a0And if the ejection fraction is good. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. So, if your symptoms persist consult your doctor at the earliest. Regards.",

    "question": "stent 6 months ago for cto mid lad. recently had episode where felt weak,lightheaded,dizzy like my body is just not being oxygenated properly. no real pain. made a point of checking hr and bp and both normal but in this episode there was an obvious resolution where it literally felt like there was a burst of oxygenated blood that was being restored throughout body. this is obviously unnerving and doesn't seem to make sense given normal hr and bp. all recent tests have been normal but haven't had any test when this is happening. plan on making appt to discuss w/ dr. but any info would be appreciated",
