            "answer": "Hi,No risk at all. Let's try and look at this logically:1. The diabetes blood tester is a stylus (in most cases) which works like a ball point pen. The needle just punctures the finger and retreats into the casing. The actual bleeding would begin slightly later. I mean it would be almost impossible for the stylus tip to have blood on it.2. In the most unlikely event that the stylus did have a minute amount of blood AND the person on whom it was used was HIV + AND the stylus not not cleaned (universal precautions followed by all personnel) - it would still not transmit the virus, simply because the virus would not survive for an hour, especially in the small quantity it would be present on the stylus if at all.Hence, no chance of transmission. Think about it, just can't happen!",

    "question": "I think I read the answer to this already down below, but just wanted to clarify.It's about needle pricks. I'll keep this one short, I promise! :)Say someone used on of those diabetes testers.... and used that needle pricking gadget to prick the end of the finger to get a blod sample. You all are saying that the blood on the end of that needle CANNOT transmit the HIV virus? Even if the needle was used an hour or so afterwards by someone else?Thanks",
