    "question": "I recently started taking Metformin perscribed by my kidney specialist. I don't think they are working. I have cut back a lot on my sugar intake. Trying to use altrenatives like organic stavia for my cups of tea n things. How long do they take to kick in? I have 1 twice a day. Can anyone recommend something yummy that may include Greek yoghurt that I can incorporate fruit in with along with fiber. Is this Metformin for pre diabetes or am I a 1 or a 2.I understand these are all questions that I could ask my specialist but I don't go back to see him for another 5 weeks.Can diabetes be a symptom or your liver and gallbladder not working properly?Hoping someone could help me with answers to my questions and maybe even give me a little more onsite from someone who has been through what I'm going through right now.Thank you xxxx",
