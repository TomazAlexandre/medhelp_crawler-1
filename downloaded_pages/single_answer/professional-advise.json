            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous system. To make the diagnosis there are specific criteria, in which objective neurologic findings are present affecting 2 or more locations in the nervous system in 2 or more episodes. In order to make this diagnosis, a detailed history and neurologic examination is required. MRI is helpful to look for white matter lesions in 2 or more locations, as you mentioned from your MRI. These white matter changes are typically periventricular (around the CSF spaces of the brain). The lesion you mention in the corpus callosum is suspicious for MS. However, there are multiple conditions producing MRI changes that could be mistaken for MS. These include chronic migraine history, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking abuse, high cholesterol, etc. The MRI should be reviewed properly and correlated to the symptoms. When the diagnosis is in doubt, LP to study the CSF is helpful, and if there is still some doubt, there are other tests such as evoked potentials that can help.I suggest you continue following up with your physician who knows your exam best.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "HiI was wondering if any professionals out there could interpret this for me. There is evidence of hyperintense T2/FLAIR lesions in subcortial white matter on the right and left frontal lobes frontal lobes, left parietal lobe, right side of the rostrum of the corpuus callosm, right and left paraventricular white matter; there is no evidence of associated signal abnormalities on DWI ADC or EPI. No edema or mass effect.My neurologist thinks 95 percent ms",
