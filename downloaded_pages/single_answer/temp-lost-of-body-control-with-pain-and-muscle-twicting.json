            "answer": "Hello,Some of the important causes of your symptoms are overextension of the muscles,overweight,prolonged standing during the day,dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium,calcium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism,peripheral vascular disease(narrowing of the leg arteries which causes poor circulation),sarcoidosis,excess alcohol,nerve compression or nerve entrapment, multiple sclerosis,spinal cord injury,cerebral palsy or stroke and sometimes liver disease.Some of these causes like dehydration,being overweight,alcohol intake and prolonged standing are modifiable by efforts of the patient. Stretching and massaging the affected muscle (usually a calf muscle) can usually relieve such pain. A painkiller such as paracetamol may also help to ease muscle discomfort and tenderness.My advice is to consult a physician and rule out the above medical conditions by thorough investigations as without physical examination and investigations, pinpointing a diagnosis is tough.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
