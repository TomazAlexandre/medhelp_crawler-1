            "answer": "cancer is not measured by a TSH lab. I don't feel that should have been said to you.Many Hashimoto patients will have nodules and thyroid cancer is not common within that autoimmune disease.She sounds more like she has Hashimoto thyroiditis which in leman terms means sick or inflammed thyroid.It may be tough to get this test but in your post I do feel iodine testing should be done. Its called an iodine loading test and many can't get it done with their doctors since they don't believe in it. Just reading in your post - hits me to have you research this test.Also a thyroid uptake scan is better to get than the US or MRI at this time.",

    "question": "Hello. Mt daughter is 14 and has been sick several months. Four months ago her ultrasound indicated heterogeneous echotexture and fine hypoechoic nodularity and her thyroid was swollen. Her Anti-TPO and TG levels were in the hundreds indicating hashimotos.Her TSH level was also elevated 8.3. She has been on synthroid for 5 months and her TSH is now 1.5.\u00a0\u00a0They did a second ultraound and MRI this week both indicating her thyroid is larger than before, swollen and has increased nodules. Her TPO and TG levels have also gone up. Her neck gets puffy at time, she has a dry constant cough, it hurts to swallow, she gags trying to brush her teet, is extremely nauseuas and sometimes vomiits (if she eats more than tiny amounts at a time), has lots of throat/neck/ and back pain, very dizzy, feels really hot all the time and sweats more than what is normal. She did also have elevated testosterone but nobody seems concerned about it.\u00a0\u00a0Weve had to beg for all thetest done through our pediatrician who knwos nothign about thyroid disease but does think we now need to rule out thyroid cancer -the endocrinologist said a few months back he was certain it was nto cancer becuase her TSH levels went down. Does anyone know if it sounds like thyroid cancer or if Hashimotos in a child can do all this? We are having a hard time finding anyone who can really help her and figure out what is causing her to be so sick. She has to go to school at home now and really cant do much of anything. Any advice please? Also does anyone know of a good dr familiar with pediatric thyroid disease that we could see. It seems ours is just very diabetes focused and has not very helpful. Any helpis very\u00a0\u00a0much appreciated-we are feelign very desperate.",
