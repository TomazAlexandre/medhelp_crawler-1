    "question": "Hi, I have a very good friend who is constantly thirsty. Every few minutes he is getting up to get a drink of some sort, or to go to the restroom. He is slightly lethargic but he bikes to and from his work almost everyday which is over 5 miles so exercise is not a problem even though his weight is. I just want to know if his constant thirst/urination and weight problems could be diabetes. If so it has gone on for a very long time untreated.",
