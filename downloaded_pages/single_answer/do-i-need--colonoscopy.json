            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.IBS can produce these symptoms of abdominal pain or discomfort. Then again please check for Diabetes as this can affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves leading to bowel symptoms. This can be detected by a simple blood test. Also local pathologies like growths or inflammatory diseases can also cause these symptoms. For this a colonoscopy will help detect the lesion. So, would advise you to discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
