            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is unlikely that you have MS. Burning, calf pain, dizziness etc that come and go can be due to low calcium. Get this tested and if this is low, parathyroid gland function and Vit D level will have to be tested. Tingling in tongue can be due to gastric reflux with acid coming and hitting at a point. Raise head end of bed. Take Omeprazole empty stomach in morning and an antacid gel at bedtime. Refrain from smoking, alcohol, fuzzy drinks and spicy food. Walking around also helps clear gas. I would strongly recommend you to see a gastroenterologist (a specialist who looks after the diseases of our digestive system) if these tips help you.Excess alcohol intake, partial seizures, diabetes, spinal nerve compression high up and low calcium levels all cause head and tongue tingling. Wisdom tooth is another cause.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "So yet another interesting symptom has appeared, adding to an ever-growing list.\u00a0\u00a0Now it's a patch on the top of my tongue, a little smaller than a quarter, that tingles; the sensation is halfway between pins and needles on the one hand, and the feeling you get quen you scald your tongue on hot coffe on the other, but it's just this little patch.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, I'm freaking out and thinking it's MS, but I'm trying to take things calm and consider things rationally.\u00a0\u00a0Is this even a symptom of MS?\u00a0\u00a0I once had a burning sensation on my skin for a day or so, a few months ago, but nothing else remotely like this.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 20, and male, and the fact that MS strikes women more often than men is little comfort.Besides this, I've been coughing more lately (a coughing fit or two a day for the past 5 weeks), though the stomach gas and pains that plagued me for months seem to have disappeared after I visited my parents this summer.\u00a0\u00a0I also get long-lasting, aching pains in my left calf muscle, not related to excercise, and I get dizzy when I stand up, sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0I also get occasional stabbing pains,like being poked by a needle, at totally random points on my body.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any suggestions, or reassurances?",
