            "answer": "Do you know for sure that you ovulate during those long cycles? As long as you do ovulate, I'd think it's possible and safe to try to get pregnant. I don't know about the vitamin D deficiency, though... I'd think that it has nothing to do with PCOS and is a separate issue. I'd definitely check with your doctor if I were you before I started actively trying!To answer your other question, yes, PCOS is a fairly serious issue. There is no cure for it, but it is possible to manage it and achieve pregnancy. If you look up PCOS online, you'll probably find statistics saying that women with PCOS have a higher risk of diabetes, heart disease, and are often infertile. I think it mainly relates to the ovulation issue (as with me), which is actually pretty easy to fix with medications. If you do have PCOS, your doctor may prescribe Metfromin, which is a drug that controls your insulin (the root issue of PCOS) and that may also help regulate your cycles. Good luck!",
