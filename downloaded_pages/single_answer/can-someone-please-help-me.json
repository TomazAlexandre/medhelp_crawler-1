    "question": "I have had the most severe case of Shingles most of my doctors \"have ever seen\" so they say. My entire left side of my back from my spine out to my under arm, down to my waist and up into my neck into my hair line. It looked like someone had poured scalding hot water on me. I had blisters the size of quarters and my skin would peel and peel. For 3 years I was completely disabled! Now I have shingles on my forehead, on the left, clear up to my hairline. For three years my life has been hell. Now to add insult to injury, I have lost over 25% of feeling in my feet, and 13% in my legs. NO ONE can tell me why I have such terrible neuropathy. I can hardly walk, when I do the price I pay at night is un- describable. I have been to 8 different doctors from neurology, podiatry, orthopedics, vein doctors, internists, and not one of them have found a reason for it. I do not have diabetes, lime disease, thyroid problems, MS, or anything like it. I finally asked about shingles and no one has even entertained that idea. IF ANYONE HAS AN IDEA PLEASE HELP! I am on morphine around the clock and my life is non existent. I am only 64 and am an active person, runner, work out regularly, now I am housebound, gained 65 lbs. and am at the end of my rope. Please, if anyone has any insight on this subject please get in touch with me. I am Praying for help!",
