            "answer": "\"Could this be caused from the diabetes, can I be starting to have a stroke?\"The onset of Diabetes Neuropathy yes.\"I try to watch my sweets and carbs, although I'm not always successful with it..\"You need to try much harder to avoid sugary foods & liquids, foods made with white flour [breads, crackers, etc], white rice, starchy foods like potatoes. A poor diabetes diet will escalate your diabetes side effects.\"Is there any OC meds I can take?\"No. The keys to controlling and managing t2 diabetes are proper nutrition, maintaining proper body weight, perform 30 minutes of daily physical exercise like walking, and keeping a normal lipid panel and blood pressure. Doing and keeping these inline lessens the need for medication.Do you know of a free clinic in your area? Google search for one. Also, Google your area hospitals to see if they have a \"care van\", or something to that nature, that helps the homeless. Care vans go to specific locations to provide medical care and medication/s to those who cannot afford it. You need to get back on medication asap. If you must go to the ER. Please get medical attention before your symptoms worsen. Good luck",
