            "answer": "Hi there,A normal value for SGOT is 0-35 and SGPT is 4-36. Your values are on the higher side. A complete medical history, clinical examination and work up is important for determining the correct cause of your symptoms. High levels of SGOT and SGPT could be due to fatty liver caused by Alcoholic fatty liver disease or Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. Some possible causes of elevated transaminase levels are viral hepatitis, drug/medication-induced liver, autoimmune hepatitis or genetic liver diseases Additional testing is required in order to determine more precisely what is wrong with the liver. Consult your doctor.Best luck and regards!",
