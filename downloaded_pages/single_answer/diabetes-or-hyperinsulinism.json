    "question": "I am\u00a0\u00a0a woman aged 38. For approx 15 years have suffered extreme headaches on and off that were diagnosed by a GP as cluster headaches. However I have since discovered in the last 2 years that I only get the headache after I have eaten sugar. It used to take quite a lot of sweets or sugary items to bring on the headache but in the last 2 months it does not take\u00a0\u00a0very much at all to bring on a headache, in fact for example 4 small boiled sweets and I will get the headache. The headache only comes about after 5 hours of consuming the sugar and can last up to 72 hours, absolutley excrutiating headache, makes me feel exhausted, foggy brain,irritable and almost unable to function properly. Incidentaly I dont consume sssugar on a regular basis bu instead take sweeteners in my tea etc and do try to avoid sugar, but it seems to be getting worse and quite rapidly, any ideas? When I spoke to my local gp about it they suggest I just avoid the sugar, which I feel is just a band aid to the problem and\u00a0\u00a0I would like to find the cause, can anyone help me please?",
