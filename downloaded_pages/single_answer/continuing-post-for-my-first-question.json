    "question": "Today we had the evaluation with the dietician and she said that Gracie was on the verge of being overweight for her age? She does not look overweight at ALL, she is very slim with a baby belly. The dietician said she is at high high risk of being dangerously overweight and hopes she grows taller and grows into her weight. She has not gained weight in a year, in the last three months she has lost 2lbs, but she has also grown 2inches in height. I think she is very well porportioned. She is not a thin frail child she is very solid, exteremly strong, but is littler then all her friends. The dietician brought up diabetes.. I also have a 20 month old son that is following in the same footsteps and the dietcian said he was also at high risk for being overweight. He is just shy of 20 months old. He is 32 1/2 inches tall and 28lbs. He too does not look \"fat or overweight\" he has a thin small solid solid build. He was born at 33 weeks gestation. He to was a big baby 7lbs 6ounces 18.5 inches long. He had small issues at birth small PFO of the heart and mild PPS. He was just released from the cardio NOV 09. He also has torticollis and postional placiocheply all issues have improved, but not gone away. He also has asthma/ severe excema/ NO food allergies.Diabetes does run in both of my mother and fathers family. It does not run in my husbands side at all.I have always had bordeline glucose but no other symptoms. Both pregnancies I was on bedrest with hyperemesis & hydronephrosis. My second child ruptured my uterus.I am very worried my kids have been misdiagnosed. Please guide me in the right direction!",
