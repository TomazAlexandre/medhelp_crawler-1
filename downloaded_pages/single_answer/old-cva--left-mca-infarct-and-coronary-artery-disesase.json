            "answer": "With a totally occluded LAD he must be getting blood from somewhere, probably hence the old MI and he must be having some collateral feeds. I would certainly highly consider the surgery and go for it. However, I would ensure that there is a competent surgeon doing the operation. I would also discuss infection before, during and after surgery. Maybe a course of antibiotics before surgery wouldn't go amiss. Make notes about the details of surgery, such as which vessels which will be used and where they will be attached. This is always useful info if you are ever asked later in life.",
