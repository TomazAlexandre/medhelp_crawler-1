            "answer": "For your height you do not need to lose weight. You should consume approximately 1800 calories per day to maintain your weight. When fat (good fat) and protein are eaten with carbohydrates, they help slow down the glucose (sugar) rising of the blood from the carbohydrates. Eating carbs alone will cause high 'sugar' increases in the blood. You do not eat meat which will increase the sugar response in your body by the food you eat consisting mainly of carbohydrates. Suggest having a protein food (egg / nuts, etc) each meals and snack. Eating 5-6 small meals a day will also help keep your blood sugar constant instead of 3 main meals. Recommended intake percentage is 50% carbohydrate, 30% protein, and 20% fat (good fat). There is medication you can take to help you with your insulin issue so you may not develop diabetes and heart disease. Hoped this helped you.",

    "question": "Hi, my question is related to the macronutrients ratio ideal for my case. I have PCOS and very high insulin levels in the blood, though not yet diabetec. How many carbs are too many in my case? I also read that some types of fat and protein also have a definite impact on insulin. How should I balance these properly? I do not eat red meat or poultry - I simply dislike meat products of all type and my digestion just doesn't agree with them ( I would be nauseous and sick if I eat them for days - except if I eat really small amounts). So I rely for protein on eggs, soy and fish (cheese is also a problem so I don't have it). How much of these should I consume each day (for 1200 calories)? How many fruits am I allowed and what would be the best diet to lose weight considering my problem?",
