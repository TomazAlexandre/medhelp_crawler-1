    "question": "Hi, I'm searching for a root cause for multiple aneurysms, ways to mitigate my condition and wonder if it's genetic. Claudication symptoms 1 year ago revealed that both popliteal arteries had aneurysms and thrombis (clot). One had collaterals that had provided blood flow to lower leg. The other required a fem-pop bypass which was successful. Pre-op check for fem-pop revealed a 5.5cm aneurysm on my asc aorta. 3 CT's every 6 months shows it hasn't grown. Hoping that it's stability will prevent having to go in there. Healed nicely from fem-pop, began working out after 3 months, then a clot formed in my graph. Angiogram with TPA on a Friday night; Angiogram on Sat revealed the clot had disappeared from graph. Reperfusion gave me compartment syndrome which a fasciotomy corrected. I'm on Coumadin, toprol & aspirin now. Taking Lyrica and morphine at night to deal with referred nerve pain on the bottom of my foot, which has gotten 80% better. Cardiologist will have me re-start vytorin next week.\u00a0\u00a0I'm searching for root cause: genetic? Diet? Luck? I'm 165lbs, 50 years old, and play racquetball 2-3 times a week for the last 20 years. Don't smoke, one glass of merlot at dinner, no diabetes, organic food lifestyle. I'm told it's PVD and not PAD. A PVD specialist at the University of Colorado suggests a collagen deficit in my arteries. Suggests a genetic study would provide info on if it's heredity and if my daughters could get the same thing. Cho:220; HDL:74: LDL:63. First go around on Vytorin brought Chol down to 157, and then I suspended taking it when I got the clot, but expected to re-start it soon. That's the background, anyone have a suggestion as to how I pursue root cause or ways to mitigate continued aneurysms from forming? Thoughts on care from a large university hospital like CU with multiple vascular and cardiothoracic surgeons versus local community hospital with only 2 cardiothoracic surgeons if I have to deal with the aorta? CU versus Mayo? Thanks in advance! KJ",
