            "answer": "You have not stated what your GFR or any of your labs are,, such as BUN, Creatine, etc. These will give us an idea of whether or not to be concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, your kidneys can turn themselves around depending on your age and health, but you need to find out what is causing your lower than normal GFR. Some medications are filtered thru the kidneys and you need to really use these sparcely and get an OK from your family doctor. Stay away from Ibuprofen, and any anti-inflammatories as these will make any renal dysfunction worst. If you have diabetes or high BP, these conditions are also hard on the kidneys so you need to manage them well if you have either condition.",

    "question": "Hi all. I've never visited this forum before because most of my problems of late have been neurological for which I was prescribed prednisone 40mg. Along with this I was also prescribed topamax, verapamil, baclofen, high dose vitamin D, and synthroid. Then most recently macrobid. I had a recent flare up for which a visit to the ER was in order. My respirations were dropping low setting off the monitor, serum CO2 was a little high, and GFR was slightly under the normal range. This was the first my GFR ever came up flagged.They concluded I was having a bad reaction to some of the medications and all were stopped immediately except the pred and baclofen need tapered. I will stay on the Vit D and synthroid as needed.Could this be just a little blip from all the meds, or is it something that I should be concerned about and follow up on? Not sure what to make of it at this point. I do have a lot of swelling around my eyes, but none in the hands and feet.",
