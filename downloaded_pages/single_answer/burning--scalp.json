            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You have very sensitive nerve endings in the area and this could be due to peripheral neuropathy of diabetes or hypothyroidism or it could be due to a pinched nerve. It could also be due to localized eczema or dermatitis. Very dry scalp due to dandruff or any other reason like chemical irritant could also be the cause. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage without examining. Do consult a doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
