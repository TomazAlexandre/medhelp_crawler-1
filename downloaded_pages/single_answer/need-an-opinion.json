            "answer": "I am a volunteer for JDRF, mom of a child with diabetes, and not a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest that if you think that your daughter is misdiagnosed, seek a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0I would ask them to redo the blood tests. There are several blood tests that are specific in diagnosing type 1 diabetes, such as Hemoglobin A1c-, which gives the doctors an average of what the blood sugars over a 2-3 month period.\u00a0\u00a0I would try to find a pediatric endocrinologist, and bring a copy of her existing medical history.I hope this helps, please contact us again and let us know the outcome. It you have any other questions please stop back again.",

    "question": "My daughter who is 15 moths old was diagnosed type 1 diabetic and my question is could she have been misdiagnosed based on the fact that she has been thru a couple of severe MRSA infections in the past 6 months or so and I know that infection can raise blood sugar levels to very abnormal heights...she had an infection at the time of her diagnosis so could it have been that that caused them to believe she might have diabetes???",
