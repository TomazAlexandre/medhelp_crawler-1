            "answer": "Hello dear,Your MRI probably shows a white matter lesion. The lesion could be due to vascular insufficiency as the age advances.. The diagnosis of MS is more of clinical than pathological.Need not worry just maintain your blood pressure levels and blood sugar levels in normal range,do warm up exercises and eat nutritious diet. Alzheimers cannot be detected on MRI .There are no tests to diagnose it.You should follow up your neurologist timely for follow up.Best",

    "question": "I had 2 incidents where the far right side of my visual field appeared to be a backwards C shaped shimmering light. I also saw 2 zig zagged lines of this same shimmering light in my field of vision. Shortly after the appearance of the shimmering light, a small spot of my visual field was blurred, during the second episode. During these episodes, I was light headed and after them, was very anxious.. Went to an opthamologist, no problem w/ my eyes. PCP ordered brain MRI. Went to neurologist - MRI says no stroke, TIA, tumor, but did see \"some mild to moderate scattered foci of increased T2 and FLAIR signal in the cerebral white matter is nonspecific, perhaps representing small vessel disease change.\" Neurologist says this small vessel disease change could be nothing, or from age (I'm 54), high blood pressure (mine is low), multiple sclerosis, or diabetes. I had blood drawn - am awaiting results. Neurologist says to rule out MS need to do spinal tap. The question: Should I be concerned about this? He didn't seem to be very concerned. Says he sees similar results in 4/10 MRI reports he reads. Is it the start of dementia? Alzheimers? My mom recently died of Alzheimers and it is a horrible disease. Neurologist says you can't diagnose Alzheimers from an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0Should I do he spinal tap? I've heard it's painful. Would it even help to know early if I had MS?",
