            "answer": "Hi!While, yes, endometriosis can to some extent contribute to bloating, there are many other causes which should be ruled out. Other than IBS or spastic colon your daughter could be suffering from Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, diabetes, food intolerance, malabsorption syndromes, constipation, gallbladder and liver problems, pancreatic dysfunction, or taking a diet rich in sulfites (juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, red wine, mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough). Cancers of the gut and in female ovarian cancer too could be a cause. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Take care!",
