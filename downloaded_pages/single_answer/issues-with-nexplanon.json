            "answer": "I'm also on nexplanon and I have been for almost 2 years now. I also had considerably bad depression when I started the contraception but as time went on the depression slowed down. The periods still aren't regular and probably never will be. The longest period I've had on nexplanon was a light flow for about three months then I was off for two. The doctors say irregular periods should be expected. If your depression doesn't better itself in the next couple of months then you should consider other options, even if they do make you gain weight",

    "question": "I started Nexplanon about a month ago. My doctor asked if I had history of depression, anxiety, and the list goes on (diabetes, cancers, etc..). Which I do - depression and anxiety is what I was diagnosed with at 17 years old.I have since stopped taking my Zoloft, which I never had a problem, I stopped taking it at 21 which has been a few years now and no problems until now.I'm having mood swings, my partner is noticing and feels like I need to get the implant taken out (but i like the fact I can have it for 3 yrs and have heard bad things about Mirena) Along with mood swings, I'm having the worst depression I've ever experienced, weight gain, loss of appetite and on top of all of that, I've had my period for about 24 days now.I got pregnant on the pill, so that's out of the question. And I also had the depo provera shot which caused horrid weight gain, and by horrid, I mean I probably gained 15 pounds within a month and a half - and I go to the gym and eat healthy.I've gone to the doctor about it and he recommended I just try and wait it out a little bit longer but i feel like I can't keep dealing with these mood swings, nor can my son or partner. Is there anything you recommend that I can help the nexplanon be an easier process? My mind set is at taking it out but would anti depressants help or do I need to go to something that wouldn't be as hard as this is on my body right now?",
