            "answer": "Honestly I think you really need to see a doctor. A lot of serious things can cause those symptoms so it's very difficult to know what is causing them or even if it is serious until you see a doctor.Some tests or things you might want to talk to the doctor about is arthritis, diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme disease (specifically if you go out hunting or have animals that could have ticks), and maybe lupus. Not meaning to scare you or saying that I think you have these problems-these are just worst case scenarios that come to my mind and should be ruled out.Again, not meaning to scare you, but significant weight loss and joint pains can be symptoms of some serious conditions so make sure you see a dr asap.",
