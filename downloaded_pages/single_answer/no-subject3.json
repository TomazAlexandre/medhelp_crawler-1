            "answer": "It is often difficult to figure out what is going on based on symptoms alone.\u00a0\u00a0As you know, some people present with heart problmes very atypically, ie, they don't have the classic symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0You are young, but you do have some risk factors for CAD, at this point two: family history and high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0You obviously cannot change your family history, but the high cholesterol you can, and you are doing so by taking a cholesterol lowering drug.\u00a0\u00a0The next step would be to make sure that your cholesterol is where it's supposed to be.\u00a0\u00a0That's typically done with a blood test and I am sure your doctor has checked that in the past.\u00a0\u00a0As fart as your symptoms are concerned, I agree that they sound very atypical and are most likely related to the conditions that you've described other than the heart.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that you have had two negative stress test and that you run around with your kids without any symptoms makes me less worried about heart problems.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think you need yet another stress test, and you defitnitely should not have a catheterization.\u00a0\u00a0The important things to focus on are:\u00a0\u00a0getting back in shape, losing weight, exercising routinely, eliminating smoking exposure (first or second hand), healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables and very little red meats and fatty foods.\u00a0\u00a0As I mentioned earlier make sure your cholesterol is well controlled and make sure that you don't have other risk factors such as elevated blood glucose (diabetes) or high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0You should also discuss takin a low dose aspirin with your cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0He may or may not advise you to do so.\u00a0\u00a0If your symptoms are really bothersome you should see a physician anyways to figure out what can be done to help you out.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes taking an acid reflux pill may help you feel better.\u00a0\u00a0Physical therapy may help with the herniated disk.",

    "question": "I am 40 years old, 6' 4\", and 287.\u00a0\u00a0I have high cholesterol and take Crestor and a lipid.\u00a0\u00a0 My father had a heart-attack at age 64, and I've had two stress tests since then.\u00a0\u00a0The last one was in the fall and it came out fine.\u00a0\u00a0I'm out of shape and worry about the effect on my heart.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, I've been having some pressure in the center of my chest (just the left of my sternum), but it appears to be relieved when I press on the area, especially when I burp.\u00a0\u00a0 I also have had some tightness in my left shoulder blade and some periodic numbness in my arm, etc, but I also have a herniated disk in my neck. If I press on the shoulder-muscle, or sleep on it oddly, it results in numbness.\u00a0\u00a0I never have chest pain when going up stairs, or running around with my children, but have some tightness at times.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what to think.\u00a0\u00a0When I combine all these symptoms, I worry about the the heart.\u00a0\u00a0But, then I think that the pressure in my chest is gas-related and the shoulder tightness is probably related to the herniated disk.\u00a0\u00a0 Please advisse.....",
