            "answer": "Hi!The vibrations in your shoulder blade area could be an extension of the vibrations you feel in calf and forearm areas.The symptoms could be due to drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, hyper and hypothyroidism, lupus, and Lyme\u2019s. Multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonism, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, low vitamin B12 or low vitamin D, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. and certain epilepsies too could be the cause. It can be benign fasciculation syndrome if all causes are ruled out.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Lately, a region in my lower left shoulder-blade feels like its vibrating/wiggling and I don't know why.It doesn't hurt, but its just unpleasant and worries me. It also only occurs for 0.5 to 1 second at most so I haven't been able to actually touch the area at the time it happens.\u00a0\u00a0I checked in the mirror and felt around the area and it feels fine, I just feel muscle.I'm hoping it goes away by tomorrow, but what could it be?Will it go away?\u00a0\u00a0I usually get the vibrating feeling in other areas like my calf or forearm but its never been near my shoulder blade before and that's what bothers me.",
