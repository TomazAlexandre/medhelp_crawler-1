    "question": "I have had 2 episodes since Sunday. One lasted 10 minutes, the other 50 minutes. Both times ribbons of light with numerous colors,\u00a0\u00a0start at the middle of my vision and work toward the right. They are continuously moving on the right side. Along with the ribbons I get light-headed, dizzy and ths feeling lasts for hours afterwards. I have been taking meclizine for many 10 years due to dizziness and drs have not found a reason yet. I have had this one other time, the ribbons. 2 yrs ago I had them for a hourI recently had ablation surgery on my heart, it was less than a week before these symptoms started. I have informed my cardiac surgeon and my cardiologst about these episodes. I have since then been to an eye specialist and have found my eyes to have 20/20 results in every test even though I do wear glasses. Perhaps it might be optic migranes but the dr did not really think so.I have also had symptoms this year of placing words or letters in different orders in my speech and also when I write sentences. Sometimes when I get tired, my speech is slurred. I also say oppposites of what I mean to say but not all the time.Today I am light headed still after this 1st episode. It feels almost cloudy on my right side ncluding my ear.any ideas?dj",
