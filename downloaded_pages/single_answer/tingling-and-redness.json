            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Your son could be suffering from gout, which also results in joint pains and swelling. This is due to high uric acid in the body that gets accumulated in the joints. \u201cGout usually attacks the big toe (approximately 75 percent of first attacks); however, it also can affect other joints such as the ankle, heel, instep, knee, wrist, elbow, fingers, and spine.\u201d\u201cClinically, gout can be hard to distinguish from several other conditions, including chondrocalcinosis. Chondrocalcinosis is a very similar disease, caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate rather than uric acid.\u201d Refer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoutDiagnosis is by finding the elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. However most confirmatory is study of fluid aspirated from joint to detect urate crystals.\u2019 Refer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoutIt could also be due to rheumatoid arthritis. Refer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritisIt could also be due to diabetes.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage without further details. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
