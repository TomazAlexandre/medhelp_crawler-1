            "answer": "HI and thanks for using the forum.The fact that your diabetes screening, thyroid panel, blood tests and chest x-ray came out normal are great.\u00a0\u00a0Some of your symptoms could be from your asthma (shortness of breath. squeezing feeling, and heart flutters).\u00a0\u00a0Your knee problems, back pains, and \"popping\" can be related to your years of running ( a lot of wear and tear on your joints).\u00a0\u00a0Were you given an inhaler or medication for your asthma?\u00a0\u00a0If not, since you are experiencing some of those symptoms, it might be something you can ask\u00a0\u00a0your doctor about.\u00a0\u00a0There are daily medications available to help prevent those asthma symptoms and rescue inhalers for actual attacks.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, switching up your sport a little can help with those body aches and pains- maybe try some yoga (the stretching is good) or some swimming- a little easier on\u00a0\u00a0your joints.\u00a0\u00a0I can't really explain the jaw bone itching- except that if it is accompanied by a cough always- it could be allergy related.I think you should try to not focus on all these symptoms you are having and try to just go on as you normally do, maybe making a few of the changes I suggested.\u00a0\u00a0If things don't get better and you are still really concerned then it is OK to go back to your PA and let them know you are still experiencing these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Good LuckBridget",

    "question": "I'm only 19 years old and I feel like I'm falling apart. Not that I'm constantly in pain or depressed, but mild medical problems keep coming up. In the last year I've been diagnosed with a shoulder impingement in both shoulders and asthma. Yet, I've always slept too much and can fall asleep pretty much anywhere (which is a problem during classes), I get short of breath faster than my friends even though I'm in better shape than them and have better endurance, get couple different types of random chest pain,along with a squeezing feeling (during exercise) and fluttering in my heart, and random small stinging sharp pain anywhere at random points of\u00a0\u00a0my body, lower back pain when I stand too long and then after when I lay down to relax, knees also hurt every once in a while (probably just from 6 years of cross country and track), every morning my right hip pops/cracks, crack my back probably everyday, many times my calves swell and stiffen when I've been sitting in a desk for about an hour unless I can elevate them, sometimes my jawbone sometimes gets itchy (mostly when I cough but not always), faint nearly once a year and feel like I stand up to fast even if I've be sitting, and the weirdest is that I can barely get half a breath while standing and stretching my hands over my head, or doing the seal ab stretch. Been tested for diabetes, anemia and thyroid problems and everything came back normal and a chest x-ray when I told my PA about the last thing and everything came back normal. When I was younger I did have chronic bladder infections because I have an extra tube that connects my right kidney to my bladder (2right, 1left, 3total), I've had surgery to fix it and I haven't had a problem since. My family does have an extensive history of heart disease, but not obesity, but most are a little overweight however I am not. I just would like to know if if this is a legitimate concern or if I'm just paranoid. Thank you",
