            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.It is possible that his thirst is a result of his increase in physical activity. If it is still hot where he lives and he is outside running or at sports practice his thirst could be due to that. Were any tests other than the finger stick and fasting blood glucose done? Does the thirst and need to urinate occur at night as well.?Does it disturb his sleep? Did the doctor collect any urine, or do any other blood tests?If the symptoms continue, especially if they are affecting his diet and sleep, I would recommend going back to the doctor and asking for further testing. It sounds like his blood glucose levels were not elevated, ruling out Diabetes Mellitus. However, sometimes if you go to the doctor and ask to be tested for a condition, that condition is the focus of the visit. There could be another cause for your son's thirst and increased urination that was not tested for at the last appointment.I hope this helpsCathyCathy",

    "question": "My son is 21 year old very healthy and active student.\u00a0\u00a0He has been excessively thirsty and urinating very frequently (urine color has been very light to clear in color).\u00a0\u00a0Everything online points to diabetes which he did go in and get tested for.\u00a0\u00a0The finger prick test came back fine and then he was asked to fast overnight and they took more blood and he was told this was also normal. He did have shoulder surgery 4 months ago and was very inactive for a few months and recently started lifting, running and sports practices but he said this is excessive to what he is used to.\u00a0\u00a0He hasn't been eating as much because he is not as hungry because he's full from drinking so much water during the day.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions on what this could be?\u00a0\u00a0Is it just his body getting back into the swing of things?\u00a0\u00a0Please Help!",
