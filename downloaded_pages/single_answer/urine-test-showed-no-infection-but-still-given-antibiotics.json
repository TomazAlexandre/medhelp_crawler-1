            "answer": "Hello,Frequent urination is called polyuria. It can be due to many reasons which can be physiological or disease-related, and include excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones.I suggest you to take opinion of your doctor who would do a clinical examination and advice for needful tests (such as routine urinanalysis, blood glucose test, blood & urinary osmolalities, ultrasonography of renal system, etc).I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I went to the doctor recently because I've been experiencing frequent urination for the past week. They did a urine test which showed no signs of a UTI. My doctor prescribed Bactrim just in case there was an infection that the urine test didn't pick up correctly. Is this a common thing for doctors to do and should I be concerned about taking Bactrim when I might not actually have a UTI?",
