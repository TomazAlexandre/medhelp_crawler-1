            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.There is an entity called trigger thumb. Here the thumb gets stuck in a bent position and then straightens with a snap, like a trigger being pulled and released. This is due flexor tenosynovitis, which is inflammation of the tendon sheath. This is more common in women and in people with diabetes. Treatment is with pain killers and splitting. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hello, I'm writing because my thumb has been twitching ALL DAY EVERY DAY FOR 2 WEEKS! It's driving mad. I was recently referred to a neurologist (before this thumb twitching started)\u00a0\u00a0because I've had other random symptoms. The neurologist said they were due to anxiety, but (because I wouldn't let up!) he booked me a ct scan and an eeg, both of these have come back as normal.I've had thumb twitching for years, but this has always gone away. Also, the 'twitching' I'm experiencing now is more of a jerk than a twitch, probably happens once every 2 seconds. I've seen 2 doctors about this an neither of them can give me an answer as to why this would happen, but neither of them seemed particularly worried. I would just ask my neurologist, but as my eeg came back as normal, my doctor said that my neurologist will most likely discharge me, so really don't know what to do! Anyone had anything similar?Thanks",
