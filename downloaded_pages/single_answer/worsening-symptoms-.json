            "answer": "Hi Dr Suzy. I'm glad you have an appt with your Pdoc.It may be time to reevaluate your meds. That's something very common with drugs for mental illness. If you've been on the same meds for awhile, I doubt the skin picking is a side affect of a drug. But very important to write down in advance all of the things that are happening to you. My Pdoc gets a little impatient and if I have an agenda pre planed it helps me make myself clear.Anxiety can be helped by meds. But it's also helped by talk therapy. I had a Pdoc and a psychologist.\u00a0\u00a0You can learn CBT. Mindfulness. Breathing exercises. Meditation. We need to be proactive and active in our management of mental illness.So you also have a support group? Thru NAMI and DBSA you can go for free. It's usually once pr week. It really helps me. It's respectful and I like the people in my group. They also have a Friends and Family group that meets monthly.\u00a0\u00a0 So, don't let your Pdoc brush you off. Get the help you deserve.",
