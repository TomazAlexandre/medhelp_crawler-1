    "question": "I am now thirty years young with type one diabetes. I do have trouble getting erect before intercourse. I have to use pills for maximum performance which at best is still not good enough. To make matters worse for as long as I can remember I have not ejaculated after intercourse. It certainly feels like I do but I am sure that I do not produce any semen after intercourse. Is there any help that I can get to remedy this?",
