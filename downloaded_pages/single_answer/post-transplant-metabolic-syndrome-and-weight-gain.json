    "question": "I had a \"cryptogenic\" transplant 10 years ago at St. Luke's in Houston.\u00a0\u00a0I have nearly been a poster child - no complications; no infections.I had a proportionately large belly before the transplant (5'5 and 140#) and since then have gradually increased in girth (my waist is now 40\" and I weigh 160 now).Last night I was searching metabolic syndrome and post liver transplant and found a lot of information, but no real recommendations for shedding it.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I walk daily for a half hour but it certainly is NOT reducing me to a shadow of my former self.Do you know any programs specifically for addressing it.Sheila Harrison***@****",
