As for him \"not taking your help\", this is usually a matter of \"control\".\u00a0\u00a0Refusing help is something that allows him to assert himself. There is no answer, really, but making sure he has choices will help a bit. That is offer two choices of food and ask him to decide. Ask him if he wants to go out now or later. If he wants to eat at noon or one P.M. Would you like the red shirt or the blue one?",
