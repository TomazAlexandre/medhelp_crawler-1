            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If it is more than a month, then the cream is not suiting you. Alternatively the diagnosis is not correct. What you can do is apply a combination antifungal cream. Many treatment options are there like Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1%, ketoconazole, terfibnafine and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%. Many OTC products containing these salts are available, your pharmacist can help. Try a combination of two and apply until the round mark you see disappears. Continue application for 2 weeks after the marks disappear. The cause for persistence is that the treatment is often left in between. Keep the area dry, wear loose fitting clothes, and change undergarments at least twice a day. If within 14 days there is no improvement, then consult a skin specialist for a reassessment of diagnosis. Meanwhile test for blood sugar level to see if it is high for diabetes too can prevent resolution of fungal infection.Hope this helps. Take care!",
