    "question": "Ever since I can remember, I've had this weird occurence every so often: sometimes when I turn my head, or raise it - I feel this pop in the back of my skull, followed by a warm/burning sensation and intense pain & dizziness. It only lasts for a minute or two, but it happens often. What could it be?Family history includes: smoking, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. I, myself, have never been diagnosed with anything. I've had severe chest and head pains, and difficulty breathing, but whenever I've gotten checked out, nothing serious was found.",
