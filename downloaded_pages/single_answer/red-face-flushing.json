            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Alcohol, certain drugs, allergy to food additives, heat intolerance, hot beverages and food, anxiety, orthostatic hypotension, certain endocrine disorders like those involving the adrenals, diabetes etc all cause facial flushing.In some cases a TMJ disorder too can cause flushing due to sympathetic innervations getting activated. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
