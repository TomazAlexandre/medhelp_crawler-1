    "question": "Hello,My father had triple by-pass surgery in December of 2006 and since then his blood pressure is extremely high and the doctors can not get it controlled.\u00a0\u00a0He is on 5 different blood pressure medicines along with other pills for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0To add to the high blood pressure, he worries that it may cause a stroke.\u00a0\u00a0His doctors just keep increasing his mecidines dosage but it is not going down. Is this a normal side effect from his surgery?Thank you,Marcy",
