            "answer": "Hi Barbara,Just read your comments. I just consulted one of my resources on drugsand supplements.\u00a0\u00a0Lipitor is the product name for Atorvastatin.\" Atorvastatin is a member of the statin group of lipid- lowering drugs.It is used to treat hypercholestrerolemia ( high blood cholesterol levels)in patients who have not responded to other treatments, such as a specialdiet, and are at risk of developing heart disease.\"\" Atorvastatin blocks the action, in the liver, of an enzyme that is neededfor the manufacture of cholesterol. As a result, blood levels of cholesterolare lowered, which can help to prevent coronary heart disease.\"\" Rarely, atorvastatin can cause muscle pain, inflammation, and muscledamage. The risk is increased if the drug is given with a fibrate ( anotherkind of lipid-lowering drug).Possible adverse effects* Adverse effects of atorvastatin are usually mild and transient. Muscledamage is a rare side effect and muscle aching or weakness should bereported to your physician at once.\"Symptom/effectNausea\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 commonHeadache\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 commonSkin rash\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 rareMuscle pain/weakness\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rareJaundice\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rareInsomnia\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0rareUrine discoloration\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 rareChange in cognition\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 rareProlonged UseLong -term use of atorvastatin can affect liver function.Monitoring - Regular blood tests to check liver function are needed.Tests of muscle function may be carried out if problems are suspected.I hope you find this information helpful. I agree with you. It shouldn'tjust be lawyers fighting for females who have taken Lipitor and now suffersevere adverse effects. Men who have taken Lipitor and as a result nowhave the types of conditions you describe above should be allowed tosue for damages too.\u00a0\u00a0This is most unfair and unjust. Perhaps this maychange. Your male friend should seek a lawyer who would be willingto sue for damages on his behalf.\u00a0\u00a0Eve",
