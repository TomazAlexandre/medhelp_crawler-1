    "question": "My grandmother started bleeding in the month of Jul\u00a0\u00a0this year. She started spotting initially with a fish like odor. Bleeding lasted for about 6 days after which a D&C was carried out. SOme cells were found growing and her uterine wall seemed thicker.. The biopsy result were clear and not cancerous.. She started bleeding again around the same time the following month even after the D&C.. It seems like her normal period cycle everyone.. This has been going on for the past 3 months.. Is this dangerous? What the cause of this as its not cancerous? Could you tell us what needs to be done?",
