            "answer": "Belching is very likely from H. pylori. The only way to treat it, are antibiotics. Antibiotics really may be heavy, but you should go through that. When on antibiotics, avoid meat and other protein food, so your stomach will empty faster. You should stick with the whole 2 weeks course of antibiotics, otherwise H. pylori might not be eradicated completely.Breath test is safe, they give you to drink a suspension of urea, which bacteria ingest and produce gas, which is then measured in your expired air.Rapid heart beat and feeling week may be due to rapid gastric emptying, but you should treat H. pylori first, and see if heart rate will return to normal after eating.",

    "question": "Two weeks ago, I started feeling a discomfort in my stomach (upper part -under the end of the rib cage of my chest ) It was as if my stomach is stiff, or closed. I did not have any symptoms of vomiting, or nuesa, pain, diarriah. I only feel the discomfort after eating or drinking. It was associated with rapid heart beat and a general weak feeling. This made me start to fear eating. I did an U/S for my stomach which was all clean. I then saw my doctor who on physical examination (when pressing the upper part of my stomach it did hurt me, but not much or sever). He asked me to do a blood tes, where H.Pylori was present. He gave me Rabeloc and antiboitics. I did not use the antiboitics because they were too heavy. I only used the Rabeloc where I was reliefed. Now over 7 days or so, I started to evelop a symptoms of burping or belching frequently (although I do not eat heavy meals). It really bothers me, because I would have a general discomfort that would not go away unless I belch. I need to mention that I have anxiety, stree and depression problems, I suffer from GAD, and OCD. I lost two KG over the past 10 days. I am under weight, I am 36 KG while I am 165 cm tall. I have no apetite for eating.I saw another doctor who asked me to stop the antiboitics, because blood tests are not always acurate. He told me to continue on Rabeloc and do a breath test after two weeks to check the pylori. Is the test risky, I am afraid because the thing they give you to drink. Can I do another safer test instead?My concern is:What are the causes of belching and how can I overcome it, are there emdications for it , is it a sign of disease.What are the causes that I start getting rapid heart beat, the moment I start to eat (I do not have any heart or chest problems), My Hb is 84%, no anemia issues or diabetes.Are there any natural ways to cure H.Pylori, is it dangerouse?Do help me please",
