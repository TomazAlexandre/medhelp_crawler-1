            "answer": "I don't believe there is a specific test for schizophrenia or bipolar but what you are facing is if the psychiatric disability emerges and the recovery rates are with current anti-psychotics. What if there were anti-psychotics that could promote a full recovery? That doesn't possible right? Well as being identified as making a full recovery from schizoaffective disorder with glycine, a glutamate antagonist, a new form of antipsychotic in Phase II FDA study it is possible. The medications aren't out yet. But as schizophrenia generally emerges at puberty they will by then. And people will make a fuller recovery without the risk of tardive dyskinesia or diabetes. My study will be published by my psychopharmocologist in a standard psychiatric journal but in the meantime google \"Dr. Javitt, glycine\" and look up \"psychmeds123\" to see the progress of these new medications (the site updates itself). \"LY2140023 Eli Lilly.PhII. Modulates glutamate activity.\" seems very promising. You may not be able to test for the disability, it may happen and with new treatments the person may have a full recovery. The antipsychotics of the future will be very different. I am the first out of study result but you can read through my posts and journals (which are approved by my provider) for more information as well as the studies. Your child will grow up happy and healthy even if they do develop these psychiatric disabilties. Welcome them into your home.",

    "question": "Fostering a 1 month male infant. Wanting to adopt him. Mother has schizo affective disorder and father has bi polar mania. Is there any genetic markers or testing that we can do on the baby to accertain wether or not he will be prone to any of these disorders? We are an older (late 40's) and need to know if we would be capable of handling and caring for him if these disorders should kick in. What is the likely hood that he would be disorder free? Given the age factor on us we are hesitant. ANY advise would be most appreciated. Thank you",
