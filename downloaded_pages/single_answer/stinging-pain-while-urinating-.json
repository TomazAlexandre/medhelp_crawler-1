    "question": "I have a stinging sensation while urinating. I had a UTI about 3-4 weeks ago and it took 2 rounds of antibiotics to get to go away. I don't have the terrible pain or the frequent urge to urinate but I still have a stinging sensation while urinating and for a little while after. It comes and goes. Some days are worse than other. Some days it is barely there. What might be causing this pain?",
