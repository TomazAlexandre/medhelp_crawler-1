            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Since it is causing shooting pain on pressing it could be phlebitis. It could also be a bruise due to varuous reasons like medications like anticoagulants, blood thinners or birth control pills, clotting disorders, fragile spider veins, deep vein thrombus, deficiency of Vitamin B12, folic acid, or Vit K, or a liver disease. It could also be a patch of fungal infection like Tinea cruris or a patch of dermatitis. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I noticed that in a certain light there is\u00a0\u00a0a place on my shin, right next to the bone, that is a different color, darker. It is also depressed, and you can feel the depression when you run your hand down my leg.\u00a0\u00a0It has boundaries that you can see when you look at it in a certain light (like a lamp shining on it), but it doesn't otherwise feel or look different.\u00a0\u00a0It hurts a little when I push on it, and shoots pain down my foot, but not every time.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have a clue what this can be? Could it be phlebitis?\u00a0\u00a0It's very strange, and it's scaring me.I don't have any diseases that could cause this that I know of, no diabetes or circulatory problems.",
