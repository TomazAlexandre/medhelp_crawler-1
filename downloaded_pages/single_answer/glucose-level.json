            "answer": "Hello,Your fasting glucose is slightly high (normal should be < 95), however your numbers are not yet considered diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0your PP numbers are totally normal.Researchers have seen that people with higher than normal fasting blood glucose can go on to develop diabetes in the future.Your best approach would be to focus on being as active as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Walking, cycling, swimming, or jogging twice a day can be a sound approach as well as adding in some weight or resistance training if you can.Focus on a diet very high in vegetables and plant foods, limit carbohydrates (particularly grains, sweets, sugars), eat moderate amounts of quality protein, and eat healthy fats (nuts, dairy, meats etc).\u00a0\u00a0Note: the latest research indicates that saturated fats are not the problem, but that transfats (manmade fats, which are present in many processed foods) are very bad for humans, and should be completely avoided.",
