            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched /neuropathy (due to vitamin deficiency).\u00a0\u00a0This may also occur due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

    "question": "About a couple of months ago, I started to feel just \"not quite right\". I went to the Doctor and had some bloodtests ordering. He tested me for many things and the only test that came back was showing a severe Vitamin D deficiency. Since then, I had a \"spell\" at work in that I became very dizzy, sweating profusely, ringing in ears, seeing \"silver spots\" in front of my eyes, headache, tingling in limbs, then of course, I got scared and lost my breath. They sent me home from the E.R. saying I probably have an inner ear infection causing vertigo. (The Dr. never looked in my ears. I went the next day to my primary care Dr. and she ordered a CT scan of my brain, which came back normal. I do not know what these syptoms can mean. Have any of you had anything similiar to this happen? I, also, \"lost\" most of a day, make 2 huge errors on my job in less than one week, and am sleeping almost 12 hours everyday. HELP !!!! I feel as if I am going crazy, not sure the Dr.'s believe what i am feeling. It is Hard to sleep straight through, as my arms \"fall asleep\" and that wakes me up. Not quite painful as much as an annoyance. Also, am having some pain in my hips, and cramps in legs.",
