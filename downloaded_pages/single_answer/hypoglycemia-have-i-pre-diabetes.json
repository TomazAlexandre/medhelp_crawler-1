            "answer": "Hi eebelica,First, just a reminder that I'm not a doctor but a volunteer living with Type I diabetes for 12 years. I'm sorry to hear about your hypoglycemic attacks. Hypoglycemia can be scary, but it can be treated. I suggest you speak with your doctor, who can help you better control your blood sugar. Trsut me, beeing a diabetic and having had many hypoglycemic episodes I know what it's like to overeat to treat it. I think most of us have done it on occasion, but it is possible to control it and treat it in a healthy way, without having to eat too much. Actually you don't really need many carbs to bring up your glucose levels. I find that 3 glucose tablets (about 15 grams of carbohydrate) is usually enough. However I know how it feels when your sugar drops and it seems to take forever to go up again, making you feel terrible -that's why most people tend to over eat becuase they don't feel better right away. It's important to be aware that the carbs are working and you just need to give it a few minutes. What I usually do when my sugar drops very low (usually that would be at night because when I'm awake I'd catch it before it drops really low) I'll eat some glucose, drink milk or juice or whatever, and then check my sugar.I'm not sure if you're pre-diabetic or not. A doctor would be able to provide you with more information and put your mind at ease. Please see him/her as soon as you can to help control your glucose levels. Feel better and good luck!",

    "question": "Hello. I am having hypoglicemic attacks for five to seven years. They are occasional, four times in a month, ussualy provoked by not enough sleep and skipped breakfast. I had normal blood level when i went to a doctor.When first attacks occured i lost conciusness (three times-always looked like a syncope), but now i just become very active in searching food and i eat.I bought those glucose meters, thought i might catch those hypoglycemia attacks. But when attack comes i just cannot take timemesuring sugar.I measured glucose when feeling lightheaded\u00a0\u00a0and hungry but not as severely as when attacks occur, and it showed 52 -60 mg/dl (2.8-3.2 mmol/l), the highest measured glucose level was118 mg/dl (6.6 mmol/l), which was not fasting glucose.Trying to avoid hypoglycemia i often eat too much, and i have gained too much weight.I think i might have a pre-diabetes, because my mother has diabetes type 2, but i am still very young, 26 years old.Does anybody had similar promblems? And how did they managed it?",
