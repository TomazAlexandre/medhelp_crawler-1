            "answer": "Cortisol can be mildly elevated in cases of depression or other stressors to the adrenal gland, cortisol itself is a hormone that raises blood sugar, can raise blood pressure, increase storage of energy such as fat and mobilize bone causing problems with osteoporosis, create some insulin resistance leading to risks of diabetes.I would clearly work with your endocrinologist to discuss what exactly is your level and if it is normal and now that the tests have been done what is next. Sometimes 2-3 collections of urine are needed or it may be early, the overnight dex test rules out that there is a source that is acting on its own and shows that the thermostat is able to be shut off properly. Keep working with your doctor",
