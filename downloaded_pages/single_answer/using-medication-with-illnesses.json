I know that some people on the forum do use Gabapentin for their pain.We do not know anything about your brother (except that he has Hep C and Diabetes), his medical problems,\u00a0\u00a0or what condition his liver is in. We do not know if he currently treating his Hep C or not. We do not know if he has cirrhosis.Whether he can/should take Gabapentin should be discussed with his Hepatologist. His Hepatologist should know his medical history, including the condition of his liver, and the Hepatologist is the best person with whom your brother should discuss the use of Gabapentin.Best of luck to your brother, and to you.",
