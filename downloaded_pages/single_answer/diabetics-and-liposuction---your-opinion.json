    "question": "Hello,I am interested in having liposuction performed on my inner and outer thighs. I'm also 41 years old and have Type1 Diabetes (for over 30 years). I have no retinal, kidney or circulatory complications and am working toward transition to insulin pump technology.A doctor I spoke with recently did not recommend liposuction. I have seen many changes in medical opinion re: diabetics and cosmetic surgery procedures, and I know that lipo or any other \"optional\" surgery is not without risks. I would like to get another opinion regarding this procedure and diabetics; whether it is ever advisable. If it is now considered appropriate, I would also be interested to hear what method is most recommended.Thank you.Anne",
