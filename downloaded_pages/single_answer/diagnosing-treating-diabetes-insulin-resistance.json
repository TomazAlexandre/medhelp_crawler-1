            "answer": "Hi,Right now in medicine the most agreed-upon approach to insulin resistance(without frank diabetes) is to encourage weight loss through dietary and exercise means(lifestyle changes). There is a growing population that treats insulin resistant states, especially such as PCOS, with sensitizers like Metformin.\u00a0\u00a0But studies have shown that lifestyle changes are better than metformin at preventing diabetes, so it is far preferred especially as the first intervention.Unless there is a contraindication( for example pregnancy, allergy, worsening renal failure on ACEs) , all diabetics with proteinuria should\u00a0\u00a0 be on an ACE inhibitor or ARB, even if they only tolerate a low dose. It has been shown in study after study to reduce the progression of renal failure, so it is very important. Statins have also been proven to have many benefits and should be considered for use in all diabetics under the right circumstances.Many guidelines for diabetes care can be found on the ADA and AACE web pages, so check the out too.Take care.",

    "question": "When do you treat a person w/ insulin resistance & how do you diagnosis it? The symtoms (sx) of diabetes are very similar to sx of depression so I look for it a lot in my pts. The family practice & internal medicine doctors do not seem anxious to treat insulin resisamce or to diagnose (dx) diabetes. When I get insulin levels that are high along with sx of depression/DM (fatigue, wt gain, sleep & appetite disturbance, mood sx, etc) I would like them treated for insulin resistence.Almost no one in town does that. What do you recommend?Also many of my diagnosed diabetic pts are not one ACE inhibiters or ARB medications despite having protein in their urine. Many are not on statins, despite several risk factors of heart disease, besides diabetes. What is your opnion on these issues?Thanks!",
