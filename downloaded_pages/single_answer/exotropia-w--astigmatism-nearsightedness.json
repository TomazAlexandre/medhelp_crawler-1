    "question": "My son aged 5 is said to have exotropia w/ astigmatism nearsightedness. I started noticing his right eye drift outward from past 5 months(since sep 2009), but didnot think much of it. He started doing it more frequently and then in Jan 2010 we asked the pediatrician who said he has exophoria..we got the appointment in march w/ a eye doc....since jan he drifts both eyes outward, .but the ped opthamologist who saw him a few days back said he has exotropia and is astigmatic and nearsighted...he has prescribed glasses which he said is little strong\u00a0\u00a0so he can try to get the eyes not to drift. After six weeks he said he 'll see him tell us if he needs surgery. This is the prescription O.D Sph -1.25 cyl +0.50 axis 090 O.S sph -1.25 cyl +1.00\u00a0\u00a0and aixs 085. Had I taken my son to the eye doc earlier\u00a0\u00a0would this be less complicated? I had gestational diabetes and my son was born at 3 weeks (premature..since growth was upto 33 weeks)...intra uterine growth restriction ...i didnot mention to him about his premature birth..did not occur to me at that time .does this have any effect...Does my son have to wear eye glasses forever?\u00a0\u00a0 cant' vision therapy help...? Will these glasses prescribed help cure strabismus?",
