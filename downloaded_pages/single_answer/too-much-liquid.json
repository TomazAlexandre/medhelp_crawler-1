    "question": "I seem to be able to drink 4-5 liters of liquid a day sometimes even more and i probably only urinate 4-5 times a day. Is this normal because i notice people around me drink a lot less and urinate a lot more. Now the drink ranges from Vodka down to water. I drink alcohol 2-3 times a week and am able to consume nearly 5-6 pints of beer before urinating. When im not drinking during the week i can easily consume 2 liters of diet coke within an hour and half and continue drinking all day. I have been tested for diabetes some time ago and the results were negative. Can you help?",
