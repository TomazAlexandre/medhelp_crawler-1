            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!There are a few things you must get investigated for like thyroid problems, diabetes, rheumatoid diseases and anemia. You could also be suffering from gastric reflux or GERD. Omeprazole is a good drug to combat this. Along with it you can try over the counter antacids. Avoid heavy meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Go to bed at least 2 hours after food.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
