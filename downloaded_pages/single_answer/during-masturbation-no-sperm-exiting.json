            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for posting your query.I can understand your concern for the dry orgasm when no semen is ejected during orgasm. A 'dry orgasm' is when a man reaches sexual climax but does not ejaculate and no fluid emerges from the penis.From the history that you have provided, two points that are important are that this dry orgasm has started recently and secondly you took Rapaflo for three days prior to that. Rapaflo (silodosin) is an alpha-adrenergic blocker that helps relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, making it easier to urinate. Hence it is used to improve urination in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.Retrograde ejaculation is a common side effect associated with this drug. It occurs when semen, which would normally be ejaculated via the urethra, is redirected to the urinary bladder. What happens is that when it relaxes the prostate and bladder neck, the path of least resistance for the ejaculate is back into the bladder and not out of the penis. Hence there is no semen during ejaculation and the semen is released during urination.But retrograde ejaculation due to Rapaflo is a reversible side effect which reverses after the drug is stopped. Since you have stopped taking the drug, it should improve in a few days. If however the dry orgasm persists then get other causes ruled out which at your age include diabetes, seminal vesicle obstruction, multiple sclerosis, blocked sperm duct and any malignancy of urinary bladder.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Wishing you good health.",
