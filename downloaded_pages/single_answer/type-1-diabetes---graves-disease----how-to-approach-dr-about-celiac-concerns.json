            "answer": "Although\u00a0\u00a0am not a doctor, I have had diabetes for a long time and know that there are many diabetics who do have other autoimmune diseases like celiac.\u00a0\u00a0If you are concerned, i certainly don't see any harm in being tested.However, I think the most critical issue for all of us who have diabetes, is to have the kind of relationship with our doctor where we can share our concerns and be heard without fearing that we will be seen as hypochondriacs. Having a long term chronic disease does make us more aware and tuned into our bodies and our health.\u00a0\u00a0This is a good thing and in the long run, will help us manage our diabetes better.\u00a0\u00a0The more involved we are in the management of our care the better.\u00a0\u00a0This may have the effect of us asking more questions and raising more concerns with our doctors.\u00a0\u00a0Most doctors will welcome this kind of involvement from their diabetic patients.\u00a0\u00a0Try again to have this conversation with your doctor and if you get the same response, you may want to consider finding another doctor you feel more comfortable with.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck to you.Es",

    "question": "I've been feeling awful for several months, am now experiencing lethargy, easy bruising, and seem to be using less insulin to cover the foods I'm eating.\u00a0\u00a0I brought this up to my current endo, who then 'poo-poohed' me and sent me on my way, saying I was depressed (granted at the time I was a bit down due to a very stressful work situation, but didn't feel I was depressed. I rather tend to think of myself as quite positive!).I have a good friend, also Type 1 Diabetic, diagnosed a couple of months ago with Graves and recently with Celiac. She had no idea she was also dealing with Celiac disease (no symptoms, other than some malnourishment), and was told by the medical professionals that the incidence of Celiac amongst Type 1 Diabetics, and especially those presenting with OTHER autoimmune related items, is higher than one would think.\u00a0\u00a0Her doc tests all of his Type 1 patients dealing with other autoimmune symptoms for celiac once a year and is always on the lookout for Addison's disease.So... my questions are, should I be tested for this? How do I tell my endo this is something I'm concerned about (of course I'm afraid she'll tell me to 'be on my way...' I don't want to be labeled as a hypochondriac, but then again, I know that there are other items I should be on the lookout for, and perhaps she's not in that frame of mind).\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps I should find another endo?\u00a0\u00a0What's the general opinion on this?\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone else dealt with the same issue?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your replies.",
