Know that many partners have different sexual appetites and stamina. You know, there is such a thing as individual variation, and that is the best that I can come up with!S.A.Liroff, M.D.This information is provided for general medical educational purposes only.

    "question": "Hi....I'm writing coz I need a biological explanation for the way my partner is.\u00a0\u00a0He's a 33 year old man who's overweight, has type 2 diabetes, is a smoker, and leads a sedentary lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0However, he has no problems whatsoever when it comes to achieving and maintaining erections.\u00a0\u00a0In fact he's like a teenager in that department; he's able to achieve an extremely hard erection simply by thinking about sex or when we're just about to become intimate.\u00a0\u00a0Its like an off/on switch.\u00a0\u00a0The moment we're about to start being intimate he gets an erection, literally....no need for any stimulation. And he's able to maintain an extremely hard erection throughout sex and even after he climaxes....he remains hard (and I mean hard, not semi hard) until we're ready for a second round (or should I say until I'm ready for a second round).\u00a0\u00a0I'm a healthy 32 year old who's not overweight, not a smoker, doesn't have diabetes, and I exercise three times a week.\u00a0\u00a0I know I'm normal/average when it comes to achieving an erection and having a refractory period.\u00a0\u00a0I just need an explanation for how my partner is the way he is.\u00a0\u00a0I understand some people have higher libidos than others, but I don't think he desires sex more than I do (at least this is how I understand the word libido to be).\u00a0\u00a0I need an explanation coz everything I know about science and health suggests he should not be the way he is!\u00a0\u00a0Its making me a little self-conscious!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
