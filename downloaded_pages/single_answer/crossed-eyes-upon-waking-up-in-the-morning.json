            "answer": "Hi there,The exact cause of your symptoms can be determined only after a complete ophthalmological evaluation. Refractive errors like hyperopia may develop strabismus because of the additional amount of eye focusing required to keep objects clear. The other conditions leading to crossed eyes are cranial nerve palsy, diseases affecting the small arteries like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, hardening of arteries with aging etc.A stroke to the brain stem, thyroid disorders, myasthenia gravis and\u00a0\u00a0temporal arteritis are few other possible causes. Schedule an appointment with an ophthalmologist and get him evaluated. Hope you find this information useful.Take care and regards!",
