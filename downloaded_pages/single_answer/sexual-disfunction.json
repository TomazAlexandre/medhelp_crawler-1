            "answer": "Hello,You seem to be talking about retrograde ejaculation i.e. when the semen goes into the bladder instead of out through the penis. Common cause of such symptoms are ejaculatory duct obstruction, diabetes, medications for treating high blood pressure, prostate enlargement and mood disorders, retrograde ejaculation, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or seminal vesicle obstruction. Sometimes procedures like prostatectomy, transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP), transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), laser therapy of prostate and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) may also cause such symptoms.I suggest you to consult a urologist and get some investigations done. These include blood sugar levels, blood tests, ultrasound of the prostate, ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles and BP monitoring. Once the cause is identified, treatment can be palnned.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
