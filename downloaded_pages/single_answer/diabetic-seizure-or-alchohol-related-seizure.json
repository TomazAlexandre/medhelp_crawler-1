            "answer": "My first question to you would be how honest you are being, with your doctor or with yourself about your alcohol use. Doctors don't tend to refer to alcohol related seizures without some reason. And alcohol related seizures don't occur from drinking too much but from alcohol withdrawal in someone who is addicted. If alcohol has been a problem for you, I would continue with your sobriety; you've gone six months so keep up the good work. Have you had a seizure since soon after you stopped drinking?As for diabetic seizures they usually happen with extremely low blood sugar. How low were you? If you have frequent serious lows you need to monitor your blood sugar more often and treat anything under 60 and also to look at making changes in your insulin dosing.",
