            "answer": "I'm assuming George was tested for diabetes, thyroid and anemia. If you're not sure which tests he had done, ask for a copy of his records. (It's good to keep a home file anyway.) If any of those were not done, ask for them to be done.If he were my husband, I would want him to also have a sleep study to rule out any sleep disorders disrupting his sleep stages, even if not waking him. Poor sleep caused me to wake up nauseous, and felt weak and sleepy all time. May be a long shot, but worth a try. The sleep study will monitor his heart, brain waves, and respirations overnight, so all that could be good info to have.If these things are done and you have no answers, ask your docs what is next. They can't know how serious you feel this is unless you continue to tell them. With every thing they rule out, ask them what the next thing is they'll be looking for. Please let us know how things progress.",
