    "question": "86 yr male - fair health - mildly active, not bent over & sick but with fair number of age problems. Heart, diabetes, BP, ...Had blood in urine for 2 days last week after exercising. Urologist wants to run a series of tests- Blood work, CT scan, & colonoscope. Due to a stricture near end of my penis I don't want to do the scope part. I had a year of problems following prostate surgery several years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I told him if cancer was found I probably would not do anything at my age. I'm more interested in quality of life than extension of life. Am I\u00a0\u00a0being reasonable?",
