            "answer": "HI and thanks for using the forum.Diabetes cannot be diagnosed based on one elevated fasting blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0This is why your doctor wants you to go for further testing.\u00a0\u00a0A fasting glucose of 150 is high though and given your family history it is possible that you are developing diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0THe good news is that diabetes is manageable and many people can make lifestyle and diet changes that help bring those blood sugars down.\u00a0\u00a0Follow up with your doctor and start doing some research on diabetes management.\u00a0\u00a0Even if the rest of your blood tests come out OK, a family history of diabetes can make you more prone to developing it.\u00a0\u00a0So get educated now about it and ways to prevent or mange it.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.BridgetPS- the American Diabetes Association has a great website with a lot of information.\u00a0\u00a0Also, there are some great support communities on medhelp as well that are full of information.",
