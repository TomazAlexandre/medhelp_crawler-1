    "question": "So tomorrow i will be 33 weeks. I have been diagnosed to have gestational diabetes and i'm treating it with diet and home monitoring but lately i have been suffering from an extreme low blood pressure that ranges between 92/54 and 80/44 my doctor asked me to rest and to eat things that have magnesium! I am not pretty sure that this is enough! I just moved to Milano, Italy and having a real hard time in communicating. It is just devastating. Have any of you ladies had the same high blood sugar and very low blood pressure! I am confused wether to eat more or not to eat!",
