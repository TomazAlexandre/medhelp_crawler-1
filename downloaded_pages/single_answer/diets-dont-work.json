    "question": "I am a 42 yr old woman suffering from MS and am carrying an extra 182 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0My weight was fine until about 14 years ago when I suddenly piled it on despite not changing my food intake or preparation or amount or energy expenditure.\u00a0\u00a0I have had my thyroid tested several times with all results being negative as have tests for type 2 diabetes (my father has the latter).\u00a0\u00a0I do suffer from B12 and folic acid deficiency.I have tried numerous diets and none worked except for the cambridge diet although even on that diet, my weight loss was slow to start with - I didn't lose anything in the 1st week despite not cheating!\u00a0\u00a0I eventually lost all my excess weight and then followed a low fat, low sugar calorie controlled diet but put all the weight back on again! I kept a food diary after I came off the cambridge diet and walked a minimum of 15,000 steps a day and my doctor said that I was eating a healthy diet but couldn't explain why I was putting on weight at the rate of approx 10lb a month!It was extremely soul destroying!!! I've since discovered that I suffer from mild PCOS and I have insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0I'm tempted to go back on the cambridge diet to lose some of the weight, but know that I can't live on it for the rest of my life, I'm also weary of going on a low carb diet as I've always been told that missing out a one of the major food groups and a bad idea!\u00a0\u00a0I've also been diagnosed with MS in the last year and my main problem areas are balance and co-ordination, and bladder weakness.Does anyone have any ideas?",
