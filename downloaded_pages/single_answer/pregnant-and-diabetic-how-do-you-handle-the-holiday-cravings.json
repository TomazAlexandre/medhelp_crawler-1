            "answer": "I dont have diabetes but have gall stones and am almost 18 weeks pregnant and have a very limited diet.\u00a0\u00a0With me i just have to remember that that one cookie could (and likely will) put me in the hospital for emergency surgery.\u00a0\u00a0It was very very hard but i did pretty good.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of grabbing cookies here and there or dessert i opted for celery amd cucumbers. Boring i know.\u00a0\u00a0I cant have any fat so mashed potatoes made with butter and or milk were out and so was gravy which i love. I just had to remind myself it wont last forever and i am putting the baby first. As mothers we learn to put our children ahead of ourselves and i am just doing that before he or she gets here.\u00a0\u00a0Once this baby and the gallbladder are out and i am able to eat again i am making a huge list of things i am eating! I also have to drink an insane amount of water so that helps me feel full to resist the urge to grab that awesome looking fudge! I also told everyone who tried to give me cookies and sweets that i cant eat them so they could give them to someone else, in a nice way and they understood. Who wants the temptation! Hubby and toddler didnt like it as much!\u00a0\u00a0I wish you the best with everything! It wont last forever!",
