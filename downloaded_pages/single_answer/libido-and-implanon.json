            "answer": "Hello,There is no relation between loss of libido and implanon. Loss of libido is very commonly found in women and mostly the cause is psychological in nature. It can be due to stress and anxiety or relationship problems with your partner.However if there is no stress and anxiety then the physical causes need to be ruled out. These include anemia, diabetes and hormonal imbalance. Some investigations which need to be done( some may have been done in the hormonal studies) are follicle stimulating hormone levels, estradiol, thyroxine and thyrotrophin levels in the blood test reports.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing",
