    "question": "Back in October I ended up in the hospital, diagnosed with a-fib. Including that stay in the hospital, I was in 3 times as the doctors tried to convert.\u00a0\u00a0Finally on the 3rd - with a med. called Tikosyn.\u00a0\u00a0Including that med. I'm on about 16 different meds., some for diabetes, some for blood pressure and adema, some for asthma (diagnosed when I went on lopressor).\u00a0\u00a0One good outcome had been my sugar levels being consistently good since that 1st stay, until almost a month ago.\u00a0\u00a0Because of some difficulties, my doctor switched a couple of my blood pressure/a-fib meds. and just before that added magnesium. For almost a month now, my sugars have consistently been in the upper 200s and low 300s (prior to the change were from 70 - 180).\u00a0\u00a0Is this just a coincidence? Has my diabetes kicked into overdrive on its own, or is the change in my meds a reasonably possible culprit?Thanks.",
