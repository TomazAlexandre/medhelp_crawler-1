    "question": "I had the Nissen operation in 1999 , and it has been the biggest mistake of my life. I cannot burp or vomit any longer and I am contuinally bloated and uncomfortable. I would like to get the gastric band fitted, but some of the Private doctors have told me that this cannot be done , even if I get the nissen reversed. Please could someone shed light on the reversal and then a gastric band. I also have diabetes type 2, and have just finshed getting my overactive thyroid under control. I sound like a walking wreck and I feel it too.",
