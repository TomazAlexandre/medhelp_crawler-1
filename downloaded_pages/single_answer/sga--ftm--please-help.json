    "question": "I'm 32 weeks along and have just been told that my baby is SGA (Small for Gestational Age). He is measuring at 31 weeks and his AC (Abdominal Circumference) is 3 weeks behind :( I also have gestational diabetes hence am on a strict diet. I'm a FTM and worried sick about my baby and Google is only making it worse. Any of you other mummy's have any experience with SGA? Were your babies okay? Is there anything I can do to make him grow as he should and avoid premature birth? Any input at all would be highly appreciated! My OB appointment is tonight but I just want some peace of mind for the time being...",
