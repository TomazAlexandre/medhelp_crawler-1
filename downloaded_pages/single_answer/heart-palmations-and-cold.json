            "answer": "Hello,Various possibilities are there for such kind of symptoms which need evaluation.First of all thyroid evaluation has to be done as hypothyroidism is responsible for tingling sensations as well as feeling cold,dizziness and palpitations of the heart.I strongly recommend consulting an endocrinologist and getting thyroid hormone studies done.Other possibilities are orthostatic hypotension(low BP), diabetes, stroke, transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis.Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause tingling sensations.In my opinion,pls consult a physician/endocrinologist and get the thyroid status checked.If negative then other possibilities have to be probed.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",
