            "answer": "IBS is certainly possible, but other causes like chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or malabsorption can also lead to these symptoms.If suspected, blood tests to look at the amylase/lipase, a colonoscopy, and stool tests to exclude malabsorption can all be considered.If negative, then optimizing treatment of IBS can be done - including increasing fiber in the diet, or antispasmodic agents.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patients education only.

    "question": "I was diagnosed w/IBS 20 years ago: symptoms are gas (belching and farting), intestinal growling/twitching, mucusy discharge/stools, difficulty thinking.\u00a0\u00a0Had lower GI then w/no pathology.\u00a0\u00a0BUT change in symptoms past few years have me concerned. Additionally now stools often have nasty smoky smell, like an ashtray or tar. They are floating, lightish in color (golden tan) and consistency (smeary).\u00a0\u00a0Physical in '05 showed no elevations in bloodtests (exception: blood in urine for which I had CT scan and csyto, and glucose at 111, but no diabetes or cancer, etc detected).\u00a0\u00a0Had him bloodtest me in '07 for celiac's: also negative.\u00a0\u00a0He now wants to ultrasound gallbladder.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure why.Are my foul floaters another symptom of IBS or could it be something worse: gallblader, pancreas, liver diseases or damage? I am female, 47, slim and active. I'm totally healthy except for the digestive annoyances, migraines and (new, pre-menopausal?) allergies, and on no meds except advil and allegra when needed. My alcoholic aunt developed kidney failure and then colon cancer, and I remember she smelled like my poops. I'm high-strung and drink alcohol (avg 2 ) daily, but my my IBS is stress-related and the alcohol relaxes me and relieves my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be really worried and having a bunch more invasive tests?",
