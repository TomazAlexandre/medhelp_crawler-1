            "answer": "Hello,Diabetes predisposes to skin rashes and infections which takes a long time to heal. From your symptoms it can be an insect bite, contact dermatitis or irritated hair follicle.You may take oral antihistaminics like Benadryl or zyrtec. Also apply calamine lotion as it has a soothing effect on the skin. You can apply OTC steroid cream but for severe symptoms, you are requested to consult a dermatologist as oral steroids may be needed.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
