    "question": "I've had a constant burning sensation behind one knee for more than a month. I consulted a dermatologist who found nothing wrong with my skin and dx'd it as parestesia. I've now had burning sensation on top of tongue for about a week. Any idea what might be causing this? (I am looking for a neurologist in my insurance program).\u00a0\u00a0thank you.",
