They have a website and data base that may help you to reach some researchers who are MD's working in the field of gastroparesis.http://www.rarediseases.org/search/rdbdetail_abstract.html?disname=GastroparesisThe problem with your son's condition is if he's already suffered gastric neuropathy, the pacemaker will not work for him. It's much like the pacemaker that's used for the heart. The neurons have to be intact and functional for a pacemaker to work. If his neurons are already dysfunctional or gone, there will be nothing there to 'pace.'",

    "question": "My son has chronic gastroparesis caused by type1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0For the past year and a half he has been in and out of the hospital (mostly the VA hospital in Gainesville, Fl. ).\u00a0\u00a0He also suffered a bloodclot in the lungs so he has to take blood thinners.\u00a0\u00a0Over time the pain from the constant vomiting causes him great pain and he was given dilaudid for the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Now when he goes to the hospital dehydrated, vomiting, and in pain, the doctors won't give him the dilaudid. the other pain meds just don't work for him.\u00a0\u00a0However, he's been labeled addicted to the drug, which that may be but I think it is inhumane to let a person suffer in pain for ten-twelve hours. He also has a feeding tube and he says when he's put on the pump he feels pressure on his stomach even\u00a0\u00a0though the tube is connected to his bowel.\u00a0\u00a0Some Dr.'s tell him to eat small meals several times a day.\u00a0\u00a0Others tell him don't eat just feed thru the tube.\u00a0\u00a0Some Dr.'s say you should get a stomach pacemaker and others say he is not a good candidate for it.\u00a0\u00a0We need help!\u00a0\u00a0My son is 39 yrs old.\u00a0\u00a0Where can we find a specialist in this field to help us?This discussion is related to/posts/show/770145.",
