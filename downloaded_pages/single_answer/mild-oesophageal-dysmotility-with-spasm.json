            "answer": "Hi, motility disorders can cause the symptoms described by you. Motility disorders are functional disorders. Medications to promote motility may help in emptying the intestines by promoting motility. Your doctor has prescribed medications to control acid levels and to promote motility. Diabetes mellitus can cause autonomic neuropathy and consequent slower motility of the intestinal tract. Hope this has been ruled out. Follow up with your doctor. Regards.",
