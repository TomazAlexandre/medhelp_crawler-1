            "answer": "Hello,Your partner seems to be having erectile dysfunction. Common causes causing erection problem are stress and anxiety,poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, which make sex a task rather than a pleasure,negative feelings about non performance,smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord injury or nerve problems.Your partner should get a detailed evaluation done from a urologist to confirm the cause. At young age, it is mostly due to psychological reasons.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Ive been with this guy for a year and a half now, and no matter what i do he cant seem to get an erection and when he does it only lasts for maybe 10-15 minutes. The longer weve been together the bigger the problem gets. Also he is only 18? Im not sure if that interferes with the problem but even when he is very aroused he cant seem to get it up. Weve even tried multiple hard on pills, nothing works. What do i do? What could the problem be? Any information would be great! Thanks",
