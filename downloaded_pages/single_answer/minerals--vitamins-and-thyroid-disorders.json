Magnesium is necessary for both the action of insulin and the manufacture of insulin and a deficiency is linked to insulin resistance, pre diabetes and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Only 0.3% of magnesium is in blood serum so at a cellular level you could be very deficient.\u00a0\u00a0Magnesium is also the most important co factor for vitamin D absorption and all the major minerals (calcium, potassium, sodium) are dependent on magnesium being present in order to function.Low or deficient vitamin A is noted in hypothyroidism due to the slowing down of beta carotene to vitamin A conversion. As your thyroid is overactive, having good levels of vitamin A is not surprising.
