    "question": "hi,doctor. I am a 23 year-old student with left localised scalp paresthesia for the past one week. I feel numb when i touch it for which the sensation is different from the right side. The scalp paresthesia happens worse when I press my left elbow on the table but never on the right side even i press my right elbow on the table. Am i having nerve compression symptom? what are the complications? is it necessary for me to seek any treatment? really thanks so much, doctor.",
