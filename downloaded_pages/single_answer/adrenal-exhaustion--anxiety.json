    "question": "Recently I read about how anxiety, stress weight, and fatigue can be linked to adrenal exhaustion. The articles I read claimed that anxiety from unresolved conflicts or depression can cause your adrenal gland to release to much of the hormones that keep you energized and assist in your metabolic rate. Then the adrenal gland can no longer produce or release more of these vital hormones throughout the majority of the time, making you tired, sluggish, and lowering you metabolism. The suppliments recommended were fish oils, low levels of DHEA, deglycyrhizinated licorice and ginseng. It also reccomended trying to resolve the conflict. When I went to Whole Foods, I was told to start out just with the DHEA and deglycyrhizinated licorice then add fish oil and ginseng if necessary. Having read the side effects of DHEA I definitely do not want to overdo it, so I got the 10mg bottle. Is this too much? Should my intake be every other day?Also, hyper and hypo thyroid conditions run in my family. In addition, an Aunt of mine went through a horrible divorce at a young age, ever since then she struggled with depression, is always tired and went through ealry menopause. Her uterus became useless and harmful to her around age 30 and was removed.making her unable to have kids. To me these effects sound like Adrenal Fatique from the articles I have read. This adds to my anxiety b/c I really want to have kids.In your opinion, could these symptoms be caused by a thyroid or adrenal issue? Should I begin using DHEA and see where it goes, then if I have no weight loss or decreased depression assume I have hypo-thyroid? Since I am inbetween jobs and without health insurance I am unable to consult my physician. Hopefully I will get hired for a promising position later today, but then health insurance would still take a while to kick in.Any insite or advice would be helpful. Thank you!",
