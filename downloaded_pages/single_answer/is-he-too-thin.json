            "answer": "It is never bad to have labwork that is normal, rather than catastrophic, and its also good to get a baseline to compare future labs to, in this cat who is now middle aged. I recommend yearly labwork in older pets, to be proactive rather than wait for diseases to become chronic and less treatable. Potential causes for weight loss in older cats include hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, diabetes, and intestinal disease or parasites. I recommend having a senior wellness blood panel with thyroid levels. Even is all is normal, you will be able to rest better.",

    "question": "Here is the situation:Every morning my dad and I give my cats a treat of canned cat food. Dried cat food is out all day in which my cat goes to and eats when he is hungry.Lately, I've noticed that my eldest cat, Fatty (who used to be chubby when he was younger), has gotten a bit thin. His ribs and spine and hip bones feel more prominent than usual. I recently gave him a trim because he is a long haired, indoor cat, therefore I am not sure if he has been on the thin side for a while or not. He isn't lethargic, his gums are of normal color (in comparison to my other 1 1/2 year old male cat) and he has plenty of energy. I weighed him this morning and he weighed about 10 1/2 lbs which he has always weighed, so I don't know if I'm exaggerating something minor or not.As of today, I am watching him eat his food and making sure he eats all of it. I'm buying cat treats and \"Googling\" ways to make him eat more and what not.The question: Is it a good idea to try getting him to gain weight for a few days before taking him to a vet? I'm scared I'll take him and spend a good amount of money for nothing to be wrong with him.",
