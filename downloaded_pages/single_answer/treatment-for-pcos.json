            "answer": "I have PCOS too. I was diagnosed when I\u00a0\u00a0was 19. I used to have heavy periods and I would bleed for weeks there was one time I was bleeding\u00a0\u00a0for 22 days. Then doc put me on birth control pills to control and regularize my periods. It didn't work. I switched to an RE when i was ttc. She put me on metformin, its a tablet used to treat type 2 diabetes. Also since PCOS patients have elevated levels of insulin this medicine does the trick. I have heard that some of the pcos patients have got regular periods just being on metformin.\u00a0\u00a0Did you ask your doc why they put you on krimson-35?",
