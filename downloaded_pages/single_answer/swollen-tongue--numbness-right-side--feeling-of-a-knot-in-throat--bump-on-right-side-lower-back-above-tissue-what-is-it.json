            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for writing in this forum.I will try to give the differential diagnosis of the various symptoms that you are having.First of all the bump that you are having can be a swollen lymph node or a sebaceous cyst. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection along with other numerous causes.Treatment is usually cold compresses,over the counter anti-inflammatory analgesics(pain killers) like acetaminophen or ibuprofen,antibiotics if cause of infection is suspected to be a bacteria and surgical drainage if there is any abscess formation.Sebaceous cyst is a closed sac that fills with a fatty white material called sebum produced by sebaceous glands of the epidermis.It is usually painless but can become painful if infected.Then antibiotics are needed.If even after treatment the lump persists then biopsy or FNAC of the lump has to be done to see what is causing this lump.Secondly,this feeling of something in the throat while swallowing is called globus hystericus. Globus hystericus is a subjective sensation where people feel a lump in the throat. At times, it is associated with difficulties swallowing. They are probably related to psychological problems. The most common cause is gastro esophageal reflux disease - GERD. GERD is treated by antacids, bland diet, small evening meals and elevation of the head of the bed.Lastly,numbness can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.Warm regards.",
