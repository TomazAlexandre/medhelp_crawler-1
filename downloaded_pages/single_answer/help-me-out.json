            "answer": "I really don't know what 20/20 and 50/50 insulin is. Most of us use fast acting insulins like Humulog or Apidra for our mealtime bolus and long-acting ones like Lantus for our basal. If you are spiking from 60 to 250 you are either eating too much carbs, taking too little insulin or both. I suggest getting on a regimen of determining your bolus dose by counting carbs. To do this you need to formulate an insulin:carb ratio. You can start with 1 unit of insulin for every 15 carbs and work up or down until you find the ratio that keeps your blood sugar in target range two hours after your meal. You might want to get the book Using Insulin by John Walsh that explains dosing and carb counting.",
