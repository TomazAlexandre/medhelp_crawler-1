            "answer": "Hello,higher than usual blood sugar can make you feel tired.To feel better you could try following a low carb diet (by reducing the blood sugar swings your energy should be much better) and also adding in at least 30 minutes of exercise each day.\u00a0\u00a0Though it sounds strange, exercising can actually make you feel better.You should also ask your Dr to check your thyroid levels.\u00a0\u00a0Low thyroid is quite common for people with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0YOu can also aks for your b vitamin levels to be checked.To know which foods to eat, you can check your blood sugar 2 hours after first bite of food.\u00a0\u00a0If after eating that food / meal your blood sugar is less than 120 (or at worst less than 140) then you know that food / meal is suitable.\u00a0\u00a0IF your blood sugar is higher, then you should adjust the meal next time (typically by reducing the carb content / increasing the healthy fat content (fat slows carbohydrate digestion and means it has less impact on your blood sugars)).Hope this helps.",
