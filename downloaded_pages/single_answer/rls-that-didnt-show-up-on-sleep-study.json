            "answer": "Hi there!While most cases of RLS test positive on a sleep study, a few might not. A positive sleep study is not a required to diagnose RLS, though it can fortify the diagnosis. In the absence of a positive sleep study, alternative diagnosis may need to be considered and if RLS is established as a diagnosis one would want to look at secondary causes such as iron deficiency, varicose vein or venous insuffiiency, folate deficiency, magnesium deficiency, fibromyalgia, sleep apnea, uremia, diabetes, thyroid disease, peripheral neuropathy, parkinson's disease and a few auto-immune disorders such as sjogren's syndrome, celiac disease, and rheumatoid arthritis etc; that could possibly be related and could help in deciding on a management plan. You may like to discuss these in detail with your treating doctor.Hope this helps.Take care!",
