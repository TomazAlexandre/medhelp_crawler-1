            "answer": "It is quite possible you have a gal stone that got lodged in the tube going into the liver. That would be quite painful. It could cause the liver to not function right. It is also possible to develop gall stones with out a gall bladder. Have they checked your pancreas? that is such a small organ but can cause the symptoms you describe. I have had both of these problems and I would not wish this on anyone. Do you still have your appendix. Keep asking and seeing doctors until you get your answers. Either the diagnosis was wrong or they nicked something or did something wrong during your surgery. It is more likely they got just part of the problem.Let me know what you find out.",

    "question": "I am only 22 years old and about 4 years ago I started having horrible stomach problems. My symptoms were extreme upset stomach, diarrhea, pain below my ribs on the left and especially the right. Finally, I went to a gastro doctor who gave me a colonoscopy, an upper G I, and a blood test to test for h-pylori. All of those tests were normal so the gastro said I had IBS. So I started a high fiber diet and things just got worse. Finally after a year I decided to go back to the gastro doctor. I ended up having a blood test to test for thyroid problems, a blood test to see my sugar levels because diabetes is in my family, a gastric emptying test, an ultrasound to test for gallstones, and a gallbladder test that contracts your gallbladder to see at what percentage it works at (i forget what its called). It turns out all my tests are normal except my sugar levels were a little high and the gallbladder contraction test. I end up being dianosed with Biliary Dyskinesia and they ended up removing my gall bladder which was only working at 18%. My surgeon said my gall bladder was distended and inflamed, so they had to drain it before they could remove it. Anyways, it has been almost a year since my surgery and\u00a0\u00a0I still feel nauseous 24/7, have diarrhea as soon as I eat-sometimes I am not even finished eating, have pain in the same spot, and get extremly shakey when I get hungry and then after I eat, and I have gain around 12 pounds since my surgery and have not changed my eating habits at all.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do or any information on what is wrong with me? Please help!",
