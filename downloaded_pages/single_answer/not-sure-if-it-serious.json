    "question": "Yesterday I was playing with my dog outside. It was nice and warm but then my boot came off in the snow I didn't tie it tight. Then my dog thought it was a game to dig and run and make my boot go in the snow more. (we live in Alaska) I forgot that my foot only had a little protection from the snow cold, I was out there digging in the snow without snow pants or any snow protective snow gear. And I realized I was out there for nearly 10 minutes without my shoe. I went inside (it was a 1/4 a mile away, and foot going numb so I cant feel it) I was running and there is oil and stuff everywhere because we run a sawmill. Then I get in the house and didnt look at my foot. By the time I took a shower I wasn't able to take the shower or stand or even putting it in the warm water it was on the BOTTOM arch of my foot. Then, I put a cool rag on it last night. I'm walking with my heel and my good foot. My mom has it in Epsom salt mixed with water and hydrogen proxide. Im home alone and its getting worse and now forming a blister. If I go to the doctors what will they do and will I have to use crutches ???",
