    "question": "My 1 hour glucose test levels came back elevated, so now I have to do the 3 hour test. My mom had gestational diabetes with all three of her pregnancies so I figured I would have it to, but I'm scared! I'm reading about all the increased risks for my baby, and I can't help but feel bad/guilty even though I know there's nothing I can do to prevent it. I'm just hoping I pass the 3 hour test and don't have to deal with it. Anybody else that is going/has gone through this?",
