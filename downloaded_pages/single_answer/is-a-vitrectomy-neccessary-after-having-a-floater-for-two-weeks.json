    "question": "Okay, first question on this forum, so please be gentle. ;)I live in Tasmania, Australia (G'day!). I've had Diabetes Type 2 for eight years now. I started laser photocoagulation treatment in January this year for the beginnings of very minor non-proliferative retinopathy. On the 28th February I got a large black floater in my left eye. My surgeon has recommended a vitrectomy if the floater in my left eye doesn't clear up within a fortnight.As he's the only laser surgeon in the island state of Tasmania, I'd value a second opinion. Doesn't a vitrectomy seem overly aggressive treatment for something that could clearup in more than a fortnight?",
