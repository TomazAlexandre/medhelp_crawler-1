    "question": "Hello,My mother is 71 years old and she has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes since 2001, she takes pills for it and monitor her blood sugar levels every morning.Just in case this is important for this issue, she also has a tyroid condition so she takes Tirosint.She used to be able to see great from afar for many years unlike me who is 33 years old and has started to show signs of myopia since 1998-1999, but we have noticed starting 4 months ago that there was a big and sudden myopic shift even though she never had myopia before and from what I gather it has increased quite a bit since then.Is this a sign of danger for her eyes? And is there anything we can do to prevent this from progressing further?",
