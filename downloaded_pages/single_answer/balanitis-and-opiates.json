    "question": "I was diagnosed with diabetes a year and a half ago.About ten years prior to that, I had what I thought was an STD scare. I'd never had unprotected sex and at 18 years old, I was pretty dismayed at what I considered significant damage to my goods when I grew a simultaneous sore on my mouth and on the area between the tip and shaft of my penis.It occurred shortly after I'd tried Vicodin for the first time.I didn't have a re-occurance until last year when I associated it finally with diabetes. I had since been tested for STDs and that came back negative.My question is this: Could I have an allergy to something in pharmacudical opiates that spurs Balanitis in to rear its ugly head (no pun intended there)?I'm otherwise managing diabetes ok. Not great, just ok. What can I do to never have this again?",
