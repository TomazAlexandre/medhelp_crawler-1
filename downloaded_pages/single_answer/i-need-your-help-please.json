            "answer": "Hi!The connection between diplopia and localized hot sensation can be high blood pressure. A very high blood pressure or a blood pressure that suddenly spikes up can cause pressure symptoms, mild hemorrhage and leaking etc in the brain which can result in diplopia or double vision. This happens due to brain damage. High BP can also cause hemorrhage in eye and subsequent diplopia. This high BP can result from plaques or clots in arteries and veins and this can give a localized hot sensation. So get your blood pressure checked. A heat sensation or sudden feeling of warmth can also be a sign of pinched nerve or due to diabetic neuropathy. If you are a female and on birth control pills, then this could be due to the side effect of pills as they can also cause deep vein thrombosis. For diagnosis first a duplex ultrasound or color dopplar would need to be done. If this is negative then a nerve conduction study and test for diabetes. If there is a chance then if everything else is negative, then lupus may need to be tested for.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
