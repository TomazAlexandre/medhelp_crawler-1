            "answer": "Positive ANA results are found in patients who have various autoimmune diseases, infections, cancer, lung diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, hormonal diseases, blood diseases, skin diseases, the elderly, people with a family history of rheumatic disease. ANAs are actually found in about 5% of the normal population.You mention you have GERD and this is mainly due to insufficient stomach acid.\u00a0\u00a0Supplementing with digestive enzyme supplements (to digest foods) and betaine HCI with pepsin supplements (to make up for stomach acid insufficiency) will help prevent GERD.Diseases associated with low stomach acid:AsthmaDiabetesOsteoporosisArthritisHepatitisEczemaAcne rosaceaDry SkinPsoriasisParasitesGallbladder diseaseHerpesHivesHypothyroidism (Hashimoto's Thyroiditis)Hyperthyroidism (Graves' Disease)ThyrotoxicosisLupus ErythematosusMyasthenia GravisAutoimmune Pernicious AnaemiaCeliac DiseaseSjogren's SyndromeHashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease are positively associated with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria (CIU). Thyroid autoantibodies are found in 27% of patients with CIU.Peripheral neuropathy is damage to the peripheral nervous system and causes symptoms such as pins and needles, burning, numbness. There are many conditions that cause peripheral neuropathy. On the list above, this includes Diabetes, Hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's Thyroiditis), Lupus Erythematosus, Autoimmune Pernicious Anaemia, Celiac Disease, Sjogren's Syndrome.Peripheral neuropathy >>>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_neuropathyLead levels can rise when when calcium and iron intake is inadequate. Vitamin D is needed to absorb calcium from the diet.Causes of vitamin D deficiency include:* Lack of sunlight.* Living north of 35\u00b0 latitude (eg: Europe, Canada, two thirds of the US). There are no UVB rays between the months of November through March due to the angle of the sun.* Dark or black skin needs up to 10 times the amount of sun than light skin to absorb vitamin D into the skin.* Wearing sunscreen - prevents absorption of UVB rays.* Lack of vitamin D co-factors - magnesium (most important co-factor), zinc, vitamin K2, boron, and a tiny amount of vitamin A.* Too much calcium affects magnesium levels. For instance, milk is about 8 parts calcium to 1 part magnesium. Too much milk will lead to a magnesium deficiency and in turn will lead to a vitamin D deficiency.* Low cholesterol - cholesterol is the precursor to vitamin D. Vitamin D3 is made in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol absorbs UVB ultraviolet light at wavelengths between 270--300 nm.* Kidney and liver problems - processed (metabolized) by the liver and kidneys into an active form of vitamin D.* Hashimoto's Thyroiditis - genetic defects in the receptor site for vitamin D. Patients need higher amounts of Vitamin D to maintain health, even if their blood tests show sufficient Vitamin D.* Parathyroid conditions (parathyroid - glands in front of the thyroid). PTH (parathyroid hormone) regulates calcium in the blood.\u00a0\u00a0As the calcium level increases, the level of vitamin D decreases.* Malabsorption problems like celiac's disease. Some people with celiac disease have no signs or symptoms.* Medications - statins (cholesterol lowering drugs), acid lowering medications, anti-inflammatories, laxatives, prednisone, corticosteroids, barbiturates.* Very large or obese body, as a larger body requires more vitamin D.* Very low fat diet; in order to absorb vitamin D the body needs to have fat (vitamin D is fat-soluble).* Older age, as the skin converts less vitamin D from sunlight.* Fat malabsorption conditions such as Cystic Fibrosis.* Hereditary disorders (rare):- Renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (also called type I hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets)- Type II Hereditary Vitamin D-Dependent Rickets- Type III hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets",

    "question": "Hello,I recently tested positive with the ANA test.\u00a0\u00a0It was ANA titer 1:80\u00a0\u00a0Speckled.Also it has been confirmed that I've had chronic inflammation over several months.\u00a0\u00a0The test for that was consistent CRP levels.My rheumatoid panel, ANA-9-Line, and CCP were negative so that rules out Rheumatoid arthritis I think.Metabolism is fine.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid and vitamin levels are good.\u00a0\u00a0Anxiety has been ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Lyme tests were all negative.Myasthenia gravis was ruled out.Nerve tests show mild carpal tunnel in both wrists.\u00a0\u00a0Also abnormal nerve conduction in both elbows.\u00a0\u00a0These were done over a year ago though.\u00a0\u00a0I had a clean MRI but that too is a year old now.\u00a0\u00a0Just two years ago my ANA was negative so...At this point it is the only thing that has been ruled out.Here are my symptoms:overall malaiseMuscle weakness/fatigueMuscle twitchesSome spots feel like icey hot is on it.Pins and needles in the affected areasthese aren't random either.\u00a0\u00a0Very consistent areas.Mainly in the extremities.All joints have pain/weakness including neckSome of the larger muscle groups get cramp-like feelingsRecently my throat has a spot that feels like a cramp is happeningLow grade fevers all the timedizzy/vertigospeech is slurryNew thing is the outer side of my knees are tender.My voice is weaker if that makes any sense.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like it takes more effort to talk and breath.So far it seems like really hot and humid days make it worse.\u00a0\u00a0Cold I think but we'll see this winter.I get a rash regularly on my arms.Have been diagnosed in the past with:GERDSleep Apnea (hypopnea) - I use a CPAPChronic Idiopathic UrticariaOther findings include low vitamin D (mind you I eat a diet rich in vitamin D, I do go outside, and I supplement)Vitamin D correction has had no affect on anything else.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect whatever is going on is causing mal-absorption.My blood lead level was borderline but I'm not exposed to lead in my day to day.\u00a0\u00a0Though I read that low vitamin D can cause your body to retain lead.Whatcha think?",
