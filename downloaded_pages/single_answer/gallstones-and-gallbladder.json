            "answer": "If your gallbladder was to worsen it would effect the pancreas, i dont think that would happen anytime soon but its still a worry. My mom waited 10 yrs to have hers out and now shes had probs with her pancreas flaring up. I wouldnt worry right now about surgery but if\u00a0\u00a0you started getting more attacks and more frequently then i would consider it.",

    "question": "One year back during Ultrasound I was found to have two small gallstones of 3mm dia while the common bile duct is said to be 4mm in dia. I have no problems except for two minor episodes of pain in right rib area. Pain has been tolerable. I also have type II diabetes. Doctors want that I should have the gallbladder removed. What is the harm if I do not remove the gallbladder? Could the stones pass thru the duct opening since the stones are smaller than bile duct dia?I always had elevated bilirubin and was told it is Gilbert's syndrome. Will taking the gallbladder cause bilirubin level to go even higher? I was thinking that since the stones have not been bothering much - why go for a surgery.",
