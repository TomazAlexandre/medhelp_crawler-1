            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Erectile dysfunction is the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. Generally if there is any problem in the normal physiology of erection it can result in failure of erection, weak erection or early loss of erection. Many causes are there of which diabetes and low testosterone are the most important. Hence these should be eliminated first along with varicoceles. Other causes are stress and anxiety, depression, poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations making sex a task rather than a pleasure, and fear of non performance based on previous experience. Smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs can also be a cause. In your case may not be true. Medical conditions such as high blood pressure, poor circulation and peripheral vascular disease, heart or thyroid conditions,\u00a0\u00a0spinal cord injury, nerve damage (for example, from prostate surgery), or neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease) can all cause erection problems. Though these medical conditions may not be there in your case they need case they need to be ruled out one by one. Other than all this it could be injury to shaft of penis due to masturbation.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

I have been looking at porn and masturbating for many years and think this may have something to do with it. I have stopped both for over a month now and am not seeing much result. I can almost get an erection then my mind doubts itself and its a fail after that. It is really starting to get to me.\u00a0\u00a0My biggest problem is I am in a relationship with a girl of my dreams and it is really effecting us. I have yet to have a successful sexual experience with her. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",
