            "answer": "There is the blood test to determine if you are pregnant. I know they measure the beta and the progesterone - to make sure your body is producing enough to sustain a pg.I think my doctor also checked my cholesterol (not sure why), overall blood levels, and tested for some STD's. The HIV test was optional, but I was told that if I was not tested during the 1st and 3rd trimester that the babies would have to get this blood test while they are in the hospital after the delivery.I am having the sequential screen done to determine the risk of the babies having certain chromosomal abnormalities. This test involves having 2 blood draws taken - the first will be at 12w and I think the 2nd is at 16w.During the 2nd trimester, there is a blood test to determine if you have gestational diabetes. If you pass the 1st test, then you do not need to take another. I failed this test when I was pg with my 1st so I had to take the fasting 3 hour diabetes test. The first test involves one blood draw. The second test, the fasting test, involves 3 blood draws 1 hour a part.These are all the blood tests I remember getting with my 1st. My friend was tested for the varicella (chickenpox) and measles antibodies. I am not sure when she had this blood test. The doctor told her that she was not immune and should get vaccinated after she had her baby.",
