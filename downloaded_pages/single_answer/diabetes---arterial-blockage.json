    "question": "My father was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 40 - he goes in every year for his check ups - about six years ago they found blockage in his left leg - they told him that there were at least 3 areas that had 80% blockage - and just within the last 2 years they finally operated and corrected the blockage.\u00a0\u00a0 My concern is, they had also found blockage in the past\u00a0\u00a0in his right leg but never did anything about it.\u00a0\u00a0He recently went to the same doctor for a check up and the doctor now says he cannot do anything for him.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The nurse spoke with my father and told him that what the doctor was saying is not true and that they can help him and if something is not done soon he may possibly lose his leg.\u00a0\u00a0Can you give me any suggestions???\u00a0\u00a0 I told him to get a second opinion.",
