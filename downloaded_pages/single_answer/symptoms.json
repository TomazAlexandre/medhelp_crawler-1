            "answer": "Hi and very sorry you are experiencing this. Due to your symptoms and lack of other symptoms it is hard to say for sure that you have Chikungunya, so you should see a doctor right away. But it is the most close, disease symptom wise, and since they have outbreaks of it in the area to Chikungunya. Since you are young and healthy if this is Chikungunya if you get the other symptoms of fever, muscle pain, rash, or headache those go away in about a week. The joint pain takes about a month.\u00a0\u00a0If you have diabetes, high blood pressure or heart problems it can be more serious.\u00a0\u00a0You can take Ibuprofen for the joint pain as directed by the package. It would be good for you to see a doctor to make sure this isn't something more serious.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to rest, take in plenty of fluids (8 glasses of water or combined fluids a day) and the Ibuprofen for pain if it doesn't contradict anything you are taking now. It doesn't sound like the symptoms of dengue. I wouldn't put it off it would be best to go in and get checked by a doctor.mkh9",
