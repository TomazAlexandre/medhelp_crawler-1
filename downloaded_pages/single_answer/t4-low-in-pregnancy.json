    "question": "Hi, I'm 30 weeks pregnant. I discovered at 28 weeks I developed gestational diabetes. The doctors are trying to keep it under control with a diet so I will not need insulin. Seems it works. However, they did test TSH and T4. It was discovered that my T4 is 10.4 (should have been in the range between 12 and 22). I never had problems with the thyroid. I am extremely concerned because I read that low T4 gives mental retard to the baby. Tomorrow I'll go to an endocrinologist but I thought to ask here, too, being that concerned... Please, can anyone help me with an answer? Many thanks.",
