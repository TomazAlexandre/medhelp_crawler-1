            "answer": "Hi!Commonest cause of increased frequency of urination is UTI, both due to a STD and non STD infection, diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Small for size bladder is another cause and so also neurogenic bladder. Another possibility is a polyp or a growth inside the urethra. At times a hair too grows inwards and keeps tickling the urethra causing a need to urinate. A frenulum tag too can cause this type of sensation.You must talk to your physician regarding all these possibilities. Diabetes, UTI, STD are ruled out in your case. You would need some more tests and clinical examination to rule out diabetes insipidus, small bladder, neurogenic bladder, ingrowing hair, urethral tumor and frenulum tag. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "Just started having an issue with frequent urination, I've had tests done for a UTI and they came back negative, blood sugars are good, and blood work showed that kidneys are good. Don't have any signs or symptoms for an STD, what else could be the issue? No burning or discharge from the penis.",
