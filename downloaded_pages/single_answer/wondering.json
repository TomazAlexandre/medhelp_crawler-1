    "question": "I had a uptake scan in 2002 and the uptake was 15%.\u00a0\u00a0In the normal range but borderline.\u00a0\u00a0I have continued to get very sick and have severe osteperosis and much more including adenoma of pituitary but small.\u00a0\u00a0I just finished an ultrasound of the thyroid and was told I need to have a fine needle biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0The scan showed the nodoule in question to be solid and complex.\u00a0\u00a0My question is what does complex mean.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned. It also says something of nodules inside of nodule.\u00a0\u00a0What does that mean.\u00a0\u00a0 I want to have further testing done on pituitary first because of frequent urination and thirst.\u00a0\u00a0My aunt has diabetes insipidus.\u00a0\u00a0I am very concerned of this connection and do not want to jump into treating the thyroid if needed before ruling out hypopituitary.\u00a0\u00a0I am very sick and do not want to make things any worse.\u00a0\u00a0He did not do testing for this even though this is one of my major complaints.\u00a0\u00a0Frequent urination and thirst.\u00a0\u00a0It shows no hormone testing for ADH or ACTH.\u00a0\u00a0 My nurse practishioner thought in the past my complaints of thirst and urination was because I had a borderline sugar problem going on.\u00a0\u00a0I do not believe it is this.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar was never involved 6 years ago on testing and these were my symptoms then.\u00a0\u00a0Should I push for more pituitary test before tackling the thyroid issues. Please advise.",
