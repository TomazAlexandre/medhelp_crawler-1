            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.The differential is broad. One differential is neuropathy causing pain in the arms/legs, but you\u2019re symptoms are classic for it. Regardless, a neuropathy is a burning or tingling sensation caused by nerve damage, either from diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune disorders such as lupus or Sjogren\u2019s, neoplasm, or toxins. There are other conditions that lead to neuropathies such as genetic, metabolic, and hereditary disorders. If you have muscle weakness too, an EMG/NCS would be helpful in the diagnosis. Treatment options for neuropathic pain include neurontin and lyrica.If your symptoms are on one side of the body/limb, conditions such as stroke or multiple sclerosis would be considered in the differential. An MRI of the brain and cervical cord would be recommended.If you have had trauma to your neck/head, it would be helpful to have an MRI of the cervical cord and brain to evaluate for a condition called syringomyelia. Syringomyelia is a chronic progressive disorder of the spinal cord causing a capelike distribution of sensory changes on the shoulders but can include feet as it progresses.Other causes include seizures, migraines, and metabolic such as low calcium. These conditions would be high on the differential if the symptoms migrate.Sometimes symptoms of whole body tingling may reflect emotional/psychiatric problems related to stress (what is called somatization disorder). The latter is a true medical condition whereby instead of a patient experiencing depression or anxiety, they experience physical symptoms, and once the stress is addressed, the symptoms resolve. Fibromyalagia is another medical condition that leads to whole body pains, and is best treated with medications such as lyrica and neurontin, exercise, and physical therapy.These are just some causes of burning/tingling. Continued follow-up with your doctors is recommended. If you have had a recent illness and fever, you will need to let your doctor know this information. He/she may wish to rule meningitis. Evaluation by a neurologist, if you have not already done so, is recommended.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
