            "answer": "Hi!I think that your doctor may be looking for a polyp, when she is recommending the saline infusion scan.\u00a0\u00a0Typically in a case like this it all boils down to the fact that your hormones are out of balance.\u00a0\u00a0Too much estrogen not enough progesterone.\u00a0\u00a0This is common enough to be almost normal in perimenopausal women.\u00a0\u00a0Depending upon your risk factors for endometrial cancer ( obesity, diabetes, family history, etc)\u00a0\u00a0I might be tempted to treat you with progesterone for 14 days and then re-scan.If you are at high risk for endometrial cancer, or have a polyp on saline scan, I would probably recommend a D&C hysteroscopy.Hope this helps!Dr B",
