            "answer": "What you describe suggests acute and chronic anxiety, perhaps with was is called a panic disorder.\u00a0\u00a0However, the assumption should not be that your symptoms are on an emotional basis. Because these same symptoms could be caused by a number of metabolic diseases, including Diabetes, or by ingestion of a toxic substance.I suggest that you seek consultation by a doctor who will take your symptoms seriously, take a careful history and determine what testing should be done to rule-out serious physical disease.Good luck",

    "question": "For the past few days I've been needing to take deep breaths every 20 seconds or so. I also feel the need to yawn a lot. I do have allergies and a slight case of asthma. I've had a breathing test done that confirmed this but otherwise can't figure out what is causing this. I've had my o2 checked by a DR when I thought I was short of breath but it was 94. I also experience fast heart rate/palpitations, upper stomach discomfort, and lightheadedness. Any insight as to why this is happening? Thanks!",
