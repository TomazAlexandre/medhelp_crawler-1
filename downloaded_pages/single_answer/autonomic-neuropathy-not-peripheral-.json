    "question": "Hello,I have been diagnosed with autonomic neuropathy (ANP) after having type 1 diabetes for over 50 years now.It was determined by my continual low blood pressures. Now I am beginning to have very high blood pressures. Is this normal with ANP?Also, besides wearing support hose and taking fludrocortisone, are there any natural treatments available? I have heard of IV's of alpha lipoic acid being done. However this is in Germany. Is anyone familiar with this being done in the US or of any other treatments to help?Thank you very much,Lea",
