            "answer": "Hi! High blood pressure itself could be contributing to all symptoms except swollen feet. Loss of balance can be due to inner ear problem, Meniere\u2019s disease, diabetes\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with peripheral sensory neuropathy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, affect of certain medications, past head injuries, loss of foot\u2019s perceptions and sensibilities, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), joint weakness etc.Even if you have no pain in the ear or apparent infection, wax in the ear, internal ear infection or labrynthitis can cause balance problems. Postural hypotension or BP falling with change of posture is another cause. Cervical spondylosis (or pinched cervical nerves due to any cause), mini strokes, MS, high blood pressure, tumors or injury to cerebellum of the brain, syncopal attacks, severe anemia, and thyroid disorders are some of the causes for loss of balance.Swollen feet can be due to high BP, disorders of liver, kidney or heart so all these functions will have to be assessed. The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Take care!",
