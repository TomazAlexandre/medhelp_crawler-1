            "answer": "Hi kusum lata!In all probability this is due to pinched nerve. Nerves pinched at the elbow result in cubital tunnel syndrome. If you have struck the elbow and that has caused the pinched nerves, you should maintain a relaxed arm posture and take over-the-counter pain killer and anti-inflammatory such as aspirin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If a splint helps you to immobilize the arm motion and keep it relaxed then go for it. Physiotherapy is generally advised after the pain subsides.Another way a pinched nerve occurs is by repetitive motion as in computer use. For this you need to use furniture best suited to relax your elbow, change the placement of your work station, use anti inflammatories as before. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
