            "answer": "Hi,While reading your post, I was thinking of suggesting a liver function test done ( SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase levels,direct and indirect bilirubin levels) and it's a good thing you have mentioned having your bilirubin levels noted.An ultrasound of the liver and biliary tract may be a good initial test to evaluate the structures. With regards to your diabetes, are you compliant with your medications? How is your Hemoglobin A1c? Were your doctors able to evaluate your glomerular filtration rate (GFR)?Discuss these with your physicians. A liver and biliary tract disorder is a primary differential( thi has to be ruled out first).However, diabetes mellitus may lead to involvement of target organs such as the kidneys as part of its disease process.",

    "question": "Hi, I just had a IVS test done to check for kidney problems as a result of my high BP. Kidneys were ok, but my bladder\u00a0\u00a0was \"abnormal\" I dont really have a history of symptoms that would indicate a tumor, except for possibly blood in my urine. for about 4 months my urine became very dark. I couldnt explain why. It happened kind of suddenly. As I am very color blind, I thought the Urine was brownish, and not red. But later found out it was red when someone else saw my urine.I gave a speciman at the local clinic, but it came back negitive for blood(I do need to note that I was living in a small province in the Philippines at the time, and medical standards there are not as high as they are here). The doctor sugessted drinking 2 gallons of water per day. He said I needed to drink that amount because I was sweating so much fluid out due to the daily 90-100 degree temperatures and no airconditioning. I drank the water, and it cleared up some, but not all the way.But, since i have been back here in the USA, my urine appears normal. So, thats why i say i dont think I have any symptoms of bladder cancer. I do have type II diabetes, which i have had for the past 15years. I'm only 39 years old.So, here is my question. If I dont have a cancer, which I shouldnt, right? Then I have a cyst, or a benign tumor? Will it need to be removed? Am I going to have to pee in a bag?My regular doctor(Veterans Administration) is setting up an appointment with a Urologist, and has ordered a new test for me. This time on my liver, because my bilirubin(surely spelled incorrectly) is high.I was diagnosed with type II diabetes at 24 years old, and had my first cataract replacement surgery at 32, second at 34. I mention that because I have read that these sort of things usually happen to those over 50. And to show that I have been atypical in the past.Please forgive me for my poor spelling. Thank you for taking the time to help belay some of my worries.",
