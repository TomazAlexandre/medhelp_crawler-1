            "answer": "Hi,Based on those blood sugars, you do have diabetes. It certainly could be the cause of your symptoms, or whatever may may the cause of your diabetes(sometimes it is the result of another illness or medications in use).I urge you to see your doctor as soon as possible to have some tests done and be started on the approprate treatment because you can become very sick quite quickly if this goes on for too much longer.Until you can see a doctor, drink lots of water, stay away from sweets and try to decrease your carbohydrate intake by a moderate amount. But see your doctor soon, or go to the nearest urgent care center for treatment.Take care.",
