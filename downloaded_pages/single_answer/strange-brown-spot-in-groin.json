    "question": "I am a 42 year old female, married and in a monogamous relationship.\u00a0\u00a0Last week, I noticed a fairly round, brown dime-sized splotch of skin in my groin in the upper, inner thigh region.\u00a0\u00a0It does not itch and does not appear to be scaly.\u00a0\u00a0I also have had intermittent diarrhea for the past few months, although my gastroenterologist attributes this to irritable bowel syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0I am on Metformin for being in a \"pre-diabetes\" state and take birth control pills for PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, I have lost ten pounds in the last few months, although my doctor attributes this to the Metformin.Could you please advise as to what this brown splotch could be?\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if it is some type of fungal infection (or something worse?)\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
