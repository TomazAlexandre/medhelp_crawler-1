            "answer": "Diabetes is a metabolic disorder. A connection between inflammation and metabolic disorder has been found. Inflammation could be causing the anemia.Medications and some supplements could cause anemia as well.My husband 45, 5'6'' at 150 lbs.(pre-diabetic), my son 19, 5'8'' at 210 lbs.and myself 45, 5'4'' at 175 lbs. have insulin resistance (metabolic syndrome), inflammation along with low thyroid. It was discovered that we all have lyme disease.We were told by our endocrinologist that if diet wasn't changed we would likely develop diabetes. Our diet wasn't bad to begin with but we did change it for the better. Lyme disease was the cause of our health issues.Is he over weight and inactive or is he very active and eats healthy and diabetes just doesn't make any sense? Look up all of these conditions and see what you find.All\u00a0\u00a0these could be possibilities.",

    "question": "I am posting this on behalf of a male family member who is age-49. He has battled severe fatigue and depression for months and upon getting blood tests this month, was found to have diabetes. The concern I had for him, was his also being found to have low CBCs, indicating anemia. The concern is that I know anemia is not a typical finding in males his age and his development of diabetes seemed to be a fast onset. I am wondering about possibilities of blood loss due to a disease or other possibilities.Any comment on his tests results ordered by his doctor would be very appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank You!His five low blood count findings:WBC\u00a0\u00a0\u201c3.7\" (L)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 4.8 to 10.8HGB\u00a0\u00a0\u201c13.7\u201d (L)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 14.4 to 16.6HCT\u00a0\u00a0\u201c38.6\u201d (L)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 42.0 to 52.0MCV\u00a0\u00a0\u201c79.2\u201d (L)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 81.0 to 99.0RDW\u00a0\u00a0\u201c11.2\u201d (L)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 11.5 to 14.5His two Diabetes Findings:Glucose \u201c249\u201d (H)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 70 to 109Triglycerides \u201c247\u201d (H)\u00a0\u00a0Range: 0 to 149Also his HDL cholesterol was 6 points below normal and his VLDL Cholesterol was 9 points above normal which placed his risk ratio for heart disease at \u201c5.5\u201d (moderate) in a normal no-risk range of 0.0 to 4.7.",
