    "question": "Two years ago I had a heart attack (female aged 58 at the time) and subsequent 6 way bi-pass surgery which went very well without any complications.\u00a0\u00a0About a month ago, out of the blue my hear started 'fluttering' several times a day, mostly when I was at rest (or maybe I just noticed it then).\u00a0\u00a0After about a week of this every day occurrence was about ready to call the doctor when just as suddenly it stopped as suddenly as it started.\u00a0\u00a0Just out of the blue it would 'gallop' taking my breath away, then it would beat normally for a few hours.\u00a0\u00a0Is this something I should be very worried about?\u00a0\u00a0I know that sometimes it's hard to diagnose a woman having a heart attack, they delayed my treatment because even I thought I just had the flu.\u00a0\u00a0I was throwing up and the left side of my chest & back hurt.\u00a0\u00a0After the surgery my surgeon told me I had scarring from an old heart attack years ago....I remember about ten years ago, an episode where I couldn't stop throwing up for two days and I had abdominal pain.\u00a0\u00a0All of this really scared me because I had no clue and I didn't know I had diabetes 2 either.\u00a0\u00a0Now the flutter does worry me...should I be?",
