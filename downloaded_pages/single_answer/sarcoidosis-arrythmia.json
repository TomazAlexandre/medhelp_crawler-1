            "answer": "sarcoidosis often affects multiple organ are actually causing organ dysfunction because of redundancy within these organs.\u00a0\u00a0For example for his sarcoidosis will always affects the liver pathologically it was never causes liver dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0Sarcoidosis affects primarily the lungs in your case shortness of breath may be related to any lung involvement.\u00a0\u00a0But in your case it may also involve the heart since you are having these arrhythmias:that PACs are nothing to be concerned aboutsince these are simply early or atypical atrial depolarizations(these are beats coming from the top chambers are).the PVCs or VPCs is there also called represent early ventricular contractions.\u00a0\u00a0These are not significant as long as that don't occur in a sustained fashion: If they occur 4 or more in a row then this is called ventricular tachycardia.this ventricular tachycardia is the feared arrhythmia in patients with sarcoidosis, and it's often difficult to treat.\u00a0\u00a0Some patients require antiarrhythmic medications others receive ablation procedures and yet others who did not respond to these procedures require heart transplant. but it doesn't seem as if you have this arrhythmia as your Holter only reported some PVCs. hence you don't need an implantable cardiac defibrillator at this time, but she must be weary\u00a0\u00a0of the symptoms of ventricular tachycardia: dizziness, lightheadedness, passing out or sustained palpitations.",

    "question": "I have been dx with sarcoidosis for @7 years.\u00a0\u00a0There has always been a quiet belief that there was cardiac involvement though, with long standing diabetes no one ever was sure.\u00a0\u00a02 years ago I had an event monitor that only showed constant sinus tach and PVC's.\u00a0\u00a0Fast forward to this year with increasing Shortness of Breath and Palps.\u00a0\u00a0Event monitor was just repeated to evaluate for an ICD.\u00a0\u00a0Results this time showed mostly sinus tach but the PVC's are now pretty evenly split between PVC's and PAC's.\u00a0\u00a0Also shows ventricular escape beats corrolating to when I feel my heart decelerating a period of ventricular triplet and an atrial run.\u00a0\u00a0EP (a fairly prominent one) is not concerned.\u00a0\u00a0My question is that this was to evaluate for the possibility of sarcoid involvement\u00a0\u00a0and that the only time one tends to have glaring proof of gross sarcoid involvment tends to be upon autopsy.\u00a0\u00a0Are the newer, changed findings truly nothing to be concerned with or are they the needle in the haystack for which we should be looking?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
