It may not give true symptoms in some people until it's very advanced and very problematic.It might also be good to have her checked for diabetes.",

    "question": "My daughter is 23 and she is intellectually disabled.\u00a0\u00a0 For a few years now she complains of pains that go across her midriff area.\u00a0\u00a0Not specifically on one side or the other or in the centre, she describes it as right across, when she shows me she puts her hands right across her middle and around to the back a bit.I think she has a fairly high pain threshold (she gets her eyebrows waxed without wincing!)She probably gets the pains about twice a week and they can last for hours, sometimes a panadol doesn't ease them much.The thing is,\u00a0\u00a0she doesn't have ANY other symptoms to go with the pain.\u00a0\u00a0No nausea or anything.She takes the pill continually for period pain and because she can't handle her periods due to her disability.\u00a0\u00a0So she doesnt get a break from the pill (its been about 4 years non-stop without a break)\u00a0\u00a0She is not sexually active.She also takes zoloft for her OCD and anxiety disorder.She is also overweight (about 130 kgs)\u00a0\u00a0 She only leaves the house 3 times a week with her carers\u00a0\u00a0(I live 300kms away from her)I know if I took her to the doctor, all we could say was \"She gets pains across the tummy\"\u00a0\u00a0theres nothing else we can say, she is very non-specific about her symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that she is really healthy and hardly ever gets sick.Her grandfather has caeliac disease which came on in his 60's.\u00a0\u00a0 Also diabetes on her fathers side which came onto him and his brother in their 40's.She has never been one to go to the toilet until the very last minute.Any clues?Ruby.",
