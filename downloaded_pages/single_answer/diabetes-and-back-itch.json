            "answer": "Hi,Diabetic neuropathy usually starts at the end of long nerves(like in the feet) instead on the trunk, so this would be somewhat unusual. Your family doctor should look into other causes of the itching as well(do some general blood work, check thyroid and liver tests etc) before deciding this is an unusual case of diabetic neuropathy.If you think the mole looks different I strongly suggest you seek consultation with a dermatologist to have it evaluated soon.Hope this helps,Take care.",

    "question": "I have had serious back itch/prickling for over a month now.\u00a0\u00a0My dr. thinks it may be neuropathy from my type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It has now gone to my abdomen as well.\u00a0\u00a0I have a mole on my back that has changed and become sore.\u00a0\u00a0The itching started when this mole changed.\u00a0\u00a0However, my family dr. dismisses this as anything serious.\u00a0\u00a0 Could my diabetes cause neuropathy in my back before any neuropathy in my arms and legs?\u00a0\u00a0Also, should that mole be examined a bit more as a cause of the itch?\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, I have had pains under the left side of my ribs that also began when the itch started.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?",
