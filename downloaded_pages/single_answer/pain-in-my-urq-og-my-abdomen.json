            "answer": "Kidney pain is usually, sometimes the pain will be referred and show up in other locations around the area, in the backside not the front side of the abdomin. I don't think sitting or bending would cause more pain, but others can chime in if this is not the case with them. If you put your hand on the bottom of your ribs and the top of your hip bone in the back that is where the pain would most likely be. It is off to one side versus the low back.Risk factors are diabetes and high blood pressure. It is a simple blood test to rule it out so that should be easily enough obtained. If you have swelling in your joints or fluid buildup then it is more likely a problem.You may want to try something called craniosacral massage. It isn't really massage. It is its own thing. They use fine movements to direct organs in the right directions. I am explaining it really poorly. I was having a lot of stomach upset. Belching for no good reason. No test showed anything wrong. The person I saw did some work on that area and within two sessions I felt much better. It is about the same price as traditional massage maybe a bit more. Worth a shot. They will likely also be able to help with the low back pain.",

    "question": "I also have apin in my RUQ. Sometimes it feels like my liver gets caught under my ribs. I seem to have more pain if I'm sitting for too long or bended and then it spasms. I had a colonoscopy/endoscope with normal results, blood work, ultrasound, I ended up in the Er with mild pancreitis ( I don't drink much) MRI- nothing etc...It feels like my stomach also gets really bloated and full feeling. Also have some pain in my lower back. I think my Doctor thinks I'm crazy too. Guess I'll ask for a HIDA",
