            "answer": "HI,I think you should contact your son's pediatrician as soon as possible to have him checked out. It may not be diabetes, but certainly given that you are sure this is not his normal pattern of behaviour, I think it should be addressed soon. Give them a call and set up an appointment as soon as you can.Take care.",

    "question": "I have a four yr. old son. Who i think might be diabetic some of his symptoms are drinking alot. Not just water but anything that he can get his hands on. Very strong mouth odor. He also kind of has a short fuse. I don't know if maybe i am kind of over reacting. His grandmother is diabetic and said that she has noticed some of these and is wanting me to look into it a little more. What should I do?",
