            "answer": "Hello,Yeast of fungal infection love humidity and moisture and it can be due to moisture (due to sweating or frequent washing), the abrasion caused by clothing, the pressure of sitting, chemical irritants like laundry soaps, colognes and scented toilet paper. the other possibility is that it can be due to other skin conditions like eczema, incomplete treatment, treatment resistance , co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity.Firstly we need to confirm whether this is fungal infection or other skin causes like eczema and dermatitis. I suggest you to consult a dermatologist and get a KOH examination and maybe a skin biopsy done.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
