            "answer": "Atypical chest pain is a term that is used to describe chest pain that is not \"angina.\" Angina is usually chest discomfort that is substernal pressure that arises during exertion, relieved with rest, and often accompanied by nausea, shortness of breath, sweating, and can often radiate up to the jaw, neck, or arms -- which is often worrisome for underlying heart disease.Atypical chest pain can be serious if is caused by heart disease or it can represent another problem unrelated to the heart (muscle pain, stomach disorders, etc.). Usually this is evaluated with basic tests such as blood work, vital signs, a chest xray, and an EKG. If you have a lot of risk factors for heart disease (high blood pressure, history of smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, or a family history of heart attack), often times this is evaluated with a stress test.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had any of these things done?",
