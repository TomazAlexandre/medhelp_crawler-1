            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Spinal surgery would ideally not cause damage to the acoustic portion of the vestibulocochlear nerve unless the surgery was performed very close to the brain stem. You should explore other causes like diabetes mellitus, B12 deficiency, or any inflammatory process.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "This might be a repeat, not sure if the first one went through. My problem is hearing loss after extensive spinal surgery in January. I was under for 12 hours. The docs said they do not know why ot happened but it was not because of the surgery. ENT said my right ear is profound and nerve damage cannot be repaired. My left ear has fair hearing. Has anyone experienced this after surgery? Can anything be done? Thanks, Zingb",
