            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Hypertension, diabetes, mini strokes or transient ischemic attacks should be looked into. The symptoms do look like TIA. Hence all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc.The second possibility is seizures. Benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) is another possibility. This happens due to impaired CSF absorption. Episode of blackout could also be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position).\u00a0\u00a0You stood up from a sitting or lying down position. Get your blood pressure checked in different positions\u2014sitting, lying down, or standing. Ofcourse it could be something as simple as anemia or low sugar or disturbed sleep pattern or just stress.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage on net. Please consult a doctor or a neurologist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "3 days ago, on a Saturday morning, after waking up I had a huge head rush which caused me to black out for a second and collapsed. Since then I've been having a light headed feeling and I'm wondering if that may be the cause of it. I'm not entirely sure if that was the root of the problem though since I wasn't feeling top notched after getting home early morning on that early Saturday morning.",
