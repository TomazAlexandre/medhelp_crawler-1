            "answer": "Hi there,A detailed history and evaluation is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment of your condition. The common causes of foot drop are nerve injury, brain or spinal disorders and muscle disorders. Diabetes mellitus, stroke, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies are few common causes. Since your EMG is normal it is least likely to be a muscular cause. You may need other tests like blood sugar tests, MRI brain, spinal cord and nerve conduction velocity. Consult a neurologist and get examined. This is merely an advice and not a substitute for clinical examination. I sincerely hope it helps. Take care and warm regards.",
