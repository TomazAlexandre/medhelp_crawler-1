It can be benign fasciculation syndrome if all causes are ruled out.Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You may need blood sugar monitoring, MRI of brain and cervical spine, T3, T4, TSH, sleep studies, serum electrolytes, brain EEG, etc to reach a diagnosis.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.
