            "answer": "Hello,Frequent urination (polyuria) can be due to diabetes mellitus. Other possibilities are diabetes insipidus, glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism and diuretic drugs. Investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen , intravenous pyelography ,prostate specific antigen blood test, thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis. In your case, the kidney stones can be responsible for this.The difficulty in pulling back the foreskin can be due to fungal infection, infections like Chlamydia or due to adhesions. My sincere advice would be to consult a urologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
