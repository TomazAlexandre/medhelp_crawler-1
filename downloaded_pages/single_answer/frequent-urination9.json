            "answer": "Hi,Are there other signs or symptoms present? It is good that your blood tests showed negative for infection and diabetes. This could be due to an overactive bladder (OAB) which is a urological condition\u00a0\u00a0that presents with urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. Usually, the detrusor muscle,\u00a0\u00a0the muscle that surrounds the bladder, contracts spastically, sometimes without a known cause, which results in sustained, high bladder pressure and the urgent need to urinate. Treatment for OAB includes fluid restriction, avoidance of caffeine, bladder retraining, and medications. It would be best to discuss this with your doctor for further evaluation and management.This link may be helpful: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overactive_bladderTake care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "I frequently need to urinate throughout the day and at night (every day about 12 times in a 24 hour period). I have had urine samples taken and there is no infection. Also, all blood tests are normal and diabetes has been ruled out. It is not painful when i pass urine but i often get a pain in my lower stomach and can feel the pressure of needing to go, despite sometimes passing very little. Sometimes however, I pass quite a lot of urine, more than I would expect. Urinating always relieves this feeling of pressure though. I am female and this has been going on for about a year now. What could be wrong?",
