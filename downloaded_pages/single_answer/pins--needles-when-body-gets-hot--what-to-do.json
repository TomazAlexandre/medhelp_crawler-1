            "answer": "Hi!At your age the pins and tingling that come when body is hot can be due to menopause. You need to consult a gynecologist and get the following hormone levels tested: estrogen, progesterone, FSH, and LH. Sometimes hormone replacement therapy helps with these symptoms. Other possibilities are diabetes, thyroid disorders and lupus. Please discuss with your treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi everyone,I'm 51 years old and for the last 3 years I've been to 3 neurologist to fine out why when my body temp gets hot I get the most terrible pins & needles beginning from my head down through my entire body.\u00a0\u00a0It's so pain full I want to pull my hair out.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I scratch so hard I get blood on the surface.\u00a0\u00a0This pain wares me out because I have it all the time. I can't clean, wash cloths, take a shower and these are my everyday things.\u00a0\u00a0I live in Arizona so right now the weather is over 100.\u00a0\u00a0I don't go out much.\u00a0\u00a0Between the 3 doctors they have taken every test available and they rules out all types of conditions like stokes and MS.\u00a0\u00a0In 1999 I had a C5-C6 spine compression. I had temporary paralysis from the neck down which left me with CRPS/RSD in my left arm, Migraines, and chronic pain syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0But after all these years I've managed all of this well and my pain was at a minimal until 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0My orthopedic told me I have a herniated disk level C4-45 but doesn't think that this has anything to do with the pins & needles because I also complain of numbness in my right side of my face.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm stuck.\u00a0\u00a0If the disk isn't causing new problems and the neurologist can't find anything, where to I go? Who do I see?\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any information they can share.\u00a0\u00a0I'll go anywhere outside my state.I hope I didn't write to much.Thank you.Lucky me.",
