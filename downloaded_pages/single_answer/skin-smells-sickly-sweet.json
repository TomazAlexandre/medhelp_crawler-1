    "question": "Hello,A few days ago I woke up and noticed that there was a really sweet smell coming from my skin. It smells almost like apple juice. Obviously I tried showering, no difference, it's coming from inside, stronger in my sweat. I have also been much more fatigued then usual which is odd as I have always been the person whose only needed about 4 hours of sleep and never take naps.Other then this issue I am a healthy and active 22 year old. I eat a very healthy vegetarian diet and I make sure I get enough protein through \"fake meat\" products. I also take vitamins and work out on a daily basis.Any ideas as to what is wrong? I have only been able to find ties to diabetes and I have no family history of that on either side and it doesn't seem to fit with my healthy lifestyle, but you never know.thanks",
