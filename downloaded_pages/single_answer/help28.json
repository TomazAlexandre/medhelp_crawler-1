            "answer": "Hi there,If you are planning a baby stop all forms of contraception. It is believed that timing sex close to ovulation is the best strategy for getting pregnant. Regularly having sex every two to three days can also be helpful. Stress on either partner can affect the chances of conceiving.\u00a0\u00a0A nutritious, well-balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight will be helpful.Consult a doctor and he/she may advise you to take folic acid. Quit smoking and alcohol. If you have any medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, epilepsy etc it is best to visit your doctor and inform that you are planning a healthy baby. Do visit a doctor and clarify your concerns. Keep me posted.Best of luck for your wishes!",
