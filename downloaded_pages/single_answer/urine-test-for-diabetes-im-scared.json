This does not usually need drugs to be controlled and glucose levels can be brought under control with good exercise and diet control.A diet that includes fruits, vegetables, fiber-containing foods, and low-fat milk is advised.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided.
