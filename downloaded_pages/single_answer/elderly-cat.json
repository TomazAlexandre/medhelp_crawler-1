    "question": "I have a 13 year old male cat. Last May we adopted a younger male. I first notice my older fellow loose some weight. Thought it could be the stress of a new cat.\u00a0\u00a0At his heaviest he was 18 pounds but he is a very large guy to begin with. He also has a bad hip. Since May he is now down to 15 pounds. Although he eats the same, drinks a normal amount of water. Is actually more playful now that he is lighter and gets around better on his hip. His coat is still beautiful and shiny. My question is should I be concerned with his weight loss even though he is doing better all around?",
