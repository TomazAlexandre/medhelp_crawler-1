            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Increased nocturnal urination could be due to excess liquid intake just before going to sleep, diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus, BPH and due to infection in the urinary tract.Are you having any medical conditions for which you are taking medicines? Certain diuretics could also cause this.I would suggest that you get a DRE of the prostrate done by a urologist, to rule out infection and BPH. A blood sugar test would also be required to rule out other possibilities.Hope this information helps.Take care",
