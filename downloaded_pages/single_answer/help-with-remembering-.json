    "question": "Hi,I'm 41 years old and I'm dealing with memory issues. I think that they have been apparent since I was a little kid (I was discussing this with my mother and she said she noticed a few things) after having an accident when I was little where I smashed my forehead into some concrete steps... I also suffer from epilepsy and it is thought that I have got some brain damage due to the seizures,\u00a0\u00a0and on top of all that I also take several medications (including stains and anti-epileptics) which I recently discovered could be making it even.What I need help with is (of course)\u00a0\u00a0remembering things. A minor example is that my wife can ask me to make the bed,\u00a0\u00a0and pretty much as soon as she has said it I have forgotten she made this request....the major ones are forgetting my twice daily medications,\u00a0\u00a0which are for epilepsy,\u00a0\u00a0diabetes, heart condition and depression...I have tried setting alarms for things that are regular,\u00a0\u00a0but if I am in the middle of something then I'll forget. I've tried making lists,\u00a0\u00a0and I either forget to write them down or forget to consult it. If I get distracted then my memory pretty much forgets what needs to be done.I've seen consultants and they have said that my brain is fine (which the way I'm forgetting then it obviously isn't) although said there potentially brain damage,\u00a0\u00a0but doctors are saying there is nothing that they can do.I don't know what to do,\u00a0\u00a0it's grating on the family,\u00a0\u00a0it's getting to my wife of 2 years and it can potentially have devastating consequences (I' very left the gas cooker on,\u00a0\u00a0Kept the fryer plugged in, left the iron on the board while wandering off after answering the door or getting a phone call).Please,\u00a0\u00a0does anyone have any ideas that can help?Thanks in advance for anyone who might be able to suggest something that can help.",
