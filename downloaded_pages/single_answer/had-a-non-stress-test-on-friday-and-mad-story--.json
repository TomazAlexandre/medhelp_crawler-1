I actually fell asleep and I am looking forward to them every friday for a little R and R haha!!!\u00a0\u00a0BUT the young girl next to me was so dumb she made me mad...her baby had 4 heart decelerations where the heart rate went down and didn't go back up for over a minute... she was very big belly size so must have been far along.. and has type one diabetes that she is not controlling..\u00a0\u00a0well they wanted her to go to labor and delivery for further monitoring and she refused...the nurse said you really should go... she said no,, so the nurse said be absolutely sure that your baby is moving 10X every 2 hours all the time.. I would hate you to have gotten this far and have something happen to your baby.\u00a0\u00a0And the girl just left!!!\u00a0\u00a0I am soooo mad...
