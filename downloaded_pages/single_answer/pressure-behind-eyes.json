            "answer": "Such sensations usually are not originating from the eyes if your ophthalmologist has determined so.\u00a0\u00a0Sinus problems frequently lead to similar symptoms and if he has not had imaging done to rule this out, it should be considered.\u00a0\u00a0Lack of balance and dizziness in an 89 year old could have many causes that may or may not be related to the pressure feeling behind the eyes.\u00a0\u00a0He needs to see a good neurologist for this and likely needs an MRI of his brain and face to look for abnormalities etc.\u00a0\u00a0If this all has already been done, I don't know what else you could do than to get a second opinion from another neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0Have them concentrate on the dizziness and lack of balance as the pressure behind the eyes may be a distractor in his case.HV",

    "question": "My 89 year old father has had pressure behind his eyes for the last 20 years. He has diabetes and glaucoma and congestive heart failure problems. We've been to eye doctors, endocrinologists, allergists, neurologists, tried acupuncture, and chiropractors.\u00a0\u00a0His vision is good and we were told the glaucoma is not the cause of pressure BEHIND his eyes. The pressure makes him dizzy and unbalanced and unable to lead the kind of life he wants. Any\u00a0\u00a0ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",
