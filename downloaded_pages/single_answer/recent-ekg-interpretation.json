            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.At least one-fourth of all myocardial infarctions are silent, without chest pain or other symptoms. They are discovered on EKGs. This is more common in diabetics, due to cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. Therapy will now be based on the number of vessels blocked, the percentage of blockage and the viable myocardium which is present. Also, other factors like diabetes need to be controlled.
