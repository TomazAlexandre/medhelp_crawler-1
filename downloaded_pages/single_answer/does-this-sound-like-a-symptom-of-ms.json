            "answer": "Hi!Endocrine gland related conditions like hyperthyroidism, acromegaly and glucose control disorders (diabetes and hypoglycemia both) all result in increased sweating. Pheochromocytoma, cancers, carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections too can cause increased sweating. It can also be due to low blood pressure. Get your thyroid and adrenal gland function tested.Avoid too much of tea, coffee, smoking and spicy food. . Sleep at regular hours. Practice deep breathing exercises and avoid neck strain.\u00a0\u00a0Drink plenty of water. Take a multi-vitamin for a week. If the symptoms persist please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

    "question": "Hello! This is my first question I have ever asked in an online forum setting, and I'm SO glad I found this site! Okay, her.e goes. I have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis for almost 5 years. About 3 years ago, I had some numbness, tingling, some problems with balance, visual problems that seemed to happen overnight, and a few other symptoms. I went to a well known MS specialist here in Central Kentucky. He did a very thorough neuro exam in his office, then he ordered an MRI. The results came back that it showed 4 lesions on my brain. The neurologist wasn't alarmed, told me to come back in 6 months. I never kept the appointment (shame on me!). ALL of the symptoms disappeared. About a year ago, I had another completely different set of symptoms appeared. I again went to the same neurologist, who did no further testing, and said that his professional opinion was that I did not have MS. But there is a new symptom that has appeared and it is very distressing. I SWEAT so terribly bad when I get the least bit warm, and my head has a tremor to it. I am 56 years old, and through with menopause. But to any of you, does this sound as if it could be an MS symptom, or has anyone else experienced sweating so bad that my head will be wet and dripping sweat. And then there is the head tremor....",
