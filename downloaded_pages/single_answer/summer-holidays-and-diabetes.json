    "question": "I've just returned from holiday and had a couple of instances where my blood sugar went to high and I felt really ill.\u00a0\u00a0On one occassion we'd been for a long walk so at lunchtime we had a sandwich made from a large baguette plus a glass of sangria.\u00a0\u00a0I felt really sleepy so went for a lie down and slept for 2 hours - when I woke I still felt extremely drowsy and a blood sugar test found it to be 18.4.\u00a0\u00a0Once I had some insulin I felt fine - but normally this is something I usually only take after my evening meal.\u00a0\u00a0On another day we stopped mid way on our morning walk and had a full english breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0I only ordered a small but as they brought a large one I ate it - and regretted it afterwards as I felt sick and drowsy for sometime afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0As I do not carry my insulin with me in the sun we just walked it off, although I did have to keep stopping for a sit down and a drink of water.\u00a0\u00a0After this I was careful not to eat too much, drink sangria and I banned myself from having any ice creams at all.\u00a0\u00a0This kind of spoilt my holiday a bit as I feel that for one week I should be able to have a drink in the afternoon or an ice cream without feeling ill.Any suggestions on how i can make this easier to bear?",
