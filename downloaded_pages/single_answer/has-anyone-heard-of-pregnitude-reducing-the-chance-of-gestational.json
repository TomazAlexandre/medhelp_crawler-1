    "question": "I' m 4 weeks, 3 days along. I went to my dr yesterday and because i've had gestational diabetes in my two previous pregnancies he gave me Pregnitude. He says it can lower my chances of having gestational diabetes.I went online to try to research it, but it seems to be fairly new so there isn't much research on it. I don't want to take anything without knowing long term effects and so forth. I'd rather deal with the gd which I can control with what I eat.Any input is greatly appreciated.",
