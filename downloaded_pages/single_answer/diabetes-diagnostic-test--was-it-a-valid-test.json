    "question": "Hello, I just went to the doctor to get tested for a variety of things, as I have been experiencing a wide array of symptoms.Among the tests the doctor ordered were tests for type 1, and a full blood work up. After the doctor had left, the nurses came in. They proceeded to place a IV in the vein just above my elbow so they could gather the blood for the full blood work up.After this they took out a home testing meter, removed some of the blood that had come from the IV, placed it on the stick, and used that to test if I had diabetes. Now, I'm not a nurse, but I was under the impression that those were meant to be used on blood from your fingertips, and not from a external container that had been taken from a IV?",
