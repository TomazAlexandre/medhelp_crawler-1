            "answer": "Hello!Total knee replacement is indicated normally for osteoarthritis with loss of cushioning and cartilage in your knee joint.If your body bony structure is always similar then it is of no concern.If your orthopedician has indicated total knee replacement for rheumatoid arthritis due to loss of cartilage you can go ahead.
