            "answer": "Hi,How are you? After the first menstruation or menarche, irregular periods may be observed to some girls especially in the first 2 years. This can be due to\u00a0\u00a0rapid weight change, medications effects, excessive exercise, very low body weight, not eating enough calories, hormone imbalance or stress which influence the part of the brain that regulates periods. Vaginal trush or yeast infection is extremely common. Don't be scared. It can happen also in girls who have not yet started their periods and the risk increases with intake of antibiotics, presence of diabetes and weakened immune system. At this point, it is best that you see your gynecologist for proper evaluation. Medical management may also help provide relief. Take care and do keep us posted.",
