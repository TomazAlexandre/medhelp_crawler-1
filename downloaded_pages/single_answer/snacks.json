            "answer": "Snacks are always a difficult thing, you now have to consider how every little thing effects your blood sugar. What works for me are snacks that are low in carbs and packed with protein and fat (mostly protein). Nuts are a good choice, just look for lower sodium options. Jerky and other dried meats are good as well. Also consider fresh fruit but beware tropical fruits (Mango, pineapple, papaya, etc.) these are particularly heavy on sugar relative to size. A small to medium sized banana or apple are always a good snack and don't spike your blood sugar. The best advice I can give is to start thinking in terms of Carb units (15 grams of carb = 1 carb unit) and try to balance your carb intake with fiber. Soluble fiber helps slow digestion and as a result minimizes spikes in blood sugar. Also meet with a diabetes educator and nutritionalist they are a great resource and can get you started on the right path. Good luck with the new adjustments, and now that you have millions of friends to lean on for support.",
