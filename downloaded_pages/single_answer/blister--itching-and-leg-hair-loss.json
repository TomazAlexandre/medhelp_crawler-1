Poor circulation is the main cause caused or aggravated by diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery disease, medications, poor diet, smoking, being overweight; lack of exercise etc.Alopecia areata can cause loss of hair in legs along with scalp. Infections such as folliculitis, a bacterial infection of hair follicles, and ringworm, a fungal infection, can also cause hair loss on the legs in the areas in which the infection is present. To diagnose this condition he needs to be evaluated and tested by a health care provider. If necessary he may be referred to an endocrinologist/dermatologist. I sincerely hope you find this information useful. Do keep us updated on how he is doing. Take care!",
