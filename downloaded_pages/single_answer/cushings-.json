            "answer": "When was the last time that bloodwork and urinalysis were performed on your dog? Has it already been tested for Cushing's disease? Cushing's disease is caused by oversecretion of steroids by the adrenal glands, or by overtreatment with oral or injectable steroids. Atopica is an immunosuppressive medication used as a non-steroid way to treat allergic skin disease, and if the skin is improved, it sounds like it is helping the skin. However, if your dog is losing weight, then you need to take her to your veterinarian right away, since rapid weight loss can be a symptom of diabetes, cancer and other very serious diseases, unrelated to the Atopica. Additionally, dogs with Cushing's disease are prone to become diabetic, and the symptoms of diabetes and Cushing's are similar (increased water intake and urination). She needs recheck labwork immediately.Good luck,Kimberly Coyner, DVM DACVD",
