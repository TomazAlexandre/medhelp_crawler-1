            "answer": "Hi!Yes, nerve damage or injury is possible following repeated surgeries and this can be detected by nerve conduction studies. You can consult a neurologist.Other than that it can be failure of the rotator cuff surgery. Conventional method of repair will not help if there is a lot of atrophy. There are many new techniques like tendon transfer (debridement to clean out the area), or reverse shoulder replacement. Sometimes patients have moderate to severe glenohumeral arthritis and irreparable rotator cuff tears. These patients need hemiarthroplasty to overcome the pain. Reverse shoulder prosthesis is tried in patients with severe cuff dysfunction or loss of coracoacromial arch, or for patients who require revision due to pain or dysfunction.Possibility of diabetes or an autoimmune disease worsening the situation should be looked into. You can discuss these treatment options with your orthopedic surgeon or a sports injury specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",
