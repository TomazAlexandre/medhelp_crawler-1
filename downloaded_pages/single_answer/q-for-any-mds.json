    "question": "Would any doctors monitoring care to comment on the diagnosis, Hep C Onset Diabetes? It seems to be something that all the doctors that have treated me for my diabetes either are unaware of or don't want to talk about. I was diagnosed w hep C in about 92 (probably been pos. for 20yrs+). I have never had any symptoms or tx. Then diabetes came up in about 95. My blood sugar seems to be the highest in the mornings. From my own research doesn't the liver dump sugar while you sleep? Is there any info available somewhere on this that I havn't been able to find? Thanks, C.P. in S.A.",
