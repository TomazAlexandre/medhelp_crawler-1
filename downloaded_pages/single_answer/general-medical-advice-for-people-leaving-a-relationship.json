    "question": "Hello Dr HHH or Dr. HookIt has been a long time since I last visited this site and I just have some general questions and concerns. In February 2009, I broke up with my boyfriend of a little over a year. During the course of the relationship both of us were tested for STDs and HIV. He was tested in December 2007 for general STDs and HIV, all negative, the Doctors office called him directly to tell him the news. He is positive\u00a0\u00a0for oral herpes (cold sores), I was tested in November 2007(World AIDS day) and again in March 2008 for general STDs and HIV all negativeWe were not consistent with condom use for I was on the pill and he always made the effort to not ejaculate inside of me. I limited oral sex on me because of his cold sores and for the most part no problems. Toward the end of our relationship, I was plagued with vaginal irritation and dryness. I never recognized any bumps or cuts. But diabetes does run in the family.Now that the relationship is over, I will be up for the annual exam this summer. I was wondering what testing I should ask for and if I am at any significant risks.Thank you for your website and I look forward to hearing from you.",
