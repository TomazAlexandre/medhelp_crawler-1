            "answer": "Although possible, I am not aware of elevated liver enzymes or hepatitis being associated with Byetta.I would consider an ultrasound to further evaluate for any anatomical abnormalities that can lead to an elevation of the liver enzymes.Repeating the enzymes after a period of alcohol abstinence can also be considered.\u00a0\u00a0If they continue to rise, a liver biopsy can be considered for a more definitive diagnosis.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.kevinmd_b",
