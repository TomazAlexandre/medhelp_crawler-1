            "answer": "Hi,Usually neuropathy associated with diabetes is from long-standing diabetes and/or poor glucose control. If you indeed do not have high glucose levels(now or in the past) it would be unusual for your neuropathy to be caused by your mild diabetes. Give the Lyrica some time to see if it helps. If you have not seen a neurologist, I think perhaps they may be able to give you a more complete differential of what may be the cause,take care.",

    "question": "I have been experiencing tingling and burning in my hands and feet, mostly at night.\u00a0\u00a0I had an EMG conducted about 2 months ago and it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0Since then my symptoms have worsened.\u00a0\u00a0Last week I failed an oral glucose tolerance test.\u00a0\u00a0I also had an A1C test performed and it was 6.2.\u00a0\u00a0Since being diagnosed I have closely monitored my glucose.\u00a0\u00a0It is usually below 140 in two hours, out of 110 readings in the past week I have been over 140, 10 times. I have also been taking Lyrica, last 2 days, and it does not seem to help.My question is it possible for the neuropathy to be associated with my diabetes?",
