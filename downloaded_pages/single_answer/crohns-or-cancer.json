            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry you are having symptoms and cannot access a healthcare provider more quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned about your health.\u00a0\u00a0Firstly, longterm prednisone (steroid) use can take it's toll on your bones (osteoporosis), blood vessels (atherosclerosis which can lead to heart disease and stroke), and cause diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Strong consideration for an alternative therapy needs to be given for your connective tissue disease.\u00a0\u00a0To counter the effects of prednisone on your bones, you should consider supplementation with vitamin D and calcium.\u00a0\u00a0In terms of your Crohn's disease, the sulfasalazine is a good medication and safe to take long term.\u00a0\u00a0You should be taking folate (1 mg per day) along with the sulfasalazine as it may cause a deficiency in folate.\u00a0\u00a0The prednisone is likely helping to treat your Crohn's disease, but as mentioned above is not advisable for long term treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned about your rectal bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0This could be due to many factors including a flare of your Crohn's disease.\u00a0\u00a0Other potential causes of rectal bleeding would include hemorrhoids, polyps, diverticulosis, or even cancer.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot tell you if you have cancer; a colonoscopy would be able to help with a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I would strongly advise you to seek out medical attention sooner.\u00a0\u00a0Consider going to a free clinic or emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0Are you in the U.S.?\u00a0\u00a0If so, where?\u00a0\u00a0I might be able to direct you to the proper facility.All the bestFrank Farrell, MD",

    "question": "Hi. I am a 56 year old female who was diagnosed with Crohn's 4 years ago but have been doing well on Sulphasalazine & being careful with diet etc. I have also been taking 5mg Prednisone daily for about 12 years for a nonspecific connective tissue disease.About 10 days ago I started having quite heavy rectal bleeding with bowel movements, bright red & including rather disgusting, meaty looking clots.On Sunday I started taking 2 x 75mg Ferrous Sulphate + 500g Ascorbic Acid twice daily as I was by then feeling very weak & tired.Unfortunately I do not have funds to access private medical care & my next appointment at the Government hospital is July. I live alone, so bed rest is not possible. As I have no family in the country it would help to know your best guesstimate as if it is likely I have cancer I would need to make arrangements for my pets etc. I know you're going to tell me to see a doctor, but I'm not in much pain, more just uncomfortable.Please advise if you can. I'm annoyed at being ill as I quit smoking 10 months ago & gave up all alcohol, fizzy drinks etc. 4 years ago.Many thanks.",
