            "answer": "Dear Meg,From your description, its sounds like you might have some residual swelling (edema in medical terminology) related to your injury in September. Depending on how severe your injury was in September, how old (or young) you are, how healthy you are (other medical problems like diabetes can slow healing), if you iced/elevated/rested the ankle after your injury, and whether you are a smoker, complete recovery from an ankle sprain can take months.With regard to \"pushing\" for imaging (such as a MRI), that would depend on what your range of motion is at the ankle, whether your ankle joint is \"stable\" or not, and upon your clinical examination by the orthopedic surgeon.Are you currently having problems with your ankle besides the swelling (pain, stiffness, giving out)?I hope this was helpful to you.~*~ Dr. Parks ~*~This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice.

    "question": "Hello!In early September, I ran a walking stacker into my left foot. Fortunately, I had it in slow speed and had my foot up against a block, or my injury would have been worse. As it was, I ended up with a moderate sprain on the interior ankle of that foot. When I went for my check up in late September, I was fine, albeit a little stiff. However, as time has went on, a lump has formed just under the joint. I'm going to the orthopedic surgeon in a few weeks. Is there anything I should push for? Such as an MRI or something of that nature? I'm just worried that somehow I've screwed up my ankle royally.",
