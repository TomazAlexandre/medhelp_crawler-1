            "answer": "\"Recently (for about a month now) I have been experiencing nausea.\"Has anything changed during this time - foods you eat, medication/s [new, increased, modified], fasting and postprandial glucose [blood sugar] levels elevated than what you posted? Are you getting proper amounts of sleep?\"I have even thrown-up a few times\"With all your health issues it would be wise to seek medical advice. Throwing up is not a good sign.
