            "answer": "That's a bit of a jump in one week, but most likely represents early hypothyroidism due to hashimoto's.\u00a0\u00a0Another possibility is transient autoimmune (TPO positive) thyroiditis which may recover with time (but this is less likely).Usually we would repeat the TSH in 4-6 weeks, if still high, then consider levothyroxine treatment.\u00a0\u00a0The low testosterone may be in part due to hypothyroid, so would consider treating thyroid first, then when you do the next test (after correcting thyroid) make sure it is an early (8-9am) morning draw as this is the best time to assess testosterone.Lowish testosterones like this may also be associated w/ pre-diabetes and insulin resistance (aka metabolic syndrome) - ask your doctor about this possibility.",
