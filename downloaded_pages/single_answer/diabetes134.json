            "answer": "Hi!If you have diabetes then diabetic neuropathy is a major cause. Plantar fasciitis, arthritis of small joints, hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, over weight, deep vein thrombosis, wrong foot wear, gout, etc are a few causes of sore feet. Diagnosis is by blood tests, nerve conduction studies, dopplar ultrasound etc. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Meanwhile check and see if your foot wear is comfortable or not, dip feet in warm water every day, and run very short distances and slowly increase the distance you run. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
