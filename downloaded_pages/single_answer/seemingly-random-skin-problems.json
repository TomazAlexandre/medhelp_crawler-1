            "answer": "I think that you are mixing apples, oranges, and Cheerios.\u00a0\u00a0Some of what you are describing may be mild eczema--people often get irritated-looking patches in places like armpits and the groin from mild eczema, a hereditary condition.\u00a0\u00a0These spots need to be treated not just with moisturizer--the skin is inflamed, not dry--but with a prescription-strength hydrocortisone.\u00a0\u00a0Bruises that come from trauma you can't remember happen all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Your basic problem is anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0None of it sounds like something systemic or sexual.\u00a0\u00a0So what I suggest is that you get a physical exam, to tell you for sure that you don't have diabetes, etc., and that you see a skin doctor, so you'll know what you have, skin-wise, and get what you need to treat it.Best.Dr. Rockoff",

    "question": "I seem to be having some skin problems at the age of 32 years and I am male.\u00a0\u00a0I seem to be getting jock itch and diaper rash a number of times over the past few years and I do not play sports at this point in my life.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a mild skin irritation under my armpits and was diagnosed as intertraigo (sp?).\u00a0\u00a0I passed after about a month and a moderate strength hydrocortisone cream.\u00a0\u00a0I am thin as well.\u00a0\u00a0I also get a red patch on the top of my left foot right after the shower but it fades in about 15 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0I treat the jock itch but it takes awhile to clear, more that 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I have also seen a few (2) bruises and do not remember if I did something to bring them on.\u00a0\u00a0I am worried I might have something like diabetes and not know it, or something more serious like HIV and not know it?\u00a0\u00a0I have never engaged in anal sex or drug use but 8 years ago I did have one unprotected encounter with a woman.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible it is all just a coincidence but it seems like too much stuff at once.\u00a0\u00a0 Maybe allergic to my dog?\u00a0\u00a0I use hypoallergenic detergent as well.Thanks for your thoughts!",
