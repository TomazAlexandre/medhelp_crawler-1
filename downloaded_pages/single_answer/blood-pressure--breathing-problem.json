Actually my problem is that whenever I eat something sweet like chocolates, pastries etc I find difficulty in breathing. Like more pull to inhale. I sweat a lot in hands. And going from sitting or lying position to standing position often cause dizziness. I want to ask if breathing problem is related to low blood pressure or it is due to some other reason like diabetes. My mom's mother had diabetes. So kindly tell me what the reason of breathing problem is.",
