            "answer": "I am some informed on pulmonary fibrosis, but by no means an expert. My mother had pulmonary fibrosis. Her disease was called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic meaning cause unknown. Pulmonary doctor told Momma, that she had IPF since 2001. She though was not diagnosed until August 2004. The doctors from 2001 to 2004, just keep missing diagnosis. Momma was given heart tests, etc. They thought she had asthma. By the time the pulmonary doctor found the IPF, Momma was considered in the end stage of the disease. She lived three more years after diagnosis in 2004. Momma passed away August 2007, from complications due to a lung transplant. I do not know how they stage this disease. I so hate to say this, but pulmonary fibrosis is a terminal lung disease. Life expectancy is usually 5 to 6 yrs. Momma developed diabetes during this lung disease, due to certain medications that she was taking, for the pulmonary fibrosis. If your grandfather is up and about some and his breathing seems no worse, then that is good. Of course, as you well know, his sugar is high. I am wishing you and your grandfather all the best. Maybe someday they will find the cause and cure for this terrible lung disease. God bless you all.",
