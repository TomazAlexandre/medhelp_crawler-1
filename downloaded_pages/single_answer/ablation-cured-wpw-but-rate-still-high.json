    "question": "I had WPW and had an ablation 6 weeks ago. The EKG shows the WPW is gone but am still experiencing a resting rate of 100-130.When asked, the Dr. said \u201csome people just have a high rate\u201d. This doesn't satisfy me and will go in for a Holter next week.I am prediabetic with Diabetes prevalent in my family. I am trying to keep it under control with diet and exercise. I have noticed a connection between the two issues - If I have a higher than usual carb load my heart rate goes up and (unrelated to diabetes) if I have a glass of wine it goes up and will keep me up at night even with 50mg of motropolol.Question is - could my blood sugar be affecting my heart rate and was my WPW just another problem layered on top? If so what can I do?",
