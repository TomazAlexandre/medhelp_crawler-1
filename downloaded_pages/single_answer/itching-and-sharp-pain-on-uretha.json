            "answer": "Hi,There are several causes that can predispose to bacterial vaginosis. Some of these include anemia, stress, alteration in pH due to pregnancy, etc.It is possible that the pain and itching are due to the infection. However, ensure that you pay particular attention to hygiene. You can also discuss the possibility of the use of metronidazole gel with your ob/gyn.Identification of the cause of the recurrent infection would help with eradicating the disease.Some measures of eradication have also included partner treatment. You may be sexually inactive right now, but the infection may have occurred earlier and may have become obvious in the presence of other factors.Do rule out systemic disorders, such as diabetes, as these alter the pH level of the vagina.Keeping fluid intake high (over 2000 ml) and adding citrus fruits and juices to your diet can also help increase mucosal resistance to such infections.Do keep us posted on your doubts and progress.Regards",
