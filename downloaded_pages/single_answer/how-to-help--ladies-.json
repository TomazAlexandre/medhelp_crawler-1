    "question": "38 weeks yesterday I had a membrane sweep at the drs appt. since then I had a lot of mucus and spotting and contractions but nothing strong enough to start labor. I took my epo last night and lost more discharge. I even had a gush of fluid but I was laughing so I attribute that to weak bladder....any ways I can help my contractions be stronger or water to break ?? in 5 days we will face a medical induction if I can't go natural due to diabetes and raising blood pressure. anything that's safe I will try !",
