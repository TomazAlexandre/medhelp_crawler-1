    "question": "Hi,I am 35 weeks pregnant, from 1 week quite sometimes I feel dizzy. I have gestational diabetes which is being controlled by diet and some exercise, there is no point about high sugar level I check it regularly (4-6 times/day) and it comes usually normal. I am eating very carefully, usually it happens in evening or when I take showers. My blood pressure is also normal and I am regularly taking Materna as supplement. This is my second pregnancy; my first one was without these complications. I am taking proper rest, still this problem persisting which leaves me very disturbed.Thanks",
