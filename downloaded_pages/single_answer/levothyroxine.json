            "answer": "Can you provide us with your most current levels of thyroid hormones?\u00a0\u00a0You should be getting tested for the thyroid hormones, Free T3 and Free T4, along with TSH... Or are you only being tested for TSH, once/year?\u00a0\u00a0If that's the case, you aren't being tested adequately and that's your problem, since TSH is variable and can fluctuate by as much as 75% over the course, of a day.Your symptoms could be related to a number of things, including thyroid conditions, diabetes, B12 deficiency, plus others...Once we know your actual thyroid hormone levels, we can better assess your situation.",
