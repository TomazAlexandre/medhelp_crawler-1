    "question": "I have just come back from the opticians, (vision express) and just had the new scan done of the back of my eye, it has shown up a flame shaped haemmorhage, the optician could also see something when he tested me and my perscription for distance has changed only slightly. He has given me a letter to take to to the doctors to be refered to an eye doctor, but I just wondered as he didnt really explain it, what IS a flame shaped haemmorhage and is it anything I should be overly concerned about?",
