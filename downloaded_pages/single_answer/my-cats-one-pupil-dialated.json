    "question": "Two months ago my 12 year old male cat started to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0At first I thought it was because of the dog we rescue and brought home.\u00a0\u00a0That was not a case.\u00a0\u00a0Turned out he really liked the dog and they became friends.\u00a0\u00a0He started to avoid eating a dry food and turned more into the can food.\u00a0\u00a0I just thought he changed his eating habits.\u00a0\u00a0I have 4 cats and now 1 dog (all the rescue animals) so it was really hard for me to notice that something might be wrong. A week ago the right side of his face got swollen and he wouldn\u2019t let me check his mouth.\u00a0\u00a0 We took him to the emergency clinic and the vet said he has an infection in his mouth.\u00a0\u00a0He gave him an injection with antibiotic that lasts for 2 weeks in his body and some liquid pain killers to put in his mouth every 8-12 hrs.\u00a0\u00a0He also got some fluids as he was slightly dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0The next day he felt better and the swelling went down.\u00a0\u00a03 days later we took him to our regular vet for the check up and the vet said the infection is gone but he has a bad tooth that has to be pulled out.Yesterday I noticed that his condition worsened and he is not eating like always. His right eye is not wide open and today during the day I noticed his pupil is dilated and not reacting to the light.\u00a0\u00a0My question is can a tooth infection cause the eye damage in cats?\u00a0\u00a0Or there is more to it than just a bad tooth.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate and answer.We are going to the vet tomorrow for another checkup, but I would like to prepare some questions that should be asked.",
