            "answer": "Hi, the symptoms mentioned could be caused by cervical spondylosis. Some metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders are known to simulate these symptoms. Please discuss this with your primary care physician who will carry out blood tests and x rays to rule out these conditions. You seem to be very anxious and in pain, take OTC pain medications like Tylenol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. Try applying local analgesic creams. Place ice over the painful area every 1-2hrs for pain relief. Practice relaxation techniques like yoga and meditation. Regards.",

    "question": "Hey, I was in a crash about 8 years ago, I suffered very bad whip lash, but over the last 2-3 years I have been getting severe lower back and left shoulder pain, it's that sore the pain is all on the left side of my breast in my armpit, I have been to the doctors for EKGs but I was told I was suffering from anxiety.. Depression.. You name it, but I don't believe I am, the pain is there I feel it everyday, I checked myself into the hospital thought I was going to have a heart attack as the pain was so intense on my chest, I had blood tests x-rays etc, nothing showed up! I was told I was suffering again from stress.. anxiety.. Depression.. So he gave me Xanax I refused to take this, as I believe it's something else! iv started to become obsessed with my heart beat which is not good because it's a nightmare a night because I find it very difficult to sleep!! So I went back to another doctor, I told her my symptoms she examined my back and said I had knotts all over my shoulder she clicked afew and I told her about the chest pain and she said the pain from my shoulder is pushing on a nerve causing the chest pain, so now I have been referred to Physio and will let ye know how I get on!! But I couldn't find anyone with the same symptoms as me, then I started researching my symptoms, which was a bad idea, because all sorts was coming up!! But if anyone has similar pain, please go and see your GP don't be shy tell them everything, the pain isn't worth it, I'm usually a happy person I want to get back to that, I'm not letting this frigging pain stop me or the beating of the heart, it's your life you should live it the way you want too!! BE HAPPY PEOPLE xx",
