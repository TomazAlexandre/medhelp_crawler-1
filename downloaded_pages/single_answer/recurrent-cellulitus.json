            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I read both your posts. Anxiety cannot be the cause, though it can exacerbate the problem. I can see that you have had a number of blood tests but was diabetes ruled out? Recurrent staph infections are peculiar to diabetes. If the normal fasting and PP sugar test is normal then a glucose tolerance test must be done. The second thing is to get a culture sensitivity test done. This will tell which antibiotic will take care of the bacteria and to which antibiotic the bacteria is resistant. Do this test after stopping all antibiotics for 4-5 days, or a minimum of 3 days.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have had an issue with recurrent cellulitus in my face for the last 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0I get cellulitus on the right side of my face in the same spot.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen an infectious disease specialist, an ENT, plastic surgeon to remove part of the area, and an optomistrist/opthomoligist to check if my tear ducts had a blockage.\u00a0\u00a0NOTHING has changed. I get the cellulitus almost monthly.\u00a0\u00a0I have been taking amoxicillian which seems to treat the issue.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also allergic to bactrim and now Keflex.\u00a0\u00a0All of the 5 doctors I have seen can't seem to prevent this from happening and treatments only seem to work for a short time.\u00a0\u00a0I was on continious low dose of anti-biotics, penicillian, and augmentin but I still had an episode.\u00a0\u00a0I've had CAT scans done, lymph node biopsey and the tissue from both excisions from the plastic surgeon have concluded nothing.\u00a0\u00a0With the exception \"....it's a staph infection...\"\u00a0\u00a0Any clue what I should do next or where I should tell my treating physicians to send me or some type of test.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks! !",
