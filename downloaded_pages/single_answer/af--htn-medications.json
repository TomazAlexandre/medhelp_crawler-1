            "answer": "The atenolol and the lisinopril should be continued and they are safe at these doses unless she feels lots of lightheadedness.\u00a0\u00a0The omeprazole helps with ASA tolerance.As far as the CNS bleeding, she obviously should never be on coumadin.\u00a0\u00a0ASA has a lower risk of bleeding and is probably safe in her case.\u00a0\u00a0I would confirm this with her neurologist or neurosurgeon.I would probably keep her regimen the way it is for now.",

    "question": "My mom, 72 year old, female, with hypertension for 8 years (with medications, systolic 110-120). In May, while hospitalized due to methyldopa induced cholestasis, she was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. In 8/09, 14 days into Warfain, she felt & suffered an acute subarachnoid & subdural hemorrhage.In Dec, she has open cholecystectomy due to acute cholecystitis with pigmented gallstones.ECG results:4/09: Sinus Bradycardia & Atrial Premature Complex5/09: AF, T abnormalities8/09: (hospitalized for CNS haemorrhages) Sinus rhythm10/09: AF, T & ST abnormalitiesCurrent Medications:30 Amlodipine Besylate: 5 mgLisinopril: 40 mgAtenolol: 50 mgOmeprazole: 40 mgAspirin: 100 mgShe has no other risk, CHADS is \"1\".1. Given her near-death bleed out, how safe is it to continue any blood-thinning therapy?2. Are there any no problematic\u00a0\u00a0drug interactions with her medications?\u00a0\u00a0We are particularly concerned with some of the Atonolol\u2019s side effects (i.e., the potential to develop type 2 diabetes, and unsteadiness when walking leading to more falls.)\u00a0\u00a0Are there safer, just as effective alternatives to Atonolol for her?\u00a0\u00a0We are also concerned with the elevated dosages of Lisinopril & Omeprazole. With these dosages, our mother\u2019s systolic blood pressure has been in the lower end of below 120. Should the dosage be lowered, what should that be ?Thank you.",
