    "question": "Hi everyone ,It's my first time posting here ... Just wanted to get some insight or maybe some perspective of what possibly could be going on - a little background , I'm 35 type 1 diabetic on a insulin pump .For the past week and a half I've been extremely tired ( more than usual ) the front of my chest in between my breasts hurts , almost like I've been punched in the chest , it's sore , hurts when I breath , move , just generally a very painful uncomfortable feeling , I've been experiencing bouts of dizziness , like a vertigo feeling , yesterday while at the post office , it came on so suddenly I thought I was going to pass out , luckily I hung onto the counter took a few deep breaths , and was able to leave and come home & lay down ..I'm not one to rush to the doctor for every little thing .. But I'm a little concerned right now .. I have no fever , so the main things that are concerning me Is, uncomfortable pain in the chest , tired & dizziness ... Any help would be greatThank you :)",
