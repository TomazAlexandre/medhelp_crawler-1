            "answer": "Hello,Frequent urination can occur due to a number of conditions. One of the commonest is excessive consumption of fluids/liquids. It is also common during the winters when one tends to sweat less and thus our body tries to compensate by making more urine.However, it\u2019s also a sign of Diabetes mellitus and will thus suggest you to get blood sugar checked. It is usually associated with other symptoms also like excessive hunger & excessive thirst. Please get the urine analysis done as there\u2019s another condition called diabetes inspidus in which the urine is not properly concentrated and thus more dilute urine is passed.Please do consult a physician for the confirmation of diagnosis as it\u2019s not possible to make a diagnosis online. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "I noticed over the past week or so I've been going to the bathroom a lot more than usual. When I say a lot more, I mean like 6-8 times in a 8 hour period, also I'm waking up at night having to go at least once. Every time I urinate there's quite a bit of urine, and it's usually clear to a pale yellow color. I'm not sexually active, so I can't be pregnant. I was just treated for a UTI (Urinary tract infection) a few weeks ago, I have no idea if that has something to do it or what. I was wondering what could possibly be causing this? Any ideas?I'm trying to avoid going to a doctor as much as possible seeing as I don't have any health insurance at the moment.",
