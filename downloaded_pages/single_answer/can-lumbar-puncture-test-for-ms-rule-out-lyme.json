Testing of CSF after a lumbar puncture definitely rules out Lyme disease. Please get ELISA and Western blot tests done for confirmation. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",

    "question": "I am a 32 year-old woman who has been experiencing a myriad of symptoms over the past two years - including dizziness, muscle weakness, fatigue, difficulty concerntrating, general \"fugginess\", unusual reaction to alcohol, excessive burping.\u00a0\u00a0I had a MRI which showed a number of small lesions (+20) consistent with a demylenating condition, though no lesions in my spine.\u00a0\u00a0While my neurologist suspects MS, I do not have acute episodes, but general un-wellness that comes and goes during the course of the day and sometimes over the course of a couple of days.\u00a0\u00a0I first noticed my symptoms while I was on holiday and they have been pretty persistent ever since, though not really getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for iron deficiency, diabetes, thyroid disorder, as well as a number of things that could cause the neurological problems that can be tested through routine bloodwork (eg. HIV) - all were negative.I am reconciling myself to a MS diagnosis, but based on my research my symptoms seem to correlate with more lyme than MS.\u00a0\u00a0There is a definite possibility I was exposed to lyme, though I do not specifically remember a tick-bite.\u00a0\u00a0I am awaiting the results of a lumbar puncture to confirm the MS, but my question is this: is there anything that would be revealed in the lumbar puncture that would definitively rule out lyme such that there is no point testing for it?",
