            "answer": "Protein in the urine can signal kidney problems, or it can come from bladder infections. It is important to establish which. If you have diabetes, or high blood pressure or Lupus, the protein may be coming from your kidneys, and you should be evaluated by a kidney specialist. I am assuming that the fistula was corrected surgically, and that you no longer have this problem.You should get your urine cultured to be sure that these infections are real. You can't truly diagnose infections unless a urine culture is performed. If the culture is negative, and you are still having the bladder symptoms, and your gynecologist is satisfied there are no STD's, or pelvic masses, then consider evaluation by a pelvic floor physical therapist, who can identify pelvic muscle rtigger points which may cause your symptoms.If the fistula has not yet been fixed, please get it taken care of as soon as possible...",

    "question": "I am 27 years old and suffer from constant pelvic pain, bleeding and UTI's. Back in 2001 I got surgery done for a Uretheral diverticuli which was discovered the day of my cyst removal surgery..Prior to that the docs thought to have discovered and large cyst inthe anterior vaganal wall that turned out to be a fistula connecting to my bladder and Vagina.\u00a0\u00a0Lately I've been having alot of UTI's the docs keep finding bacteria, high blood and alot of protein in my urine they prescribe antibiotics and for about a week the infection clears up but that's it. I then get it again. The difference now is that they have become extremely painful.\u00a0\u00a0I also suffer from endometriosis and my urologist thinks that it might be affecting me. They think my constant vaginal pain,bleeding and inflammation had something to do with it. They ruled out the spread to my kidneys but they have found a cyst in my kidneys which in the beginning they thought were stones.\u00a0\u00a0My gynecologist constantly refers me back to the urologist because of the high protein and blood in urine.\u00a0\u00a0It has become normal for them to withdraw my urine with a catheter to make sure it's clean. After hormone shots and pills, they are going to perform and laparoscopy and the docs say they will see what they will do from there.\u00a0\u00a0I am getting frustrated with the situation it seems to be never ending.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any idea what may be causing these problems?\u00a0\u00a0Could it just be stress? What should the docs or I be doing?",
