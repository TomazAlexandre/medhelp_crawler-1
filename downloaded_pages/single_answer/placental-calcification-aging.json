    "question": "I was asked to do an ultrasound at 31 weeks to check for a dilated kidney.\u00a0\u00a0(thankfully the kidney is fine) I was asked to come back at 34 weeks where the doctor told me that my placenta was aging faster than the baby. At 31 weeks, my placenta had calcification deposits that resembled a placenta that was 35-36 weeks old. Fortunately the baby is still growing normally (he's 5.5lbs) and the blood flow is normal.My OB/GYN is currently on vacation and I have many concerns about this...once calcification starts, can it slow down or stop? What type of precautions should I take? Will I most likely be induced? If so, what week? Has this happened to anyone else?I know that this can occur in women who smoke, have diabetes and/or hypertension. I have none of these things and I'm actually very healthy. Why would this happen?",
