            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Metallic taste in mouth is a common side effect of many medications. It could be due to infection of gums or cavities in teeth. It could also be an abnormal perception of bitter taste called dysgeusia. GERD and heart burn too cause metallic taste in mouth. Post nasal drip as in sinusitis, salivary glands infection, pharyngitis or strep infection too are common causes. Certain dentures and artificial tooth or filling of dental cavities too give a metallic taste. Sjogren\u2019s syndrome and copper or lead toxicity are other possibilities. Since you are losing weight, long standing infection, poor diet, IBS, malabsorption syndromes, liver disorders, hyperthyroidism, diabetes\u00a0\u00a0etc should be looked into. Please consult an internal medicine specialist to begin with. Take care!",
