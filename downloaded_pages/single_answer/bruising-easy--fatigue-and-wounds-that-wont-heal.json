            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Are you on any medications like anticoagulants, blood thinners or birth control pills. The commonest cause of bruising and feeling tired is OCPs or birth control pills. Check with your doctor if you are on any of these. If you are on them then immediately consult your gynecologist regarding changing the prescription or go for another contraceptive method.The other possible reasons are low platelet count, clotting disorders, fragile spider veins, deep vein thrombus, deficiency of Vitamin B12, folic acid, or Vit K, a liver disease or certain cancers. It could also be due to pressure urticaria. Also since your wounds do not heal well there is a chance you have deep vein thrombosis and diabetes.You need a comprehensive investigation taking all these points in consideration. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0Do let me know if there is any thing else you want to know. Take care!",

    "question": "Lately I have been extremely tired, when I wake in the morning I feel like I didn't even go to bed.\u00a0\u00a0I have a lot of bruises on my legs and I don't even know how they got there because I haven't hit my legs on anything.\u00a0\u00a0I also have these wounds on my legs that are deep and won't heal.\u00a0\u00a0I will cover them with band-aids and put Neosporen on them overnight and they still won't heal. They seem to be very ***** when I take the band-aid off and red on the outside of the wound.\u00a0\u00a0They also hurt when I touch them.\u00a0\u00a0The wounds came about when I was itching my leg.\u00a0\u00a0On top of all of that I have been waking up with a headache.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions?Thanks!",
