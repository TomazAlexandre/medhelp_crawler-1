    "question": "I am a 44yr female.\u00a0\u00a0Was diagnosed 2 yrs ago with type I.\u00a0\u00a0I also suffer from hypertension and hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Several years ago a small, insignificant pituitary tumor was found.\u00a0\u00a0I am not overweight, relatively fit and have no family history of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if the pituitary is the cause of these issues.\u00a0\u00a0When I inquire, I am told that I am just unfortunate and my doctors cannot give me a reason why I have these issues.\u00a0\u00a0Most importantly, I am interested in finding an underlying reason to the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't seem reasonable that I developed it out of the clear blue sky for no apparent reason.\u00a0\u00a0Can you help?",
