            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be either a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched in your hand.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.Take Care & Regards!!!",

    "question": "30yr female5'6\" 130lbshistory: asthma, juvenile arthritis,(grad mal seizure--as a child).for the past three months i have been experiencing my right hand going cold (like a corps) with stiffness and pain, i shrugged it off, but things got worse. waking up EVERY night with a \"dead arm\" my left one. during the day no problems with the left, just the right hand starts getting cold, and then right leg and foot with numbness and electrical pulses. i have a standing doc apt on the 23rd, and was just diagnosed with a heart murmur (abnormal), but after a long night of breathing problems, i freaked out this morning because, when i woke up my left hand was tingling, i readjusted and sat up right waiting for the pain to go away, instead\u00a0\u00a0it just intensified with complete paralysis in my left hand stuck in a fixed position. it took forever to subside (the whole time it felt like i was holding a ball of electricity in my hand), then my left hand went cold for the first time....wtf this is too much, what is going on?....the 23rd seems so far away.",
