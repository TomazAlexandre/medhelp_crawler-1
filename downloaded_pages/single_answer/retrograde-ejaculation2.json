            "answer": "Hello,In retrograde ejaculation, the semen goes into the bladder instead of out through the penis. Common cause of such symptoms are ejaculatory duct obstruction, diabetes, medications for treating high blood pressure, prostate enlargement and mood disorders, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or seminal vesicle obstruction. I suggest you to consult a urologist and get investigations done.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "i recently had back surgery on my l4-s1. i had terrible nerve problems before and not so severe afterwards. i noticed penile problems before and hoped after they would go away but now have no sensation in my penis during intercourse, masturbation also has the same effect. i had a 2 disc spinal fusion thru the abdomen that was successful but i believe i suffer from retrograde ejaculation. although my research says a man will still have sensation during intercourse where i have none. please advise me as to the situation.",
