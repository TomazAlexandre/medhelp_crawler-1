            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!No, this does not sound like fever. Yes, you can have fever without chills and sweating, especially if this is a low grade fever. No, fevers are usually not so short lived. Generally fevers comes with other symptoms such as those related to gut, lungs, urine, stool etc. Viral fevers can come without other symptoms too but they cause body ache and stay for 3-5 days. Yes, anxiety can cause your symptoms.The symptoms could be due to dehydration, so drink plenty of water during the day and see. It could also be due to anemia, diabetes and thyroid problems. So check these out by blood tests.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "A couple weeks ago there were three nights where I felt very hot, radiating from my head.\u00a0\u00a0It lasted maybe an hour or two each.\u00a0\u00a0During the days I felt fine.\u00a0\u00a0This happened two other random nights over the next week and a half.\u00a0\u00a0I felt no other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I never really \"felt sick\", just HOT. Since it was during the weekend I even went out and drank later on some of those nights.Can you have a fever without chills and sweating?Can fevers be so short lived and spread out?Do they usually knock you off your feet and come with other symptoms that make you feel sick?Can anxiety cause these symptoms?Does this sound like I had a fever or no.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
