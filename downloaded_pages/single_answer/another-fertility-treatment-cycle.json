    "question": "Hi Everyone.\u00a0\u00a0It is now 2 cycles since my last m/c and am trying again this month with Femara.Today did CD3 testing for LH/FSH/Estradiol.\u00a0\u00a0Will get those results on Friday. Hope they're all good.So far all the tests have come back negative with no explanation for the recent 3 consecutive losses.Obe and Immunologist discussed. Immunologist thinks there are immune issues (just they haven't identified them yet).\u00a0\u00a0They've got me taking low dose aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0A few more tests to be done (IF they're not too expensive).\u00a0\u00a0Trigger is target date 9th May, and IUI target 10th May.Am working on regular exercise (bought a treadmill which I have been using daily).\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Regular exercise increases blood flow to the reproductive organs and will also help in management of my diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Will cut out coffee next week (am enjoying my last week of coffee this week), and my last glass of wine for this cycle tonight.If this attempt succeeds (and sticks) the new baby would have the same or nearly the same birthday as my daughter.Fingers, toes, and wires crossed! :)",
