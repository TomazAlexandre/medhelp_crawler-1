            "answer": "You don't mention if you are on insulin.\u00a0\u00a0But the best diet for type 2 diabetes is the low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0Check with your doctor if you'd like to give it a try.\u00a0\u00a0When you eat low carb, you're not stimulating the pancreas all the time to make insulin, which leads to insulin resistance, which leads to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 I have a few friends that tried it and they no longer had blood sugar problems, but they have a hard time sticking with it.\u00a0\u00a0 Even if you could manage to stay away from high glycemic carbs for 2 out of 3 meals a day, it would help your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0As for the \"plaque\", if it is yeast, a low carb diet will help get rid of it.\u00a0\u00a0But, of course, I don't know what it is that you have.\u00a0\u00a0A doctor would have to diagnose your problem.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.",
