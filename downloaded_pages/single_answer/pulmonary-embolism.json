    "question": "Hi!I'm 21 years old. Relatively, healthy. I have been checked for\u00a0\u00a0thyroid, hypertension, blood pressure, diabetes and everything has come back normal.In October of 2010 I was at a grocery store. All of a sudden I felt light headed, the world sounded far and I felt short of breath. I was taken to the ER and was told I had suffered an anxiety attack. I had one more a month later and haven't felt that way since.Along with that I suffered chronic headaches and I thought maybe that was causing those brief moments of feeling that way. I had an MRI done Jan 12th and everything also came back normal.Recent new symptoms have been pain on the right side of my right breast. When I breathe in it hurts. The pain is NOT crippling and every other breathe will have pain, not all of them. I do take the birth control pill and I just want to make sure that pulmonary embolism is not a factor? What are the symptoms for that?I'm kind of scared.Advice is appreciated.Thank you!",
