    "question": "My mother has been treated by a family doctor for high blood pressure. After seeing copper wiring in her eyes, the doctor added Bystolic 5mg to her taking Hyzaar 100 25mg and Cardizem LA 300mg. Her pulse then lowered to 43 and she felt weak and began retained fluid (her ankles have been a real problem). Could the lowered pulse have been caused by the Bystolic and should she see a specialist rather than a family doctor? She also takes Glimepiride for diabetes which has been under control.",
