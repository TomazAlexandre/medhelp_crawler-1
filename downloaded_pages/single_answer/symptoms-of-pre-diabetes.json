            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.The causes of restless leg syndrome can be hard to decipher. It is not always caused by fluctuations in blood sugar. If your blood values are normal, I assume that there is another cause. If your symptoms continue, I recommend going back to your doctor and having a full workup to find the cause of your symptoms. Sometimes if you go into a doctor asking to be tested for 1 thing in particular, that is what they look for. If you get a full workup, maybe you might find the cause.I hope this helps.Cathy",
