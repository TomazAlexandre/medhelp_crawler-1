    "question": "Hi everyone, I am a 16 year old who has been diagnosed with PCOS about three/four months ago. I'm awaiting treatment (most likely birth control pill) and my next appointment is scheduled very soon.My concern at the moment though is directed towards insulin resistance and diabetes. I wasn't even aware of the correlation between PCOS and insulin until the other day, when I had a frightening incident regarding blood sugar. I treated myself to some super-sugary cookies and almost passed out in the middle of town (my mother had to drag me home on the train). Since then I have tried a couple more times with eating sugary foods and found the reaction to be very similar. I've also found that I become very dizzy/faint if I don't eat regularly or have meals on time. I'm also finding myself drinking about 3 litres a day (didn't used to drink much at all) and peeing round the clock. I'm so tired and fatigued that I slept 13 hours the other night and could barely open my eyelids I was so exhausted. I looked these symptoms up on the internet and found out a lot about type 1 diabetes. I don't really want to rely on my own judgement, as I'm aware that I may just be being paranoid now that I know about the link to this and PCOS, do you think it is just insulin resistance or should I ask to be tested for something more serious? Is it worth bringing up with the doctor at my next appointment?* I'm fairly certain it isn't type 2 diabetes, as I'm only 120lbs and I live a fairly healthy lifestyle. The only medical conditions I have to deal with is my fairly severe PCOS.",
