    "question": "Dr Lupo,.I had what I thought was only Hashimotos disease for years recently diagnosed as having Graves coinciding (Autonomous Functioning Tissue with Graves antibodies).I had RAI 131 8 weeks ago. Over the last 18 months was on doses of synthroid 175, 200, 250, off for 9 weeks, 75, 88, 132, 137, off for\u00a0\u00a027 days for RAI, one week after RAI was on 68.5 for 5 days, then full dose of 137, had labs and was reduced to 100 three weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0I seen in one of your earlier post a lady was on 300 and reduced to 150..you told her she probably \" hit the wall\" and would need to get used to the change. I feel like I've hit that wall per se too many times over the last year or so. My body, my mind, anxiety , the pain ,\u00a0\u00a0my periods, digestion everything is whacked... and have also been diagnosed with intermediate diabetes, endo feels this may clear up when thyroid remains stable for a while.\u00a0\u00a0Will I ever feel normal again? How long after RAI can you experience\u00a0\u00a0hyper symptoms, and can the antibodies Graves or Hashis continue to make you feel bad after the thyroid is gone? How long before the anxiety leaves? I would like to add a B complex vitamin to see if that helps, .",
