    "question": "'m so so sorry for all these questions. I'm trying to get them all in, so that I can get all my answers at once and not have to keep bothering you. I was just reading about Autoimmune Hepatitis and the\u00a0\u00a0the major auto-antibodies are called anti-liver-kidney microsomal-1 antibodies. Which then reminded me, that I was also diagnosed with Hypothyroid/Hashimoto's thyroiditis due to having a low tsh level in March 2012 along with anti-microsomal level of 599 and it should'nt be higher than 34. Please do tell me, this isn't the same thing as the anti-liver-kidney microsomal-1 antibodies? I would also like to mention after reading your forum, that I do not drink alcohol at all. However, I do drink alot of coffee. One more question, if a fatty liver from 2008 is the cause of my high liver enzymes and I'm not scheduled to see a gastro. until Oct. will more damage occur? I received a letter from my PCP in regards to my ultrasound I just had done last week, stating it was normal. I will be picking up the radiologist report to review on Thursday. I'm surprised if the one in 2008 showed a fatty liver, now this one is normal. Not that I'm not ecstatic.I have lost 10 lbs. in a wk. in a half due to stress over this issue and changing eating habits to try and cleanse my liver, not being able to take my diabetes med.'s and cholesterol medicine. I monitor my sugar and it's been excellent. However, not sure as to what my cholesterol, trig. are at this time. Praying they're always in range. Keep up the good work. I say prayers every night and thank GOD for giving all Dr.'s healing hands and the knowledge in helping the sick. Keep up the good work. GOD BLESS YOU!!",
