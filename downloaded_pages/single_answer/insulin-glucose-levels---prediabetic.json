            "answer": "In the diabetes world normal and healthy are synonymous. A fasting glucose of 100-125 mg/dl indicates prediabtes, unhealthy. Normal is 70-99 mg/dl, healthy. Some doctors say as low as 60 mg/dl but it is known that at 70 mg/dl lethargy starts to set in. By eating well-balanced meals (no sugar, no bad carbs) in the correct amounts, along with moderate exercise (like walking) and weight control, you can keep your blood glucose level as close to normal (non-diabetes level) as possible.\"inulin was 4.\"Inulin is used as a test to help diagnose problems or diseases of the kidneys. If you typo'd 'insulin', normal insulin values are 5-20 mcU/mL while fasting. Normal value ranges may vary among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.",

    "question": "i am doing fertility testing and just found out my fasting glucose and insulin. Glucose was 109 and inulin was 4. From what i've read the 109 means that I am pre-diabetic, although still in the \"normal\" range - just not the \"healthy\" range. It seems from what I've read that the insulin level of 4 is low. Is that true? What do these numbers mean? My doctor was looking for poly-cystic ovary disease and these numbers are fine for that, so he didn't say anythiing else to me. I had to look this all up. Thanks!",
