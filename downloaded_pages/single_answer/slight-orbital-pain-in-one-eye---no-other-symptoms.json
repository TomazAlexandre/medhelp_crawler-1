    "question": "I must have a problem with my vision, apparently this website says I can get medical help for free!No, seriously, my vision is 100 percent fine (other than the myopia which I've had for 20 years). My eye looks fine, too. No redness or anything else. It also feels completely normal. But when I apply pressure, my left eyeball aches a little. The pain isn't behind the eyeball, or next to the eyeball... It's the eyeball itself. It makes no difference where I poke it; when I poke it, it aches all over. The aching sensation takes a few seconds to recede. It's pretty mild so it took me a while to realize that it's a symptom. My guess is that I've had it for about a fortnight.My right eye is fine. I can poke it all I want, no pain.My question is: Can I just ignore this for a few more weeks? I'm in a third world country and in an extremely critical phase of a major project, and don't really have the time to spend at hospitals and doctors' waiting rooms.Background data: 37 years old, male, currently a non-smoker, sedentary lifestyle (but I do take the stairs), weight 60kg, height 171cm. Blood pressure normal. Hardly ever drink alcohol. No allergies. Family history of diabetes, YES, and I have a sweet tooth. But personally healthy so far, no illnesses since birth other than the occasional cold. Oh I did get dengue fever back in 2003 but it wasn't as bad as people make out.",
