    "question": "Hello, I'm a thirty-two year-old, 145lb American woman living in China. I recently came home from an English class, and began doing laundry. Quite suddenly, I began to experience a warm tingly sensation near my stomach. I hadn't eaten dinner yet, so I thought it was hunger, and kept going. I then became light-headed, and my arms felt light and shaky. The other symptoms were dizziness, the immediate desire to lie down, trembling, and a tiny bit of blurred vision- like everything was darkening around the edges. I was thinking this is not normal, and that it had something to do with low-bloodsugar, so I quickly poured myself a bowl of cereal with milk and ate it. The symptoms lessened a little, but my hands still feel shaky and uncoordinated, my upper arms feel warm and tingly, yet extremely weak, and I'm still light-headed. What's going on? Should I get my thyroid checked? Could it be anemia, diabetes? Very worried...Jen",
