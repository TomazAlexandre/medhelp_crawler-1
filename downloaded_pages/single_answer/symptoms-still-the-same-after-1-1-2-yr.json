            "answer": "Jerry --- like all medicines, Interferon and Ribavirin all have side effects. Some of those side effects can last for a very long time. And it really depends on each individual, their genetic makeup and predisposition for certain diseases and drugs.I believe (and this is just my opinion) that the INF and RIBA cause your genetic timeline to speed up\u00a0\u00a0and if you were meant to get a disease like let's say diabetes --- at say... uhm... 55 years old... and you took INF and Riba at 33 --- then you might get the diabetes at 33...So - some of those symptoms might be a part of something that you would have gotten already....But some of them would make me wary --- and I would - by chance seek the advice from a second doctor.It took one full year and a half for me to start feeling normal again.There are others who have taken longer --- and still a few that haven't gotten better at all.ALL IN ALL tho --- those that remain ILL --- or those that continue to have bad symptoms ---- the amounts of people that still feel awful AFTER treatment --- well they are SMALL NUMBERS...In comparison to those who get better.It may be the luck of the draw --- and you just got the short end of the stick... Like me... I ended up with Neuropathy and Fibromyalgia. HOWEVER --- I'm alive... and I'm going to outlive my liver --- and not the other way around.So --- get another doctor's opinion.... Find out what is wrong..Don't stop ---- if you believe there is something wrong.... Because your doctor may just not know what is possible.Or may be accidentally overlooking something.",
