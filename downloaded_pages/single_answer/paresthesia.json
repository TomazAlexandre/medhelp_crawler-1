    "question": "In doing some research into what I was experincing I found the following information. (I can't remember the site location, but it was a reputable one.) This really helped me as a limbo-lander to understand that the symptoms I'm experiencing make sense in respect to a possible diagnosis of MS.My doctor seems to think that this is what I have, although it's unusually slow to progress and my tests are normal. However I do have some signs such as hyperactive reflexes and ankle clonus, as well as a skin mottling suggestive of systemic autoimmune disease.I am in a \"wait and see\" mode right now. It's challenging, but at least I now know that it's not all in my head.Hope this is useful to all of you with tingling, burning, and numbness symptoms!Paresthesia\"The skin sensation of partial numbness or \"pins and needles\" or a type of \"burning\", \"tingling\" or \"creeping\" sensation of the skin, is known as a \"paresthesia\". Symptoms may start as a tingling (paresthesia) and change to a numbness, or there may be a combination of decreased sensation (numbness) but with heightened sensations at certain times or with stimulation. Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. Causes depend on the exact location of the paresthesia sensations, but typically include a physical nerve injury type condition (e.g. a nerve entrapment or some type of pressure being applied to a nerve directly or to the spinal attachment of that nerve), or a disease condition affecting the nerves (e.g. neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and others). Having these sensory symptoms in multiple locations, or the recurrence of similar symptoms in different locations is a hallmark symptom of multiple sclerosis, so your doctor will likely ask about the past history of similar symptoms to assess the likelihood of multiple sclerosis as a diagnosis (see symptoms of multiple sclerosis). Any of these tingling or numbness symptoms are more than just annoying; they can indicate a serious medical condition and require prompt medical diagnosis by a professional.\"",
