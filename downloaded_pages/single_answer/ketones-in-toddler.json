    "question": "I picked my two year old up early from day care because they said he woke up from nap around 1:00 and has been laying on his mat for 40 min. complaining of a belly ache. Immediatley when I picked him up in my arms he vomitted. We cleaned him\u00a0\u00a0up and I could tell instantly he felt better. I took him to his doctor just in case, and she did a urine test and found high levels of ketones. She did not act concerned and I informed her that he has not gotten sick anymore. I called back today to see if I needed a follow up, or if I should test his ketones at home. She wants him back in in the morning for a follow up. Should I be worried, I have tried some research but the only thing I get is information with children who have diabetes. Diabetes does not run on either side of my families or on my husbands. Just misinformed, and not sure what to do?",
