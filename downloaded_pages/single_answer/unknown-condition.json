            "answer": "Hi,How is your mom? It is good that the tests were fine. Fainting occurs when the brain does not get enough oxygen, low blood pressure, certain medications, seizures and problems with the heart or with the blood vessels leading to the brain. People at risk include those with diabetes, anxiety disorders, low sugar , or dehydration, Have this evaluated further for proper diagnosis. A referral to a neurologist may also help.Take care and best regards.",

    "question": "My mom occasionally gets very sick and these are the symptoms I find are relevant:-Always occurs after some worry or being nervous where she panis a little.-Experiences great fatigue where she's unable to move a muscle. Almost fainting but still able to hear but not move.-Great headache.-Fingers on hands go cold.-Blood pressure low.-Nasea.-Chest feels hot while the rest of the body is cold and shivering.-Seems to get better when lies down with the head being higher than the body.She had many test done including\u00a0\u00a0MRI, stress tests for the heart, but none of them, or atleast the doctor, showed anything significant.Is there some conditions similiar to this that we could check her for or something you can suggest. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
