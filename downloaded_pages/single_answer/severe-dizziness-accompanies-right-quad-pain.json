    "question": "Does Anyone have severe dizziness/lightheadedness that accompanies their pain. I am actually becoming more concerned with the lightheadedness than the pain. Yesterday I actually ended up at U of P ER because of an episode where I actually felt I was going to loose consciousness. There was a heat like sensation up the back of my neck into my head and I immediately began to sweat and get clammy. Has anyone had this? Someone mentioned Addison's Disease but I don't have the darkening of skin that most get. My cortisol level was somewhat low...but needs to be retested as I did not get an early am blood draw which is required. After the dizzy episode, I immediately had an exacerbation of the burning symptoms in the lower right quadrant that persisted all night. THis am I am still somewhat lightheaded but the pain has calmed to some degree. Anyone else have this?",
