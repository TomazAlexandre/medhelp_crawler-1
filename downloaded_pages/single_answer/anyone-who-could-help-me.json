            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0To be able to calculate your prognosis (survival and recurrence rates), I would need some additional information.\u00a0\u00a0How old are you? What's your general state of health? Do you have any chronic illnesses like diabetes or heart disease?\u00a0\u00a0Did the doctors also do estrogen receptor (ER), progeterone receptor (PR), and HER-2 assays on your tumor? If they did, what were the results?\u00a0\u00a0What chemotherapy drugs were given to you?From the information you have posted, your cancer seems to be at Stage IIIA, since your primary tumor is 8 cm in size and there is already spread to 9 nodes.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment for this stage of the disease will consist of radiation therapy to the mastectomy site, in addition to the surgery and chemotherapy which you have undergone.\u00a0\u00a0If your tumor is hormone receptor positive (that is, the ER or PR assays are positive), you would also benefit from at least a five-year treatment with tamoxifen or other hormonal therapy.Patients with stage IIIA, if untreated, have approximately a 60% chance of survival in 10 years, and a 60% chance of recurrence in 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0These statistics improve depending on the kind of treatment given.\u00a0\u00a0I can give you a more accurate approximation of your prognosis if you can post the additional information I requested. Thanks.",
