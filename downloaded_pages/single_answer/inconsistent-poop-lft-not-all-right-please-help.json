            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.IBS can produce a feeling of incomplete defecation and the symptoms mentioned above. Then again please check for Diabetes as this can affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves leading to bowel symptoms. This can be detected by a simple blood test. Also local pathologies in the rectum like growths or inflammatory diseases can also leave a feeling to defecation. For this a proctoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy will help detect the lesion. So, would advise you to discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
