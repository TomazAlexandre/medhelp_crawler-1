    "question": "I experience a loss of color vision in my right eye periodically ONLY when after I go to bed at night and turn off the lights. Once it is dark, I feel as if a shade has pulled over my eye. With the door open and light coming in from other room, I realize that I am unable to see colors as they were. Reds look black and most other colors are a dark white and light grey. I turn the lights back on and I can see the reds much better but they yellow/beige are still greyish. Only after 5-10 minutes do I return to normal until the next time it decides to occur again...I have already done every test my eye dr can do in his facility to check me out. All tests are normal. He is sending me to Bascom Palmer in Miami to get evaluated further. I should note that I have been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy in my right leg but intermittant symptoms also occur in all my extremities including positional loss of blood flow in all of them in certain standing or sitting positions. I also have arthristis in my feet and I am only 28. I have been tested for diabetes and nothing came up. Thus far I am stumping all my doctors...I am wondering what is causing this?",
