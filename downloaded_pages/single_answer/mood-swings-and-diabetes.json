    "question": "My partner was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes roughly 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0As he works away a lot, he missed appointments and has therefore never been prescribed any medication.\u00a0\u00a0I've been with him for two years and in the past few months he seems to have been suffering from wild and totally unpredictable mood swings where frankly, he becomes vile, which is most uncharacteristic.\u00a0\u00a0These episodes are becoming more frequent and yet he can never explain why he behaves this way and then becomes depressed that he's alienating the person closest to him.Someone has suggested to me that his diabetes might be the root cause.\u00a0\u00a0I'm desperate to help him and would like to find out how.",
