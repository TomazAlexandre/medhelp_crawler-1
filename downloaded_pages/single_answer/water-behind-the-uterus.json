    "question": "I am a 42 year old women and I recently had a pelvic ultrasound as well as a transvaginal ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said that I need to have a CAT scan as there is water BEHIND my uterus.\u00a0\u00a0She says that this is normal for premenopausal women but not for post menopausal, which I am.\u00a0\u00a0I went into premature menopause 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a lot of medical issues including diabetes which I have had since age 19 or 20.\u00a0\u00a0I did have a LEAP procedure done when I was about 23 years old for pre cancerous cells in the cervix.\u00a0\u00a0I also have several complications from the diabetes including 3rd stage kidney failure and extensive nerve damage in my legs, hands and stomach.\u00a0\u00a0I have always been a healthy weight, but in the last 18 months I suddenly gained 30 pounds and no matter what I do I can not lose the weight.\u00a0\u00a0I don\\t know if this has any bearing on the uterus but everything I have been reading points to uterus cancer.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor won't speculate until after I have my CAT scan, which I understand.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any other reasons for water behind (not in) the uterus?\u00a0\u00a0Please help as this is causing me a bit of concern but I'm not going to panic until I have a reason to be stressed.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any info you might have.",
