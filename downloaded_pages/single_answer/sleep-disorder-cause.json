    "question": "68 yr old male w/type 2 diabetes, hypertension both well controlled with Rx. I have sleep onset usually between 2 PM and 4 PM in the afternoon and wake after 3-6 hrs, then fitful sleep until 12-3 AM. Does the fact that I consume 4 glasses of wine after the noon meal have anything to do with this ? Thanks.",
