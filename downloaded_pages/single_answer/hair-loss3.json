            "answer": "Hello,Imitrex does not cause hair loss.No such side effect has been reported so far.Imitrex conatins sumatriptan which is tructurally similar to serotonin while hair loss can be caused by antidepressants which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.Both of them are at far ends. If you are having hair loss then pls look out for other causes of hair loss like stress,anxiety, alopecia aereata,hormonal imbalance(overproduction of dihydrotestosterone and thyroid hormones irregularities),malnutrition,fungal infections,malnutrition,diabetes,lupu,chemicals used on hair and sebum plugs on skin.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how your husband is doing and if you have any additional queries.",
