    "question": "I am 34 weeks 4 days pregnant. I have been recently diagnosed with mild gestational diabetes and have been on strict diet since one month. I also take 500 mg metformin with breakfast. My levels seem to be in control now give or take 1-2 high reading per week.I had a fetal assessment scan at 30 weeks 1 day and baby's size was fine, abdominal circumference and femur length was a bit on higher side of mean. But doctors said its fine.I had another scan yesterday and now abdominal circumference is right on mean but femur length is shorter than mean.FL at 30 weeks 1 day\u00a0\u00a0= 59 mmFL at 34 weeks 3 days = 63.5 mmIs this a problem sign? what could be the reason of FL growth to be reduced in 4 weeks?Has anyone heard about femur length being fine till 30 weeks but then on shorter side?Thanks in advance.. i am very much worried for my baby...",
