            "answer": "Congratulations on your excellent A1C. I'm also a type 1 (LADA) and so far the lowest I've gotten mine is 6.3. I am also a vegetarian and realized I had to make a lot of changes in my diet when I was diagnosed. I heard that many people weren't able to maintain a vegetarian diet as diabetics and was willing to change if I had to for my health, but was glad I didn't have to. I don't eat very low carb (I'm sure my A1C would be lower if I did) but moderate low and I do a lot of cooking, so I can have interesting meals but not too high carb.As for your question, I'm not an exerciser so I don't really have any suggestions. But I am on a website with a lot more traffic from longterm type 1's and many discussions about just this topic. I'm not allowed to post websites on here so I'm sending you a PM with the address. Keep up the good work!",

    "question": "Hello!\u00a0\u00a0I am a Type 1 Diabetic, 28 year old woman, and was diagnosed when I was 9.\u00a0\u00a0I have always tried to keep on top of my blood sugars, and have maintained a Hemoglobin A1C of 6 or below for years, using a combination of Lantus and Humalog injections.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, I take 15 units of Lantus, and Humalog on a sliding scale.\u00a0\u00a0I am a vegetarian, mostly vegan, and eat a diet based on a large amount of fruits and vegetables and hardly any refined foods (maybe whole grains 2 or 3 times a week, no refined sugars, etc.)I have always been physically active, but recently lost a lot of weight (I was out of the country and didn't have food), which seemed to make me more insulin-sensitive.\u00a0\u00a0However, I have begun exercising much more intensely, and my blood sugar is spiking like crazy after exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I will take it before going on a run, it will be 80, I will come back, having ingested nothing but water, and it will be 290.\u00a0\u00a0The same with capoeira.\u00a0\u00a0So, I have to take more Humalog just to bring it down, and sometimes I then go low...\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to be on this rollercoaster, and I am wondering what I can adjust/do so that I can continue to be active, train hard, lose weight, and not take a ton of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want my A1Cs to be off!\u00a0\u00a0I want to stay in control.\u00a0\u00a0I am also familiar with the research on intense exercise and hyperglycemia, but that research doesn't really give direction as to how to deal with the problem...Thank you.",
