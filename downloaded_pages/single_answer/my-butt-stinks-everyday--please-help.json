            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Body odor is seen in poor hygiene (ruled out in your case) or medical conditions like thyroid disorder, carcinoid syndrome and taking drugs like antidepressant.\u00a0\u00a0Increased sweating due to any cause can also cause unpleasant body odour because microorganism in your body can break sweat into aromatic fatty acids which smell bad. All causes of hyperhydrosis like hyperthyroidism, diabetes, carcinoid syndromes infections etc should be eliminated.Body odor can also be due to a diet very rich in proteins. Also if the diet is rich in cheese, then a bacteria of staphylococcus type acts on the sweat and causes smell of vinegar.Please consult a doctor to rule out these causes. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "No matter how many times I shower, no matter how much times I wipe, (uses baby wipes by the way) no matter what I do it seems it always stinks..I mostly notice this at school..I go to the bathroom about 1-2 days sometimes 3 days on a really bad one..Ever since my freshmen year of high school it's been like this and I'm tired of it..I can't have any friends or relationship with someone if I smell like this, I don't go around smelling like **** all day, but I also don't go around smelling like roses either..I think it's something inside of me honestly because I've showered so many times and wiped so many times to try to make it smell good for at least ONE DAY but that seems impossible..I never notice it at home but everywhere else I do,..it can smell really awful for 20 seconds at rare times and sometimes it's not noticeable I guess..Someone please help, I'm out of options and want to get out of this ridiculous situation..I eat fruit everyday with breakfast so it's not that",
