    "question": "My family history is pretty scary. My 1st uncle died from kidney failure, my 2nd uncle died from liver cancer recently. On my dad's side, my grandfather died from diabetes. I wonder how does this affect me, and what are the precautions I have to take to ensure a healthy life. In terms of checkups, what should i be focusing on?I have been diagnosed with HPV recently, and am at a risk of getting cervical cancer. I will have LEEP done soon. And in terms of gynae-related issues, the doctor told me to closely monitor my pap smears (once/6 months). This I am prepared to do, but just based on my family's history, I am getting paranoid about other issues as well. Please advise! Thank you!",
