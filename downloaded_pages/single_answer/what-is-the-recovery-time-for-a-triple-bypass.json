            "answer": "Hi there,I can give you some info on the recovery after open heart surgery (had my OHS when I was 32) but can not give advice on whether or not your dad will be a candidate for minimal invasive surgery or angioplasty.\u00a0\u00a0That only the Cardiologist and his team will know.What to expect Post-op:\u00a0\u00a0Hospital stay 7-10 days - depending on his lungs, bloodpressure and Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was in heart failure at the time of surgery and stayed 9 days.\u00a0\u00a0Not allowed to drive for 6 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Can resume desk-job after the 6 week check-up with Thoracic Surgeon.\u00a0\u00a0It took me about 2 years to fully recover from this surgery and feel like my old self again.It is really a big operation and he will have to make arrangements with his Employers and prepare himself for possible complications and extended sick leave.I had some complications with the electrical pathway and was booked off from work for 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0Ended up on loosing my job at the time, but God gave me another one and I was fine.\u00a0\u00a0But unfortunately Employers are not always understanding.If I was in your dad's shoes, I would go for a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Take all the relevant documentation, reports, Echos and Angio's with and ask if Angioplasty would be an option as it is far less invasive and worth it to try that first.\u00a0\u00a0But at the end the Specialists will know best - with all the information in hand.Please let us know how your Dad is doing and if you need any further info, I would like to help.",

    "question": "Hi! My dad is about to have a triple bypass in about a week. He would like to know how long the recovery time would be and how soon can he get back to work. This is an elective surgery and not an emergency and he is fairly healthy. He is 47 yo and his doctor says he has a strong heart and has no trouble pumping blood. He does have Type 2 Diabetes and high blood pressure but have then under control. My dad is worried that his job might not take him back because he may be deemed unfit and that the recovery time might take too long. He is a Merchant Marine with a desk job and leads a fairly sedentary lifestyle.Also is it possible to ask the doctor to postpone the surgery for a couple months and have a minimal invasive surgery first or take medication until we can get things all sorted out. Or can we ask the doctor if we can choose angioplasty instead even though she said a bypass is the way to go? My dad doesn't suffer from angina or have difficulty breathing. He did feel it slightly one time when he had to climb up 5 flights of stairs. And my grandmother who lived with us just passed away about a month ago and we took her body back to her homeland so our financial resources are pretty much depleted.Thank you for your answers!",
