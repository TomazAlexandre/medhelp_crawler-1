    "question": "My father 2 weeks ago had a aortic valve replacement surgery and a reconstruction of the aorta (they called it the Bentall Procedure - biological). He is 73 Yr old male with Type 2 diabetes. Has had his diabetes in control since his diagnosis (about 30 years ago) and maintains a healthy lifestyle. He was a smoker but quit over 25 years ago. He was released 1 week ago and yesterday returned to the hospital after having difficulty breathing again (and had been complaining about a cough for a couple of days - which we were told was normal. He now had to have almost 3 litres of fluids extracted from his lungs (accumulated in the last week) and had to have his heart shocked because of an arrhythmia (he did not have this problem before surgery). Is this normal for people who undergo this surgery? What can we expect his recovery to be afterwards.. my research and the Dr.'s advised us that we can expect a normal recovery after the initial surgery and that my father was doing extremely well but within a week he accumulated water in his lungs and developed an arrhythmia -\u00a0\u00a0Now we are afraid he will be released too soon and can encounter additional issues... I feel as if I am not asking the right questions to better understand the situation. Can you help me with this?",
