            "answer": "Hello googmonster,First let me say that we're all volunteers here with lots of diabetes experience.\u00a0\u00a0We're not medical professionals, so be sure to review information from here (and elsewhere on the internet) with your doctor.Your blood sugar numbers are generally within the normal range tho'many folks do see a rise in BG after eating.\u00a0\u00a0That spike can come 1-3+ hours after eating depending on the type of food (fats deley that spike).\u00a0\u00a0As long as your numbers are not falling into the 50s, your numbers are not a cause of concern.\u00a0\u00a0Do pay attention to your overall health -- the numbers are generally a reflection of your health and not a \"cause\" of it.There is some evidence that some folks who develop hypoglycemia (a medical condition where the pancreas excretes too much insulin in response to carbohydrates) later develop diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Not all with hypoglycemia develop diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Hypoglycemia is a treatable condition also.\u00a0\u00a0Personally, I wonder if the progression occurs in part because the beta cells are simply exhausted by their over-activity and they finally poop out or become sluggish.Given there is some family tendency to diabetes, a good preventative strategy is to maintain a healthy weight for your height, get regular exercise to the level approved by your doc, and eat a healthy balanced diet.\u00a0\u00a0A diabetic diet is really just a healthy diet with plenty of fruits & veges, healthy protein & fats, and suitable water to keep yourself well-hydrated.",

    "question": "Is there any scientific evidence that consistently having a low blood sugar might be a sign that you may someday develop diabetes? (have one adult relative with type 2 diabetes)Mine is low no matter what I eat or when I check.\u00a0\u00a0Like between 70-75 whether fasting or an hour after eating (regardless what I eat, sugary or not).\u00a0\u00a0I'm worried that I may be secreting too much insulin all the time or something.\u00a0\u00a0I started checking because I often feel weak and tired regardless of when and what I eat.Or is this a good thing?",
