    "question": "Greetings!10 days ago I had an anxiety-ridden period at work (now over). I began having excessive gas that first night which wakes me at night. The morning after the second such night I had a periodic blood test related to my cholesterol medicine. The blood glucose came back at 300, whereas just a few months before it had been below 200. I was\u00a0\u00a0diagnosed with diabetes 2. I have a long-term history of 200-400 mg of ibuprofen to manage chronic pain from an old injury. The excess gas condition has continued ('treating' with Gas-X).\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if 1) the anxiety at work could have caused an ulcer to erupt (or if not what might explain the on-gong excessive gas)?\u00a0\u00a0and 2) might the sudden significant elevation in gas have temporarily elevated my blood glucose level, so that I should be re-tested? 3) what tests/treatments could distinguish between ulcers, diverticulosis, or treat the gas, etc?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
