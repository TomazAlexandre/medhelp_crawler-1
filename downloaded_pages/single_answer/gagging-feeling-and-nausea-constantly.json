    "question": "I was ill, violently vomiting, about 3 months ago, and recently this feeling of gagging and nausea has occured. I am 14, healthy etc and have been to the doctor who prescribed ranitidine as he thought it was stomach acid, which has stopped the nausea but the feeling in my throat is still carrying on. He sent me for an ultrasound to check there is nothing in my stomach, but it came back clear, as did blood tests. I am to finish the course of ranitidine but I don't think anyone is bothered as nothing showed up on any of my tests. Mine is very bad in the morning, about 1-2 hours after I get up, and then generally subsides to a steady feeling for the rest of the day. I honestly don't know what's wrong with me, kind of scared :/",
