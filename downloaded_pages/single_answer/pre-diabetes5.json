    "question": "Im hoping someone here has some helpful answers for me. Today my doctor told me that my fasting blood sugar level is 6.3. That's the first time in my life I ever had elevated sugar levels that I know of. He also told me that the 3 month test, I think its an average test, was normal. He told me if I lose some weight the number would drop but it would only delay me getting diabetes by about 20 years. Im so confused because I have read that pre diabetes can be reversed. Also since it was the only time they were elevated is their anything else that could have caused the spike. I did the test fist thing in the morning. I hadn't eaten in 8 hours besides taking my medication citalopram with a small sip of water. I have been worried sick ever since the doc told me it was elevated.",
