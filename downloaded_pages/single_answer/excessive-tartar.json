    "question": "Please help me, somebody. I seem to have an abnormal proliferation of plaque/calculus/gunk, despite efforts at least on par with normal. I brush my teeth twice a day. I do not floss daily, but I do clean between my teeth with a professional dental scaler and StimuDents. Despite this, I have calculus and brown gunk on my teeth all the time! I can never seem to get caught up with it. I'm certainly not perfect but it seems like what I do ought to be enough to at least be able to keep up. Does tartar grow this fast in anyone else? As much as I worry about it, it seems to stay uncontrollable.I do smoke, I do suffer from dry mouth, and I did not until recently use fluoride toothpaste (used baking soda and hydrogen peroxide.) My weight and diet are good and I have no other health problems. I eat very little sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I just started using Gel-Kam and Closys. Is this normal? Does calculus develop overnight?Please help me. I don't understand.",
