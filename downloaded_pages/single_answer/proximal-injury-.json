            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Femoral neuropathy can have many causes, including but not limited to trauma, compression, and stretch injury. Other causes of femoral neuropathy include commonly diabetes, and other less common causes of mononeuropathy (neuropathy of 1 nerve) such as hereditary/genetic causes, autoimmune disorders, demyelinating conditions, vitamin deficiencies, abnormalities of protein metabolism, as in a type called amyloidosis or monoclonal proteinemia, and ischemia (lack of blood flow).Femoral neuropathy causes weakness predominantly of the quadriceps muscle, leading to difficulty in extending the knee. This can lead to difficulty with walking as in your case, and particularly with going down stairs.The prognosis depends on the cause of the injury and the extent of the injury. If the cause was trauma for example, if there was nerve stretching, some recovery is possible, but requires some time. If the nerve was severed, then recovery is unlikely. If the neuropathy was caused by for example diabetes, then aggressive diabetes control will prevent other neuropathies and will promote healing. If a reversible cause is identified and treated, then partial recovery is likely. The likelihood of healing can sometimes be assessed by a repeat EMG study a few months after the initial injury. Physical therapy is essential to help the other muscles of your leg compensate for the weak ones, and is strongly recommended. With intensive physical therapy and compensation techniques, ambulation may improve significantly.I recommend continued follow-up with your neurologist. Evaluation by a neuromuscular specialist (a neurologist specialized in diseases of the nerve and muscle) may be of benefit to you if you have not seen one.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
