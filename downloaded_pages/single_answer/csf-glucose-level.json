    "question": "I was recently reading my emergency room report after I experienced a general tonic-clonic seizure.The report indicated that the lumbar puncture results indicated everything was within normal limits,except for glucose.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor never mentioned this to me, so I'm wondering if this is important?Can an abnormal glucose level indicate a condition that can cause a first seizure like this inan adult? To my knowledge I don't have any problem with my glucose, although my grandfather haddiabetes. Thank you.============================================================================The CSF glucose is a reflection usually of the blood glucose. You did notsay if it was high or low, however the CSF glucose tends to be high inpeople who have high blood sugar due to diabetes, and if the blood sugaris low in a person who is fasting the CSF glucose also tends to be low.One reason for CSF sugar to be abnormally low in the presence of normalblood sugar is in bacterial meningitis. In this case the sugar is beingconsumed by bacteria in the CSF, however the white blood cell count inthe CSF would also be elevated in this case and the protein would be high,In the absence of these two accompanying findings meningitis is not likely.An isolated abnormal CSF glucose therefore is likely to be a reflectionof the blood sudgar levels, and on it own has little significance.",
