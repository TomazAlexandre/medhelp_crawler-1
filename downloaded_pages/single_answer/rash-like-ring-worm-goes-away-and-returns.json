            "answer": "Hello,Various reasons for recurrent or persistent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Treatment resistance can be overcome by applying a cream with a combination of antifungals (Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1% and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%). Get her blood sugar tested, fasting, 2 hours after food and if these are high then glycosylated hemoglobin to see overall sugar status in last 3 months.I suggest you to get it evaluated from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "So..for about 5 years now I have had a rash type ring worm that when treated with RX like fluconazole it goes away, then about two weeks later comes back. I have seen about three deramtologist and all have given me a different answer. Answers ranging from a toe nail fungus that when i put my underwear on I bring it from toes to groin (ridiculous) or something like a gluten allergy wich I have no other symptoms of. Topical creams dont work at all and this stuff is usually in the groin and arm pit. Occasionally it has spread to stomach and calfs. Any help would be more than appreciated. I am so sick of this. I have yet another appointment at the beginning of April with yet another different dematologist.\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks!!!",
