            "answer": "Hi,Have you any history of trauma to the chest?How would you decribe the pain? Sharp,stabbing.shooting?Do you feel pain in other parts of the body ( neck,jaw)?Would you be able to locate the source of the pain using just one finger?Is the pain aggravated by any movement like breathing?What relieves the pain?Is the pain associated with your menstrual cycle?I suggest you try analgesics or anti inflammatory medication and see if they disappear.Make sure you have no previous allergies with the medications before taking them.Do you have an associated hypertension, diabetes or a history of early heart attack in the family (before 55)?Costochondritis may cause sharp stabbing pains in the chest area. If the pain persists and is asociated with difficulty breathing,dimming of vision,persistent chest heaviness then further examination is warranted.I suggest you seek consult with your primary physician regarding your problem of the \"whole rib cage is moving\".This may be assessed through physical examination.I hope this helps.Good luck and keep us posted.",
