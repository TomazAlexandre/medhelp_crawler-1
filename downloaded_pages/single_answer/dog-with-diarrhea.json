            "answer": "I had the same thing happen when we adopted our new Dalmation in January.\u00a0\u00a0He spent a week with the county shelter and was about to be euthanized when a rescue group took him.\u00a0\u00a0We adopted him a week later.\u00a0\u00a0A few days after coming to us, he developed diarrhea and then started vomiting occasionally after meals.\u00a0\u00a0Our vet assumed it was a bacterial infection and a course of antibiotics fixed him right up.\u00a0\u00a0Lord only knows what he was exposed at the shelter or even during the time before he was picked up.Since the diarrhea isn't getting any better, ask your vet if a course of antibiotics would be appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0Since she's already had a dietary change, and Science Diet is a premium dog food, I wouldn't change again just now.\u00a0\u00a0Give her body a chance to get used to it.\u00a0\u00a0And congrats on adopting a new family member!\u00a0\u00a0:-)",

    "question": "We lost our last dog of ten years to diabetes about two months ago.\u00a0\u00a0It was heartbreaking. We got our little pug when our daughter was 18months and they grew up together. They were very cute and she was very dear!\u00a0\u00a0We went to the Humane Shelter and got another dog that weekend. We already love her! She is 3 and beautiful! She looks like Little Ann from Where the Red Fern Grows. She has the most wonderful personality but is very shy and nervous. It seems like she was probably an abused dog on the streets or with a previous owner. ??? The problem is that she has develpoed diarrhea for about a week now. It isn't real bad. She still eats and drinks and plays, but sometimes seems like she doesn't feel good after eating. The vet did a fecal and it came back negative. I am waiting for the vet to call back so we can talk about what is next. I have had to start putting her outside to sleep because she can't go through the night without a liquid, smelly mess happening in our room. She doesn't really seem to mind, but I hate it! Does anyone have any ideas on what I can do for her? She is on Science Diet dog food right now\u00a0\u00a0and I am thinking about changing to something else? Any ideas?",
