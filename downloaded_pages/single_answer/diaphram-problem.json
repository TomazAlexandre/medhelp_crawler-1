            "answer": "Actually, I feel for you mother...I have bilateral dipahragmatic issues and require a ventilator to breathe...this is the severest of forms.From what you said, she has one affected side, not both like myself. Alot of people aren't even aware that they have one sided involvement until they get a chest xray that shows an elevated hemidiaprhagm on one side or the other. A person might also feel more short of breath with exertion...your mom probably feels out of breath with moving around, maybe that is why the docs said to not exert herself too much. Does she feel this way at rest too? If a person has underlying lung problems, then they can feel shortness of breath at rest. How does she feel when she lies flat? Again, shortness of breath can be more pronounced if she lies flat (called orthopnea).The reason why a person might suffer from unilateral paralysis of the diaphragm would be from trauma (cardiac surgery can injure the nerve feeding the diaprhagm), infection, tumor, neuropathy or in many cases, the cause is not identified and is called idiopathic in nature.I guess treatment would depend on the cause if it can be found...What does her doctor think about all of this? There is a procedure to consider: plication of the affected side of the diaphragm. This is a surgical procedure that involves tacking down the affected side. What happens when a side of the diaphragm is weak or paralyzed is that with each breath, that side of the diaprhagm moves upwards instead of downwards. This adds to the shortness of breath, so docs will sometimes do this procedure to prevent the affected side from moving upwards with each breath.I am not a doctor, just someone who has been living with this for 5 years and counting, with bilateral involvement and simply have been around the block with the testing, treatments etc... What I would do is to maybe go with your mother to the doctor's if she lets you and ask questions regarding her case and treatment. I hope that this helps you...you can message me anytime if you have questions about this. Sunny",
