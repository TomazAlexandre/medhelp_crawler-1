    "question": "After several hours of sitting, I got up and noticed my right foot was asleep. From halfway down the shin to the toes and covering the whole foot, but only on top. The tingling doesn't include my heel, sole, or under my toes. I've tried massaging my foot, leg, and joints and stretching but nothing seem to work. I have no history of back, leg, or nerve injuries or any surgery. However type II diabetes runs through my family like wild fire (including both grandmothers, my father, and my mother who is borderline). On top of this family history, I have gallstones, a past history of smoking (quite smoking 5 months ago after 3.5 years), bad cholesterol, I'm overweight, and I have hypothyroidism (for which I started taking medication 2 months ago and am still working with my dr to find a correct dosage).So my question is this, how worried should I be about 12+ hours of tingling in my foot and what can I do to help it? Should I wait a little longer, see if exercise and activity change it or should I go to the doctor's now ask for a glucose test? Should I even be that concerned about diabetes, given that my last fasting glucose test was high enough for the Dr. to tell me I need to loose weight, but low enough for him not to suggest the extended 8 hour test? Or could I somehow have pinched a nerve?",
