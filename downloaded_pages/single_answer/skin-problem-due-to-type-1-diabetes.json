    "question": "I am a juvenile diabetic and recently I had developed some dark brown patches/spots on my feet and now they started increasing and i can see them all over my feet and ankle. they look very ugly. My blood sugar is in control (most of the times, during stress or exam times, it just increases exponentially) but my hba1c is in control. I don't know what is the reason for these spots. There is no pain or irritation but these spots look very ugly and i am worried that is this a sign of some other diabetic complication.",
