    "question": "HelloI found this website (really glad) and I need second opinion. For about 2 years I have had this symptoms: sleepy and tired all the time, itchy feet, very thirsty at night, yeast infections. My aunt from my husbands side has type 2 diabetes and she told me to check my blood sugar level so I did. My fasting number were usually 95, 126,\u00a0\u00a0136, 153, 85. After 2 hour meal it was usually 140-155. I went to a doctor, they did a fasting blood glucose test and it was 138, my A1c was 5.7 and my doctor told me I am glucose intolerant and have pre-diabetes. Aren't those fasting numbers too high to be considered pre-diabetic? I will appreciate all the answers!
