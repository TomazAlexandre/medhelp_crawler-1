            "answer": "Hi there. Muscle spasm can be caused due to muscle overuse, strenuous exercise,\u00a0\u00a0dehydration, electrolytes depletion, anemia, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. It may be a part of nervous system diseases like multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. Also worth mentioning are kidney disease, hypothyroidism. Certain investigations need to be carried out like complete blood count for all the above mentioned systemic conditions, thyroid function tests, electromyography etc.Consult a neurologist and get these evaluated at the earliest lest anything important is missed out.",

    "question": "its been on my mind for a while.\u00a0\u00a0Since i was little i can always remember having random body spasms that only last for a few seconds. I went to a doctor a couple years ago, but that neurologist really wasn't much help and in the end i stopped going to him. I continue to having these random body spasms, maybe just once a day, and it only effects my body from the torso up (sometimes just my arms or sometimes its like an electric jolt). Does anyone have an idea what this could be?",
