            "answer": "Hello,Various reasons for recurrent or persistent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Treatment resistance can be overcome by applying a cream with a combination of antifungals (Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1% and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%).If the symptoms are worse then it is best to consult a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "hi guys,first of all my case isn't something like the red rash never subsided. I have had jock itch since late November (more than a month already) and every time I applied topical cream like Daktarin/canesten it always subsided in 3-5 days. However, once i stopped using the cream it always come back few days later.I went to a doctor in mid December and he said i might want to get a culture test to make sure if it's fungal infection and yes so I did go to the lab. It was confirmed fungal infection by culture test. The doctor gave me a cream and told me to use it for 2 weeks beside anti-fungal oral drug called ketoconazole. So yes, this time I used his cream and this anti-fungal drug for 15 days even though the redness itself had subsided in about a week.However, 3 days later, these fungi finally came back :( I can see some redness although they are still in very premature stage. im quite sure they aren't part of skin irritation of something because the \"shape\" look definitely like the previous infection, as well as the location.I have consulted with my dad and he said canesten should help. I've tried canesten before but only for about 9 days (and yes it came back few days after I stopped using it). I truly wonder how can I kill these fungi?It's really embarassing and frustrating. I came to another doctor and this female doctor said i should keep applying the cream for a month instead of just 2 weeks. I wonder if it's true? If i check online information, some people even keep applying topical cream daily after their infection gone, wouldnt it make the skin thin?",
