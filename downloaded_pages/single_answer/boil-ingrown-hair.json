            "answer": "Hi,Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. The bacterial skin infection can be transmitted by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle. Apply warm compresses on the boil and then clean the site thoroughly by topical antiseptics. Then apply some topical antibiotic cream like Bactroban or Neosporin if you are not allergic to any of them. If the symptoms are severe then oral antibiotics and incision and drainage may be needed. Recurrent boils are commonly found in diabetes, disorders of the immune system, malnutrition, poor hygiene and exposure to harsh chemicals that irritate the skin. So you should also get your blood sugar levels estimated. You can get fasting blood sugar levels and post prandial blood sugar levels estimated to check your status of diabetes.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I keep getting what I believe are boils along my panty line. I went to the ER for it once and had to get it drained and packed with gauze. It has came back 3 months later, in the same spot, but this time it's different. I've been leaving it alone for a week now to let it heal on it's own, but it just keeps getting bigger and more painful. It feels like there is a knot where the incision was and it's swollen. There is no white head, just a hard knot. I was just wondering if there may be something that I can do at home to reduce the swelling and what I can do to prevent it from getting worse and what I can do to prevent it from happening again. I can't afford to go to the doctor and risk another 2 weeks out of commission. Any advice is appreciated.",
