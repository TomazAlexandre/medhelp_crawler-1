            "answer": "Hi Pete!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. This pulse you feel could be due to anxiety and panic attack and since citalopram is helping, probably the diagnosis is anxiety related.However, yes, this sensation can be due to palpitations, hyperthyroidism, electrolyte imbalance, low vitamin B12, diabetes or pinched nerves. You could ask your doctor regarding these possibilities and get tests to check if you have any of these conditions. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have suffered with this for a few years now. The pulsing is in rhythm with my heart beat. It goes through my chest and head and out of my finger tips. I was put on citalopram by the doctor and this scary sensation goes away. But if I forget to take the citalopram for a couple of days it comes back very strong and is very scary. I would love to know what is causing this and whether there is a cure. But like I said the citalopram is controlling it. I've not had any tests done. It is that bad that if I did not have anything to control it I would not be here. Thanks for reading and any information would be grateful.
