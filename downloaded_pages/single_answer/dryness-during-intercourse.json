            "answer": "Hi, it could depend on your estrogen levels...it helps in the production of the vaginas' natural lubrication which also helps keep it clean. A lack of it would leave you with a dry vagina or make lubrication difficult.However, this only usually occurs during the menopause. i dont know how old you are, but if you are older and reaching menopause then that could be the reason. if you are not then it might be worth asking a doctor about it, but things like diabetes can also effect lubrication.Hope that has helped a little, but i recommend seeing a doctor as only they will be able to diagnose the problem.Good luck x",
