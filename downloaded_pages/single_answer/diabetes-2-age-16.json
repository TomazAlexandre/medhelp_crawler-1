    "question": "Hey, Im 16 yo boy , full asian with diabetes type 2 history from all of the 4 grandparents.My mum is in a prediabetes stage so she recieved a blood sugar measure device so I decided to try it and got a bit worried when I saw the results which were 100-107 ( tested in 4 different days around a month ago )I have fast metabolism, I weight 70 Kilos for 186 cm but I eat A LOT of candy which I have tried to reduce the amount I eat.last week I did a whole week without sugar which was quite hard for me to do and still after 7 days without eating any sugar and after 10 hours fast the result was 104 mg/dL so I got kinda depressed.I guess the question is : How do I lower the amount of sugar in my blood\u00a0\u00a0( considering there is not much weight to lose and I would say I am physically active )Thanks:)Sorry for if there were made any English mistakes",
