            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of her symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include chondromalacia, degeneration, inflammation like bursitis, tendonitis, injuries to the ligaments/ tendons/ internal knee structures, neuro-muscular/ vascular issues etc. Without a diagnosis at hand it would be difficult to suggest a management plan. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an orthopedician for suggestion of an appropriate management plan.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

She says it feels like something is grinding behind her knee cap and the knee is giving out on her far more frequently. She is not a good candidate for a major knee surgery according to her cardiologist. I don't really want to add or increase her pain medicine...she is not sleeping soundly due to the intermittent pain. Are there any \"rehab\" type excersizes that I can help her with to strengthen knee?
