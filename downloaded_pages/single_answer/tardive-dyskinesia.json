            "answer": "Glucophage is treat diabetes. If you need an antipsychotic Zyprexa is the worst offender for diabetes. Abilify is the least likely to cause it. But it is a risk with all atypical antipsychotics but can be monitored for but some psychiatrists don't use Zyprexa anymore because of the high risk of diabetes. As for Depakoate that can often cause weight gain. Lamictal is much less likely to cause that and that is a known effective mood stabilizer. Perhaps you could ask your psychiatrist about changing you to Lamictal. I know that I gained a fair amount of weight on Lithium and Depakoate but did okay on Lamictal. You could ask about that as its an established first line mood stabilizer.",

One visit it would beelevated & the next visit it would be low, the next high (you get the point)..I took myselfoff the sugar med due to weight gain. My weight had never been an issue until then.
