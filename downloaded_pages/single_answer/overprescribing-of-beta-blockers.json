    "question": "I was diagnosed two weeks ago with PVCs. The doctor prescribed beta blockers, in spite of my having marked \"asthma\" on my intake form. I told him I thought I was overweight and that my hernia might be contributing as a result to the PVCs. He said \"you look fine to me\". I was 188 pounds, at five-six! That is 29.9 BMI, the last number before you jump from the \"overweight\" category to the \"obese\" category.I went home and read up on the drug he'd prescribed. Realized I should not take it with asthma. Realized it would not CURE me in any way. My resting heart rate is 65-72, and I am in reasonably good shape for my size. I realized the drug would LOWER my heart rate. I have low blood pressure to begin with, too, and realized the beta blocker would lower this as well. I thought long and hard about it, and decided NEVER to put one of those poison pills in my mouth.This all got me wondering - are we all being prescribed medicines we don't need, to suit the needs of pharmaceutical companies? I mean, why else prescribe this thing to me?I have family in Cuba with similar problems, and there, the medical care is focused on prevention rather than profits for drug companies. My cousin was told to lose weight, and monitor her dietary triggers, to exercise vigorously. I have been doing these things, and while my palps are still with me, they are easier to control with some careful planning and thought.I wonder how many of us are being needlessly drugged because the real cures - diet, healthy life and exercise - are too difficult to imagine forcing on people?Of course, I say this as someone whose PVCs have no known cause. I have good health overall, and nothing obviously wrong with my heart.",
