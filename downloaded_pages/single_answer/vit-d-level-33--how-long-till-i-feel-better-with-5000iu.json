            "answer": "Hi Shana!The normal levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D range from 30.0 to 74.0 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).So, your first doctor is right. You have low normal levels. You may benefit from some vitamin D supplementation and exposure to sunlight. So, yes, you can take the vit. D supplement for some time, but do not continue for long.Other than this, your symptoms could be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Nerve conduction studies should be done along with blood tests for above mentioned disorders. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis is another possibility that should be investigated.Please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I started having symptoms 9 mo ago. I had a Vit D level checked and mine was 33. My physician never told me if was a \"low normal\". I have been thru an MRI, 2 neurologist, 1 rheumotologist and several appts. My MRI did reveal a small lesion, I was told probable MS. I was freaked out. I just seen a new physician and he told me that the :normal\" levels are incorrect and shold be 50-100. So he told me to start on 5000iu which I started about 5 days ago. I don't notice anything yet. My initial symptoms were lightheadness for 2 days, then numb on rt side of my face, now with burning sensations in my legs, hand and foot muscle pain. Are these all symptoms that others have had? I just want to feel \"normal\" again. Also I am an Arizona Native, moved to Washington state 2 years ago. Not much sun here. I hope that Vit D defecit is my issue and nothing else. I do know that a lesion in the brain can be from migranes- MS, but I do not have any weakness and my symptoms are intermittent and have not gotten any worseThank youAny input is appreciatedShana",
