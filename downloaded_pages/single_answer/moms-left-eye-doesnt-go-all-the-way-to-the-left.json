    "question": "Hello,My Mother woke up a couple days ago with a dull ache behind her left eye. When I visited her this morning. I noticed that when she looks to her left, her left eye does not go all the way to the left. It kind of stops half way. Her right eye is fine. We just visited the optometrist who said the problem is caused by nerves and/or muscles at the back of the eye. She did a fill \"optiscan\" of the eyes and noticed no other issues. The optometrist said we should see our family doctor who could recommend us to an eye specialist. My mother continues to have a dull ache.What can cause this and what are possible solutions? Please let me know as I am worried.",
