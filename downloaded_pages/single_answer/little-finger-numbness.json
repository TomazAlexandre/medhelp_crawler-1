            "answer": "Hi,The first possibility that comes to mind is carpal tunnel syndrome due to nerve compression at the wrist. The nerve involved is usually the ulnar nerve which supplies the pinky finger and ring finger.Other causes like diabetes, B 12 deficiency, thyroid dysfunction also need to be ruled out.I would suggest you to do some gentle wrist exercises and take OTC B12 supplements.Good luck!",
