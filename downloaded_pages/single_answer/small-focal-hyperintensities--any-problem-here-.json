            "answer": "Hi,There seems to be no problem with your brain MRI. Some undefined white matter lesions are seen which can occur due to high BP, diabetes, smoking, alcoholism, chronic headaches, migraines, trauma, past infections like encephalitis. MS and stroke have been ruled out in your case.Hope this answers your question!",

    "question": "FINDINGS:There are a couple of tiny foci of abnormal increased signal intensity in the subcortical white matter of the left frontallobe. One, or possibly two small focal hyperintensities are also noted in the subcortical white matter of the rightfrontal lobe. The above findings are best appreciated on the FLAIR technique. They are not clearly visible on the T2weighted images. No signal changes are noted in the cerebellum or in the brainstem. The ventricles are normal insize and configuration. The visualized proximal intracranial vascular structures are normal. The pituitary gland, thesuprasellar and the parasellar regions are unremarkable. The middle and inner ears are normal. The mastoids and theparanasal sinuses are clear. The orbits are unremarkable. After intravenous administration of contrast material, nopathological enhancement is noted in the brain parenchyma or in the meninges.IMPRESSION:1. There are a couple of small focal hyperintensities in the white matter of both frontal lobes, as describedabove. These are nonspecific findings of unknown etiology and questionable clinical significance. Noabnormalities are noted in the periventricular white matter. No abnormalities are noted in the brainstemor in the cerebellum.2. There is no evidence of acute ischemic infarction. There is no intracranial hemorrhage or space occupyinglesion.3. The ventricles are normal.4. After intravenous administration of contrast material, no pathological enhancement is noted in the brainparenchyma or in the meninges.5. The remaining findings are unremarkable.This discussion is related to/posts/show/293139.",
