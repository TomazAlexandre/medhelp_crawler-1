    "question": "I have been getting an onset of unexpected chills with severe shaking , for about 2 months now. It always happens at night and lasts anywhere from 30 minutes to whenever I fall asleep. (I find going to sleep seems to calm it down.)I have talked to quite a few people who experience the same thing. Ususally get headache and fever afterward. Not exposed to air conditioning or other cold environment. A good majority of them say they are diabetic and it is caused by a spike in your blood sugar levels. My doctor just took me off of my diabetes medication, after my last AIC came back noraml(Actually the last 3 reports were normal) I was ecstatic, because Ive been diabetic for the last 10 years.(Type-2 Adult Onset) They say mine is probably an adverse reaction to coming off the meds so quickly. I quite agree. Going back to my doctor this week and will give updates as I get them. Hope this helps some of you.God Bless,Nolakid",
