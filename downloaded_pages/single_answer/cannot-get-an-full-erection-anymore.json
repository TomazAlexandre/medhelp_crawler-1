    "question": "Hi I'm a 16 year old healthy, active teen and I'm experiencing erectile dysfunction. I know most people would say if it happens when I'm a teen its mostly anxiety, but I can't seem to get a full erection at any time, rather then just with my girlfriend... I am verrry attracted to her and I get that sexual arroused feeling when I'm with her but it seems that my penis won't fill up with blood. I don't think I obsess about it but maybe in the back of my mind I do and that is all I need for the anxiety to stop it... I just want to know the possibilities. I even stopped smoking cigarettes. It seems to get better by the days but I just want to know forsure that it will get better and the possible problems.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
