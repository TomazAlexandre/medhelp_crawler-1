            "answer": "Hi there!Since people who work in medical facilities are at a very higher risk for being exposed to disease than the general population it is important to make sure that all medical students and workers are immune to these diseases. It is helpful in the protection of both the employee and the patients with whom the person may be in contact. Usually a negative serology after 2 documented doses may represent a false negative which may mean the antibody titer is too low to detect with commercial tests. Diabetes mellitus is an immunocompromised state and several tests of immunologic function are known to be abnormal among diabetic patients. It may be possible that due to your diabetes mellitus after 3 doses also you are not able to gain immunity to measles so there is no point is repeating the dose. You should discuss your concerns with a doctor. May be that will be helpful. Do write to us again on how you are doing.Take care and regards!",
