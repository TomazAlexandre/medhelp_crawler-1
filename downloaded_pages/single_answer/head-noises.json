            "answer": "hi zaxmom1.how are you? Well this post of yours shows that you are not much happy. Frankly since you are standing in an island and surrounded by too many problems. Hence you are getting a exaggerated response. Do you notice here 1and 1 is doing a 11 job rather than 2(in relation to the number of diseases).Don't worry.

Faith is important.If he has diagnosed all these, then he is giving you the correct treatment.And keep us informed also.regardsabhijeet",
