    "question": "I'm having gallbladder pain so the doctor put me on a very low fat to no fat diet, no meat, no nuts, no oils. Basically i can have plain grains, fruits and veggies. Yesterday i was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. In stressing out about the limitations on my diet and being healthy for the baby and myself. I'm 28 weeks and have lost 11 lbs in about 11 days since i started the low fat stuff. The nurse said that it was probably ok since I'm heavier. Any one else have any issues like this?",
