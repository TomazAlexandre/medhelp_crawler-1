            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for the question. Usually cause of RLS is unknown, but it is essential that you consult your treating doctor before decreasing or stopping the recommended dose. Other reasons of RLS could be rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, diabetes or any underlying heart disorder. The leg pain of RLS typically eases with movement of the legs and becomes more evident at rest. Therefore, medicine dosage is usually prescribed before going to bed. Though there is no permanent cure of RLS, it is advisable that you take regular & sound sleep to get relief from your symptoms. Supplements of iron or vitamin deficiency certainly help in elderly patients with RLS to ease out symptoms. Other medications such as levodopa, bromocriptine, oxycodone may be tried to provide some relive in your symptoms. If your previous medicines are causing RLS, then they can be stopped or reducing the doses after consulting your treating doctor may help to control symptoms. Hope this information proves helpful to you. Take Care & Regards!!!",

    "question": "I have had a twitch in my upper thigh, lower buttock for a month now. It only occurs at night, beginning between 9 and 10:45pm, and prevents me from getting to sleep. If I get to sleep before it begins, it wakes me up. I have posted before, and someone suggested to look at RLS (restless leg syndrome). I examined the symptoms associated with RLS, and do not believe this is the answer.I have tried stretching, heat pads, icy hot, spa, massage, electrolyte drinks, and vitamins. I have had blood work done and everything came back \"normal.\" The twitch occurs in the same exact spot every time, and generally continues until around 9am. I do not have any prior health conditions (that I am aware of), and am truly stumped here.Any suggestions are greatly appreciated, and I thank you ahead of time.",
