            "answer": "I do not know your lab ranges for T3 and T3. Doctors should be testing FreeT3 and FreeT4 anyway. Those are more accurate. Your cold-like symptoms could be directly related to the thyroid. If you could post any other tests like FT4/FT3 and TSH, then we can give you a better opinion.In the meantime, you really should see an endo, one who specializes in thryoid, not diabetes. Those nodules can be directly caused by thyroid disease as well.What medication do you take?:) Tamra",
