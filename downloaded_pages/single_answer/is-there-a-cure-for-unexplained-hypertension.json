            "answer": "Hi,Unfortunately, these so called lifestyle diseases like diabetes, hypertension can\u2019t be cured but only be treated/controlled. Hence, one needs to take adequate lifestyle measures and drugs to make sure the hypertension/high blood pressure remains under control. The lifestyle measures include daily walking, restricting the salt intake, avoiding salt rich foods like potato chips etc.In your case, I think you need to add another class of drugs to control your blood pressure as such a high pressure puts a lot of load on the heart which is not good and harm not only your heart but also the kidneys etc.Please consult your physician and make sure your blood pressure doesn\u2019t exceed 140/90 mmHg.I sincerely hope that helps.Please do keep me posted.Kind regards.",
