    "question": "I was in a relationship with a woman from August 2009 to mid-November 2009, during which we had unprotected sex 1-2 times a week. We both have HSV-2. She advised that she had previously had cervical cancer due to HPV but the cancerous cells were removed. About a month after we started having sex I developed urinary issues which I now believe were due to a kidney stone I finally passed in Mid-November. However, starting on 11/09/09 I had an irritation on the rim (or corona) of my penis, just on my left hand side. I had masturbated the ngiht before, but not roughly or \"vigorously\". It started as 2 red spots that were very sensitive to touch or to just rubbing my underwear while walking around. For about a week it was pretty painful. I used neosporin on it and seemed to help some with pain. However, it has continued to slowly spread. I also tried lotrimin for a week with no change. Presently it is not a sharp pain, more of a tingling sensation, and is not sensitive to the touch anymore, although it is discolored. There was never any fluid, and I have never had an HSV outbreak in this area. My GP, Urologist and Dermatologist have all said it does not look like HPV, and I have gotten negative results for HIV, Syphillis, Chlamydia, and Gonorrhea, as well as for Diabetes (due to possible thrush). Presently the dermatologist has me using OTC non-soap cleanser and OTC Aquaphor healing ointment since mid December. He also recently prescribed me Ellavil for nerve pain, and I have been taking 2 10 gram pills nightly since 1/18. However, this problem still persists. I have done a lot of research and was wondering if this could be a yeast infection.\u00a0\u00a0I am considering trying an OTC yeast infection treatment such as Monistat, since all I seem to be getting from the doctors is \"don't worry about it\" and OTC moisturizers which are having no effect. The dermatologist has a followup appt with me in March to see how things are but they are not getting any better. Any advice?",
