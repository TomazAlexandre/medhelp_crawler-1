    "question": "8 days ago I noticed that the tops of my feet started tingling after I took a deep breath. Since then the sensation has gone from tingling to more of an ache. The tops of my feet feel like they are bruised and it is noticeable when I walk, Just today they started to swell but only on top. What could be going on? Do I need to see a doctor ASAP?",
