            "answer": "Hi.Does the pain seem to be triggered by a normally not painful stimulus? Is there any trigger at all?The location of the pain seems pretty atypical if we are considering its relationship with the aneurysm. I am assuming that there were problems with specific limbs/extremities \u2013 both with sensation and movement before you had the operation, and then after the operation only the pain you are reporting persisted. If the pain is associated more with the ball of the foot (the opposite end of the toes) and the hip, then it may be anatomically related. It is possible that the surgery corrected the aneurysm, but nerve recovery was incomplete. Medications that favor a type of pain for nerve damage could be tried such as gabapentin and pregabalin \u2013 its best you discuss use of these with your doctor.Another scenario I am thinking about is the possibility that the regions involved are more arthritis related than nerve related. Some patients perform adaptive measures, change the manner in which they walk, perhaps limiting certain normal angles when there are deficits produced by disease. These changes tend to exert additional pressure on joints which could lead to arthritis. If this is the case \u2013 there should be some sign of damage such as swelling or changes seen on an X-ray.Other causes of nerve damage (not related to the aneurysm) such as diabetes could also be evaluated.I hope this post helps.My best to you and Merry Christmas.",
