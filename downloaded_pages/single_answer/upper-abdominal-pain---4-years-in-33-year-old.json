            "answer": "13% of gallbladder function is really low. The most common cause are gallstones or biliary sludge - a condensed bile from which gallstones may eventually appear through the time. Ultrasound often miss both conditions, CT or MRI show them better but still not 100%. Even, when there are no gallstones or sludge, \"biliary dyskinesia or Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction\" (SOD) may be the cause of yor pain. Gastroenterologist should explain you results of HIDA, and what are your options. If the problem is gallbladder emptying, gallbladder removal would be a solution. But if the problem is in the main biliary duct, gallbladder removal wouldn't help. You just need to get exact explanation of HIDA. Other tests of biliary tree are available, if necessary (ERCP, manometry of sphincter of Oddi).Kidney stones may be seen much more clear with an x-ray. Often, specific substances can be found by urine test. Vomiting which releaves your pain, speaks against kidney stones.Another (additional) issue may be H. pylori infection of your stomach. Symptoms may be: burping, heartburn, bloating, early satiety. You may want to have a breath test to exclude/confirm H. pylori. Treatment is with antinbiotics.",
