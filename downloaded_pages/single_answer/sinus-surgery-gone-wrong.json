            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth, dental caries, etc\u00a0\u00a0can all cause facial numbness and pain. They can also cause ear numbness that spreads to face. Hemi facial numbness is also seen in Bell\u2019s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia where a spasm may cause numbness, or due to acoustic neuroma which is a benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve.Since it started after a sinus surgery, nerve conduction tests should be done. Under go a dental examination. Tests should be done for vit B12 deficiency and diabetes.Take care!",

    "question": "Over a year ago I had sinus surgery. During the surgery the doctor messed up and scraped my brain. I have been given Nortriptyline to help with the pain in my head. Since the accident I keep having different parts of my body going numb. My neurologist has run every kind of test imaginable and the only thing he has come up with is that I have tendonitis in both arms, though I never had a problem prior to the injury and I don't do anything repetitive.I also get electrical shocks in my scalp if I move my baseball cap in certain ways. It has been getting progressively worse with half my face starting to go numb. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
