    "question": "My mom has type 2 diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0along with many other health problems, including lung cancer. We've grown familiar with the problems of high blood sugar immediately after chemo, but she recently developed a severe sinus infection and since has had very high spikes in blood sugar. The doctors has had her on an insulin pump, but even so, her sugar goes up to 530. She also has kidney disease. My question is will her blood sugar go back down after the sinus infection is under control?This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/415182\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/415182</a>.",
