            "answer": "Your weight is within the recommended range for your height and glad to hear you do not have diabetes. Suggest a snack (protein and carbohydrate, ex: low fat yogurt with 2-3 cracker) around 8 pm to see if that helps you at night. Try to eat a Heart Healthy diet which will give you the nutrients, vitamins and minerals your body needs, and help with possibly preventing future disease states. Heart Healthy diet which is a moderate fat diet which\u00a0\u00a0means = using polyunsaturated (omega 3, corn oil, nuts, etc) fats and monounsaturated (olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, etc) fats, no saturated fats (high fat snack foods, butter, fat spreads) and no trans fats. Eat low fat meats (chicken, fish, loin of pork) or non-meat sources (soy products, nuts), low fat vegetarian combinations (rice & beans, pasta & beans, low fat cheese & pasta), low fat and substitute dairy products (1% milk, low fat/fat free yogurts, low fat soy milk/soy yogurt), use plant oils, non trans-fat margarines, and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. Eat daily high fiber breads and cereals (oatmeal). Hoped this helped you.",

    "question": "I was given a 3 hr glucose tolerance test and my results were:GLUCOSE FASTING 70-100 mg/dL 90GLUCOSE 1 HR 70-190 mg/dL 155GLUCOSE 2 HR 70-165 mg/dL 57 LGLUCOSE 3 HR 70-145 mg/dL 120My main issue is waking about 3 am from vivid dreams or nightmares with continuos adrenaline rushes, It starts between 2-3 am and will continue until morning. This is the original reason my doc wanted to do the test because he thought these attacks had something to do with low blood sugar since they never happend during the day and i'm not anxious or depressed. I don't have diabetes.My questions are:1. Do you feel the atkins type diet is best nutritionally for my situation?2. What are the best and worst things/times to eat before bed in this situation?Thanks!",
