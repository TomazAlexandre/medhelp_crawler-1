    "question": "Hello, my mother in law has been through a ton of health scares in her life. She survived breast cancer 20 yrs ago..... chain smoked up to 2-3 packs a day for probably 35 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0About 7 yrs. ago she had kidney problems and went to the ER and they noticed her heart was terrible.\u00a0\u00a0She ended up having a quadruple bypass.\u00a0\u00a0She quit smoking cold turkey.\u00a0\u00a0The past 1 1/2 yrs she has been in terrible shape.\u00a0\u00a0She has literally died 3 times, has had 4 heart attacks.\u00a0\u00a0They finally diagnosed her with COPD and CHF (She has also been a diabetic for a few years).\u00a0\u00a0This last exacerbation she experienced was a doozy.\u00a0\u00a0She was in a med induced coma for a couple days, life support ect.\u00a0\u00a0They had to do hypothermic therapy on her to preserve brain function.\u00a0\u00a0She baffled Dr.'s and nurses and is awake, alert, eating, can get out of her hospital bed and into recliner.\u00a0\u00a0What happens is scary.\u00a0\u00a0She will be fine....feeling \"normal\" and all of the sudden out of the blue, she can't breathe (at home).\u00a0\u00a0She has been picked up from her home by ambulance about 4 times in the past 4 months....in and out of hospitals and nursing homes.\u00a0\u00a0She now lives in a state of total anxiety because she never knows when it will hit.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering how much more this woman can handle.\u00a0\u00a0Dr's and nurses are (I think) afraid to tell us their opinion...their job is to give us hope and that's great....but watching her constantly go through this is heart wrenching.\u00a0\u00a0How many heart attacks can someone handle?",
