    "question": "So randomly throughout the day, I get this weird numb feeling through out my body. I feel like my body is all jumpy. It last for a long while. I talked to my doctor about it and his exact words were \"you got me. I don't know.\" Then explained it might be my sugar getting low. At 27 weeks, I think, I took a diabetes test to see if I was diabetic. It came back normal. But now my doctor is saying my sugar could be getting low?\u00a0\u00a0Anyone else been in this situation?\u00a0\u00a0Ill be 35 weeks tomorrow.",
