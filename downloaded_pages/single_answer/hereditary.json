    "question": "My nan died in March, she had Milo Fibrosis which (from what i know) is a rare form of Leukemia. She had very low blood pressure and Iron Deficiency anemia and (probably unrelated) Diabetes.I've just been told that i have Iron Deficiency Anemia and also have a very low blood pressure (82/55). Due to the similarities, im just wondering if Milo Fibrosis is related to Anemia or low blood pressure and if it is hereditary.I know my mum doesnt want me to know alot about my nans illness because of the similarities and probably doesnt want to worry me but contrary to her intentions, i am worried.Help would be much appreciated x",
