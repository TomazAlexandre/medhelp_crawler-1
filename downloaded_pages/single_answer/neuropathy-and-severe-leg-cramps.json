            "answer": "Thank you very much for your question; although it is quite hard for me to give you a precise opinion here without being able to examine you, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From your description of symptoms, it seems that it could be a nerve irritation of back or could be any neurological disorder due to any underlying disease like diabetes. People who work for long periods of sitting or standing (wearing high boots) jobs, do a lot of traveling or do heavy labour work are at a greater risk for low back or disc problems. By the reason of that nerves from the spinal cord can be irritated causing leg pain and numbness, tingling, or weakness in the leg. Another possibility could be an underlying disorder like diabetes or alcohol abuse that may result in neuropathy (nerve pain like numbness and tingling at affected areas and sometimes blurred vision due to retinopathy). If you suffer continuous weakness and notice reduced strength of muscle bulk in leg, please arrange an appointment with a neurologist right away who may differentiate in both the possibilities first. These \u201cred flags\u201d could be indicative of compression of the spinal cord and its nerve branches and early treatment is essential if permanent damage needs to be avoided. Further referral to a physiotherapist for spinal exercises could be beneficial and may produce relief of symptoms. Hope this help. Take Care & Stay Healthy!!!",

    "question": "I have neuropathy and had it for years now and a few years ago I had these pains that would show up as a cramp in the arch of left foot and this cramp would be so sensitive that I could not even touch it, I would get this pain traveling up my leg to my knee or higher and it felt as if I was pulling on something in the arch and it was pulling down right from the knee. I got this now and then for a few hours preventing me from wearing my work boots and going to work but it would last a few hours or so and be gone, Have not worked in nearly 3 years now and suddenly I have it again, got it three days ago and was really bad, made every step hurt like heck, the next day I could not walk and third day (today) is like first day.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone know what it is, why it feels like a muscle being pulled out of my knee to my arch and what causes it?Thanks, any reply will help me I am sure.",
