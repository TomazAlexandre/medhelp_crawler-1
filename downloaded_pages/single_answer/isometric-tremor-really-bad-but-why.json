They seem to run more tests than regular doctors ( as they love a new challenge ) and they actually sit down with you afterwards to let you know of the findings, the cures, ( or the lack of ) the causes, etc.I pray that someone else on the forum who has been through this/going through this, can help and support you more.",

    "question": "My 20 year old son started at age of 15 right before he was diagnosed with his 3rd ( he had graves which turned into hashimotos, type 1 diabetes and addisons) autoimmune disease Addisons disease starting to get shaky muscles. It started in his tummy muscles when he'd sit up, then it went to legs so say he is holding a squatting postilion he shakes really bad, lil by little it went higher to his arms if hed\u00a0\u00a0pick up anything heavy now its as simple as a milk gallon, then it went to his neck, jaw and tongue, If he sticks out his tongue it shakes like crazy, if he stretches his muscles or flexes it also does it but walking or standing still nothing. He has been to 4 or 5 drs for it and noone can figure it out all MRIs CTs blood work are fine. My youngest at 15 also before diagnosis with Addisons disease started the same thing but it never traveled to other parts its still only in his legs. All the specialists say they have never seen anything like it before. So I found this group and im hoping to find some answers he cant be the only one with this. Any thoughts please, oh I will add its not any meds that cause it I know thats first thing people usually ask me. Thanks",
