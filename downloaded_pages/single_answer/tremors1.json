            "answer": "Hi,A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is often a warning sign that a person is at risk for a more serious and debilitating stroke. Some of the symptoms your husband is experiencing are manifestations of a TIA. Statistically, about one-third of those who have a TIA will have an acute stroke some time in the future.Many strokes can be prevented by giving importance to the TIAs and treating underlying risk factors. The most important treatable factors linked to TIAs and stroke are high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, heart disease, carotid artery disease, diabetes, and heavy use of alcohol. It is good that medications are now available to reduce and eliminate these factors. Lifestyle changes such as eating a balanced diet, maintaining healthy weight, exercising, and smoking and alcohol cessation\u00a0\u00a0can also help. It would be best for your husband to consult his doctor for proper evaluation and management.Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I am not positive that my husband is even having TIA's, but it looks like them.\u00a0\u00a0He has been hospitalized several times and once came out with the diagnosis of Hypertensive Encephalopathy. He is on many blood pressure meds now, but continues to have episodes.\u00a0\u00a0He will not seek help or see a doctor, so this is why I am writing.\u00a0\u00a0He seems to have a fairly steady, slight tremor, in the upper half of his body.\u00a0\u00a0I feel it most often in his arms.He has episodes where his vision is unfocused, speech is slurred, he loses balance, his tremors increase with intentional movement, and he does not remember the episode afterwards. He basically looks drunk with the exception of the tremor.\u00a0\u00a0He sleeps after them for quite a while.\u00a0\u00a0The onset of the episode seems to happen when he is tired and resting..or has just awakened from rest.\u00a0\u00a0 Is there anyone out there that recognizes these symptoms and could lead me in a direction that might assist me in getting him to see a doctor.",
