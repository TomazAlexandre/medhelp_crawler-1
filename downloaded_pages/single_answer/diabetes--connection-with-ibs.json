    "question": "I have had several colonoscopies and some polyps removed and the family history as well with both parents---father with a dozen inches taken from (& living, five years ago-operation a success) plus maternal unit had diverticuliar clean out; I am now having issues with ails: swelling above eyes, hands & feet, liver enzymes were a tad up with AST & ALT, with serum glucose 101 and quite nervy ... w/weak limbs & numbing hands, as a middle aged woman. Could this be the onset of Diabetes-2? My just passed maternal grandma had it for 45 years but maintained well with insulin. Any pointers?",
