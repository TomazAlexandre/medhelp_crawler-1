            "answer": "Hi, this is a very good question you have asked. Various studies have done in the past to find out the co-relation between these two. It is well known that in longstanding and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus angiopathy is more common and severe. Experimental studies have shown that decreased blood flow in the shoulders facilitates and precipitates the calcification of the surrounding tendons. In addition, studies in tissue cultures and in cultures of fibroblasts from diabetics have shown that insulin deficiency inhibits collagen synthesis as well as producing an early senescence of fibroblasts, mechanisms which may contribute to calcification of the connective tissue. I hope this helps.",
