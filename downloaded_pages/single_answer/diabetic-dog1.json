Last night and today, he is not himself.He seem to have his eyesight affected more than usual, his eyesight was compromised before, but seems to have gotten worse in the last 2 days. He reacts like he is pain when I try to pick him up under the right shoulder. He is a large chihuahua. We lost his mom to pancreatitus 2 years ago and he was treated for the same disese several months ago. We didn't think he would make it and he remarkably pulled through.What could be causing this and what can I do?",
