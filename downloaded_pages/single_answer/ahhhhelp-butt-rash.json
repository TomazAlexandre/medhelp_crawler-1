    "question": "i woke up with a bump on my left butt cheek. it itched. then it seemed fine.. then the next morning i woke up itching again. this time it's two bumps on the top of my butt cheek by my crack. then i just kept itching and itching now my left butt cheek is about 3 inches of tiny red bumps but i've itched so much that its raised almost like a platform or something. and i have bumps also lining my buttcrack. where the first bump was now there is a small bruise. i started out thinking this was a spider bite.. but why would it cause a rash and spread.. i'm not sexually active so it couldn't be an std right? i sit alot.. does it have to do with sitting down too much? or maybe heat rash. ahhhhhh.. i've also changed laundry detergents.. but why would it only affect my butt? i could change my bedding.. but then again.. i don't sleep naked.. so how would that affect my butt? my last conclusion is that my dog just had fleas.. and my friends cats had fleas.. could these be flea bites? do flea bites itch? what is going on with me and why do i have a rash on my rear.. if anyone has any insight.. please feel free to comment!!!! :) i'd really appreciate it!",
