            "answer": "The chance of your being affected in that medical situation is so low it is not worth worrying about. I do not believe you are more at risk because of your diabetes either. As I understand it, if you get a cut, it would be harder to heal because of diabetes. But it doesn't make HCV more likely.With all due respect, it may be helpful to speak to a psychologist or psychiatrist and get a handle on the hypochondiasis so yo can live your life more comfortably. Most of the things we worry about never happen.",

    "question": "Hello, I have a sort of two fold problem. One is type 2 diabetes and the other is extreme health anxiety. I got a colonoscopy about a month ago, and my blood sugar was 168 the night before the procedure, and it was 201 the first thing in the morning at 6 am. My BS went up quite a bit when I woke up in the morning. My procedure was at about 9 to 10 am, so I believe it probably dropped before the procedure. My fear is the possibility of infection by getting a colonoscopy and endoscopy. Mainly hepatitis c because that is the infection that I have read about regarding contaminated equipment or reused syringes. I read no cases about HIV being transmitted through a colonoscopy so I am not worried about that. Basically, I read online about rare cases where people were infected by HCV during procedures, and now I am worried it may have happened to me. I am extra worried because of my high blood sugar during the procedure. I know that infection is more likely in a diabetic. However, I am sure a lot of other diabetics have received these procedures with less than optimal BS numbers and were fine. I shared my infection concerns with my doctor, and he assured me that they take infection control very seriously and the places that infected people were doing dumb things. He also said they had a special team dedicated to cleaning the equipment. They asked me right before the procedure what my blood sugar was, and I said 160 because I was thinking about the night before and I was very anxious. I did not give them a completely accurate blood sugar, which was 201 that morning. I have been a type 2 diabetic since I was 21, and now I am 24. Sorry for the rant, I am trying to give an accurate portrayal of my situation. In summation, I read articles about HCV infection during colonoscopy/endoscopy, and now I am freaked out that it is possible it has happened to me because I am more prone to infection since I am Diabetic. This hypochondria is a huge burden on me because I am aware of the long term complications of type 2 Diabetes, and it makes it a lot harder to concentrate on taking care of myself. Please, I would really appreciate some input into my situation. Thank you.",
