            "answer": "If I were you I'd fire this doctor as he/she is not interested taking care of your health. I would go to where the experts practice and teach medicine. Your bio says Passaic, NJ so The University Hospital in Newark, Gastroenterology dept. is the place to go. At least you'll know someone in that hospital complex knows the right cure/treatment for you. Good luck.",

    "question": "I have had 2 urine screens done recently and a blood work up because I just don't feel right. I keep being told I am fine but I feel sick! The dr seem to be ignoring the fact that I have had protein in my urine, low specific gravity, low creatinine, positive nitrites and \"many\" bacteria in my urine as well as low lymphs in my blood. while all the other results are with \"normal range\" they are all on the low end of normal. I have a lot of pain in my back and shoulders, my stomach has swollen up and gotten rock hard although it has returned to normal with mild discomfort. I am extremely tired and have had a nagging headache. Please help me understand what is happening and how to get a doctor to take my complaints seriously. I also had a VERY heavy menstrual cycle. I am 31 yrs old and have had diabetes in the past which has been treated with oral medications and during pregnancy with insulin. I am also a lap band patient.",
