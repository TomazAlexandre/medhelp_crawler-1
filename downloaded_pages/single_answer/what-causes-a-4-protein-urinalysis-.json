    "question": "I am 24 years old, in good health aside from muscle/nerve damage from a car accident last year. I went to the doctor this morning concerned I had a UTI and my urinalysis showed a 4 (as far as his dip stick would read) in protein. I tested positive for nitrates, but he said there weren't enough there for him to think it would cause a UTI or give me discomfort. I don't understand why I have that much protein in my urine though or what might be causing it? Would my cortisone shots have anything to do with it? My doctor just sounded very concerned and somehow grim and I'm just scared now. Please help if you have any knowledge or advice on this topic.",
