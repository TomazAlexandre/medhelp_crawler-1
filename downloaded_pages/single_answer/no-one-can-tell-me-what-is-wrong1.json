            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Tinnitus (ringing and sounds in ear) and certain neurological disorders such as paresthesia (caused by diabetes, pinched nerves, Lyme\u2019s, lupus, thyroid disorders etc) and central neuropathic pain are similar in many ways. So, if you have any of the above conditions or central neuropathic pain then you can have pins and tingling and tinnitus with it.It is generally treated with anti-depressants or anti-epileptic drugs along with vitamin supplements. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I am 58 year old male in good shape. 4 years ago, I had rotator cuff surgery and became sick and somehow developed allergies which I did not have before the surgery. Two years later I had rotator cuff surgery on my other shoulder and after that, I started feeling like I was stepping on marbles in both feet. Now, that sensation has become pins and needles and burning sensations on my skin throughout my body and ringing in my ears. My skin in my forearms and neck has turned blotchy red with no pain or itching over time. I have seen the best doctors at Boston hospitals, including neurologists, spine specialist, hematologists, rheumatologists, etc. and I tried alternative medicine and no answers and I am just getting worse. I know that if I am near an allergic situation (ex. dog) my pins needles and burning reactions become much worse. No allergist can tell me about a nervous system/allergy connection. Oddly, I also note that most nights I can sleep and I don't understand why. I do know histamine is involved in the sleep/wake cycle, turning off at sleep and turning back on for waking.Benadryl is of some help, but the others like Claritin do nothing. Also, one doctor had me try cymbalta, which made things much worse. Has anyone out there experienced anything like this? I plan on going to the MAYO clinic to try and get an answer.Thanks for any info-",
