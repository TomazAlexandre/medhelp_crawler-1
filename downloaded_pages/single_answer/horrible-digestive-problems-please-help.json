            "answer": "Hi!Well, most causes of severe nausea, indigestion, GERD, bloating/gas, sometimes mild epigastric discomfort have been investigated in your case. Food intolerance, IBS, Crohn's and celiac disease should also be investigated.Many a times AST (SGOT) and ALT OR SGPT (both are collectively called transaminases) rise without any cause. Because AST is found in many other organs besides the liver, including the kidneys, the muscles, and the heart, having a high level of AST does not always (but often does) indicate that there is a liver problem. For example, even vigorous exercise may elevate AST levels in the body. However to reach at that conclusion the medical causes of these raised transaminases have to be ruled out. Causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. Steatosis and cirrhosis are ruled out by the ultrasound. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia and thyroid disease, can also cause liver transaminase elevations. Most liver diseases are characterized by greater ALT elevations than AST elevations except cirrohsis and alcohol abuse. ALT also rises in bile duct obstruction due to stone.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please discuss with your treating doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been suffering with GI problems for two years. Symptoms: Severe nausea,indigestion, GERD, bloating/gas, sometimes mild epigastric discomfort. I have been on priolsec then protonix a year in a half now. (does not help GERD) Anyways I have had and upper GI, Ultrasounds, CT scan, xrays all coming back negative. I had a HIDA scan about 5 weeks ago which my gallbaldder didnt show so aI had it removed. The surgery relvleaved chronic gallbladder disease/extensive gallbaldder adhesions which were removed. A week before the surgery I had a EGD. Negative for H-Pylori, hernia, ulcers, or bleeding. Biospy shows mild gastritis and excessive stromal fibrosis. I didnt feel better after gallbladder removal. I had some blood testing about\u00a0\u00a0two weeks ago showing high WBC and low RBC along with two elvated liver enzymes AST and ALT. Never had that problem before. My question is what do those elevated ezymes mean? Why isnt the acid reducers working? What are the possible causes of my gastrtis?",
