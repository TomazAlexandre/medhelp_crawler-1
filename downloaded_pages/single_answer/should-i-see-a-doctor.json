            "answer": "Hi,Your general anxiety level from your talk appears to be high.This could be one of the reasons and important one for your twitching. There are other causes for twitching including BFS.Your symptoms could be suggesting a benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) which is a diagnosis of exclusion and it is recognized by twitching of various voluntary muscles in the body. The twitching is most common in the eyelids, arms, legs, and feet.In addition to twitching, patients with BFS often experience pain, paraesthesia, generalized fatigue, exercise intolerance and/or muscle cramping. Another common feature is an increase in the patient's level of anxiety, especially health-related anxiety.Other likely causes are motor neuron diseases such as ALS, MS etc must be eliminated before BFS can be assumed.An important diagnostic tool here is the electromyography (EMG). If EMG is reported normal, than a diagnosis of BFS can be made.MS has definitive criteria to diagnose, if satisfied then a definitive diagnosis is made.MRI is diagnostic tool for MS.Have you got any endocrine problem?Did you meet neurologist? If not I think you should consult a neurologist at earliest and decide regarding further course of action.Hope this helps you.Bye.",
