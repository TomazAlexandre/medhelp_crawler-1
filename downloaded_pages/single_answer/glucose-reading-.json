            "answer": "Are you going to an endocronologist?\u00a0\u00a0That is a doctor that specializes in the endocrine system.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure wether you got diagnosed as diabetic or not?\u00a0\u00a0Have you had a fasting glucose test?\u00a0\u00a0I mean specific bloodwork done.\u00a0\u00a0I think you might need to have that done first before you get worried.\u00a0\u00a0Using your grandmother's glucometer can help you get an indication if your blood sugars are high--but again you need the bloodwork done in order to get true results and a diagnosis from a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0When you test with your grandmother's glucometer you have to remember her meter could run the numbers a little high or low. AND make sure your hands are clean(wash them before you test) because if there is any residual sugar on them it will effect the test.",
