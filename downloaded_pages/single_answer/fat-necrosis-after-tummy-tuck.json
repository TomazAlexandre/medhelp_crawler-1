    "question": "I am 6 weeks post-op after full tummy tuck with muscle repair.\u00a0\u00a0At 4 weeks PO a hole developed along my incision line.\u00a0\u00a0My surgeon's nurse had me pack it with gauze/saline twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0At 5 weeks a second smaller hole started. I saw the surgeon at 6 weeks (3 days ago) & he was quite surprised at what he saw.\u00a0\u00a0I have never smoked, no diabetes & not overweight.\u00a0\u00a0In his office/exam room he numbed my stomach & debrided the wounds, which he told me was right down to the muscle.\u00a0\u00a0He told me it was fat necrosis.\u00a0\u00a0He then stitched up the holes.\u00a0\u00a0He told me there was a 50% chance that it will work, but it may re-open.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound accurate?\u00a0\u00a0How long will it be before I will know if it worked?\u00a0\u00a0Can the necrosis spread?\u00a0\u00a0Between the two holes that were stitched the skin looks red & puffy & there is one tiny spot where some fluid was coming out this morning.\u00a0\u00a0I am not scheduled to see him again for a week & am supposed to return to work tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0Can you offer your opinion on this?\u00a0\u00a0I feel like this will never end.",
