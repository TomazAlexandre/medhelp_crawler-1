            "answer": "I don't believe a one-time craniectomy or craniotomy is the type of head trauma that is associated with later dementia.\u00a0\u00a0Rather, it is blows to the head, especially those of a type that cause the brain to impact on the interior of the skull and very especially those that cause the brain to bounce back and forth within the skull (\"contre-coup\"), that raise the risk for dementia.The Mayo Clinic website has a good presentation on dementia, including risk factors.\u00a0\u00a0(Go to their site and click on Patient Care and Info, then click on Dementia, then click on Risk Factors.)\u00a0\u00a0Risk factors that are potentially within your control include excessive alcohol use, atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, depression, diabetes, high estrogen levels, high homocysteine levels, obesity, and smoking.I invite you to ask your own doctors whether your medical history puts you at higher risk than the average person for dementia.\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe that it does, but even if I'm wrong, there's nothing you can do to change the fact that you had the angioma and the brain surgery.\u00a0\u00a0There's no point in worrying about what's in the past.\u00a0\u00a0All you can do is address the other risk factors, the same ones that apply to all of us, and that should help a lot.I personally know someone who has had three brain aneurysm surgeries and is now in her mid-60's and doing fine.\u00a0\u00a0She is an advanced practice nurse who still works full time and is functioning at a high level.\u00a0\u00a0She has no dementia.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, you will do well also.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "Some time ago I underwent surgery for the removal of a cavernous angioma located in the right parietal lobe. The malformation was in an accessible spot so the procedure was relatively minor (as far as brain surgery goes). However, I am concerned that having undergoing surgery, as well as having previous angioma, has put me at a higher risk of developing dementia or Alzheimer's in the future. Is this a legitimate concern? And if so is there any thing I can do to reduce my risk despite past head trauma?Thank you for your feedback.",
