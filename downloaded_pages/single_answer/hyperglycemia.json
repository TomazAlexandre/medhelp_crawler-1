    "question": "I just had my second baby 2 mon ago. I had gestational diabetes with both of my pregnencies.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 27, 5'5 and 115 lbs with no family history of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I've still been having random bloood sugars of 230.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to have nothing to do with what I eat.\u00a0\u00a0If I don't eat my meals at a regular time I'm shaking, I can't think, and when I check my sugars they aren't always low.\u00a0\u00a0Things are just really weird, I am seeing an endocinalogist mar 16, so I just want to hear what people think.\u00a0\u00a0This all seems so strange, for example I had a fasting bs of 150, but I was so hungry I had to eat, I had some pizza and checked it 1 hour later and it was 90.\u00a0\u00a0Is that normal. I also work out at least 1 hour everyday.Thanks Justina",
