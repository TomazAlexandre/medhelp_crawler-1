    "question": "Hi. I'm new here and I hope I'm posting this question in the correct forum. I had my annual check-up last week, mentioned that I wanted my iron tested because I was always tired, etc.. The office nurse called me today and said that everything was okay w/the lab results except that the blood glucose test result was 54. She then asked if I had fasted before the appointment, which I had not. In fact, I had eaten breakfast no more than 2 hours before. I'm always tired, sometimes \"bottoming out\", get blurred vision at times, and sometimes feel faint. Do the #54 and the other symptoms indicate hypoglycemia and is that the same as having Diabetes? I am following up with a primary care physician, but also want to get as much information as possible in the meantime. Thanks!",
