            "answer": "I am sorry to hear that. maybe you are trying to hard. if you are married maybe it is you are afraid of being caught by your wife. if this is the case then find time when you are alone, dont watch pron, and try slow strokes to alow your body to relax. also one technique that never fails is, drop down to your underwear, it works best with briefs, and lay down on a soft surface like a bed. Simulate humping on the surface while driving your privates into the bed with your pelvis. It feels so good and works allways.try these to sites to help with techniques or maybe find some info about yor problem, both have great help for males:http://advancedmasturbation.com/http://www.jackinworld.com/",
