            "answer": "Thank you very much for your question; although it is quite hard for me to give you a precise opinion here without being able to examine you, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern. From your description of symptoms, it sounds that it could be a nerve irritation of back or could be any neurological disorder due to any underlying disease like diabetes. People who work for long periods of sitting or standing jobs or do heavy labour work are at a greater risk for low back or disc problems. By the reason of that nerves from the spinal cord can be irritated causing leg pain and numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs or knee. Few persons also face generalized body weakness and numbness due to other nerve irritation on back. Another possibility could be an underlying disorder like diabetes or alcohol abuse that may result in neuropathy (nerve pain like numbness and tingling at affected areas). If you suffer continuous weakness and notice reduced strength of muscle bulk in left leg, please arrange an appointment with your doctor right away. These \u201cred flags\u201d could be indicative of compression of the spinal cord and its nerve branches and early treatment is essential if permanent damage needs to be avoided. Further referral to a physiotherapist for spinal exercises could be beneficial and may produce relief of symptoms. Hope this help. Take Care & Stay Healthy!!!",
