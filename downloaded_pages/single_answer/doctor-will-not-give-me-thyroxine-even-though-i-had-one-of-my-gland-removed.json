    "question": "Hello , I am 70 years old , I suffer from High Blood Pressure, Diabetes Osteropetrois . A few years ago i had my thyroxid Gland removed because it was overactive. Ever since i have not been given any thyroid medications and have been suffering from bittle bones and have a tendency to fall . I am curious as to why my doctor didnt feel the need to prescibe my thyroxine.. Also i have Osterposis which makes it hard to do daily tasks - My doctor has recieved several otifications to send me to an Osteropath but he refuses to send me . Please help",
