    "question": "I was making a grilled cheese sandwich when my vision blurred. I took my glasses off and covered my left eye, my right eye had only a small circle of vision in the center surrounded by a blurry white cloud, this lasted 2 or 3 minutes, then vision returned starting at the top and receding to the inside corner of the eye.
