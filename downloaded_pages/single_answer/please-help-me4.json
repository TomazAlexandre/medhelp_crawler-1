            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There is a strong possibility you have gastric reflux or even hiatal hernia. Both can cause repeated reflux of acid into the throat and spoil the taste of the mouth. It can also be due to slowing of the stomach or gastric paresis which is seen in diabetes and hypothyroidism. IBS and food intolerance too should be looked into. Avoid heavy meals. Take small frequent meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Go to bed at least 2 hours after food. Follow this routine until you meet the GI doctor.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 41 tr old woman, who for the past 7 months, has been plagued with what started out as a strange/bitter taste in my mouth. This is constant and never goes away. After that began, I began having nausea and vomiting episodes. A feeling of fullness never leaves me and now I am ALWAYS sick. I have began to have a problem with excess saliva. The more I produce and have to swallow, the sicker I get, until finally, I am forced to vomit, but only a watery liquid that literally pours out of my mouth. Very rarely is it ever food. That may be attributed to the fact that I dont eat much because the taste, and smell is horrible. I have had blood tests, that showed an underactive thyroid, and the liver enzymes were off just a bit. I then had an abdominal ultrasound that showed slight liver enlargement. After that I had an abdominal CT scan which I was told came back normal. I was prescribed Acifex which I took for over a month, with no results at all. I have an appointment on Monday with a GI specialist. I think sometimes I sound crazy when I try to explain what is happening to me. Is it the nasty taste that I have to swallow that is making me sick? I try to spit it out as much as possible.\u00a0\u00a0I am usually \"okay\" for a few hours after getting up, then sick\u00a0\u00a0the rest of the day.\u00a0\u00a0I am a tired, nauseated, spitting, vomiting freak!!!\u00a0\u00a0My poor husband..he feels so bad, but does everything he can to help me. I am afraid I am going to have to do this the rest of my life.. Can someone help or offer any advice?",
