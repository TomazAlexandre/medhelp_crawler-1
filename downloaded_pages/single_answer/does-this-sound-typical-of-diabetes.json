    "question": "I'm 20 and in my final year of university. Last week I began to have this constant feeling of thirst which only seems to have gotten worse. I am now feeling lightheaded and can feel a kind of buzzing/tinglig sensation in my feet. I'm not overweight but lately have been drinking a fair amount. The only symptoms I can think of having before this is that for the last few years I feel very ill and weak if I skip meals, sort of like I have low blood sugar, although this could be normalDoes this sound typical of diabetes? I'm planning on going to doctors asap but can't on weekend and is starting to worry me, thanks for reading",
