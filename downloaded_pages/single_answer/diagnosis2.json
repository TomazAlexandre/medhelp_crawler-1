            "answer": "Hi!If the blood volumes are persisting low, then increase fluid intake and see. It can also be due to pancytopenia, hence peripheral blood count should be done along with packed cell volume. It\u00a0\u00a0can be due to persistent bleeding from gut due to varied causes, and hence an occult or hidden blood in stool test should be done. You could be having a tendency to low volume, but it cannot be so low physiologically. Diabetes insipidus should also be ruled out.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
