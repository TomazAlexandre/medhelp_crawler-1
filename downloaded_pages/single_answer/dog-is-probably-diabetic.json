            "answer": "Yes, most diabetic dogs require insulin. Since he is overweight, weight loss will probably change the insulin level required and in some rare cases the insulin can be discontinued, although I have only seen this happen in cats.The best diet for a diabetic dog a no-grain, very low to no carbohydrate diet.\u00a0\u00a0The hills prescription diet you have listed is also good and it would probably be OK for your other dogs as long as they don't require their own prescription diets for other issues.Please take him to the vet ASAP to get him on appropriate treatment and to try to prevent comorbidities such as cataracts.",

    "question": "the last few days my dog has been acting somewhat quiet, unactive - just not himself.\u00a0\u00a0when he drinks he drinks a large quantity (over the past few days) and urinated in the house yesterday morning.\u00a0\u00a0before this i noticed nothing unusual with him. this is all within the last 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0growing up with a diabetic dog in the late 1980's i immediatly thought of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0i went to the local pharmacy and purchased clinistix urine strips and tested his urine.\u00a0\u00a0it came out very positive.\u00a0\u00a0as a control (to see if these strips are accurate for dogs) i checked the urine of my beagle/shih tzu mix and his test came back normal. i am now pretty certain that he has high glucose in his urine.\u00a0\u00a0i took the urine to my vet and dropped it off and they are sending it to the lab and we will have results tomorrow morning.\u00a0\u00a0they wouldn't test the urine with a test strip in the office and said it is more accurate to send it to the lab.\u00a0\u00a0within the last couple of hours my dog is acting more like himself (normal).\u00a0\u00a0** if my dog is diabetic does that for sure mean he will need insulin?\u00a0\u00a0**could he have had this for a long time and not had any symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0**can my other 2 dogs who are the same age eat the same dog food, for example, Hill's Prescription Diet\u00aew/d\u00ae Canine Low Fat-Diabetic-Gastrointestinal dog food (if my dog is diabeic)?\u00a0\u00a0right now they all eat senior canidae.\u00a0\u00a0we leave the bowl full at all times and they eat as they are hungry.\u00a0\u00a0**Would we still be able to feed them in that matter?my possible diabetic dog is overweight and has pretty much been most of his adult life.\u00a0\u00a0he is pretty active though and full of personality - up until 3 days ago.\u00a0\u00a0my father tends to give them some table food (which i know is bad) and he will stop doing that.\u00a0\u00a0thanks...",
