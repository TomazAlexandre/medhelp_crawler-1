            "answer": "Hi!If the disc problems have not worsened in the last few years, then you need to look at other possibilities. One possibility is definitely compression of spinal nerves up high up in cervical spine. This could be made worse by Vit B12 deficiency, anemia, vaso-vagal attack, multiple sclerosis, hypothyroidism, diabetes and panic attack. Do discuss this with your husband\u2019s doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
