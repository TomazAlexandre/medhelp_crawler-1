    "question": "I'm a 35 year-old male overweight (was about 303lbs now 280lbs) with type 2 diabetes (in the range of 150 - 200), Hypertension and Gallstones. In June of 2010 I developed indigestion, diarrhea and an ache/burning/gnawing across my abdomen mainly on the towards the left all of this along with night sweets lasted for approximately 4 - 5 weeks. All symptoms except for the slight indigestion and gnawing in my stomach have subsided. Went to GI and had Upper and Lower Endoscopy done - Lower came out clean no issues - Upper showed signs of gastritis, with beginning stages of hiatal hernia again no major worries. Reading countless medical sites, posts discussions and blogs and seeing similarities between diabetes, diarrhea, not to mention i've lost about 20 pounds in this time (granted I've cut out everything except veggies) - my mind and fears took the best of me. Went back to the the GI with thoughts of Pancreatic Cancer - GI felt I was\u00a0\u00a0fine and did not think I had PC but felt we needed to reassure my nerves do he took blood work and scheduled me for MRI.Blood Results First:Glucose: 183 High - Normal 70 -99mg/dlTotal Bilirubin: 1.0\u00a0\u00a0- Normal 0.2 - 1.2mg/DLAmylase: 36 - Normal 25 - 125mg/dlLipase: 34 - Normal 7 -60 mg/dlAST (SGOT): 21 - Normal 10 - 40U/LALT(SGPT): 42 - Normal 10 - 45 U/L RCALK PHOS: 72 - Normal 30 -120 mg/dLFerritin: 480H (Down from 513) Normal 30 - 400ng/mLCEA: 5.6 High - Normal 0.0 - 3.6CA 19-9: 22.0 - Normal <41.3 U/MLAFP: 1.9 - Normal <15.0 ng/MLNow the MRI ResultsFinding: There is no intraheptic or extraheptic biliary dilation. The common bile duct is normal in caliber measuring 4mm. The pancreatic duct is normal. There are no filling defects or strictures of the common bile duct. there are gallstones. There no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.There is normal pancreatic enhancment. There is a 4mm cyst in the body of the pancreas near the pancreatic tail. It is nonspecific in appearance although most likely benign. There is no peripancreatic inflammation.There is fatty infiltration f the the liver. There is no lymphadenopath of ascites.The Kidneys, adrenals and spleen are unremarkable.Impression: Gallstones & 4mm cystic pancreatic lesion.medical billing code 577.2 (Cyst and pseudocyst of pancreas)So... Things flipping me out!1) Elevated CEA 5.6 the high side of norm is 3.8 - yes i smoke but only social\u00a0\u00a04 - 6 a week if that.2) 4mm Pancreatic Cystic lesion.Needless to say my nerves are a wreck, even though the Radiologist and my GI feel it's benign -\u00a0\u00a0I'm terrified.GI feels it's nothing to worry about but is sending me for Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and possible biopsy - the waiting is killing me.Has anyone come across something like this? Could this be the cancer?",
