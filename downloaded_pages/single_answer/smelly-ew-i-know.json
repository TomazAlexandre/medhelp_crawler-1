            "answer": "Hi!One possibility is that you could be suffering from hyperthyroidism, diabetes, carcinoid syndromes infections etc. So, you need to ask your parents to take you to a doctor. Also, wear freshly laundered clothes as clothes worn again and again without laundering carry a musty smell of sweat especially in armpit area.Vinegar like smell in sweat is due to an acid called propionic acid. Since this acid is chemically similar to acetic acid in vinegar, the sweat smells of vinegar. This happens due to excess amino acids in sweat (which are breakdown products of protein), seen common with a high protein diet. Also if the diet is rich in cheese, then a bacteria of staphylococcus type acts on the sweat and causes this smell of vinegar. Hence to avoid this smell you would need to carefully look at your diet and lower the protein and cheese content in it (don\u2019t stop it). Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I'm 14 years old and I've no idea why my armpits smell do bad all the time. It's not the sweaty kind of smell but, musty-ish. I wash them multiple times in the shower, put on 3 layers of deodorant, 2 sprays of perfume, and I wash my clothes whenever I can but they still smell! I mean I think my sweaters are retaining the smell or something but even after fresh out of the dryer they smell. How can I clean myself and my clothes better? I'm a girl if that makes a difference",
