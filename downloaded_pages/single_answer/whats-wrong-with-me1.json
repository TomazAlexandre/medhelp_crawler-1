            "answer": "Hi,Have you had any blood tests regarding your current blood sugar levels? A certain percentage of women remain diabetic after gestational diabetes, so this is very important for you to have evaluated. The other common hormonal\u00a0\u00a0issue is thyroid dysfunction after pregnancy.If you have not had these checked, please contact your doctor soon and arrange for the tests to be done. For either scenario there are medications that can help treat you and have you feeling better soon.Take care.",
