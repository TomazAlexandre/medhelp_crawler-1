    "question": "Last Wednesday I got a migraine w/ aura and got rid of the headache but I was left w/ vision loss in my right eye. I continued to have the vision loss, and finally on Monday I made myself go to the optometrist. She did an examination and said that she thought my vision loss was due to something called central serios but wanted to make sure so she sent me a retinal specialist the next day. During my exam w/ the retinal specialist he told me that he didnt see what the optometrist thought I had, He said he didnt see any reason at all for my eyesight to be messed up in my eye, so he decided to inject some dye into me and take pictures of my eye w/ a special camera while the dye went thru my eye, He said he didnt see anything out of the ordinary, but wants to do a MRI to be sure. I am so scared, I cant see out of my right eye, and nobody seems to know what is wrong, if nothing is found with the MRI does that mean I just have to live with it? Please let me know what is going on, or if you know what it is, I am a healthy person other than this. I dont have diabetes, or high blood pressure and I havent had any falls or blows to the head. I am worried!!!!!",
