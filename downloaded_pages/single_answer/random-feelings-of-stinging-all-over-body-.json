            "answer": "Hi!Generalized feeling of a burning/stinging, on and off pain sensation can be due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. In females above 40 years it can be a symptom of menopause or premenopause. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes too should be looked into. Fibromyalgia is another possibility. This would need a comprehensive investigation. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
