            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The normal healing time is 5 days to a week. In case it is prolonged then you must get tested for diabetes. Also you must refrain from the activities that inflict those cuts. Itching is common with all healing scabs. You can use a medicated moisturizer to keep them soft. The color of the skin may or may not come back to normal. This depends on the texture of your skin.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I don't feel comfortable disclosing why, but due to certain situations my legs, all the way from about six inches below my belly button on my torso to my ankles are covered with cuts.\u00a0\u00a0The cuts aren't deep just very numerous, as in hundreds.\u00a0\u00a0I've had them since May 30th and the others since the 31st.\u00a0\u00a0So far, they are healing quite normally and have scabbed over.\u00a0\u00a0They are very itchy, I think because of the mass number not any infection or anything of the sort, so I've scratched many of the scabs off which only results in very minimal bleeding in small spots.\u00a0\u00a0All of this is very normal mind you, Basically I'm wondering the normal healing time for small cuts on the legs.\u00a0\u00a0Not deep, just scrapes like you may get cutting yourself shaving or falling in to a brier patch(possible a tad deeper than falling into a brier patch, never fallen into one).\u00a0\u00a0So far they are healing but are still visible, I'm wondering when my skin will be back to normal and show no signs of the cuts.",
