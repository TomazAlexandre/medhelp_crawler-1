            "answer": "Are you diabetic? As far as I know there is not medication prescribed for people who are hypoglycemic without having diabetes.As far as diabetes. First of all you've posted on the Type 1 board. Type 1 is controlled only by insulin as Type 1's do not produce insulin of their own (or very little) and need it to live.Let's assume, though that you are talking about pre-diabetes or about type 2 diabetes. Many people do control these conditions with just diet, weight loss and exercise for a period of time, sometimes many years. Obviously if you can do that and keep your numbers in target range, that's great. Some people cannot do this without high numbers and over time may progress to needing medications, and over a period of years to insulin. The bottom line is that avoiding high blood sugars is how you avoid the complications of diabetes. So doing what you need to do to keep your blood sugar in range is what is needed.Again, this answer relates to pre-diabetes, or to type 2 diabetes, not to hypoglycemia or type 1. Hypoglycemia is controlled through diet; finding out how often you need to eat and how much in order to not go too low. If you have Reactive Hypoglycemia, that is another situation. What has your doctor suggested and how are your numbers would be my two questions.",
