            "answer": "Hi there!Whether a pump would or would not be best suitable at this time is a decision best taken by your treating endocrinologist. Most leading brands would have good pumps with slight variation in the model. While the choice of the pump should be based on its features and the requirements, I would suggest discussing the situation in detail with your treating endocrinologist before deciding on the pump.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
