            "answer": "There are no easy answers for your question, because if he has a severe hypo while living alone he is only counting on his body to release sufficient glucose to revive him. Some options to stay safe are to more closely monitor his blood sugar to prevent serious lows. Frequent lows also create hypo unawareness so it's important to keep his numbers up enough to reset his awareness if this has happened. If he is having a lot of lows he is obviously taking too high doses of insulin and should work on better control by basal testing, more accurate I:C ratios and ISF for corrections. I also think it is safer not to do corrections too close to bedtime (I also live alone).He should test often and treat any low under 60 (some say under 70). Finally he might consider a CGMS which will notify him with alarms about downward trends of blood sugar so he can catch and treat it before it gets dangerous.",
