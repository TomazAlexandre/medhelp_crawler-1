            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If this is happening close to the meals then you need to rule out peptic/gastric ulcers, acidity, reflux disease, diabetes, IBS, Crohn's, celiac disease and other food intolerances.You also need to get examined to rule out a few things such as low blood pressure, postural hypotension (fall in blood pressure, cervical spinal nerve compression, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), severe anemia, an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), and internal ear infections.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. It would be good to consult your PCP to rule these out. Take care!",

    "question": "Recently I have been feeling a little dizzy at times, mostly in the afternoon and at night. Also, sometimes while I'm eating or just after I've eaten I start to feel nauseous. For a while I thought it was my anxiety but sometimes it just hits me out of the blue and there's nothing going on that I would be anxious about. I've searched the internet for answers but I haven't been able to come up with an answer. I plan on seeing a doctor soon if it doen't ease off.",
