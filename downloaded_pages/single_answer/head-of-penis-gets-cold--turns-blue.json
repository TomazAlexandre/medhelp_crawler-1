            "answer": "Hi,The treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel (Plavix) won\u2019t be a guarantee that you wouldn\u2019t need another coronary procedure, especially in the presence of Diabetes. Inquire from your doctor if you are at risk for a heredity problem with lipids \u2013 as you may require more intensive treatment to control cholesterol.While there is a rich blood supply for the penis indeed it is entirely possible that a reaction to cold is what you say. The arteries generally carry warmer blood and subserve the function of maintaining body temperature. Hence as arteries reach the tips (like the tips of the fingers) the temperature starts dropping and so the symptom emerges.The best protection is to keep yourself warm.It is also possible that if you are sedentary you are forming plaques that may be floating in the circulation, and these may lodge permanently in small vessels. If the symptom you described is prolonged or if there is pain, it may be best to see a doctor right away.",

    "question": "It started a couple years ago:\u00a0\u00a0my right foot, especially the toes, would get cold to the point of having a painful burning sensation in it.\u00a0\u00a0That would usually happen while I would be relaxed, as in being a couch potato.\u00a0\u00a0This past winter the same thing started with the head of my penis.\u00a0\u00a0Had to resort to putting a pad inside my briefs to keep it warm and pain free.I have CAD (7 coronary stents) and PAD (2 stents in left subclavian for SSS).\u00a0\u00a0Got these one at a time during the past 7 years.\u00a0\u00a0Add in Type II diabetes, high blood pressure and lipids.\u00a0\u00a0About 2 months ago I had an ABI: left side 1.0, right side 0.87.\u00a0\u00a0I get buttock and thigh pains while walking.\u00a0\u00a0Had a urologist check things out last month.\u00a0\u00a0No infection, no STD, PSA is ok but I do have some ED.\u00a0\u00a0The coldness and pain disappear whenever I can get an erection but it doesn't last long.I assume that I have a blood circulation problem with my penis.\u00a0\u00a0The urologist assured me that there are lots of arteries supplying blood to the penis, and I don't have anything to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0However, considering the experience I've gained over the past few years, that doesn't reassure me. I'm already taking a daily handful of pills including Plavix and aspirin so according to the advertising, plaque should not be a problem.\u00a0\u00a0But I've been taking them since 2000 and still got stents.What I would like to know:\u00a0\u00a0Is this going to be a static but cronic problem?\u00a0\u00a0Can it be fixed?\u00a0\u00a0What are the potential problems I might have in the future and can those be avoided?",
