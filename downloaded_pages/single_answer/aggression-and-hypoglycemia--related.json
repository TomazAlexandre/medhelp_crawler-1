    "question": "HelloI am emailing you to see if you could possibly offer me som advice or opinion on a specific matter regarding diabetes.About two years ago, my wife and i were staying in a hotel for the night whilst attending a wedding. I have been diabetic for 23 years and on the whole had no real problems as it has been well controlled and managed. On this occasion however i must have consumed too much alcohol and my wife said that i went into a strange state, which she found quite frightening, she said i was very verbally aggressive and very agitated. In the morning i had no memory of this whatsoever and found it deeply upsetting that i had upset my wife so badly, and very unsettling that i had no memory at all of anything happening. I had been drinking alcopops & beer (something which i now no-longer do) and was wondering whether the sugar in the alcopop was sending my blood sugar up and then the alcohol in the beer was sending it down too fast causing a bad hypoglycemia\u00a0\u00a0effect, I work nights and didn't have a lot of sleep the day before or enough to eat as i would normally would have done and was wondering if these combined factors could have caused the problem i have described. Any help or advice you could give me would be of help, as this has caused a big problem in our lives and i am still searching for answers!Kind regardsNeil",
