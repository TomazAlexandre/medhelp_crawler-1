    "question": "For about 4 months now, I've had a dry mouth.\u00a0\u00a0It keeps me from sleeping more than 8 hours a night (I need 9).\u00a0\u00a0A few weeks in, my ears started hurting a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I had gone to the doctor a few months before and he suggested I might have problems with my TMJ, but it went away until a few months ago.\u00a0\u00a0On and off I have had throat pain, but it ususally goes away.\u00a0\u00a0I've had mild weight gain, even though I had started working out again right before this happened.\u00a0\u00a0My neck feels a bit swollen at times, but I had a blood test done for my thyroid and it turned up normal.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a CBC and a test for diabetes, which all turned up normal.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried biotene, but it does nothing.\u00a0\u00a0The biotene creates more saliva in my mouth, but my mouth feels a bit burned.\u00a0\u00a0I used prilosec OTC for a week because I had very mild acid reflux, but nothing worked.\u00a0\u00a0 Does anyone know what this might be?\u00a0\u00a0I had a doctor tell me it could be Schogrens Disease, could it be that?",
