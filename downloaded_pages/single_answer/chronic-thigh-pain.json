            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. If the pain is due to meralgia paresthetica then losing some weight or wearing loose clothes and belts often helps relieve the pain/numbness/tingling. Also injection of lignocaine (anesthetic agent) at the site helps. In your case you can apply a pain reliever at the site. Keep a hot water bottle/heating pad while sleeping and apply a local analgesic cream. Other possibilities are vascular pathologies such as deep vein thrombosis and clots and will need a dopplar study. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme's and lupus are the other possibilities. It can also be spinal nerve compression in lower back.Other than this, yes, a nerve block or radio-ablation helps relieve pain. However, it may cause numbness in the area that was earlier painful. So, it is first important to rule out all the above mentioned causes of pain. You could also try physiotherapy, traction, spinal cord stimulator, opioid pain killers, TENS therapy etc. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.
