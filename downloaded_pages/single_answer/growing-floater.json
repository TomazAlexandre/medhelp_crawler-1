            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.I would suggest you be evaluated by an ophthalmologist (not an optometrist) for this. Floaters are not an uncommon finding in people. They typically will settle with gravity with time. If it is bothersome, you should have it evaluated by an eye doctor.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "About 6 years ago I began to experience a very intense floater, that grew, over time they have grown in frequency and I now have this type of episode every 4-5 days .\u00a0\u00a0This floater expanded to the point where it took over more than half of my vision.\u00a0\u00a0 This takes around 5 minutes and then expands beyond my vision and everything is back to normal.The floater always appears in the same place and is a bilateral phenomenon.I am 47 with a systolic of 115 and no sign of diabetes my health is good and I lead an active life.\u00a0\u00a0I am a smoker.My GP is not exploring this nor is he explaining that I have no need for concern.",
