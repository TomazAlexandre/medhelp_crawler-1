            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. You appear to be on a lot of medications. Apart from medications, exercise and diet control are integral to diabetes management. So, if you are not following that correctly, then medications may not help. Please consult a nutrition expert regarding your diet and ask your doctor regarding the level of exercise you should do.Also, it may help to reduce the dosage of pills and increase the dosage of insulin. However, please do not try this on your own. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
