            "answer": "HiThanks for the post! How are you now?Sensitivity to light is seen in eye infections like conjunctivitis, keratitis and iritis, corneal abrasion, retinal detachment, contact lens irritations, and drugs like tetracycline and doxycycline. Extreme tiredness is also a feature of both low sugar and diabetes, anemia and also of hypothyroidism. You need to get these tested.Please check with your doctor for a lingering infection.This needs a more detailed investigation. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining and various tests. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
