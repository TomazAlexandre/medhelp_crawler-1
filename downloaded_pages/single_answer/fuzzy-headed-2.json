            "answer": "Your symptoms sound to me more like hypoglycemia than diabetes. You may want to do some reading... go to www.hypoglycemia.org to read more about symptoms and how to improve the condition. It sounds as if your diet is healthy, but this website has some dietary suggestions for folks who suffer from low blood sugar levels. Read the information and maybe you can figure out better if this is the root of your problems.You may want to ask your doctor to do a glucose tolerance test to see if your pancreas is over-producing insulin when stimulated. Your doctor may have some lifestyle suggestions to help you, too.When the symptoms are particularly bad, you may want to drink a very small amount (half cup) of juice to help clear your head. But do avoid large amounts of juice or of soda drinks, for in large doses, they can make the problem worse. Also, many folks who deal with hypoglycemia cannot eat or drink things containing caffeine.Good luck finding some help.",

    "question": "Hi, I have a question regarding feeling fuzzy headed. I have been having a tough time concentrating at work, I feel tired or fatigued most of the time. I have been having short term memory loss, forgetting peoples names, and simple things during the day. I am 38. Never been diagnosed with diabetes, recently had some blood work done that came back normal. I am suspicious of my sugar/insulin levels because if I skip a meal I feel terrible. I fasted a lot over the past two years, but stopped for obvious reasons. I have made considerable changes to my diet. Very little white sugar, salt, fast food etc. In addition I am taking vitamins and exercising daily. Any suggestions?Thanks",
