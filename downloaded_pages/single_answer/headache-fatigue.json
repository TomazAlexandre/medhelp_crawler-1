    "question": "For about a decade, I've suffered from persistent pressure in my head, extending from my temples to the back of my neck.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't quite call it a headache, and I do have regular headaches and migraines from time to time, but it's constant.\u00a0\u00a0I can't remember a day in ten years I haven't felt it.Over the past three or four years, I've been fatigued.\u00a0\u00a0I've managed to function, going to college, now law school, but it too is ever-present and periodically very severe.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, I saw a GP and was cleared for diabetes, hypothyroidism, sleep apnea, etc., and also a neurologist, who ran an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0He said my brain ventricles were enlarged (normal for a sixty year old, which I'm certainly not) but couldn't seen any blockages.\u00a0\u00a0There was some talk of a spinal tap, but by that point I was moving, tired of doctors and my own complaints and prepared to live with it.Recently, however, I've had great trouble concentrating, periods of disorientation and memory loss.\u00a0\u00a0It's difficult to read and write, which has never happened before and leaves me at a loss.\u00a0\u00a0I'm thinking about trying to get a referral to see a neurologist again, but it's tough around here and I thought I'd see if anybody has any ideas.",
