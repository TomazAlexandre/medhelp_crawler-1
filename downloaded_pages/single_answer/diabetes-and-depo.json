    "question": "My doctor recommended a depo shot to help regulate my blood sugars after it was determined during my first pregnancy that my BG was very sensitive to fluctuations in hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0It TOTALLY didn't work.\u00a0\u00a0I've only taken one shot but I was wondering what I should expect as far as BG fluctuations after coming off this shot.\u00a0\u00a0I was strongly cautioned after having my first child not to try again because there was a strong chance that I would have a lethal low BG.\u00a0\u00a0Is that a concern coming off this shot too?\u00a0\u00a0I'm worried about hormone changes coming off this shot after reading some of the difficult stories posted on here.",
