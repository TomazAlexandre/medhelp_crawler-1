    "question": "28 year old male, have tinnitis. The weather has gotten cold here and I have what appears to be a head cold. Havent seen a doctor about it, but head feels full and a lot of mucus. Over the past 3 days I have had really bad headaches, all in the same spot. It feels like pressure headaches. Each time I had taken 4 tablets of generic IBProfen, 200mg each tablet, and it seemed to help my headache. I have only taken 4 for the day, but instead of every 3-6 hours suggested on the bottle I took them all at the same time. Yesterday was the third day and I took 4 tablets again, in the morning around 9am, for my headache and not long after I started to feel very light headed and it was hard to walk in a straight line. It felt like I was off balance when walking and I felt like this for the rest of the day. I guess like vertigo but my vision didnt seem to be affected. I did take the pills on an empty stomach so at lunch I ate something hoping it would calm me down. But the feeling persisted throughout the day and into the night. Last night was tough to sleep because when I laid down I started to feel very light headed and my body felt very weak, like tremors going through my body. I would awake every 10-15 minutes. I finally fell asleep around 3am. Now today I still feel the affect, not as powerful but still feel it. I also have what appears to be dark green stool. Also I have recently been taking vicoden for a knee injury substained recently. Any ideas? Im a large man, 6'7 400 pounds. I recently had blood work done and everything looked good such as cholestrol and diabetes ruled out.",
