            "answer": "Hi!Yes, I can comprehend you panic! You probably mean the lateral ventricles are enlarged. Lateral ventricles are prominent at 11 weeks of gestation and thereafter decrease in prominence as compared to rest of the brain. At 33 weeks to birth they are usually about less than 10 mm in width.\u00a0\u00a0If there is prominence of ventricles at 20 weeks then this can be due to chromosomal abnormalities, increased CSF formation, poor brain development or taking some drugs not advised during pregnancy or due to maternal diabetes. At times the cause is not known.However, most of babies with lateral ventricle size of 10mm do not develop hydrocephalus. So in your child\u2019s case, hydrocephalus is less likely. If the ventricle size is 15 mm or more, chances of associated chromosomal abnormalities and herniation of brain called Chiari malformations are more. There can also be other malformations such as Dandy Walker malformations, neural tube defects, or corpus callosum agenesis. Hydrocephalus usually develops.If only lateral ventricle enlargement is an isolated finding, then prognosis is excellent. However, the baby will need to be monitored both before and after birth to detect any abnormality at the first instance. Do discuss this with your doctor. I know this sounds scary, but based on the above information, there may not be any associated problem. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I had my anatomy scan at 20 weeks and everything went smoothly except our little boy wasn't being cooperative so at my 24 week appointment they wanted to get a few more pictures of the heart chambers and a profile view. My dr. Reassured me it was just because of baby's position not because they were questioning anything. At my 24 week appointment they told me that my baby's bilateral cerebrel ventricles were measuring larger than normal at 1.1cm and at the 20 week ultrasound they were measuring 1.02cm. I am seeing a perinatal specialist next week, but in the meantime I am in a panic and cannot help but worry an unhealthy amount. Anyone have any experience with this?",
