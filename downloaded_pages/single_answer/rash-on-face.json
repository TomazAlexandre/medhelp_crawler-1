            "answer": "Hello,It is very difficult to confirm a diagnosis without examination but these blister like sores can be due to contact dermatitis or impetigo sores which can occur in pregnancy. If there was moderate to severe itching then herpes gestationis could have been a possibility. It is best to consult a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi ladies,i have recently just developed a red rash on my face it starts on the upper right cheek and goes onto my forehead around my eye and then around onto the other side of my face. I have no idea what it is, it doesnt hurt, it doesnt itch.. it just looks like its blistered with red spots\u2026its\u2026.just odd. I called my doctor today who told me to see a dermatologist. this helped me non what so ever. I stopped taking my anti depressants two weeks ago, and the only thing i am taking is glumetza to try to stop the gestational diabetes from coming on. Last night was the first time i've taken it since i've been pregnant. i'm going to stop taking it tonight and see if the rash goes away. IF it does i know what it is, its just weird b/c its never happened before. I'm also taking citranatal pre natals as well. any suggestions?",
