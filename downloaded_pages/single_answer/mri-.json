            "answer": "Hi!Yes, the doctor is partially right. Small and old ischemic foci as such do not cause any lasting harm. However, recurrent small ischemic foci should be seriously followed up. If your mother has diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol or hyperlipidemia, then all these conditions need careful monitoring as they can increase the risk of ischemic foci in brain. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
