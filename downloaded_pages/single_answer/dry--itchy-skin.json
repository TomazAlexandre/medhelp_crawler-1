            "answer": "Hello,Without examination,it is very difficult to confirm a diagnosis,but it can be dry skin or xerosis or eczema.Xerosis results from hot or cold weather with low humidity levels, long-term use of air conditioning or central heating, and washing or bathing too much.Eczema is a form of chronic dermatitis (rash).Allergic reaction is one of the important causes of eczema. Allergic reaction can occur to strong soaps, Solvents, chemicals, certain foods, food additives, plants, metals, cosmetics, even urine and faeces of some animals (dust mites).Wash the areas several times with fresh water. Do not use any cosmetic products at the sites. You can apply some calamine lotion at the rash as it will help in soothing the skin. You can take some OTC oral antihistamine medications like Benadryl or Claritin and see if it helps.For mild-moderate cases a weak steroid may be used (e.g. hydrocortisone as dermacort), whilst more severe cases require a higher-potency steroid (e.g. clobetasol propionate, fluocinonide).Eczema and xerosis can be exacerbated by dryness of the skin. Use good quality moisturizers to prevent moisture loss from the skin.If still the symptoms persist then it is important to rule out internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods.Pls consult a dermatologist in that case.",
