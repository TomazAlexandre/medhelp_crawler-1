            "answer": "Hi, the symptoms you experienced could be due to a prodromal phase of an infection, before the actual signs are evident. They could also be due some metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorders. They could even be premenstrual symptoms. Sometimes anxiety or stress can cause similar effects.
