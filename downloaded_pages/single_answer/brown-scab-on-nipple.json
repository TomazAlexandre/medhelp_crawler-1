    "question": "I have a brown scab on one of my nipples, right on the tip on the nipple. A couple of months ago, it was on both breasts, but this time it is only on one. After a few weeks, the scab(s) starts to itch and eventually falls out. The skin underneath it looks dry and sore. While the scab is on it, I don't notice any major soreness.Is this normal? I am not sexually active and I am seventeen; I have been diagnosed with PCOS and borderline diabetes if that is any help.",
