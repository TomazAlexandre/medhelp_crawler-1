            "answer": "freguent urination can signal diabetes in\u00a0\u00a0adults and children. I would make an appointment with your pedatrician. Keep notice of his input in output. Is he more thirsty then usual? There could be many reasons but I would want to rule out diabetes first, especially in such a young age. Good luck and let us know if you get the answer your looking for.Paula",

    "question": "My son is 3.5 and has been potty trained for over a year.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, he has started urinating very frequently.\u00a0\u00a0The urine is clear, it doesn't smell and he says it doesn't hurt.\u00a0\u00a0He only goes a small amount each time.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't go through the night, so that makes me think that it might just be a phase.\u00a0\u00a0He knows he gets a reaction out of me because is very aware of things and seems to think it is funny when he goes so much.\u00a0\u00a0My husband thinks he would be having bed wetting accidents if there was a real problem.. What do\u00a0\u00a0you think?\u00a0\u00a0Would you be concerned or do you think it is just a phase? I think I will call the doctor tomorrow, but I just wanted some feedback from you all.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
