            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.If you know that you have vitamin deficiencies, you have most likely had your blood drawn. On the lab report there should be a record of you blood sugar. If you are having periods of weakness, it sounds more like you are experiencing low blood sugar, or low blood pressure. I would recommend that you see your doctor again and describe the \"bottoming out\" spells. Through physical exam and blood tests, you doctor may be able to help you diagnose what is causing your fatigue.cathy",
