            "answer": "Tamateta, Hi, When you have a general swelling, they call it goiter but small lumps like pea to marble size (even bigger) are nodules. Several nodules together is multi-nodular.If you haven't gotten a thyroid panel with antibodies tested, I would sure do so. Don't let them talk you out of antibodies test because your hormones can be in normal range even if autoimmune thyroid disease is present.Also, autoimmune disease increases risks for others. Type I Diabetes is usually from antibodies attacking the insulin producing cells. Some people don't know that Type I is autoimmune.I've heard others Docs say autoimmune diseases do not put you at risk for others but they are getting this contradictory info, I don't know. Maybe it's the usual \"downplay everything and it will go away attitude\".Hashimoto's Hypothyoid patients are at substantially higher risk of developing diabetes, so I'm sure the reverse is also true.\u00a0\u00a0Hope that helped.",
