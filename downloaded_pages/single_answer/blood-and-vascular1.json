            "answer": "Hi!Vibrations in the left leg can be due to a pinched lumbar or sacral nerve or due to infection in a part of lung, or deep vein thrombosis or due to dehydration, or due to electrolyte imbalance. Peripheral neuropathies as seen in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s or lupus too could be the cause. If the vibrations come only at night, then this could be due to restless leg syndrome. It is important to rule out these causes one by one. You will need blood sugar monitoring, MRI of lumbo-scaral spine, T3, T4, TSH, sleep studies, serum electrolytes, etc to reach a diagnosis. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
