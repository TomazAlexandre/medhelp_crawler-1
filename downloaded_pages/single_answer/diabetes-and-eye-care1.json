            "answer": "\" I started feeling light headed, dizziness, nauseous, and loss of balance while standing and/or walking.\" has nothing to do with an eye exam or eye issues. You need to be evaluated by a medical professional. We cannot evaluate you over the Internet to determine the cause. Your blood sugars may be out of whack and/or you're experiencing cardio issues, etc. Get off the computer and go to the nearest ER. You shouldn't feel this way for 10+ hours. Good luck -",
