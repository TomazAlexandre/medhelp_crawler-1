            "answer": "Hi!Yes, electrolyte imbalance could be a cause. The other possibility is pinched nerve. This can be due to superficial nerve compression (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve), that comes from the hip area and gets pinched. This condition is called meralgia paresthetica and is often due to weight gain or wearing tight clothes and belts. Losing some weight or wearing loose clothes and belts often helps relieve the pain/numbness/tingling. Also injection of lignocaine (anesthetic agent) at the site helps. In your case you can apply a pain reliever at the site. Keep a hot water bottle/heating pad while sleeping and apply a local analgesic cream.Other possibilities are vascular pathologies such as deep vein thrombosis and clots and will need a dopplar study.Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme's and lupus are the other possibilities. It can also be spinal nerve compression in lower back.You may benefit from taking short breaks in between work and exercising or walking during this time.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

In the last week, I noticed that when I sit, the top side and upper to middle of my LEFT thigh vibrates/hums pretty good.\u00a0\u00a0It's deep enough that I have to press hard on my thigh to feel it but I CAN feel it.\u00a0\u00a0Since I sit all day for my software development work and then at night too, it's become annoying. The sensation is just like a long thin cell phone vibrating under my skin.I read where I may have a magnesium and/or potassium deficiencies.\u00a0\u00a0So, I'll start those supplements tonight.Any other ideas?",
