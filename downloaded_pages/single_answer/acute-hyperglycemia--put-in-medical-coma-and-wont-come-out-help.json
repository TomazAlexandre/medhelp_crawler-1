    "question": "I have a question about my mother in law. She was found Saturday morning by her husband, in bed, with her eyes glazed over. When he tried to talk to her she was incoherent and he couldn't get her up so he called an ambulance. They checked her blood sugar and it was 1800!! She did not even know she had diabetes. She had been feeling like she had the flu for a few days preceding this. They are not sure as of right now if she has type 1 or 2 diabetes. They put her in a medically induced coma to bring her blood sugar down and by Sunday it was down to 110. Since her blood sugar was down, they wanted to bring her out of the coma and get the tube out of her throat, but when they tried to bring her out, she was not responding properly. She did \"wake up\" and was struggling and very obviously not comfortable, but she did not respond to anyone by following instruction or making meaningful eye contact. They decided to put her back under and do a CT. CT came back normal but they did some labs and her sodium was high so they decided to flush her blood and try to bring her out on today. Well today her sodium is down (still elevated but better) and I know that high sodium levels can cause the brain cells to be lacking water and therefore can cause confusion, but they are thinking it is low enough that this shouldn't be the issue now. They tried to bring her back out today, but she did the same thing. She was very restless and trying to sit up and trying to move about, but she wasn't actually making contact with anyone. They turned the tube off and she is breathing on her own now but obviously they can't take te tube out in case something else happens. They are going to do an EKG to check her brain activity this afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0Also when she was admitted, she had a fever of 103 and she has been on antibiotics since then and today her temp is 101. Does anyone have any ideas as to what might be going on? What could be keeping her stuck in a semi-unconcious state? I hate to think that she is trapped in there struggling but unable to cognitively communicate. Any ideas are appreciated.",
