    "question": "I just turned 41 in February, this past Nov I went to see a doctor whom sent me for an FSH along with routine blood work. Came back with an FSH of 18 and also spilling sugar. He sent me for a GTT which indicated that I had diabetes. He then ran an A1C and that came back at 11. I was told that I needed to get my blood under control before going into an IVF cycle which through the help of the insulin pump my A1C is now 7 and continuing to decline.I am wondering has anyone at the age of 41 or close to it with an FSH of 18 and diabetes had success with IVF.My husband and I would love to start a family together. I have 3 children from my first marriage whom were conceived naturally been then had my tubes tied because of Genetic reasons. Through break troughs in medicine and PGD If I can produce healthy follicles we can have the fertilized embryos analyzed for help risks.Thank you for your help. I wish everyone here much success with achieving your family happiness.Elida SI, NY",
