            "answer": "Hello,As there is a strong family history of CHF esp on the maternal side,so you definitely need to have lifestyle modification in order to prevent CHF. A family history of early congestive heart failure caused by cardiomyopathies (diseases that damage the heart muscle) may predispose you to the disease. You are also at increased risk for developing heart failure if you are overweight, have diabetes, smoke cigarettes, abuse alcohol, or use cocaine.I would suggest to abstain from all these, eat a healthy balanced diet (no saturated fat, good carbohydrates and lean protein) and keep your heart healthy with plenty of regular cardiovascular exercise.Also get an yearly EKG done to know the status of your heart.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.",
