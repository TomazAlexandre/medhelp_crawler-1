            "answer": "I'm pretty sure you can't throw up blood from diabetes, it's probably a different problem, maybe related to the smoking? But I'm no doctor, so maybe you should check it out with someone with medical experience.If he doesn't take care of his blood sugar, then his health won't be that great. I know that for sure. Being supportive is really good, letting him talk about stuff and just being a friend.It's not likely for it to be passed on, but there's always an increased risk.Hope that helped.",
