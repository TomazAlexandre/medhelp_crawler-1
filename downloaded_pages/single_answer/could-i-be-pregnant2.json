            "answer": "Hi therewe are not doctors but just here to help and support you. You can pay to ask the doctor a question on the doctors forum but you would be wasting your time as there is no way they can tell if you are pregnant without an examination/urine/blood test.It is certainly possible as you have had unprotected sex so many times during the month.Frequent thirst is actually one of the main symptoms of diabetes though so you should also mention about that to your doctor so you can be tested for that at the same time as for pregnancy.You could always buy a home pregnancy testing kit but they are quite expensive .\u00a0\u00a0It sounds as though you have to get your constipation dealt with too so going to the doctor seems like the way forward for you anyway.",
