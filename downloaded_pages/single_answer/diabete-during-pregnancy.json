            "answer": "Hi Grace,I am now 6 months pregnant and I've been on insulin for 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0so far all is going well.\u00a0\u00a0My baby seems to be right on par for growth and development.The problem with diabetes is not having it, but only if you don't control it.For me it was such a releif to be on insulin as I really couldn't control my blood sugar well consistently with just diet. However, with the insulin my blood sugar control is excellent.\u00a0\u00a0I take insulin injection twice a day. It is very easy as I was given a pen injection kit. it doesn't hurt and the idea of injecting myself was much worse than actually having to do it.I monitor blood sugar 3 times a day, alternating monitoring in mornings and afternoons.\u00a0\u00a0I have to fax my results to my doctor every 2 weeks and see him once a month.\u00a0\u00a0This monitoring is more of a nuisance than the actual insulin shots.I probably will have to increase my insulin soon as my blood sugars at lunch time are beginning to go above target (120 2 hours after eating).I'll be very pleased to discuss anythign with you.Sally",
