            "answer": "Hi,Your symptoms like tingling and weakness indicate nerve compression. I would suggest you to schedule an appointment with a neurologist as soon as possible. A CT scan of the entire back will help to identify the exact point of nerve compression. Meanwhile also get a blood sugar test done to rule out diabetes. A B complex vitamin supplement may also help.",
