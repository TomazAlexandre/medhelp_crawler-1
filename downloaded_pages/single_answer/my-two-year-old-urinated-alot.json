            "answer": "Any time you're concerned about your child's health, you should contact his pediatrician, even if it turns out to be nothing, at least you know for sure.\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely check though with symptoms you're describing...like I said...even if it turns out to be nothing.\u00a0\u00a0It could be something as simple as a urinary tract infection, but you'd want to rule out other things as well.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a health care professional, but speaking 'mom to mom' that would be my advice.",

    "question": "I have type II diabetes. My son is 2 1/2 and I never really noticed until he was potty trained how often he urinates. He stays dry all night and even wears underwear to bed. He wakes up and when he pees, he barely voids. It a tiny stream and maybe a second long.\u00a0\u00a0After that, he probably voids 10 times a day!\u00a0\u00a0Is this because potty training is so new and he loves the praise he gets?? Also, my son has this \"shake\" if you will. It comes out spiratic(sp?) but now i am thinking he might be diabetic. Constantly thristy, urinating alot, shakes sometimes.....am I over reacting or should i call his pediatrician??Concerned Mom",
