I know a 'normal' pregnancy really doesn't have any restrictions on traveling at 16 weeks. I hope all works out well for you. :)",

    "question": "ok. so i am high risk due to being diabetic. and i am now 16weeks along. my hubby is in iraq and having issues back in indiana and we are stationed in texas. he has a son from befor me and the boy is currently in foster care. we are trying to get him home so that he can be at the court hearings (which i believe he should be) but the army is wanting to know why i can not deal with theese issues for him. seeing as i have POA. but in order for me to do this i would have to travel alone for 18 hours in the car..for i can not afford to fly back and forth. I also have a son in school down here with no family here so i would have to up root him as well.so my question is....have any of you ever been high risk and know the deal with traveling? do you think i would be aloud to do this or when the cut off date is for traveling?\u00a0\u00a0i am hoping the doctor will sign off saying that i can not do it alone. but i dont know if this will happen.. im also taking insulin shots 2 times a day and would think that it wouldnt be good for the baby with diet and all that..please respond",
