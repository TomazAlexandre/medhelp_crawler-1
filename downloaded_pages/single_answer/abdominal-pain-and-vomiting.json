    "question": "I have pain on my left side along the bottom rib (mostly concentrated toward the center but spands out to my side) and it has been there since 2007.\u00a0\u00a0I typically regurgitate food whenever I eat.\u00a0\u00a0The severity of the pain fluctuates but is always present.\u00a0\u00a0And even thought I barely eat, and when I do I can not usually keep it down, I have gain 75 pounds over the last 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0 I saw 9 different doctors when if first started who all just kept telling me I was morbidly obese and depressed.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to explain that the weight gain was a symptom not the cause and even showed one pictures of a much skinnier/happier me before this started but no one would listen. Before this happens I ran everyday, ate healthy and drank a lot of water.\u00a0\u00a0Now my side hurts just to do normal activities and I barely eat.\u00a0\u00a0For example today I ate a bagel in the morning and half a chicken breast for dinner and I feel like I ate a whole Thanksgiving dinner.\u00a0\u00a0And all night I gave been throwing up little bits about every 15 minutes as if I ate to much.\u00a0\u00a0I never feel hungry and usually have to be reminded by my friends to eat or I could go for a day or two without.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone help with information of what this might be before I waste and more time and money just to be told I am fat.",
