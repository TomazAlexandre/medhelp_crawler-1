    "question": "I have been diagnosed with epicondylitis recently, however, I have begun to believe the diagnosis is dubious.\u00a0\u00a0I have a tingling, numb sensation in both of my hands, usually the right and I could simply wake up from a nap feeling like my arm has been held up over my head and then lowered into a normal position or plugged into a mild electrical charge.\u00a0\u00a0I have been waiting for about three weeks for the results of blood tests after a receptionist set up an appointment and mentioned the possibility of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0However, other than high cholesterol, my tests came normal\u2014no diabetes\u2014and was given a neoprene band with pressure points to wrap around my forarm tendons for a few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Aside from being an uncomfortable nuisance, it really isn't doing much.\u00a0\u00a0I'm an avid pool player, but I don't put much stress on my arms, I feel no pain in my elbows, or any real pain for that matter and the electrical numbness I feel in my hands also exists occasionally in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect it's neurological, but it won't be until later this month before I see a neurologist as I need to determine if I need to continue using the anti-convulsion medication I've been on for the last 4 years or at least get refills.\u00a0\u00a0I'd be happy to get some advice, especially with someone with a similar condition.",
