            "answer": "Good Morning!I have been treated for Graves since October 2007.\u00a0\u00a0My Endo believes I am in remission.\u00a0\u00a0However, he feels I will be Hypo at some point (already leaning in that direction).\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid disease runs in my family (both sides).\u00a0\u00a0My sister has had Hypo T since she was 10 years old (she is now 45).\u00a0\u00a02 years ago she was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My Endo told me that all the hormone leves (estrogen, insulin, thyroid) all work together.\u00a0\u00a0When one is out of sync, the others eventually will be too.Since the Hyper part of my Graves disease has slowly starting heading toward Hypo T my cholesterol has started going up.\u00a0\u00a0The Endo has had me go on a high fiber diet.\u00a0\u00a0He checks my cholesterol every 2 months.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, he hasn't put me on cholesterol lowering medication.\u00a0\u00a0He also has me walking everyday (30 minutes at a time).\u00a0\u00a0While I still have days where I feel sluggish, I do feel much better.Eating low carbs and more healthy protein, helps tremendously.My blood pressure has gotten under control (was nothing to read 185/100.\u00a0\u00a0I've always had low normal bp.\u00a0\u00a0It now reads 107/65, 115/72, much better than before.\u00a0\u00a0It still goes up when I go to the doctor (white coat syndrome).\u00a0\u00a0But as soon as I quit walking regularly, things start getting off again.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed 6 years ago with Graves and treated with radioactive iodine.\u00a0\u00a0Seemed to do the trick and I went hypo, then treated with levrotyroxine.\u00a0\u00a06 years later I develop type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Both these diseases by different doctors were treated like a cold, take these pills and call me in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0Another words, I was never told how to care for either.\u00a0\u00a0Went I went to the hospital my diabetes #'s were 1000 and my cholesterol was 1200, blood pressure 150 over 98.\u00a0\u00a0They recommended metformin, glipizide, lisinopril, aspirin, and cholesterol meds.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I have low blood sugar down to 30 by the time I treat it, hurting calves all the time and either feel nausea\u00a0\u00a0or crappy all the time.\u00a0\u00a0the Doc can't seem to get them both under control and is constantly testing while I feel like ****.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to see another Endo, but is there any advice out there?",
