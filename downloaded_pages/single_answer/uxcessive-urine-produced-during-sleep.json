            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. Normally around 500ml of urine is voided if retention is not present.\u00a0\u00a0In your case polyuria could be due to ADH deficiency or diabetes mellitus or excess intake of fluids at bed time.I would suggest that you visit a physician and discuss the possibilities for further assistance on treatment.Best.",

    "question": "29/MFor the past 6 months or so, I have been waking up about 4-5 times a week with a painful need to urinate.\u00a0\u00a0My bladder is *extremely* full, and typically I will produce about 1.5 liters, which based on my research, is a LOT.\u00a0\u00a0I have pain in the region that my bladder is located, and the pain extends up into one of my kidneys as well at times.\u00a0\u00a0On nights that I do not wake up, I typically have to deal with the problem when I wake up the next morning, at which point my bladder is even more full and more painful.It sort of concerns me, because despite being inconvenient and uncomfortable, it also just seems like that amount of urine is far too much for a human bladder to be holding consistently.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance for any insight.",
