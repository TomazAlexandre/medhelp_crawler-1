This is totally normal and is not an infection.\u00a0\u00a0Usually there are also other bacteria present that compete with the yeast and keep it at bay.\u00a0\u00a0If you are healthy and have no symptoms, it is highly unlikely that you have systemic yeast--which is usually only seen in immunocompromised individuals.\u00a0\u00a0It never hurts to take probiotics or acidophillus--as these have lactobacillus, which are healthy bacteria that compete with yeast.\u00a0\u00a0If you were my patient, that is probably all I would recommend doing at this time!Good luck!Dr B",
