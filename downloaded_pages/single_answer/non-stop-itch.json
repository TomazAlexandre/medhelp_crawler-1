            "answer": "Hello,This feeling of skin crawling can be due to parasthesia. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have just started having this itchy leg problem you all are talking about. Mine seems to be behind the knee down to my calfs and ankles since it has gotten hot. My friend has said she has been having the same problem. I don't think there is any way this many people are having this problem that is it a circulation problem at all. Mine feels like I have bugs crawling under my skin and I just want to scratch non stop. I have changed razors, soap, washed my sheets (which never bothered me) I do have allergies to dogs and cats but never before did my legs itch. I usually rub rubbing alcohol (just a little) to kind of soothe the itch when I can't stop. I have tried all different lotions thinking that it was causing it but nothing has helped. My mom thought it was sun poisioning but I have not went in the sun nor been in a tanning bed recently. They seem to mostly itch in the afternoons and at night when I am sitting down or lying down. During the day when I am up at school and walking they do no itch. I have been reading about possible causes and have yet to go to the MD bc of reading everyones post I figured they would do nothing. I at first thought it was some kind of peripheral neuropathy problem but that doesn't seem to cause this much itching. I don't know what it making my legs itch and feel like something is crawling under the skin but I wish someone would figure out a diagnosis so I can take this to my MD.",
