    "question": "I am a 22 year old runner who has been having lower leg and ankle pain for about 3 years. I recently had ankle and tib/fib MRI's to rule out a tibial stress fracture.The findings read: stress fracture in the distal tibial metaphysis, an endosteal lesion, posterior tibial tendonitis, ankle effusion, arthrosis of the talonavicular joint, attenuation and chronic sprains of the anterior talofibular ligament and the deltoid ligament, and retrocalcaneal bursitis.My doctor put me in a walking boot and it has been 3 weeks but the pain in my lower leg and ankle has gotten worse. The swelling and discoloration have also gotten worse. I am seeking a second opinion, but has anyone had any successful treatment for any of these conditions or know of anything else that may help? Thank you!",
