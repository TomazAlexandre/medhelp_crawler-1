    "question": "I had an MRI done around 4 years ago. It had shown a pinched nerve in the L4-L5 region. Since that time I have been experiencing a building series of chronic issues in my back almost exclusively on the left side - knots in the upper back and neck, tightness in my butt (I am an engineer, not a doctor), cramps in my leg. I was told by a PA that nothing could be done about it.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, I was diagnosed about 3 years ago with Type II diabetes. I am managing the diabetes with diet and exercise, keeping my blood sugar levels down with medication and my A1c level around 6.1 to 6.3. Is it possible for surgery to take the pressure off this nerve and to give me relief? If so, is there a surgeon or group in the Denver area you could recommend?",
