    "question": "Hello,I am a 26 year old healthy male. About a year ago I was sitting at work and suddenly some floaters appeared in my left eye. I usually seen some floaters in the past when looking at a bright background but never like this. I went to a walk-in clinic and told the doctor about my problem and he said it was nothing and I should get used to them.About a week ago (July 7th), I woke up in the morning and the vision in my left eye was completely clouded over. I could barely see my fingers in front of my face. I went to the emergency room and the triage nurse seemed quite worried when I told her some of my symptoms. In the ER, they hooked me up to an ECG (turned out normal), and gave me a CT scan (came back negative). It was later diagnosed that I had a Vitreous Hemorrhage. They sent me to see a Retina specialist at St. Mike's hospital (in Toronto) and only upon pushing down on my eye he was able to see a small Retinal Tare along with abnormal vein growth and an inflamed or previous inflamed retina. They did perform laser surgery that day the tare.My question is what are some possible causes for a torn retina in a healthy young male with no history of Diabetes (I've been checked), retinal problems in the family, or any major head trauma. It is my understanding that this doesn't happen for no reason.Any answer will be greatly appreciated.Thank you for your time.",
