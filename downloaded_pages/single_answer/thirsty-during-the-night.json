    "question": "I'm 8w today and for the last few weeks I've woken in the night with intense thirst, I usually get through approx 1/2 litre/ 16oz of water during the night. I had a random glucose test the other week which came back 5.1, normal so I'm not concerned about diabetes.Is anyone else waking at night to drink?",
