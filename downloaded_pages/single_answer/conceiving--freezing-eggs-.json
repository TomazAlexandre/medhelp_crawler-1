            "answer": "Because of your age I would really recommend talking to a genetic counselor or OB to get a better idea about what you can do. I don't know the exact statistics but eggs tend to drop less often in older women. Also after you pass 30 your rates of having a child with down syndrome and other trisomy (having a part or an entire extra chromosome) diseases increases dramatically. Even assuming you are a healthy, active, woman without risks for diabetes, heart problems, or liver/kidney issues you may still be considered an \"at risk\" pregnancy. -Because it could be harder for you to keep a baby. So like I said you really need to talk to a OB at the very least, but preferably a genetic counselor to get the answers you need.",
