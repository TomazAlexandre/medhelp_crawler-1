            "answer": "Hello!The color of the breast may be affected by your bra, sweat or any allergies. Similarly a woman\u2019s areola may change color over time due to hormonal changes caused by menstruation, aging and certain medications. In a condition called inflammatory breast cancer there is redness; swelling and warmth in the breast and skin of breast may appear pink, reddish purple or bruised. The skin of breast appears like the skin of an orange. The skin in the armpit is normally darker than the rest of the skin. It is common amongst those who use any method of hair removal from their armpits. Hair removal creams generally contain chemicals which damages your skin making it darker. Another possibility is acanthosis nigricans.It is an autoimmune condition seen commonly in people who are obese and suffering from diabetes mellitus. An external examination is very important for correct diagnosis. Seek the opinion of a dermatologist. That will definitely be helpful. I do hope it helps.Best luck and regards!",
