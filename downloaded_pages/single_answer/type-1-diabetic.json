    "question": "I am having some issues, I am a 32 yo male, I have type 1 diabetes and I am having issues with slight breathing problems, a slight pain in the very bottom of my back, kinda in the middle and when I urinate its in spurts.\u00a0\u00a0I also had been severly severely constipated, and have been feeling nauseated.\u00a0\u00a0My legs were swelling but that has since stopped.\u00a0\u00a0I started a new job and I am just sitting at a desk for 8 hours and before I started work I was just lounging around at home.\u00a0\u00a0I seen my doctor and he said that I had circulation issues, that was the reason for the swelling, because my legs were only swelling when they were bent, like sitting in a chair.\u00a0\u00a0Can someone help me because I am seeing a Indian Health Services doctor and they seem to be kinda pushing me out, to get me out of the door?",
