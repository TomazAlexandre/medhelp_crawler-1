            "answer": "Blood glucose levels can have a significant impact on a developing baby, particularly during the early weeks of gestation.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on how \"out of control\" you have been, the baby is at an increased risk of defects to the brain/nervous system, heart/circulatory system.\u00a0\u00a0We always advise prospective moms to achieve reasonable blood glucose control prior to attempting to conceive:\u00a0\u00a0An A1c (which reflects 3 month average) of less than 7%, and reasonable stability without extreme highs or lows.Given that we cannot change history, you can put yourself in the best position for a successful pregnancy by managing your diabetes intensively from this point forward.\u00a0\u00a0It is usually best to work with a high-risk obstetrician and Certified Diabetes Educator who are experienced at the management of diabetes through pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Use of an insulin pump and/or continuous glucose monitor may also be to your advantage.There is a series of excellent articles on all aspects of managing diabetes through pregnancy at the \"Diabetes Sisters\" website:\u00a0\u00a0https://diabetessisters.org/pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0 I would also recommend the book \"Balancing Pregnancy with Pre-Existing Diabetes\" by Cheryl Alkon.",
