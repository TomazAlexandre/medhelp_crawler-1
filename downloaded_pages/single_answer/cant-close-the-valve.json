            "answer": "Hello,There are some causes which need to be evaluated for the dribbling of urine. An obstruction, anatomical malformations, foreign bodies or lesions at the tip of the urethra may cause dribbling of the urine.\u00a0\u00a0It can be due to prostrate, urethral stricture and narrowing of the urethral meatus. Regarding nocturia( urinating during night), it can be due to diabetes mellitus and diabetes inspidus, kidney stones, prostatitis, irritable bladder and hyperparathyroidism. I\u2019ll suggest you to consult a nephrologist and try to find out the underlying cause of nocturia.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
