    "question": "I suddenly developed a blind spot in my right eye.\u00a0\u00a0I was not injured and am an otherwise healthy 40 year old.\u00a0\u00a0 I went to my eye doctor who discovered a blood clot while doing a fluorescin angiography.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I immediately went to the hospital at his recommendation.\u00a0\u00a0They kept me for part of 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0They ran an MRI, MRA, ultrasound of carotid artery and lower legs, echocargiograms, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They could not find any clots or any other issues on any tests.\u00a0\u00a0 I was sent home and told to take 81 mg aspirins daily.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am happy that nothing was found but also don't like the feeling of not knowing why this appeared suddenly, if it may happen again and what I can do to get rid of the eye clot.\u00a0\u00a0Any advise?",
