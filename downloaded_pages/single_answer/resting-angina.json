    "question": "i am 40 yrs old and have been diabetic for 30 yrs. i have 4 stents, LAD , i believe is the problem area. My chest pain only occurs when i am at a normal heart rate and usually in the evenings. I can alleviate this by jumping on the elliptical walker for\u00a0\u00a015 or 20 minutes and it may not come back for two or three days, and it never occurs when i am walking, before, after, or during. Itry to keep my heartratearound 110, max 120, and i have no symptoms whatsoever. I exercise daily. I was just curious as towhy this may be and could these attacks be caused by low blood sugar, because i have noticed i am usually in the 60-90 range on my blood sugar when this occurs. Simply put i can alleviate the pain w/ exercise, and the pain is not brought on by exercising.",
