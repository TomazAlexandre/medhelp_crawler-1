    "question": "Hi. My mom had gestational diabetes when she was pregnant with me. So I have been overweight all my life. I am 36 yrs old. I have started exercising rigorously for the past 3 months. I have dropped 1 dress size, but my weight is in the same ball park. I am eating healthier & about the same amount as before but in intervals, why am I not able to lose weight? I can understand building muscle \u2013 which I guess has dropped my dress size. It is a little hard staying motivated. Any help will be greatly appreciated.",
