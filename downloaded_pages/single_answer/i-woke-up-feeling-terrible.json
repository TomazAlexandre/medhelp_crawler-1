            "answer": "I hope this is resolved for you ..... I get the exact same feelings with bad attacks - it takes me days to weeks to feel normal - *****.Mine is related to my adrenal glands - I hurt them when we couldn't get my \"asthma\" (still in the air for the proper diagnosis - doesnt behave like it should) under control and I was on large amounts of inhaled steroids and prednisone.\u00a0\u00a0Now I know when stressed I sleep as much as possible (boss hates it), add extra vitamins and salt.\u00a0\u00a0It takes a week or so but I can get it to bounce back.I would talk to your doctor - they may want to do some blood tests and make sure everything is alright.\u00a0\u00a0If it comes back normal I would suggest talking to a naturopath, that is who helped me understand the adrenal fatigue and figured out my allergies as well. good luck!",

    "question": "Hello, I have a serious question to ask. Three days ago on 1/10/15 I went to the hospital due to a severe asthma attack.I woke up about 30 minutes ago from a nap and my head felt like lead, my arms and legs felt tingly and weak, and I was really light headed / Exahausted. My family background has Diabetes, hypoglycemia, mental issues (adhd, Bi-polar, Nervous breakdown, Anxiety) and Thyroid issues.I am really concerned about this.I also woke up with a sharp numbing pain in my lower back, and I almost fell out of my bed.",
