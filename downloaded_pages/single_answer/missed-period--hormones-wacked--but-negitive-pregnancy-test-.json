            "answer": "Hi!If you have missed your periods and have been moody and have gained weight, then it could be due to pregnancy, polycystic ovaries, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and liver problems. You can go for a blood pregnancy test, which is not very expensive, as this will confirm whether you are pregnant or not. If pregnancy is ruled out, then other causes will need to be investigated. Take care!",

    "question": "It has been 42 days since the first day of my last period. Normally I am fairly regular and on a 34 day cycle. A year and a half ago, I was on birth control which put me on a 28 day cycle. When I got off, I thought I was late a couple times while my body readjusted to its normal routine. My husband and I have unprotected sex often, but he is supposed to be infertile because of a genetic abnormality. There is a chance, but it's pretty microscopic (my MIL likes to remind me that \"it only takes one\"). I know my hormones are wacked. I've been moody, irritable, anxious, my breasts are tender and swollen like when I'm on my period, fatigue, headaches, and frequent urination. I have been a little nauseous, but that might be due to anxiety. I have done an over the counter test, and I went to a free clinic (no health insurance) both were pee tests and both neg. I'm scared that I might be really sick. I've gained like 5 pounds, haven't changed my diet, and wasn't stressed out until my period was late for five days. Could I be pregnant? Should I be worried about my health or could it just be a phase? I'm 22, so perimenopause is out.",
