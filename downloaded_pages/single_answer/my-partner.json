            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are many causes of nerve disorder causing pins and needles or glove-and-stocking neuropathy including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis and lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated.Since there was shivering diabetes and hypothyroidism should be ruled out first.Since I cannot examine your partner and know other related conditions he/she may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
