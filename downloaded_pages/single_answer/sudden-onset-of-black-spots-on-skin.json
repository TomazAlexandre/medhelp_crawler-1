            "answer": "I have never heard of the black spots being a side effect of diabetes. You should get it checked out very soon.\u00a0\u00a0Question? Has your weight always been this low?\u00a0\u00a0Are you sure it is diabetic neuropathy?\u00a0\u00a0You said you were diagnosed recently? How is your diabetes being treated?\u00a0\u00a0Were you overweight before? or did you drop weight when you found out you were diabetic? I know lots of questions not all related to your spots.\u00a0\u00a0What kind of numbers do you get when you check your B.S.?\u00a0\u00a0Have you had the 3 month ac1 test. May have spelled that wrong but it is the average of your sugars. The blood is taken at a lab usually.The spots? I would call your doctor. It may be some kind of fungus , but please don't ignore it!!\u00a0\u00a0My son had something that sounds similar on his feet.\u00a0\u00a0He refused to go to the doctor.... they itched. I had him get antifungal powder.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hope to hear how you make out!!!",

    "question": "Recently, i was diagnosed with diabetes type 2. I weigh about 80lbs and am 5'2\" tall and am 34yrs old. I am also currently suffering from neuropathic pain all over my body. In addition, about a dozen or so small black spots have begun to appear around my body (arms and trunk). I'm concerned about the sudden onset of the black spots, the edges are even and they are not irregular in shape, they are about 1 to 2 mm and are very slightly raised. Should i be concerned?",
