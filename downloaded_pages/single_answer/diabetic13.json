            "answer": "Hi!Your best bet is In vitro fertilization. This will give you the fastest results and the lowest risk for complications. When someone has diabetes, it is also important\u00a0\u00a0to have their family as soon as possible too!If one of your tubes is open, there is a chance that you can conceive on your own, but be very sure to watch for signs and symptoms of tubal (ectopic) pregnancy if you do.\u00a0\u00a0I always want to see my patients ASAP and check hormone levels as well as an early ultrasound to be sure the pregnancy is in the right spot.Another option for you would be to see a specialist in reproductive endocrinology about a tuboplasty.\u00a0\u00a0This is an operation in which they go in and do microscopic surgery on the tubes to clean them out and open them. I have even heard of a procedure that is done vaginally in which they insert a balloon into the tubes and dilate them like they do for blockages in the heart. Again, the problem is that the tubes remain scarred, and the risk for tubal pregnancy is high.Even with IVF it is possible to get a tubal pregnancy, but most of the doctors you meet will probably recommend this option as your first choice if it is logistically possible for you to do it.Good luck!Dr B",
