Good for you.There are some useful elements to be explored, upon viewingyour situation from a\u00a0\u00a0higher perspective .1.\u00a0\u00a0At least one significant underlying and linked to most of your conditions pathogenic factor.2. Unresolved issues at the emotional/mental/spiritual level (perhaps you may not even be aware-as they may only exist in the subconscious).Hmm. Where to start?***Could you list any significant events as far back as you can remember, prior to the onset of your conditions?Could you also list tests, scans, symptoms, meds and how you got diagnosed for each of your conditions? (I know I'm asking for a lot, but please take your time as there's no need to rush this).There are many things that can be done, but it may take time to sort all this out and implement an improvement plan.So please stick around, you seem to have the right attitude and you made the first step towards your health goal already, by posting here today.**You may pm if you prefer.Take care,Niko",
