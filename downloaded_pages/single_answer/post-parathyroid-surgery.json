            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!What you now have is chronic diarrhea. This can be due to parasitic infestations. Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, coelic disease, crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc. Parathyroid and thyroid problems can coexist and so also diabetes.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
