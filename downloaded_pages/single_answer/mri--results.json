            "answer": "Hi!Scattered foci of increased T2/Flair signals indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.So, yes MS is a possibility which can be ruled out by a spinal tap. However there are other causes as well. These need to be investigated.The spinal disc problems can also contribute to headaches and some of your symptoms. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "i recently received my MRI results throught the post and am really confused?? the results read as follows;showed minor and non-specific T2 and flair high-signal foci in the periventricular deep white matter of the temporal-occipital lobes bilaterally. at the C6/7 level, there is some loss of disc hydration and height, which is associated with diffuse disc bulge....i am a migraine sufferer and am also diagnosed with Fibroyalgia, i have an almost constant tremor, trouble emptying my bladder, poor focus in my eye's and most of the associated symptoms of FMS....does this above result mean that i could have MS?? many thanks in advance Claire",
