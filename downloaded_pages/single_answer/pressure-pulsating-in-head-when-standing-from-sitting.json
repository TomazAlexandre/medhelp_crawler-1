            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Normally when we stand, our blood pressure may drop about 10 mmHg with a rise in heart rate of 5-20 beats per minute. However, if blood pressure drops more than 20 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing, we call this orthostatic hypotension. If there is no drop in blood pressure but there is a rise in heart rate of > 30 beats per minute, this may be a condition called POTS. Orthostatic hypotension can cause symptoms of dizziness, vision dimming, discomfort in the head and neck, falls, etc.It is important to be evaluated for other causes of hypotension such as anemia, infection, dehydration, drug induced, cardiovascular dysfunction (such as an arrhythmia), diabetes, etc.There are medications, devices, and behavioral changes that can be used to help with orthostatic hypotension. These can be discussed with your primary physician if he/she feels you have orhostasis.I suggest you follow up with your primary care physician for further diagnosis and management.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "When I stand from a sitting position (especially after sitting for a long time, as when driving), as soon as I begin to walk I get extreme pressure/throbbing in my upper body, especially head/neck/sinuses area. The worst part is over within one minute and all signs of it are completely gone within 2 min.\u00a0\u00a0It happens more in the afternoon/evening. It almost feels like blood rushing to these areas very rapidly. It's worse if I begin to walk as soon as I stand up.\u00a0\u00a0If I stand still for at least 30 seconds before moving (slowly) it's not as bad. What can this be?",
