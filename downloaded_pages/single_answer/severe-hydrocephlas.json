            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry, but looks like you have got the units wrong. If they are correct, then yes, this could be serious. However, I am not focusing on the readings you have uploaded.Lateral ventricles are prominent at 11 weeks of gestation and thereafter decrease in prominence as compared to rest of the brain. At 33 weeks to birth they are about 11-13mm in width has a FC distance of about 36-40mm (distance between falx to inner skull tabe). If there is prominence of ventricles at 34 weeks then this can be due to chromosomal abnormalities, increased CSF formation, poor brain development or taking some drugs not advised during pregnancy or due to maternal diabetes. At times the cause is not known. However, most of babies with lateral ventricle size of 10mm do not develop hydrocephalus. If the ventricle size is 15 mm or more, chances of associated chromosomal abnormalities and herniation of brain called Chiari malformations are more. There can also be other malformations such as Dandy Walker malformations, neural tube defects, or corpus callosum agenesis. Hydrocephalus usually develops.If only lateral ventricle enlargement is an isolated finding, then prognosis is excellent. However, the baby will need to be monitored after birth to detect any abnormality at the first instance. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
