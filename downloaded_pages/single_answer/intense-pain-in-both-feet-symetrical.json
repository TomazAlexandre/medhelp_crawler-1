            "answer": "Hi Kelly,How are you feeling now?Did you have any trauma to the foot?Has any cardiologist evaluated you to rule out any Aneurysm (Abdominal Aorta).Diabetes or prediabetes can cause nerve injury, leading to severe pain in foot.I think you should take a review opinion from a neurologist to search for a cause.You can start on combination of analgesics like NSAID'S plus Opoid analgesics.Alternatively you can also consult pain management specialist.Hope this helps you.Bye.",

    "question": "am having severe pain in the tops of both feet and the balls of my feet.\u00a0\u00a0I thought it was because of wearig ill fitting shoes to a Wedding but this has been going on since 5 weeks now.\u00a0\u00a0I saw a podiatrist and a neurologist and an internist and they are all baffled because the pain is so symetrical.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking pain medicine and they have me on some patches that numb the feet but still no answers.\u00a0\u00a0They ran my blood work and all seems fine.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to have flared up overnight and I am having a hard time sleeping even with the pain pills.\u00a0\u00a0I'm really started to get depressed and am worried sick.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone help me?\u00a0\u00a0I have been under tremendous stress but would that present as pain in both feet at exactly the same place?\u00a0\u00a0Also, my tongue is a bit numb can barely taste food.\u00a0\u00a0This may be completely unrelated.\u00a0\u00a0I'm mostly concerned with the painful feet.\u00a0\u00a0It is excruciating.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
