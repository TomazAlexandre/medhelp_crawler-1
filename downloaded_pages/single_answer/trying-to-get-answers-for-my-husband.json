            "answer": "That's interesting that the neuro that he is seeing now says that he doesn't have Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease, yet, the doctor's said that he did have it when he was younger. I don't think it goes away.The electric shock sensations sound somewhat MS-like, however it sounds like his c-spine MRI was clear of lesions. I wonder if the compressed disc could also cause these types of symptoms.I'm really not sure. It's hard to find a good doctor. And it's hard to sometimes find doctors that come up with the same cause of various symptoms. One will point one way, while another one will point in the opposite direction.Good luck,Kelly",

    "question": "Over the past 8 months my husband has been seeing a neuro and most recently a pain management doctor. A little history is when he was 12 years old the Shriner's diagnosed him with CMT atypical, it has only affected his left leg and somewhat his left arm, but not atrophied the muscle very noticably.His symptoms over the past few months have been:A shocking sensation from his head to his toes, happens even when he just blinks his eyes. (says it feels like he is getting electrical shocks)Cognitive problems, he can't concentrate to save his life.his left upper leg muscle is wasting away very quicklyHe is getting muscle twitches all the time, I see them when he is just sitting thereHe was diagnosed with diabetes in Dec of last year along with liver disease.April of this year neuro ordered a MRI of brain, came back with \"lesions on the pons\", he ordered one of spine and that came back \"normal, but did show that he has collapsed discs in the neck\" Then we just had a new MRI done last month and the results now say \"T2/Flair in the pons\".Does any of this sound like MS? His brian MRI did not say that there were lesions anywhere else. His neuro seems to be knowledable, but on teh other hand said my husband does not have CMT and he can only think he has \"a hereditary neuorpathy\"We are at a loss as to what could be wrong and we have decided that come January he will apply for diability and I will be the sole breadwinner. I just hope and pray he gets approved for disability and it doesn't take YEARS.Thanks for any insight you may be able to shed, we see the neuro again this Saturday.",
