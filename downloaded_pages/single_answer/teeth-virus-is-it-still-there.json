            "answer": "So you had the two teeth removed? and there's no more symptoms?I think at this point most people would let it go, and practice the best oral hygiene possible.ie. flossing (after every meal or snack)waterpic (after every meal or snack)\u00a0\u00a0,brushing at least twice with an electric toothbrush (gums, tongue, teeth)and vigorously swishing mouthwash until it loses it's sting (you can get used to doing this while using the toilet).Aside from that , if you want to be really careful and cover all your bases, you'll read up on what could be happening by the symptoms that you've had, and maybe have with the redness.There's an article that talks about what could be happening that would show up as oral problems at http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/DataStatistics/SurgeonGeneral/sgr/chap3.htmie. Many systemic diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, osteoporosis, and AIDS, as well as therapies for systemic diseases, can directly or indirectly compromise oral tissues//\u00a0\u00a0Less common but very serious are oral and pharyngeal cancers.So, in order to err on the side of caution, you might want to go to your doctor and ask to have a full physical to set your mind at ease. (if you haven't done so in the past year) Usually this is done every year at the doctor's office, or ideally should be done. I'm sure that they would run the tests again, to ease your mind some. You can never be too careful.I hope that you do go to your doctor, i think it might be the only way to truly give you some closure.,",
