            "answer": "It does sound like hypglycemic to a point. If you are, food a.m.really is the most important along w/ the right snacks duringthe day & before bed. When I was a kid, thought I was slow inschool if I didn't eat before. Didn't know it though. Yearslater I was a snacker of nuts/apples & brain fog left & I thought I could retain anything I read. Still didn't get it.In my 20's I got brain fog & mentioned it to my Dr. I had astress job & seldom had time to eat/snack. He pointed out I was also acting complaining/cranky. He returned w/ a sliced apple &a jar of peanut butter w/ orange jc. He said EAT! I'll be back.20 min later, I was a calm patient w/ know hands going all overtrying to talk. Dx's = hypoglycemia. I didn't need a test, I needed the right nutrient. Complex carbs are a life saver. Theapple/peanut-butter is perfect to keep insulin from spikingthat can help brain/tremors/jittery/thinking & stops the muscleattacks to stay toned. A sm. hand of almonds 6 times a day isgood too. Don't need alot. If your over the crisis response in20 min., most likely that's the problem. Most bloodwk doesn'tshow it for some reason. I travel w/ fruit & a jar wherever Igo along w/ almonds. You'll have better focus & won't spike.Vegans have this problem. Some of us just get stressed & spike.Eat sm. throughout the day & avoid junk food. At night, trysome lean protein or again nuts.
