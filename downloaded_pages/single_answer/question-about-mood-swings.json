    "question": "Ok, i can have a great day a t work come home to my girlfriend and tell her about my day. Everything seems fine and then bam, she says something that either irritates me or just rejects my advances or touches. Then my mood goes from extremly high and happy to deep down and depressed. It is having an huge effect on my everyday life. i am not on any medications..wondering if i should. i tend to ramble alot and change subjects very quickly. i have aa huge lebido when it comes to sex, two or fives times a day i want it. I over think everything, i can't fall alseep like a normal person. i ruminate right before i fall asleep and when i wake up thru the night it takes me forever to fall back asleep.so i am wondering if i need medication ( i know i do) parents, friends and the girlfriend say i should go see my dr. so i made an appointment with a pschiatrist ( spelling is terrible i am sorry)\u00a0\u00a0but it isn't until october. what shall i do in the mean time????????steve",
