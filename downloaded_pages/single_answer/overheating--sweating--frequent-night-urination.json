            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Getting up at night to urinate at the age of 62, with a history of prostate cancer, you should ask the doctor to look for regional metastasis that behave like benign hypertrophy of prostate (meaning they press the bladder neck as a hypertrophied prostate would have).The other possibility is diabetes.Increased sweating is a side effect of Cardura. You need to discuss this with your doctor and weigh the benefits of taking this drug against the side effects.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My real question regards excessive sweating and not being able to cool down normally. After working outside and becoming hot, I have to come inside to an air conditioned environment and usually run a fan on me and drink cold water.My dad sweated a lot too, so part of this must be hereditary, but why can't I cool down like I used to when younger.I can jog on a treadmill at 3-4 mph for 30 min inside and can handle that fine.I'm 62, was in good health last check up, and have just had cardiac work done and I received a clean bill of health.I am taking quite a few medications: 300mg broproprinone, 10-20mg diazepam, 4mg cardura, 10 mg Vytorin [cardura is for complications from radiation therapy for prostrate cancer in 2002, Vytorin for slightly elevated triglycerides & cholesterol].Also, I often have to get up 5 times a night to urinate, which makes getting a good nights sleep a little difficult.I'm seeing my doctor next Monday, and am going to discuss this with him, but would really appreciate any comments or opinions. This sweating is just crazy. I've always been in good shape, but this seemed to have developed just recently, especially this not being able to cool down normally.Thanks.",
