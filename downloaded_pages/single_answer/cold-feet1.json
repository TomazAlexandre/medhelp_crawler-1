            "answer": "Hi there. Cold feet and hands can occur due to raynaud\u2019s syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, frostbite, cryo globulins, hypothyroidism, and allergies. Reynaud\u2019s syndrome is a vasospastic disorder where the smallest blood vessels in toes start to constrict causing discoloration, brittle nails. These changes can begin when exposed to extreme cold temperature or emotionally upset. Peripheral vascular disease esp. in diabetes arteries constrict and prevent free flow of blood circulation. Cryoglobulinemia is a medical condition where blood contains large no. of cryoglobulin proteins which on reduction in temperature becomes insoluble. These insoluble proteins make the blood thick and obstruct its flow causing cold feet, stroke etc. You could massage the sole of the feet vigorously, wear warm socks, and go to the neurologist for medical conditions. Take care.",

    "question": "Has anyone ever experience cold feet due to the S1 and S5 nerve being compressed from a herneated disc? I had a discectomy done last month. I still have the cold feet. I was tested already for diabeteas and for pda. And for thyroid. All were fine. I was told that my S1 and S5 nerve might cause coldness in my feet if they were\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone ever have or had that feeling in there foot or feet? It drives me nuts. It sounds like a circulation problem but I dont know what else to to. I am on that nasty Lyrica crap (150mg) which does not help the coldness. I'm talking cold feet not numbness. I was also told that it will take time for the nerves to heal and come back to life. Is that true? How long does it take for a nerve to be healed?",
