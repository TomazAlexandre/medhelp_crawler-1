    "question": "I'm currently 15 years old. I weigh 125 pounds and I'm 5'2 and a half. I can go 2 days without eating little to no food, because of my appetite not being very active. Then after about 2 days of eating little to no food, I EAT LIKE A PIG.I do not have normal bowel movements. I may pass 4 in a week. I do drink fluids quite a bit. The only medical history i have in my family are diabetes, high and low blood pressure,and cardiac issues (i have low blood pressure, but not dangerously low, it stays about 95/58.) i've also been having symptoms of diabetes, i just haven't checked my blood sugar. i don't know if my blood sugar might be high and then i don't eat for awhile or what..please help. I do have an issue with dropping weight out of the blue also.",
