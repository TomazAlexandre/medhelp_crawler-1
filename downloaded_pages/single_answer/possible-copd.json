            "answer": "Hi, COPD is usually diagnosed by lung function tests. A diagnosis of COPD is made when the FEV1/FVC ratio is less than 70%. The commonest cause for COPD is smoking. The lungs age with smoking as in comparison to the person\u2019s age. If you stop smoking at this point, the lungs are not damaged any further, though the damage that has already been done cannot be reversed. So, giving up smoking would be first step towards controlling COPD.The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. As lung disorders have been ruled out, it could be due to cardiac disorders.\u00a0\u00a0In cardiac disorders the heart is unable to pump the blood adequately, more so when subjected to stress like exercise. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. So, please discuss these options with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance. Regards.",
