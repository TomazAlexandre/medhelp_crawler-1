            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Several risk factors are considered that may increase the\u00a0\u00a0risk of colon cancer such as age, personal history of colorectal cancer or polyps, inflammatory intestinal conditions, inherited syndromes that increase colon cancer risk, low fiber and high fat diet, sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, obesity, smoking, alcohol intake, exposure to radiation therapy and family history of colon cancer and colon polyps. Since your father and and mom's father have history of colon cancer, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Aside from lifestyle modification, further tests may be done such as blood tests, colonoscopy or imaging studies. Colon cancer screening such as annual fecal occult blood testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years, colonoscopy every 10 years, CT colonography every five yearsand stool DNA testing may be done. Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables and whole grains; avoid or drink alcohol in moderation, stop smoking, exercise most days of the week, and maintain a healthy weight. Discuss this with your doctor for proper evaluation.Take care and best regards.",
