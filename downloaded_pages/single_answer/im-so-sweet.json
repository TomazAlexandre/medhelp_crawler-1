It can't hurt to be tested for diabetes if you have other symptoms as well. You might be experiencing low blood sugar during the night. Try a snack before bed.",

    "question": "I sweat a lot when I sleep. I don't feel like I've rested if I don't sweat. Its only on my neck & chest that I sweat. not my face or extremities. I've done this since I was a teen (41 now) but have never been diagnosed with diabetes. Occasionally my sweat smells sweet, but not with any consistency. I have not noticed my urine smelling sweet. What else might it be?",
