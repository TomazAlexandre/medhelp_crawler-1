            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Please do not worry as these symptoms do not sound like those of MS as of now. Peripheral neuropathy is the first possibility that comes to mind, however your B12 levels are normal. Other possibility is diabetes. Did you get a blood sugar test done?Fibromyalgia can also cause non specific pains and cramps along with tingling numbness.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FibromyalgiaPlease discuss this possibility with your doctor. Meanwhile eat healthy and sleep on time, hopefully your symptoms will resolve. Take care!",

    "question": "I've been having strange symptoms for about six months now which none of the doctors that I have seen can really make heads or tails of.\u00a0\u00a0It began with a sort of partial numbness in my face, seemingly radiating from the jaw.\u00a0\u00a0Soon afterward I noticed this feeling spreading over larger parts of my body especially in my throat (I often feel like I have something caught in my throat, but the sensation moves around), and in my left arm and left leg (and especially around the ankle, knee, and shoulder).\u00a0\u00a0At its worst I had some serious trouble moving around;\u00a0\u00a0I would walk about four or five blocks and need to sit down.Since then it's been getting steadily better -- I can walk around normally without getting winded, but I seem to be stuck at 85% better.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I feel mostly normal, but I often feel a sort of numbness in my left leg and left arm which is accompanied by a mild weakness (not a weakness that prevents me from doing anything, but I feel unsteady on my left leg and my left arm feels slightly out of my control). This comes and goes, but is exacerbated in particular settings, often after I take a hot shower or when I sit for a while (often as little as 10 minutes) in direct sunlight.\u00a0\u00a0Alcohol also seems to agitate my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0In addition I've now begun to get some strange twitching in my shoulders (both of them, but mostly the left shoulder).\u00a0\u00a0This appears to be positional (i.e. it springs up when my arm is in certain positions that strain the triceps or biceps (although the strain doesn't need to be particularly severe to set this off), and it lasts a long time (once my triceps was twitching once every three-or-so seconds for about three hours!).I've been tested for a number of things: Lyme was negative; I've had my potassium levels checked and they were normal;\u00a0\u00a0I've even had an MRI which came back \"unremarkable.\"\u00a0\u00a0The only ting that was a little bit low was my B-12 level, which was at the very low end of normal, although when the test was repeated it came back more solidly normal.\u00a0\u00a0I've been on sublingual B-12 supplements for a while now.Do any of you have any ideas or suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0My doctors seem happy to shrug at me and say they can't figure it out, but this is having a serious impact on my quality of life: I can't really run or bike because of the weakness; I can't spend much time outside because of the reaction to direct sunlight; the whole thing is making me depressed.Do any of you have any suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like MS (despite the clear MRI) or ALS or anything?\u00a0\u00a0I'd like to be able to bring some ideas to the table the next time I see my doctors, since they don't seem compelled to think too hard about it on their own (which is very frustrating).Thanks!",
