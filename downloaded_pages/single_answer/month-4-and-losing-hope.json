    "question": "My husband and I have been married for almost 5 years and trying for 3. Last fall I changed Obgyn who referred me to a RE. I have know for many years that I have PCOS and diabetes, and have very irregular cycle. I did all the testing with the RE, and we started provera and clomid treatments in January. I didn't ovulate in January so lost that month. I have ovulated the last 3 months though. Also my cycle for the last 2 months has come on it's own...which is great because the provera really made me depressed. Each month the days inbetween cycles gets more normal 40, 36, and most recently 32. So this month I went for monitoring on 13th and there were 2 follicles so to start with sex. On the 18th and 19th of last week I had some cramping. I thought it odd since too late to be ovulation pain and too early for menstration cramps. Plus I have been experiencing some nausea and heartburn which is not something that usually happens. This month though overall has been the most difficult. I have been more depressed about the whole process and stressing out. My doctor will let me be on clomid 6 tries. But then we are not able to move onto IUI or IVF because of my husbands religious beliefs...so I really need this to work. I have been taking my basal temp, doing weekly acupuncture, changed my diet to more fruit and veggies, lost 25 lbs, cut out caffenine, and even last week started seeing a therapist. I have read so many books and studies, but just don't know what else to do. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Best of luck to all of you!",
