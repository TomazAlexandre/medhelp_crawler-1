    "question": "My son is 10, and has had type 1 diabetes since age 5. This past Saturday he was rushed to the hospital with seizures. Just one week ago he started 12mg of Zoloft. the doctors are saying that would not be the cause. They do not believe that it was a diabetic seizure. we are going for a MRI and an EEG next week. The seizures were mostly on his right side. When he had the seizure I checked his glucose and it was 338- Any input you could give me would be great!",
