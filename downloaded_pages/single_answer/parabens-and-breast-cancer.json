    "question": "I have been doing a lot of reading about various ways we can reduce our risks of cancer and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have recently learnt that parabens are the least harmful preservative put into cosmetics, bath products, lotions - face and body, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I have also read that these products contain formaldehydes (scary!).What I also read is that parabens have been found in all of the breast cancer tumours tested (for parabens).\u00a0\u00a0100%.\u00a0\u00a0so, what I want to know is if more reasearch is being done to prove that these are a causative factor for breast cancer?I really don't want to put these chemicals into/on my body, so I started to use Sense skin and bath products.\u00a0\u00a0High antioxidants, NO preservatives at all.\u00a0\u00a0If any one else is concerned, I signed up as a customer online at www.nutriceuticals.usana.com (you can order \"retail\", but registered customers save 10%, and there are packages deals, etc.)\u00a0\u00a0It isn't sold in stores.\u00a0\u00a0it is the safest product out there that I have found.\u00a0\u00a0my friend told me about that site, and i am so happy she did.\u00a0\u00a0I never used to think twice about what I washed with, hydrated my skin with, and so on.",
