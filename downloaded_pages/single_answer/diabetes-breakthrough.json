            "answer": "Jerry,i'm no doctor and only know of aspirin in the salicylates category. Though i am assuming that this would benefit the type 2 diabetic more than the type 1. Most type 1 diabetics are not overweight, and it is type 2 who have the tendency of getting it when overweight. But perhaps this may lead to help finding what does trigger the genetic response in type 1's.i don't know how much you'd take if aspirin was the drug and if they haven't released it in their article then it may still need more study. Hope you eventually find what you are looking for, though it may have to wait for further study. Good luck, bret",

    "question": "I read on the Joslin website that their scientists have discovered the \"master switch\" that causes diabetes\u00a0\u00a0in overweight people.\u00a0\u00a0It is low grade inflamation caused by excess weight.\u00a0\u00a0They say that this low grade inflamation can be turned off by taking a class of drugs called salicylates which includes aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0They call this a major milestone in understanding why overweight people are more prone to becoming diabetic. This was just released and is the lead story on the home page of their website.Does anyone have any addition info on this or knows what drugs are in the salicylates category.\u00a0\u00a0If aspirin is one of the drugs, how much should you take daily?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks,\u00a0\u00a0Jerry",
