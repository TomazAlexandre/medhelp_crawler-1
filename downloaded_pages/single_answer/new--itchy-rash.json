    "question": "Hi there!I have had type 1 diabetes for about 18 years, I am 36.\u00a0\u00a0Last year I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, which had been contributing to lack of ability to stabilize my blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0I have been experiencing hair loss for a while, since I began having hyperthyroid problems (weight loss, feeling hot, mentally irrational).\u00a0\u00a03 months ago I came down with an itchy red rash on my trunk.\u00a0\u00a0It has persisted & is getting worse, spreading to my temples & hairline.I visited a dermatologist recently but didn't feel satisfied being given a steroid creme & being told it was caused by stress.Any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned that the rash could be a side effect of my thyroid medication.\u00a0\u00a0Or possible a sign of some other autoimmune problem.I'd be grateful for any help!\u00a0\u00a0What I'd also really like to find is a recommendation for a trustworthy & thorough endocrinologist in the Minneapolis/St. Paul MN area.Thanks :)",
