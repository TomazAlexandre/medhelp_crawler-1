            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0If your mother is having a hip replacement because of a condition which is unrelated to her breast cancer (example: arthritis), she shouldn't have to worry about the possibility of the surgery triggering a cancer recurrence.If she has any other chronic illnesses - heart disease, diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - these may pose an increased risk for the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0These other illnesses can potentially delay recovery from the surgery or cause medical complications intra-operatively.",

    "question": "My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer 6 years ago and had a mascetomy. She is now 76 years old and has been doing well - no signs of the cancer. She now has been told that she needs a hip replacement. I am wondering if there are any additional risks - my sister thinks that her having the hip replacement surgery is going to trigger a reoccurence of the cancer.Would appreciate any opinions or comments.",
