            "answer": "You need to get to a new doctor. Demand your GP send you to an endocrinologist or an internal medicine doctor. But, please research the endo. Many specialize in diabetes and don't know diddly about treating thyroid.I have no idea why your doctor is only treating your TSH when you have Hashimoto's. He needs to be treating your FT3/FT4 levels. TSH is secondary. Please get a second opinion. If you have hypo symptoms, then you need to get your meds adjusted...bottom line!You probably need your meds increased and I wonder if you should have a T3 drug like Cytomel (Levo is only a T4 drug) added to the mix. Although we don't know since your T3 isn't being measured.Once you get your results of your FT3/FT4 tests, post them here.We recently fired my mom's endo because he is treating her TSH levels and ignoring her 1.1 level FT4 (range for FT4 is 0.8-1.8) but she clearly has hypo symptoms and could benefit from her FT4 to be in the upper end of the range.Take care...:) Tamra",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Hashimotos after birthing twins in 2008. I am currently on 50mcg/75mcg Levothyroxine and am now approximately 7 weeks pregnant. At 6 weeks my GP was confident in only testing my TSH which read 2.2. My concern with this is that I am really struggling to keep the chill under control, all my arms and legs feel like I've had a couple of tetanus injections in each, and I feel zoned out in a zombi kind of way. I've asked if they would test my T3 and T4 (but must confess my ignorance on how these numbers relate/behave). I do understand that HCG and Estrogen can impact my TSH. If you could suggest the right words for me to ask my GP again or shed some light on the above, I would greatly appreciate that. I am truly concerned about the development of my bubba and my capacity to parent my now 18 month old twins.",
