            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.There is no \"hard and fast rule\" that at 25 years a diabetic must switch from oral hypoglycemics to insulin.\u00a0\u00a0 Oral hypoglycemics work by helping a type 2 diabetic use the insulin their body produces more effectively.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, as the disease progresses for type 2 diabetics, they sometimes produce less and less insulin and therefore have to switch to insulin to control their blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor will help you decide when to start considering insulin instead of or in addition to oral hypoglycemics.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps. Good luck.Bridget",
