    "question": "Hi,I am 21 years old and having a hard time getting an erection. I use to masterbate 2 times a day and now I can't even get my penis to get hard. I have had a new girlfriend for the past 4 months and have been having the best sex I have ever had with her. Sadly, for the past week or so I have been unable to get an erection and my testicles, have sort of became saggy and look weird.Can I please get some help with this? Whats wrong with me?",
