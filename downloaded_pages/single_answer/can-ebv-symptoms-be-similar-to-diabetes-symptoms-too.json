    "question": "Hi, I recently realize eating very less carb and sugar helps ease my 6 month old symptoms.Symptoms such as:- Chills- Chills/burning sensation at start from the feet in the morning, then spreads later to all over the body.- mild pain on lymph nodes, all lymph node areas- low tolerance to heat and cold- growling stomach- hair fallI have this pain everyday and as I was getting little better, but with just a few 6 cookie sweets and realize my symptoms would flare up.I don't feel thirsty or tired or thirsty though. but the chills specialy from my feet and hairfall makes me think, maybe I have diabetes? am i being silly?had a sugar test maybe 9 months ago and it was fine. and I am just 30 years old.",
