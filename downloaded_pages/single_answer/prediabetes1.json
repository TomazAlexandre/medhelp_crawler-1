            "answer": "Hi,I don't think 100 is low enough to cause a shakey feeling.Usually that would occur at 70 or less, depending on how sensitive a person is.\u00a0\u00a0Though I understnaed that feeling could happen if blood sugar falls very quickly, though again I wouldn't have thought that likely at 100.Will be interesting to see what your five hour results are.Best wishes",

    "question": "Hello,I am being tested for Diabetes right now. I have been feeling very lightheaded lately if I miss a meal or sometimes right after. I went to the ER 1 hour after a meal and my blood glucose was 200. The next day they did a 3 HR glucose tolerance test and my fasting was 100 and the high was 168.My Endo want to do a 5 hr test next week.QUESTION: I was told to take my blood at home before a meal, 1 hr after a meal and then again 3 hrs after. My readings before a meal are about 100,1 hr. after a meal..1453 hrs after a meal...back to 100I seem to be\u00a0\u00a0getting \"shaky\" and my heart races about 3 hrs after I eat when my # ia 100.Do you think 100 is low enough to casue this feeling?Any input would be greatly appreciated as I am new at this!!Thanks,Donna",
