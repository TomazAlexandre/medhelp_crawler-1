            "answer": "I am assuming that your company offers no disability benefits or you would not be asking about other possibilities. Please check with your state department of labor to see what state-sponsored disability compensation you may be eligible for. It varies from state to state. The local dept. of labor may have a job line and may be able to connect you with another job if you connect with them. As for your health problems, I fully understand your situation. I have been diabetic for 34 years myself. I would encourage you to tighten up your blood sugar control as much as possible in order to avoid other health complications due to diabetes. It is never too late to get those blood sugar levels as normal as possible, and doing this can prevent further damage to your body. I cannot stress this enough, for it is not invevitable to have these things happen. I wish you the best of luck with your state labor department.",
