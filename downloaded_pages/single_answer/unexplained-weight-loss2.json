            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Unintentional and unexplained weight loss of this magnitude is definitely not good. There are many causes like worms in stool, depression, anorexia nervosa, AIDS, cancers especially colon cancers, drug abuse, infections and loss of appetite. Loss of appetite can again be due to certain medications, drug abuse, depression, AIDS, acute and chronic infections, cancers and hypothyroidism. Either you do not eat well or there is increased metabolism as in hyperthyroid states, HIV, cancer etc. Poor absorption as in irritable bowel syndromes and malabsorption syndromes too is possible. Malabsorptin syndromes are seen in intestinal tuberculosis, HIV, tropical sprue, parasites in stool and Whipple\u2019s Disease.I have enumerated the possibilities that come to my mind right now. Hope this helps. Please consult your gastroenterologist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
