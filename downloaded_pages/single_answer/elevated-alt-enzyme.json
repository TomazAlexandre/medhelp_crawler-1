            "answer": "Hello sir and hope you are doing well.Yes the persisting high ALT levels could be due to fatty liver changes. Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. So, have your lipid profile done and try to bring the fatty changes under control. Also, avoid drugs like paracetomol and sedatives. Get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B. Take a good protein diet. I would advise you to wait for now and repeat the test after four weeks to see how the levels are progressing.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
