            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for posting your query.I can understand your concern for the erection problems that you are facing due to chronic prostatitis. Chronic prostatitis is basically discomfort or pain that you feel in your lower pelvic region - mainly at the base of your penis and around your anus for many months. It causes sexual problems as well like some people experience impotence (difficulty in getting or maintaining an erection), ejaculation may sometimes be painful and some men have worse pain (as described above) after having sex.Treatment is basically directed on treating chronic prostatitis and then if still erectile dysfunction is there, then evaluating and treating it.To start with, you need a longer course of antibiotics as any infection may be taken care of by them. Antibiotics such as quinolones and macrolides have potent anti-inflammatory effects independent of their antimicrobial effects. These can be taken. Then medications to relax the prostate muscles called alpha-adrenergic blockers can also be used. These can be taken in combination with non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen. Majority of people are benefitted by these. But on the whole chronic prostatitis is a very difficult condition to treat and it requires patience on part of the doctor as well as patient.Other than that Azor which is an antihypertensive has a very rare side effect of erectile dysfunction but high blood pressure as such can cause difficulty in erection. Hence get your blood pressure monitored and you can even ask your doctor to change the antihypertensive. If erectile dysfunction continues then other causes need to be evaluated. These include medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord and neurological causes. To exactly pinpoint a diagnosis you need to get a complete examination done from a urologist.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Wishing you good health.",
