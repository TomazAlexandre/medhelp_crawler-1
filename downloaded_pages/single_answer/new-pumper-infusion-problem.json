            "answer": "Hello Donnazang,We are volunteers and not medical professionals, here.\u00a0\u00a0We have a lot of experience with Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I happen to also be a pumper and - despite periodic episodes like you're having -\u00a0\u00a0pumps can achieve good control & flexibility for many years at a time.\u00a0\u00a0I've been pumping for about 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0Each generation of pump is smarter & more precise.At this point, make a call to Minimed's 24 hour support line because clearly something is wrong.\u00a0\u00a0As you point out there could be a number of issues, and they are expert at stepping through the troubleshooting in a systematic manner.\u00a0\u00a0They will also send a replacement overnight if needed.Some things they'll likely check with you are (1) insertion technique, (2) type & age of insulin, (3) attachment of infusion set to the pump & your son.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes they have you test insulin delivery once the infusion is removed from your son but still attached to the pump.\u00a0\u00a0If delivery is good then, it often means the blockage occured 'in' your son.\u00a0\u00a0It could be from a bend in the cannula when under the skin, for example.\u00a0\u00a0That can occur if the cannula is 'too long' for his body composition or if insertion happened to hit a capillary or scar tissue or or or... The point is that they will step you through a process of elimination to identify & correct the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Do pay attention to they analysis they'll do with you, so if it happens again.Also, it's *excellent* that you cover your son's high with a shot while you're trying to figure things out.\u00a0\u00a0Your pediatric endo should work with you to ensure that you have a plan in case, for example, your son needs to go, say 12 - 24 hours or longer without pumping (It's happened once to me in 10 years.)\u00a0\u00a0Many docs recommend keeping a supply of longer acting insulin on hand.Good luck and enlist Minimed to help you -- today.\u00a0\u00a0IF you have a moment once it's all been resolved, will you send us an update?",
