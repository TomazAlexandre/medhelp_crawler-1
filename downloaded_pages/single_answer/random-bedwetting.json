    "question": "I am a 20 year old female and last night I randomly wet the bed. I haven't done this since i was very very young (3-5ish range) and it's very embarrassing to me. I didn't do much of anything differently, just drank some water, read my book, and went to bed. I usually drink about 60oz of water a day and I actually had less yesterday than normal because I forgot my waterbottle at a friends house the night before. I thought at first my uterus was simply letting out discharge (which I have quite a bit of everyday) but then came conscious and realized I was actually peeing. I didn't feel like I had to use the bathroom and when I got up (quickly) I went and used the bathroom officially and changed my clothes. I would like to know what is wrong with me. I have heard talk of this being related to diabetes (which my grandpa has) but it's only happened this once. I can't even remember the last time I had to use the bathroom at night. I do usually have insomnia, but it's been much better recently and I've been falling asleep usually within half an hour to an hour of going to bed. Last night I went to bed at 12:30-1ish and woke up to this at 5:40 or so. Please tell me what I should do, I can't get it off my mind and it really is bothering me!",
