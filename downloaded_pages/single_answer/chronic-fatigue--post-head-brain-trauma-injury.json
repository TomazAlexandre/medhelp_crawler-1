            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about this and understand that you have gone through several tests to find out why you have this fatigue and \u2018brain fog\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0I am just enumerating the possibilities. Please see if something was missed.From you symptoms alone it sounds like chronic fatigue syndrome. This usually presents with widespread myalgia (muscle ache) and arthralgia (bone and joint ache), headaches, chronic mental and physical exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, concentration difficulty and memory problems. Cognitive behavior therapy, memory games, multivitamin therapy, nutritional care, graded increase in exercise all help to treat it. There is no cause for this.Then you also need to investigate other causes of brain fog like liver dysfunction (get liver enzymes done\u2014liver function test), kidney dysfunction (get kidney function test done), and anemia. Poor sleep pattern and sleep problems like sleep apnea too can cause brain fog. Sleep studies by sleep specialists can help diagnose this. Low Vit D or Vit B12 too could be the cause.Hypothyroidism, diabetes and hormonal imbalance in women due to either menopause or any other cause like PCOD should be investigated.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
