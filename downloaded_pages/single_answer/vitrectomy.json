    "question": "I have had hemorrhaging in the back of my eye which I have received injections to take care of it.\u00a0\u00a0On my last injection on 6/21 after 2 days I got infection in my eye.\u00a0\u00a0They tried testing the bacteria but nothing showed up.\u00a0\u00a0After receiving an antibiotic injection it still didn't seem to clear up.\u00a0\u00a0So the retina specialist scheduled me for a vitrectomy.\u00a0\u00a0He removed the vitreous gel which had blood in it and removed most of a blood clot, removed bacteria and infection on 6/26, they also replaced the gel with an air bubble.\u00a0\u00a0The redness and the infection seems to be mostly gone, but I still have not gotten back my vision.\u00a0\u00a0It is like I have a fog or some sort of liquid in there. Is it common to take this long for the vision to return? It has been 2 weeks since the surgery.",
