            "answer": "Hopefully you know there are two types of diabetes.The one your hearing about everyday, on every commercial,is type 2 diabetes and is curable.Type 1, insulin dependent diabetes is incurable, it's an autoimmunedisease.You don't sound like you have symptoms for the incurable Type 1 diabetes.You really don't sound like a type 2 diabetes candidate either,unless you're overweight.Check out the other crazy autoimmune diseases out there.I have one, Multiple Sclerosis (I'm good though).That numbness was a thing to look for, but it wasn't specificallyin fingertips. The numbness was the whole arm and legs. Fatigue wasalso a symptom. l don't think diabetes is your issue.Hope this helps.",
