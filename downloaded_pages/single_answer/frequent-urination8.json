            "answer": "Hello,Frequent urination in adults can be due to many causes. The primary cause which needs to be excluded is diabetes. Diabetes not only causes frequent urination but also numbness and tingling sensations.I would advise you to get a fasting blood sugar and Hb A1 C test done.If dibetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are prostatitis(inflammation of the prostate gland),interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome, stroke and other neurological diseases, urinary incontinence, bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction .Please consult a urologist in that case.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "so for the past 2 months i have been urinating every 2 hours or so. i feel like i have to go quite often. sometimes there is a mold irritation in my penis. i have been to the Dr and gave a urine sample but she says its not likely anything physiological because it does not wake me up at night. this is really troubling me, any suggestions? is there and STD that could cause this? i did receive oral sex a couple months ago. (unprotected) any thoughts? could it be a prostrate problem that wouldn't show up in a urine sample?",
