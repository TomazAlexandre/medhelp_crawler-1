            "answer": "Hi,Overall, if a patient fits the medical criteria, gastric bypass can be very helpful in causing weight loss and eventually helping control(or even cure) diabetes. However, it is not for everyone. This is a serious surgery, and living with it later also takes a great deal of dedication and discipline in following the dietary/lifestyle changes.I suggest finding a reputable medical center where the surgery is performed and have a full evaluation there. There should be surgeons, medical doctors, psychologists and nutritionists invoved in your care to make this an appropriate screening, otherwise I suggest seeking out another center.Best of luck to you, and take care.",
