    "question": "I've been trying to research this to try to find out what is causing the muscle twitching I've been having for about a week. First, it was in my left upper arm when it occurred, then I noticed it n the left side of my neck. Now, within the past hour, I felt it in the right side, mid part of my back. Previously, it occurred a lot with my right eyelid. Now, I'm wondering what the heck is going on.\u00a0\u00a0I have diabetes and peripheral neuropathy so I'm thinking this is related. However, I'm wondering if it's serious because I have diabetes, or could it be BFS?",
