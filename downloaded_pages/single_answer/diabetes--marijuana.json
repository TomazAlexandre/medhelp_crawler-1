            "answer": "First of all what you need to do is learn more about your diabetes. There is no such thing as \"adult diabetes\". There is Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 usually happens when you are younger and type 2 when you are older, but there are many exceptions to that rule. There are many differences between the two types so it's important to know which type you have and what you need to change to control it. I'll assume it's type 2. Type 2 diabetes is very much a condition of self-management. You manage it by losing weight if needed, reducing your carb intake, testing your blood sugar and getting regular exercise. If your doctor recommends, or you can't control your blood sugar with the above (ideally keep it under 100 for fasting and under 140 two hours after meals), he may add oral medications or even insulin. But most of all it takes work. In the beginning it takes more work because there is a lot to learn, like which foods (and how much) you can eat and still control your blood sugar (testing is key). So can you do all that and still be stoned a lot? This is, of course, in addition to work or school or whatever other responsibilities you have. It's hard to change eating habits and pot gives you the munchies where you don't think too much about \"eating healthy\". So those are some of the things you need to think about when you decide for yourself if you can handle all that while smoking on a regular basis.",
