            "answer": "Hello,Firstly, you should consult a physician to find out the cause of the erectile dysfunction and then only seek treatment. Common causes like diabetes, hypertension, psychological or neurological problems etc need to be ruled out. Viagra is a drug which can be used to take care of the erectile dysfunction but it should be taken only after consultation with a physician.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing. Warm regards.",
