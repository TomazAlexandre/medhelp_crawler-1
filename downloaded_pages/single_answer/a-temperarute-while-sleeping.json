            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The commonest cause of feeling cold is low external temperature. However you say it was warm enough, it just appeared that the room was freezing. There can be several other causes like hypothyroidism, liver diseases, adrenal insufficiency, liver failure and as a side effect of some drugs. Chills are also felt when a fever is about to start in case of malaria and bacterial infections due to release of toxins. One can also feel chilled if you are about to break into viral fever. Diabetes is another thing you must look into. Please consult a doctor.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi thereI woke up around 5am today, thinking that my bed as shaking to realise that I was the one shaking! I then started to feel dizzy and sick but very hot, my mouth was dry. My heart was also beating too fast that I was scared of dying! Then I went down to the kitchen to get some water, needed to go to the toiled to urinate to find that my urine was smelling funny, a similar smell to when I was taking antibiotics over one year ago. Later on when I came back bed, I was by then feeling very cold as the house was freezing! Still I could not sleep and had to go back to the toilet to have my bowels open which was normal to me despite that I did not see its colour. Do you think I had a temperature of something?",
