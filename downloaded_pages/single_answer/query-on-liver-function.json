            "answer": "Hi, normal values for SGOT is 0-35, SGPT is 4-36, ALP is 30-120 and Bilirubin is 0.3-1.0. . So, if these values are persistently raised it needs to be determined, why they are raised. It could be due to fatty liver disease, fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. With a history positive for Gilbert Syndrome, the values could be raised due to this disorder. Another cause could be the medications you are using, it can cause raised enzymes. Infections like Hepatitis B and C can also be the cause. The cause for the raised levels needs to be determined. This is done with the help of blood tests, ultra sonogram and if need be, biopsy of liver will help to clinch the diagnosis. So, the tests are necessary, have them done and follow up with your doctor. Regards.",
