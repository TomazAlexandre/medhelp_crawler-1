    "question": "Not sure where my question should go (under which topic) for i am not sure what is wrong with me... I have a few things and am not sure if they are related. I have gotten light headed, \"spacey\", tired, and my stomach has gotten very queezy not throwing up but feel sick. If I eat something it seems to help however it is not instintanious... it seems to take a bit for things to \"kick-in\" sometimes. This doesn't happen everyday but if i don't eat regularly it seems to get worse.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I get very cold when i eat. I mean goose bumps and uncontrollable shivers cold! Is this related?\u00a0\u00a0 there are times when i cant seem to get enough water, i feel very dehydrated and I don't handle salt well (i swell).One thing i don't have is the frequent need to pee....I do have low blood pressure (I have had it taken and it been 86/50) but my dizziness is not just when i stand it is all the time (when i have it) and when i am having this icky feeling i have checked my blood pressure and it was 116 over something like 60 (can't remember the bottom number) i do try and take a vitamin every day I have had low iron levels. Anyone have any ideas?Should I have my sugar levels checked? Or is there something else i should look into?I hate feeling spacey, tired and I can't seem to concentrate!",
