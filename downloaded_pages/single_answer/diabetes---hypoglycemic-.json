    "question": "This is my second pregnancy. I had no issues with my first pregnancy. This time I feel extremely nauseous and can't seem to ever feel full. Even if I eat a good amount, I feel starving. I don't feel this is normal. I was wondering if it could possibly be hypoglycemia or diabetes?? Has anyone else got these during pregnancy? How does it feel? Is it similar? How do you get tested for these? I got my blood taken about a month and a half ago and they said it was fine then. I am now 11\u00a0\u00a0weeks. Thanks",
