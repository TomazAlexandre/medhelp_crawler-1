            "answer": "An accurate comment on your MRI cannot be made as I have not personally reviewed your films. However, the comment of \"scattered chronic ischemic disease\" is a very nonspecific, general term used to describe tiny little lesions that can be seen in someone with stroke risk factors as well as migraines. They are clinically silent, meaning there are no symptoms/signs, and do not in themselves lead to tumor, stroke, infection, etc... And if you had a PFO that led to strokes, that's NOT what it would look like on MRI and you'd probably have clinical signs of the stroke. Would not worry, as in your case it probably is related to the history of migraines.",

    "question": "Thank you for responding to my recent question about chronic dizziness and ear pain.I went to the dentist who found a dead tooth and I had a root canal. IMMEDIATELY my ear pain went away.I am still experiencing some dizziness however. My doc called me unexpectedly to tell me my MRI was negative for major things like brain tumors but it found \"something\".i hope i have this correct: \" mixed T2 signal, scattered chronic small vessel ischemic disease\".I'm floored and worried.I am a nearly 50 woman with excellent blood lipids (total about 170,\"good\" cholesterol over 70, low triglycerides), low blood pressure, excellent weight, etc., no diabetes, no heart disease. I do have a history of atypical \"migraines\" -- auras with no headache. Recently, starting with ear pain, had dizziness( not vertigo) increasing left cheek pain.My doc(internist) said she hesitated to tell me what else was on the mri because it ' probably is nothing\" and she didn't want me to worry. she said,\u00a0\u00a0Idon't see how someone with no risk factors ( see above) could have small vessel ischemic disease. My doc thinks I'm fine . Can you explain the MRI findings at least generally? COULD this truly be incidental and nothing to worry about or should I be concerned?i once tested positive for anti-cardiolipid antibodies but then negative when pregnant and never tested again. they weren't high the one time they were present. I 've had a couple of echos, last about 8 years ago.. would that have shown a PFO? could the MRI findings be inconsequential ? related to migraines? i'm so worried.",
