            "answer": "Ok I would assume you arelooking a the Bragg's apple cider vinegar right?Look... I have done alot of checking into this and Apple cider Vinager is wonderful for you ---BUT>>>>>> you are not being very clear here to get into that right now. I see you are on Synthroid. and I see your dosages. I don't see any current blood results though. Please post them. I would love to share with you all the benefits of all natural apple cider vinager - but I really am not comfortable going into that without actually knowing where you are in your TSH - T3 and T4's.Give more details and we can discuss more options. I understand your weight is an issue for you - your past mocks mine to am\\lmost a tee. but getting this thyroid issue under control is first and at this time .",

    "question": "I have been thin all my life, 5' 2\" and about 110 pounds, and for several years even had trouble gaining enough weight to give blood. I always had lots of energy, insomia, and a bit jittery which I always attributed for a stressful life. I used to have slight period of where I thought I was about to faint since diabetes runs in my family I thought I was just hyperglycemic. I would gain 1 pound a year and my best weight was at 125. At 40 all of a sudden I gained 5 pounds in 1 year then started feeling very fatigued. I had gone to my PCP for a bad bout with respiratory infection when she discovered a tumor. That was in 2004, I had the benign thyroid tumor removed and then gained 25 pounds in about 3 months. I was put on .88 mcg after I gained the weight. About 14 months after my surgery I was in the ER for an unrelated problem, my doctor thought I was having a heart attack ( Female, 48 at the time) but the finding were pneumonia, bronchitis, plurisy and an accidental finding of an adrenal tumor at 2.5 centimeters. I saw my endocrinologist to follow up on the Adrenal tumor, she said as long as I do not have an heart racing or fast pulse symptoms I don't have to worry about it. So, I haven't. I went back to my Endocrinologist because I was just feeling worse and really struggling keeping my weight down because my brothers and sisters all have diabetes which is controlled by diet. I have been dieting and exercising like a mad woman, spin bike 5 days a week, weight training, walking, hiking, kyaking,eliptical training and pilates. I normally consume about 1400 calories a day, but not 1 single pounds is coming off! I hired a personal trainer. I switched doctors, he said I was a little low on my thyroid results so he upped my dosage to 125 mcg. I don't feel as tired anymore but no weight is coming off, still. I am up to 157 lbs and really have a deep fear of diabetes. I am ready to give up, I have finally decided to try natural supplements and still keeping with my 125 mcg of Levoxyl but now adding a dosage of HGH. Is there anything I need to worry about if I start on a Apple Cider Vinegar diet and HGH?",
