            "answer": "i don't think there should be any problem between the transplant and the pancreatitis. The damage was probably due to the drinking and with long-term ongoing sobriety hopefully it should no longer be a problem.\u00a0\u00a0rarely, patients can have remitting episodes of acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis but this is more the exception than the rule.",

    "question": "Hello my question is regarding the effect a liver transplant would have on someone with chronic pancreatitis. My father was diagnosised with Liver Disease, cirrosis of the liver, about three years ago. Shortly after he was diagnosised with chronic pancreatitis. He also has diabetes. He is a recovering alcoholic and has not had a drink in since being diagnosised three years ago, he is 64 years old. My question is due to lack of cadavar livers we have been considering a live donor transplant. My question is what effect will a new liver have on his pancreatis? Is the damage already done or is this something that will also improve with the help of a fully functioning liver?",
