    "question": "I went to my PCP for burning lung pain..\u00a0\u00a0I was quickly dismissed with Pleurisy..I have had Pleuricy before and it hurt to take a\u00a0\u00a0breath and taking a full\u00a0\u00a0breath was almost impossible..\u00a0\u00a0I never had a fever with it either...\u00a0\u00a0This is different...Doc put me on Celebrex for 7 days...My fever has gone from 100.7 to 101.6 and Congestion has set in...My roots of my teeth hurt and my jaw and my ears ache/burn inside like they are on fire however it is not an earache. I have a headache off and on...My lung pain is slightly less regarding the burning..I dont think this is pleruisy..what else can i research to make sure i dont get pheumonia or something serious?any ideas?.the first day i coughed and had the pain it felt like a burning chemical releasing on one side of the lung and spraying and burning the other side...\u00a0\u00a0right side only...from the brachial passage and the bottom and the top right of the lung...i am puzzled and wondering if i need to seek out another pcp...he is also trying to put me on Lipitor 20mg day claiming it will help prevent heart disease... my dad had an attack and quadruple bypass...my cholesterol is 87..the study he got this info from was for someone with diabetes and smokers...\u00a0\u00a0i do neither...confused??",
