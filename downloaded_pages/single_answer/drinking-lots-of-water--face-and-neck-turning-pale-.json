            "answer": "Hello,This can be due to dehydration or dermatitis skin but the possibility of polydipsia( excessive thirst) also needs to be ruled out. Diabetes is an important cause of polydipsia and your fasting blood sugar levels needs to be ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am a 20 yrs old tall and somewhat of a heavy set black male and i recently started noticing that my face and neck area has been looking somewhat grey. I also have seborrheic dermatitis but i don't know if thats the problem either. it is also cold where i am. It started after i volunteered to move my aunt into her new home ( were lifting extremely bulky and heavy things up steep steps) i usually just eat about two times a day (mostly fruits and vegetables to keep my dermatitis under control) but the next day i began to only drink glass after glass of water\u00a0\u00a0and one big meal. after that my legs painfully began to throb (most likely from moving my aunt into her home) and my face and neck was almost completely grey! Skin lotions do not seem to help. Could this be because of my skin condition making my skin too dry or something else?",
