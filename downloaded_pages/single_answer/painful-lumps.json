            "answer": "HiThis condition has been present for quite sometime already and the diagnosis appears to be elusive. I would suggest that a skin biopsy be done to obtain a more definite diagnosis. The bumps may appear to be infectious in origin. A culture and sensitivity test of discharge that comes from the lumps may be obtained. This will help guide treatment. Your blood sugar levels may be determined to rule out the presence of diabetes. Diabetics may have an increased risk of developing chronic skin conditions.",

    "question": "Ever since puberty, I have been dealing with a very embarrassing problem. Ive been getting genital lumps and I am 19 now and I still have them and they larger and more frequent. Not only are they larger and more painful, when I get them I experience dizziness, weakness, headaches, cracking joints, chills (sometimes), and fatigue. Most recently, one occurred near my bell button which seemed abnormal b/c they have always been in or around my vagina. I went to the emergency room and the doctor diagnosed it as cellulitis and gave me antibiotics but the genital lumps are still recurring.Lump description: about the size of a quarter dollar; red, shiny, inflamed; after a few days, bump \"heads\" would appear over the lump; remains for about 2 weeks and them slowly disappears. Some stay for less time and burst within days.Im currently researching online for possibilities and I was hoping anyone here are experiencing this and can help me or may have an idea of what this is. Most of what comes up are disorders involving STDs and I am not sexually active so I am really confused about what this could be.",
