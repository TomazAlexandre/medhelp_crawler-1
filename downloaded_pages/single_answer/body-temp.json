            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!In a marathon runner a lot of heat is generated. If the external temperature is very low, then the heat loss is more rapid. This is what probably happened in your son in law\u2019s case. Even though he was adequately dressed, the clothing was not enough to stabilize the heat loss from the body. The situation can be worsened by the presence of thyroid disorders and diabetes. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please consult a sports medicine specialist and get him a thorough checkup.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My son-in-law ran the Chicago Marathon today. The last four miles he started feeling cold and by the time he crossed the finish line, he was nearly blue..Took him to a medic tent and his boby temp was 91. He could no form words or feel his legs. They wrapped him in warming blankets and gave him warm broth. He is fine now....but what would cause this. He has trained for months, It was very cold there today,.,,but he was dressed accordingly. Thank you for any info.",
