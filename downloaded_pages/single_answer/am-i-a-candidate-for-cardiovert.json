            "answer": "Ablation sounds way too much/severe to me.While meds and/or electro cardioversion (shock) are in my experience temporary, they are far less intrusive than ablation.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you sound to me like a prime candidate for the just mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0That is, permanent AFib is harder to convert than intermittent.Now I'm not sure an electro cardio can be done if you are not in AFib, there's no way to tell it did any good, i.e., you are already in Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR).\u00a0\u00a0I think the same is true for Ablation, that is there needs to be error signals going on or they can't find where to ablate.For sure, I'd try beta blockers, maybe only as needed, and start an aspirin a day to lower clot formation during the short times you are in AFib.I say the above in the context that what I read tells me you are not in great discomfort when you are in AFib.\u00a0\u00a0 I suffer from AFib myself...but that's a long story I'll not explore here.I am a father, and send my deep sympathy at your loss.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm sure the stress of that loss is ongoing and may be driver of your AFib.\u00a0\u00a0Still, AFib is more common with age, mine started around the age 60, and while my life has not been stress-free, I have been spared such a loss as happened to your family.Oh, yes, you know the rest: STOP SMOKING.\u00a0\u00a0I also went through that, I quite about 25 years ago, so I'm home free on that point.",

    "question": "I am 58 years old, no diabetes, low blood pressure, otherwise very good health (except I smoke).\u00a0\u00a0I have had a-fib and flutter since o4 when my daughter passed away.\u00a0\u00a0It used to be bi-monthly and then sometimes monthly occurrences.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, it is every 2 weeks or so - sometimes 2 days in a row.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it skips a month, but usually lasts 12 hours per episode.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor wants to do an ablation but I would rather do the cardiovert - he said you are only a candidate if you are constantly in a-fib, which I'm not.\u00a0\u00a0Also was considering radio-frequency ablation.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts?",
