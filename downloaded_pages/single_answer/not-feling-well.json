            "answer": "I'm really sorry that you are not feeling well.I have never heard of anyone talking about hypoglycemia with MS, nor have I read about it, but I really am not sure. I am undx, but have people ask me all the time if I am hypoglycemic because if I don't eat I turn into a freak! I am not overweight, nor do I have diabetes. When they were trying to figure out why I was tingling they tested my blood sugar and it was fine even though I had not eaten yet that day. My vit D was low though. Have you had your vit D checked??? It can cause some crazy things.What else happened to you other than the tingling and twitching in your mouth when they told you you had a seizure???Feel better,Heather",
