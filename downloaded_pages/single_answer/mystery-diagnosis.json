    "question": "Somebody please for the love of god help me here. I'm a 16 year old girl who is 130 lbs and active. I have the WORST case of gerd that does not consist of an ulcer or cancer. I've seen many doctors. And my specialist doesn't even know what's wrong with me. Now I'm a smart girl. I prediagnosed myself with diabetes lactose intolerance asthma and gerd. To get to the point here. I have had 2 endoscopy's wheat/ ulcers= negativeso I suggested my gall bladder. Got an ultrasound. And they haven't even said anything back!!!Plus I highly doubt gall stones are as painful as this. My stomach is indistructable. I've burned through 8 of the best reflux meds out there. And I still burn through them. Let me add that they're all through the highest doseages. Not even muscle relaxers work. In fact those might be the least effective. I'm taking anatomy. I know my health good and though it may not show it within grades, but my common knowledge is excellent. I learned that the normal PH level should be around 7.2. Now the way things are going, I'm guessing I'm in the 6's. Even bananas feel like hells inferno has taken over my stomach. I know what your thinking.\u00a0\u00a0Bananas? Those are potasseum. Well tell that to my stomach. Oh and anxiety is also ruled out. Now here's the twist. Lots of times I can eat spicy foods and feel great such as habenero flakes in spaghetti sauces, tacos, pickles, hot sauces. It makes me feel like my stomach is over correcting the amount of acid needed to be released so when I eat strong acidics it's evening out all that acid. I told my doctors. None of them understand what I am simply suggesting. I ate pretzels tonight. Biggest mistake ever. I cried it's so painful. Please help me. I really feel as if I am a mystery case",
