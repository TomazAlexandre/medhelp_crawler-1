            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation I would not be able to point out the definite cause of chronic constipation in your case. Likely possibilities may include diet issues like lack of fiber, motility disorders, hormonal or endocrinal abnormalities like hypothyroidism, diabetes etc., neuro-muscular abnormalities, chronic inflammations, allergies, physical cause such as growths/ masses, conditions such as IBS, idiopathic constipation etc., inadequate hydration, side effect of a few medications etc. A healthy lifestyle is an important part of health. You could start by taking plenty of fluids and increasing the fiber content of your diet. Exercise and avoiding stress may also be helpful. I would also recommend a detailed evaluation by a gastroenterologist for the above mentioned causes. After a cause is diagnosed, it can be managed accordingly. Meanwhile you could \u2018occasionally\u2019 try some laxative after consultation with your GP, if the constipation gets bad.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 40 year old woman who has a family history of chronic constipation & stomach issues.\u00a0\u00a0I've always had problems with constipation - have taken laxatives here & there to help, but mainly was able to stay regular with a fiber rich diet and exercise. On the negative side, I've never been comfortable going anywhere but in the comfort of my own home so in the past, I've not done my colon a favor and put off the urge to go to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0 For the past 2 months, I've not been able to have a bowel movement at all unless I take a laxative like Correctal.\u00a0\u00a0If I don't take something I can go up to a week or two without going.\u00a0\u00a0This last time I took the Correctal, it didn't help - still haven't been able to go.\u00a0\u00a0I'm getting ready to call my family doctor back, who is getting ready to refer me to a GI specialist, but what in the world could be going on.\u00a0\u00a0I feel the urge to go, but it just won't come out!\u00a0\u00a0Is this the start of some kind of intestinal blockage, or cancer?\u00a0\u00a0Just trying to figure out what is going on with my stomach.",
