            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Before trying medical marijuana I would suggest you try vitamin B 12, a change in neurontin dose along with another pain killer (a combination usually works better than a single drug), physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and acupressure etc. Once you start medical marijuana, it will be difficult to go let go of the treatment due to dependence and withdrawals.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
