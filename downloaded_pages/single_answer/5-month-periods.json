            "answer": "Hi!In all probability Implanaon is not suiting you. The hormonal imbalance due to this could be the cause. Please consult a gynecologist regarding this. You need to get this removed. Then rule out conditions like PCOD, diabetes, hypothyroidism. You will then need to be put on another contraceptive whose hormonal composition will suit your body. Please consult your gynecologist. Take care!",
