            "answer": "Hello, hope you are doing well.Many conditions can cause rise in levels of alkaline phosphatase.Liver problems, gall bladder problems, bone/skeletal problems and cancers all can cause rise in alkaline phosphatase.Few common causes related to liver and gall bladder are hepatitis,cholangitis,cirrhosis,fatty liver,cholecystitis etc.Vitamin D defficiency,fractured bone,osteomalacia,bone cancers are few other causes. A mildly elevated Alk phosp is usually seen in fatty liver since you have no other symptoms except pain in upper right quadrant and gas. In fatty liver there is fat in the liver, along with inflammation and damage. Fatty liver due to alcoholism is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. Consult your doctor for more queries and assistance. I hope it helps.Best wishes and regards!",
