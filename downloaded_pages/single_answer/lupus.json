            "answer": "Hi! In your case, since you have a speckled pattern, it could be due to ITP, scleroderma, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, mixed connective tissue disorder or due to lupus. Definitely the possibility of hypothyroidism, PCOD, and diabetes should be looked at. All these can also cause miscarriages.Other tests for further evaluation in a speckled pattern generally include Smith Antibody (Anti-Smith), Ribonucleoprotein Antibody (Anti-RNP), Scl-70 kD kinetochore (Anti-Topoisomerase I), and Anti-La (Anti-SSB).Other ANA that may occur in SLE are anti-U1 RNP (which also appears in systemic sclerosis), SS-A (or anti-Ro) and SS-B (or anti-La; both of which are more common in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome).Hence there is a possibility that you have lupus. This needs to be further tested and clinically coordinated. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 48 year old female with a 4 year history of shortness of breath, chest congestion with exertion, cough and dizziness. Initially, I had been investigated for pulmonary hypertension as my pulmonary pressures on an echocardiography were elevated. I had two right heart catheterizations that were negative. A week ago, I had a TIA, went to the hospital where they found in an MRI that I had had multiple small strokes sometime in the past. The neurologist suggested I may have Lupus as I had 3 miscarriages years ago. I am still waiting for all the bloodwork to come back but I am guessing I don't have Lupus as my ANA was speckled pattern 1:80 and my complement 3 was 1.53. Negative for anti-cardiolipins. Could it still be possible considering the whole picture?",
