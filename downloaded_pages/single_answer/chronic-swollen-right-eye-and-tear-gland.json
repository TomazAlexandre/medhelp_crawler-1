    "question": "Hello,I am hoping for some advice and help. I am a 40 year old female who has Diabetes II and Hypothyroidism. My thyroid condition if controlled by taking 125mcg of Synthroid and my diabetes is diet controlled. My blood sugar is excellent and so is my blood pressure. I have generally good health and see my doctors annually for checks.I have however a problem with my right eye swelling profusely. It seems to only happen when there is bad air quality around me. I moved from Maryland to California in 2000 and it happened immediately once I stepped off the plane! Within a week of being there my right eye was so swollen I could not see out of it! I saw many doctors and was tested for things such as Lupus and Sarcoidosis. All my tests came back negative. I was put on Prednisone and that made the swelling go away. I had to stay on the steroids for almost two years in order to keep the problem from reoccuring. I had sinus surgery in 2002 once I moved back to the East Coast and the problem went away for good...so I thought!Three months ago I cleaned an apartment that was owned by a smoker who has three cats. Almost immediately after the exposure of the dirty air my eye started swelling again. I was again tested and retested by several doctors...even eye care specialists. They could not figure out what the problem was! Again I was placed on steroids and again the problem was solved. I just finished a two month course of steroid treatment and the eye has swollen up again. It is very frustrating!I have done research online and nothing seems to explain this. I have seen too many doctors and none seem to help. Do you have any advice for me! I can't keep taking the steroids! They are horrible! And why did the problem seem to disappear after my sinus surgery, only to reappear once I was in another bad air quality situation?Thanks for your time,Tanya Bolling",
