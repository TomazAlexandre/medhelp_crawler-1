I always suspected I have PCOS as my older sister has it really badly and I have exstensive medical history with endometriosis and blocked tubes, cysts on ovaries etc I have only 1 fallopian tube now which causes me a lot of problems especially when i get my period as its very irregular and excruciating...For the last two weeks I have had extremely sore and swollen breasts and nipples and even my limph gland under my armpitt hurts, I have a very dark blue vein tht has appeared around my nipple and its quit puffy... Iv had all the pregnancy symptoms and did 3 pregnancy tests all immediately coming up positive and then went to the doctor the following day and did another urine test and it came up negative....I did two more over the following two days and the first was neg and the next was positive...My doctors are baffled and have no idea what is gng on with me im on a 6 month waiting list to see a specialist and kinda cant wait tht long for some advice or just even to knw tht anyone else has been through it because its driving me crazy!! my hormones r through the roof im having hot flashes bodys boiling but im freezing cold....has anyone else experienced this? please tell me i am not the only one its very mentally and emotionally distressing for me as all i want is to successfully fall pregnant its just as though my body thinks it is when i may not be.....PLEASE HELP",
