            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.I don't think that\u00a0\u00a0you were misdiagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like since you have been diagnosed you have made some positive lifestyle changes that are helping you mange the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think it is a great idea to just stop all of your medications (especially something like metformin and prednisolone).\u00a0\u00a0I think you should make an appointment with your doctor and discuss your medications with him/her.\u00a0\u00a0Steroids can affect your blood sugars so it is possible that they caused part of your problems.\u00a0\u00a0 However, you really need to speak with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Diet and exercise play a large role in diabetes managment and it sounds like you are dedicated to making some good choices.\u00a0\u00a0Work with your doctor on this one.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.Bridget",

    "question": "Hello, my name is Linda, I live in Australia.\u00a0\u00a0I have had Rheumatoid Arthritis for five years with cortisone steroid injections for the first four years.\u00a0\u00a0Not once did anybody bother to monitor my blood sugar levels, and I was unaware that they could be affected by them.\u00a0\u00a0I have recently been diagnosed with High Blood Pressure, and Type 2 Diabetes, my Doctor was aware of all the medications I was on.\u00a0\u00a0I was taking Prednisolone 5mg for 1 year, Diclofenac 50mg twice daily for five years, and Perindopril 8mg once daily for a month. About two weeks ago, after feeling sick from the cocktail of medications I was taking.\u00a0\u00a0I made a rash decision to ditch all of them except the High blood pressure medication; my blood pressure was 150/109.\u00a0\u00a0Since doing so I feel amazing.\u00a0\u00a0Four months ago I decided to change my eating habits, quit a 20 year addiction to Coke Zero and started exercising everyday about a month ago; this was very difficult to start with RA, but I already feel amazing differences in my fitness.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone from 315 to 292.9 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0Since being diagnosed on the 22nd October this year I have cut out all trans-fat products, all artificial sweeteners, and anything made from a factory.\u00a0\u00a0I have noticed radical improvements in my weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0Half of my weight loss has occurred in the last week.\u00a0\u00a0Getting back to my diagnosis, with my OGTT my fasting score was 126, and two hours later it was 257.4. My doctor immediately put me on Metformin 500mg twice daily.\u00a0\u00a0He did not discuss any attempts for me to try to manage with diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0My mother developed Diabetes 4 years ago; she lost 132 pounds and manages her diabetes well.\u00a0\u00a0I borrowed her level checker and have been testing myself at fasting, and 2 hours after each meal.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting was 108/108/113/95.\u00a0\u00a0My 2 hours after lunch were 104/88/91.\u00a0\u00a0My 2 hours after dinner were 93/108/122.\u00a0\u00a0I read diabetics are unable to come down to fasting levels before a three hour period.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible that I was misdiagnosed? Sorry about the length of the question.",
