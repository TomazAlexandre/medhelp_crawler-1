            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Generally a high ANA titre indicates an autoimmune disease like SLE, \u201cSj\u00f6gren's syndrome (60%), rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, scleroderma and polymyositis & dermatomyositis (30%), and various non-rheumatological conditions associated with tissue damage. ANA are also directed to the nuclear pore complex in primary biliary cirrhosis. Other conditions with high ANA titre include Addison disease, Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Hashimoto's, Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Type I diabetes mellitus, Mixed connective tissue disorder.\u201d Refer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_antibodyFirst of all these would have to be ruled out one by one. Dehydration, deficiency of calcium and magnesium, irritable bowel can also cause a gag spasm. Multiple sclerosis is also a possibility.It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,I have been in the process of getting a diagnosis for some time now.\u00a0\u00a0I have ANA titer of 1:1280 first time, then 1:640 second time tested. Have extreme fatigue, muscle weekness especially in thighs/hips.\u00a0\u00a0Muscle spasm and tingling.\u00a0\u00a0Am starting to develop slightly slurred speech at times after having an episode of pins and needles in my tongue.\u00a0\u00a0One of my most obviouse symptoms though is a gag spasm. Does not happen while asleep or laying down. Is not from anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0When the spasm is flaring up talking, turning my head, being hungry or nothing at all can trigger a full blown gag reflex.\u00a0\u00a0This will last up to a minute or 3-4 good gag spasms, then usually disappears.\u00a0\u00a0I am seeing an MS doc currently, but he's not sure what's going on, but has a few ideas . I do not have diagnosis of MS at this point.\u00a0\u00a0I did recently find out that my mother's mother died (75 years ago) after a surgery for a medullary spinal tumor. Not sure how genetic this condition is, but it will be getting looked into.\u00a0\u00a0Does any of this sound familiar to anyone.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had a spinal tumor with these symptoms especially the gag spasm?Thanks!Jnette",
