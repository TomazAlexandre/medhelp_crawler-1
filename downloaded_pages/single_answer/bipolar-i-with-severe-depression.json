            "answer": "I get agoraphobic when too depressed and anxious. Even if you can get yourself to the coffee shop and sit and journal it will make a big difference. Because if you don't feel the anxiety and do it anyway - you will just quit doing, and I firmly believe that looking at the same walls of your house each day is enough to make anyone go batty. Even if all you can do is go outside, and have your coffee on the back step - better than doing nothing.Abilify and Seroquel are from the same family of drugs, but I do know people who take them together without incident. It would increase the potential for side effects that are class specific like metabolic disorder, and diabetes.I take Abilify and love it. It has made such a positive difference in my life. My friend though it was a horrible drug for her. Depends on what your body needs I guess.I would be tempted to look into a pure mood stabilizer like lamotrigine which is supposed to be good for bipolar depression, and it plays well with Seroquel. You have to go up on it slowly to prevent a potentially (extremely extremely rare) rash. Since they put the new protocals to go up slowly in dose the rash has all but disappeared. Very rare. If you take the pill it lowers the amount of lamotrigine in your blood so you may need a higher dose. Not all psychiatrists seem to know this - but the pharmacists do.If you don't already I'd make sure you get yourself a good therapist. They can really help. Especially with anxiety, the self help techniques I've found work really well. Cognitive behavioural therapy. Once I got a handle on those my anxiety was way better. I still get it from time to time, but I don't need medication anymore.",

    "question": "I take seroquel 300 xr with cymbalta 60 for bipolar 1 but I am also recovering from an accident which affected me physically and mentally. My depression is far more evident and partially situational. Healing is slow going but I am addressing all areas. I have insomnia without the seroquel 300 xr so would adding abilify be helpful or will these drugs interact in a dangerous way. I am also taking 1mg of clonazepam 3x per day for anxiety due to ptsd. I am becoming almost agoraphobic at times in my depression.",
