    "question": "Hi. Sometimes I notice that my eyes can't really focus so my field of vision is disturbed. I also start feeling just a little bit nauseated and am sensitive to light, especially from the sun. Non of these problems seem extreme to me they just bother me. I suffer from a level \"4\" astigmatism and my eye doctor said I was going through an \"eye degeneration\" phase but said that other than that my eyes were perfectly fine. I have also been to the Doctor and have had all the studies come back fine. NO Diabetes, Highblood pressure, Cholesterol, etc. I have noticed that if I squint my eyes, I focus better and If I close my eyes, the tiny dizzy feeling goes away. The thing that makes it worse is whenever I am sleepy or when I watch bright lights either from tv, computer, or being outside in the sun. I have not actually felt the ground or the room start spinning much less faint, and like I said It's more of a neussance than anything else, especially while driving. (oh and I DO have prescription glasses and sunglasses)Any suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
