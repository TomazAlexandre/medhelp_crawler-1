            "answer": "An initial response to the inflammation may occur, but to develop new symptoms months later would be unusual. You have not stated your age, which is important to help determine which disorders are more likely. What I would recommend is for you to see a neurologist. Specifically, to evaluate the visual disturbance. The transient visual disturbance could be due to a problem in the eye or brain. To evaluate this you may need to have a MRI of the brain. The other symptoms are very diffuse, possibly suggesting a more systemic problem. In addition to the labs you have already had, a test for B12 dysfunction, lupus (and other connective tissue diseases), and diabetes may be reasonable. Again, without knowing your age and examining you, I can not be more specific.",

    "question": "I woke up one morning a few months ago (Jan. 2004) with a swollen right ear and drainage from my ear (not internal at all but rather all surface problems and possibly from the pierced hole). My ear was swollen to twice it's size within a day and the drainage was excesseive. Needless to say it was a very bad infection with horrible inflammation including in my neck and jaw.During this time, I ended up in the hospital with severe circulation issues - Pounding heart, hands turning blue and getting cold and numb-same with feet and other strange sensations throughout my body. (Circulation would come and go drastically). Vitals were ok.\u00a0\u00a0My ear is perfectly fine now, but I continue to have strange symptoms that kind of come and go and seem to be worse when I'm in bed. Symptoms:chest pain and heaviness of breathing, numbness and tingling in different places (hands, feet, shoulders, etc. -pounding heart, pulsing temples, pressure in the front of my neck-and a new symptom is that right eye trouble. I woke 3 wks. ago, with verticle double vision that was better by morning. No more double vision, but I've had a funny feeling in my eye (almost like my muscles are tired and my eyelid doesn't want to work right-but it doesn't look funny).\u00a0\u00a0Eye doc. noticed my right pupil is slighly dilated more than left but responding fine.MRI and ECHO are NORMAL and React. Protein, SED and thyroid are FINE. Could it all be related to nerve damage from inflammation. I'm allergic to ibuprof./aspirin-so it's difficult take care of inflammation properly.\u00a0\u00a0What can I do to heal?\u00a0\u00a0THANKS SO MUCH!",
