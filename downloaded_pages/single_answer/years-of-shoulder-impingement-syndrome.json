            "answer": "Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. Take my opinion with a grain of salt.Standard conservative treatment for impingment syndrome is NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Motrin, Alleve) and PT. Also, talk to your Ortho about chronic impingement. From what I've read, dealing with that is another hill of beans.There is evidence that cortisone shots over the long term will weaken connective tissue.I think your diabetes is worth addressing as well. Is it hereditary or lifestyle-induced? Are you overweight? If so, I think that would be your first course of action. There is also a growing body evidence connecting body weight and joint problems (http://www.hopkins-arthritis.org/patient-corner/disease-management/osteoandweight.html -work/family safe).",

    "question": "Can anyone tell me what is the prognosis after years and years of shoulder impingement syndrome?\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 56 yr old F. Had rotator cuff surgery rt shoulder about 7 yrs ago, since then I'm experiencing recurrent bursitis /shoulder impingement on and off in both shoulders. This is being treated with cortisone shots and PT. The shots don't seem to be helping me like the used to. Right now I seem to be developing arm/bicepital pain which I think is tendinitis. How do I treat this, I'm afraid my tendon may eventually rupture?\u00a0\u00a0I'm sick and tired of going to PT over and over. Also people are telling me the cortisone shots will damage my bones and worsen my diabetes. Any truth to this?",
