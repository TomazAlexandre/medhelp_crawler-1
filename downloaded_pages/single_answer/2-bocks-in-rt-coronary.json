            "answer": "Coronary stenting in a patient with stable coronary artery disease is used to treat the symptoms. Specifically, exertional chest pain and shortness of breath. This is in addition to optimal medical therapy (blood pressure control, cholesterol lowering medications, anti anginal medications, etc). Stents in this situation help relieve symptoms. They are not associated with any mortality benefit. The average patient with stable coronary disease has a five year 5% mortality rate. In an asymptomatic patient with no heart failure, a normal ejection fraction, and normal exercise abilities, coronary stenting is of no benefit.",
