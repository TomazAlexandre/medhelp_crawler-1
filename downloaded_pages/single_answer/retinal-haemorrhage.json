    "question": "Hi there,My younger brother who is 13 was diagnosed with an eye haemorrhage at the back of the eye, on the side of the optical disk (retinal haemorrhage?) by our family optician.He was then seen by our family doctor, which he said it could be: diabetes (tests show no trace), high blood pressure or glaucoma. My brother has had a history of high blood pressure before.He is now going to be referred to a eye hospital.I have done research on glaucoma, read the symptoms to him - he said he has none.I cannot sit and wait until next few weeks until the professor can see him - I need another opinion.My question is, should it be related to blood pressure, will the problem rectify itself?And could it still be glaucoma?Thank you very much",
