    "question": "Dear Doctor,In the coronory angiogram for my father who is 65 years of Age, it has been observed that there is a 90% blockage in LAD vessel near S1 and 70% blockage near S2 and 80% blockage in LCX between LA and CX.In this case, what would your suggestion be i.e. shall we go for Angioplasty by deploying stints at all blocked locations or shall we consider the bypass surgery.Also, what is the expected lifetime for a sucessful angioplasty and what or how much are the chances of re-ocuurance.Your quick revert will be highly appreciated.Regards,Chintan",
