            "answer": "Hi, thinning of the intestinal walls can occur due to inflammatory disorders like crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. It could also be due to diverticulitis. Metabolic causes like diabetes mellitus can cause autonomic neuropathy and consequent thinning of the intestinal tract. As colonoscopy was normal any inflammatory colon disorders can be ruled out. The other causes for the pain could be infections of the bowel and bladder or prolapsed intervertebral disc. Regards.",
