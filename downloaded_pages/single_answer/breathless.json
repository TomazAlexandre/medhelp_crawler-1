            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Breathlessness can be due to several causes. The commonest cause is anemia. It can also be due to asthma like conditions, bronchitis, high blood pressure, diabetes, hypothyroidism or obesity. Certain heart conditions too can cause breathlessness. Stress and anxiety too can be a cause and so also gastric reflux. The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
