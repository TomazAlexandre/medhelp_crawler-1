    "question": "I have had this red area on my eyelids for 2yrs + now that flares up when I do not use the hydrocortisone cream prescribed for it.\u00a0\u00a0I was told it was eczema but it looks more like psoriasis to me, which I currently have on my scalp. I do have diabetes and hypothyroidism,\u00a0\u00a0both autoimmune.\u00a0\u00a0Link to photo: https://postimg.org/image/ve18etp09/ or https://s27.postimg.org/nmwk34yo3/2017_01_16_09_53_01.jpg . I have also developed dry flaking inside my ears. Any suggestions? The cortisone does not make it go away, just makes both less obvious.",
