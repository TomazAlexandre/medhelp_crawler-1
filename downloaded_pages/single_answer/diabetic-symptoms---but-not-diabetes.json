Have your pancreas tested.One or both misfiring can cause insulin production abnormalities3. Get a C-Peptide test to test insulin production.4. Another assumption is an autoimmune disorder.Google the above for an understanding in order to discuss them with your next doctor. Good luck.",

    "question": "I am wondering if anyone can help me out. I am displaying symptoms of a diabetic (very high blood sugars after I eat, extreme fatigue, etc) but I'm not diagnosed with diabetes - to be honest they don't know what is going on yet. But my body seems to be producing insulin at abnormal times. It seems that when my body recognizes sugar it over produces insulin but at a delayed reaction. For example, It is taking a long time to produce the insulin after I eat. My sugars are very high after I eat then my body seems to make a ton of insulin BUT its a good while AFTER my sugars spike and then my sugars go very low. I crash after I eat - if i sleep for about 10 min I sometimes feel a bit better but still kind of lousy. Any one experience anything similar or know anything? I have been to a few doctors who can't seem to answer what my body is doing. I am on a waitlist to see a specialist but am hoping to get some ideas or leads in the mean time.",
