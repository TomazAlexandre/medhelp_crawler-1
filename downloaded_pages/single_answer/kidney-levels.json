    "question": "Im a 37 year old very active and in shape woman.\u00a0\u00a0Last week I had routine physical and the blood work said my kidney level was 1.2 then they retested at 1.13.\u00a0\u00a0I followed up on a score from 2 years ago and it was .9.\u00a0\u00a0I have no symptoms and feel great and in extremely good health otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor has yet to follow up with me to answer any questions and ordered a 24 urine test.\u00a0\u00a0I understand muscular individuals could have higher level, is this true and how much?\u00a0\u00a0I have already scheduled an appointment with a nephrologist in 2 weeks but can you give my any opinion on these levels? Could this be normal? Are the test reliable? I also have no history in my family, no diabetes and low blood pressure.",
