    "question": "I'm sorry if I'm asking in the wrong place. I don't know where else to ask, so if anyone thinks this question is better suited elsewhere, let me know!My issue is that I've been running to the restroom to pee seriously every 15-20 minutes, sometimes more often than that. It started about 5 years ago when I was 18 years old. I was running to the bathroom every few minutes, and once I had to go, I had to GO, as in, if I didn't get to a restroom right then, I peed my pants. About three years later, it let up a bit for maybe a year, although I was still peeing a lot more than most people. Now it's started up again and is driving me crazy. I sit down to do some work, and before I can really get settled in, I'm running to pee again, lather, rinse, repeat. I told my doctor, and she checked my urine for glucose or bacteria and checked my blood sugar. Since she didn't find anything abnormal, she just kind of shrugged her shoulders and acted like I should just be grateful nothing showed up wrong in the tests. I wasn't coming in to have it confirmed that I didn't have diabetes, though...I was coming in because this is making my life super stressful.Any idea what else could be going on?",
