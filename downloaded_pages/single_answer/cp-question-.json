            "answer": "Hi!I can understand your concerns. Cerebral palsy does not have a strong genetic predisposition like diabetes\u2014hence the familial variant is not common. So, if you have cerebral palsy, the risk of your baby getting it is not very high. You can deliver a normal baby. However, make sure that all your health care providers know about your condition. Your doctor will be monitoring you and your baby more regularly than in other cases. Also, pregnancy can worsen the spasms. So, report any discomfort at the earliest. Take good care of your health, eat healthy, exercise as advised for pregnancy and remain positive. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
