            "answer": "Hi there,The normal results of GFR range from 90 - 120 mL/min.The two common risk factors for protein losses are hypertension, obesity and diabetes mellitus. If you have any of the conditions mentioned above treatment depends on identifying and managing its underlying cause. If that cause is kidney disease, appropriate medical management is very important. Untreated chronic kidney disease can lead to kidney failure. Consult a nephrologist and get your doubts clarified. Keep me posted.Best wishes and regards!",
