            "answer": "Im not a doctor nor do I have any expert knowledge on this subject but I dont believe being sad affects blood sugar levels. I do believe though that Stress can affect your blood sugar.Diabetes can cause depression.....but that is mainly do the person themself. I know when I got diagnosed I was depressed for a while, due to the fact that all my life up until then I hardly ever got sick nor ever had to go to the doctor for anything. But I eventually got over it, No sense in crying about something YOU can control. Just remember this, YOU have diabetes.......diabetes does not have you. Hope this helped.",
