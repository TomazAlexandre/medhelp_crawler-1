    "question": "I had this patch with slightly dry skin, no itching, on my pubic area( almost half of the whole area under the hair and a small part going toward the crease of the thigh ). I am a female 44 years old and had it for months.It was just a tone darker, and I thought it was a hormonal pigmentation change. Today, after coming from the gym,\u00a0\u00a0I saw that it became dark pink, red. At night it became a bit lighter again, but still more color than before.Can someone help me if they know what this might be. I am planning to see\u00a0\u00a0dermatologyst, but it's going to take some time before I get an appointment and I worry so much about it. Thank you.",
