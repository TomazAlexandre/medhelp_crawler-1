            "answer": "Repeat pregnancy loss is emotionally draining, and when no specific cause or treatment is identified, it is very frustrating as well. I am sorry to hear that you are having to cope with this issue.The good news is that many people with your history go on to have normal, healthy pregnancies resulting in healthy babies. Unfortunately I can\u2019t give you the answers you seek in this forum. None of the issues you describe points specifically to an easily identifiable problem. The most common genetic tests and considerations for repeat pregnancy loss as described by several genetic and obstetric professional organizations are below. You may want to discuss this with your healthcare provider to verify that the following list was considered for your circumstances, and discuss if there are any other non-genetic tests that make sense for your specific situation.\u2022\tParental chromosome analysis\u2022\tAnalysis of family history and ethnic background for clues related to repeat pregnancy loss\u2022\tTesting for inherited thrombophilia (blood clotting disorders) such as Factor V Leiden, Factor II prothrombin, and others.",
