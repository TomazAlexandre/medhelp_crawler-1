            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to obtain a history from you and examine you, I can not comment on a formal diagnosis or treatment plan for your symptoms. However, I will try to provide you with some information regarding this matter.There are many stroke preventative therapies, but it really depends on risk factors.Controlling High blood pressure, keeping your cholesterol controlled, and also managing your blood sugars to prevent Diabetes\u2014will all help you prevent a stroke caused by blocked arteries by atherosclerosis (fat accumulation) and lacunar strokes (which all these things harden your blood vessels causing them to close up).There are other causes also that cause stroke, one being something called Atrial Fibrillation, which is an irregular heart beat, and this usually caused by high blood pressure, but not always.Other causes of stroke include any conditions that make the blood thick, such as cancers or autoimmune conditions, or inherited disorders.Medications that help prevent strokes can be blood thinners such aspirin, plavix, coumadin, aggrenox, but these medications should only be started with the advice of your primary care physician!!\u00a0\u00a0He/She will know if these medications will help.As always, diet and exercise are crucial in maintaining health and also help prevent strokes.",
