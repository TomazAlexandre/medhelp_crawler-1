    "question": "I am a 28 year old male. For the past couple years, and especially in the last six months, I have been experiencing an odd mixture of symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0About two years ago I began having episodes if blurry vision that would last about 10 to 30 minutes and then recede. I also had two episodes if left sided facial numbness.\u00a0\u00a0My primary care doctor ordered an MRI if the brain, which was normal.\u00a0\u00a0He attributed the episodes to slightly elevated blood pressure and put me on lisinopril.\u00a0\u00a0After a while my symptoms stopped.\u00a0\u00a0About a year ago, I developed shingles on my left palm.\u00a0\u00a0Around the same time my left fingers went totally numb.\u00a0\u00a0This was attributed to the shingles. Aftwr three months the feeling returned.In August, I suddenly began experiencing extreme urinary frequency , having to go every 15 minutes or so.\u00a0\u00a0I tried a number of overactice bladder meds, none worked.\u00a0\u00a0My pc referred me to a urologist, who did a cystoscopy, which turned out normal.\u00a0\u00a0A couple weeks ago the bladder symptoms began improving.However, in November I began having left and mid chest pain as well as bilateral upper back pain.\u00a0\u00a0EKG and cheat x ray done- normal .\u00a0\u00a0I still have the pain every day.\u00a0\u00a0It is not awful, just persistent.Around Christmas, I started having swallowing trouble and the contact feeling that I need to burp. Started in nexium 3 weeks ago with no improvementFinally, the past week I've had pins and needles in the fingers of both hands.I have had full bloodwork done, no diabetes, btw.I don't want to keep bugging my doc, but I can't figure out what is up.\u00a0\u00a0Could this all be anxiety induced?Any thoughts appreciated.",
