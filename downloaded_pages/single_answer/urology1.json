            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for posting your query.What you are having looks like urge incontinence. Also called overactive bladder, you have an urgent need to go to the bathroom and may not get there in time, leaking urine. Now this may happen due to damage to the bladder nerves, muscles or damage to the nervous system(diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease).You need to get urine examination, urine culture and urodynamic studies, to measure pressure and urine flow done.First of all get Kegel exercises done. To do Kegel exercises, pretend you are trying to stop the flow of urine and this causes contraction of the muscles of the pelvic floor. If the symptoms persist then you may get medicines prescribed like Darifenacin\u00a0\u00a0or fesoterodine.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Wishing you good health.",
