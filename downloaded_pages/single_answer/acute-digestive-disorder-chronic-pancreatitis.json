    "question": "A female friend of mine is about 48 years old and has some severedigestive disorder - she does not seem to be able to eat most foods.She gets a bloated stomach, has to endure severe pain and developsa fever (with pain all over her body, including burning/irritatingeyes) whenever she eats most foods - nuts, fruits, juices, dairyproducts, potatoes, foods with even little protein content andall foods that are even slightly sour in taste. All that she seemsto be able to eat is plain rice with some boiled vegetables withoutany spices and apple juice. She also seems to suffer from severeconstipation, at times (not always) but if she takes laxatives,she gets severe stomach pain.She has consulted many doctors - a few said it is an extremecase of IBS, after performing several tests. One doctor said shehad duodenal ulcers that were mostly healed. One recent doctor,however, did several tests and concluded that she has chronicpancreatitis and that her pancreas has many cysts. He also saidhe observed \"fatty degeneration\" in her liver. She, however, hasnormal blood sugar (no diabetes) . He also diagnosed \"anteriormitral leaflet prolapse\", though I don't know whether that'srelevant to her digestive problems.She currently consumes a zillion pills before every meal,prescribed to her by her latest doctor, presumably all enzymesto compensate for her malfunctioning pancreas. However, even withthese enzymes, she's only able to consume the foods mentionedabove and she says it's getting worse day by day, i.e., the listof things she can consume is getting shorter. Even those foodsshe can eat do cause some trouble, but she says it's tolerable.With so many conflicting opinions by doctors, would you pleasestate what your opinion is about the latest diagnosis? Is thereanyway she could be treated, if it is chronic pancreatitis, fora complete/partial recovery? Is it possible to have chronicpancreatitis without having diabetes/insulin problems? Why areall those enzymes not helping her and why is she getting worse?Since she's not able to eat most nutritious foods, can she takevitamin or mineral supplements to compensate for lack of balanceddiet or would that cause problems if she has digestive disorders?Finally, would she need to be/can she be fed intravenously if herdigestive problems worsen?I know that's too many questions, but she's really suffering andI would really appreciate any help you could give.thank you very much,rs_____________Dear rs,As you realize from reading many of the other e-mails, abdominal pain is a difficult diagnostic problem.\u00a0\u00a0Chronuic pancreatitis should have objective findings that will support the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Abnormalities that can suggest pancreatitis include elevated serum amylase and/or lipase (although can be normal in chronic pancreatitis), pancreatic calcifications seen on x-ray, abnormal pancreatic duct wioth multiple strictures and dilations seen at ERCP. or fat in the stool.\u00a0\u00a0Although many people with chronic pancreatitis have diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes), one can have chronic pancreatitis without diabetes.The specific etiology of your friend's digestive problems can not be gleaned from the information that you provide.\u00a0\u00a0It is safe to conclude that the mitral valve prolapse and the fatty liver are NOT the cause of her problems.\u00a0\u00a0Because of the symptoms of bloating and pain (?diminished appetitie), gastroparesis should be considered as a possible cause of symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Ask the physician about the possibility of performing a gastric emptying study.Intravenous nutrition can always be tried if your friend has profound weight loss and malnutrition, symptoms that you did not describe.\u00a0\u00a0It should be understood that nutrition via the gastrointestinal tract is the preferred and safer route.This information is presented for educational purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Always consult your personal physician for specific medical questions.HFHSM.D.-rf*keywords: diet, abdominal pain, gastroparesis, chronic pancreatitis0.3",
