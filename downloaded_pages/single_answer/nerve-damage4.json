            "answer": "After my spine surgery I began to develop reflex sympathetic distrophy, please look it up. It is very serious\u00a0\u00a0and can get worse if not treated,\u00a0\u00a0The discoloring is a BIG indicator.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your DR about this.\u00a0\u00a0If you have it, work your butt off on the treatment.Mine was in my left leg from the knee down, I was fortunate to catch mine quickly, frequently icing the numbness 20 minutes and then an hour off, massaging the painful area no matter how bad it hurts, rubbing in zostrix cream to confuse the nerves (i think), excercise the leg, calf, foot, toes, really push through the pain. I am militant.\u00a0\u00a0All I do is work on my recovery. I even do this through the night. After 3-4 weeks I noticed a difference, and then it got better on a daily basis.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not 100% but I'm still working on it.",

    "question": "After spinal surgery for a pinched nerve, the feeling in the foot has not returned to full capacity. The color is darkening (blueish) and there is constant swelling. The skin is cool to the touch. So far the surgeon is not concerned and says I may have to live with this. The surgery was 2 years ago, and still I am \"dragging\" my foot when I step. Is there any rehab or meds to help correct this? I feel the situation worsening and I am afraid I will lose my foot for good if this keeps up. They have me on a generic Lyrica, that seems to help but not the results I want. There is no diabetes in the family and I have tested negative. Please let me know if you have any suggestions. I am open to any sort of treatment.",
