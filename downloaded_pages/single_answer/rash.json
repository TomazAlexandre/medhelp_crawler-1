    "question": "Howdy ya all!I just took shot 4 of a 48 week deal of Peg/riba.\u00a0\u00a0I have stage 4 portal cirrhosis.\u00a0\u00a0Hep C, type 1b.Last week I developed this really itchy rash on both inside lower arms.\u00a0\u00a0Is it something to be concerned about, or just another side?Also, I just read in the forum about this diabetes deal.\u00a0\u00a0I never heard that before, but maybe I should be concerned since I was a 30 year practicing alcoholic, now with hep c and cirrhosis. You know, sometimes this all feels pretty hopeless.\u00a0\u00a0My nurse said that my case is serious.\u00a0\u00a0I asked her how serious, should I visit my kids?\u00a0\u00a0She said yes, definitely.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor says 2 days to 5 years to live without a liver transplant.\u00a0\u00a0What am I supposed to make of that?\u00a0\u00a0Thank God for His Son and eternity!\u00a0\u00a0God bless you all! Hope you have a wonderful Jesus birthday!Ron",
