            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to chafing or rash due to friction rub or balanitis. Oral course of antibiotics is needed. In addition, please don\u2019t use any cosmetics on the penis, instead use some topical antimicrobials like Bacitracin or Lotrimin. Also corticosteroids and topical immunosuppressants can be used but they are available under prescription. Also retract the foreskin daily and soak in warm water to clean penis and foreskin. In case the symptoms persist then please consult a urologist/dermatologist for evaluation and antimicrobials and steroids prescription.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "It started with a constant itch around my thighs and scrotum area. There was no visible rash however. The doctor diagnosed it as jock itch and prescribed me Viaderm cream. While using Viaderm, I noticed the itch had already begun to spread to my feet, armpits, and buttocks. I visited the doctor again. He decided to put me on an anti fungal pill as the affected area is now too large for cream. I was prescribed Terbinafine 250 mg/day for 42 days. Within 10 days of using both the Viaderm cream on only gential area and taking Terbinafine tablets, all symptoms were gone. Three days later, I simply masturbated. A new type of infection appeared within hours. It was a red and extremely itchy rash on my penis head and foreskin. I decided to use Viaderm and within 4 days the problem was gone. Believing all infections were gone from my body, I made the mistake of masturbating again. This time, a different infection appeared within a few minutes. Unlike previous infections, this one did not itch, but simply burned. The next day, it became extremely painful. The tip of my penis was very red and producing a mucus like discharge every few hours. I used Viaderm but it didn't do anything. I went to the doctor yet again. He said it was a yeast infection and prescribed 1% Clotrimazole cream to be applied 3 times/day for 7 days. So far, it hasn't gotten any better. Even water touching the area is extremely painful.I am 20 years old. I do not have diabetes, STDs or HIV. I am very hygienic and considered by many to be a clean freak. I shower every day without exceptions. I have not used antibiotics for the last 12 months. I have not had sex for the last 12 months either. My questions are the following:-What actions must I take to eliminate this problem quickly once and for all?-How did a yeast infection appear so quickly after masturbation?",
