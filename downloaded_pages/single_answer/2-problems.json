    "question": "For the last 3 years I have been seeing a transparent/blurry circle on my right eye. This transparent circle is centered whenever I stare at something. This isn't a blind spot, but it's more noticable at night (up to the point where it\u00a0\u00a0covers/darkens my centered vision. This is only when there are no lights at all). I recently visited a retina specialist, and they told me I have a\u00a0\u00a0scar on/near my retina. Could this be the reason why I have\u00a0\u00a0see this transparent/blurry circle? If so, can it be removed?My next problem is common. I have been seeing double for the last 2 weeks. It's not very drastic since I see double on certain things. What are some treatments for double/distored vision?Thanks in advance.",
