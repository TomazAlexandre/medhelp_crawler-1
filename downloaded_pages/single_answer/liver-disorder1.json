            "answer": "Hello,In fatty liver there is fat in the liver, along with inflammation and damage. Fatty liver due to alcoholism is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. Chronic alcoholism can cause alcoholic liver disease which includes fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis and alcoholic cirrhosis. These are all serious conditions and the person suffering from these should avoid alcohol intake. Only if fatty liver disease advances a person can develop cirrhosis.The process can stop and, in some cases, reverse on its own without specific therapy. Lifestyle changes may be helpful. You should refrain from taking alcohol, as this will cause further injury to the liver. Treat diabetes if present and control obesity and high triglyceride levels. Adopt lifestyle changes like weight reduction, exercise etc. Indulge in exercise daily and avoid fried fatty foods. It is not advisable to discontinue any drug without consulting your doctor.Regarding the treatment taken it is best to have a frank discussion with your attending doctor and get your doubts clarified. Keep me posted. Early diagnosis and treatment will be helpful. This is only an advice and not a substitute for clinical examination. For more assistance and queries seek the opinion of an expert. I hope it helps. Best luck and regards!",
