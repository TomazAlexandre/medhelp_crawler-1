            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Fever persisting for two months despite treatment is called pyrexia of unknown origin. Most labs have a complete fever panel to rule out all the causes that could cause persisting fevers.Recurrent or chronic fever is seen in tuberculosis, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and other auto immune disorders, UTI, drug fever, sinusitis, glandular fever, otitis media, IBS, HIV, STDs, endocarditis, parasitic infestations, fungal infections, polycystic ovary, menopause, PID (pelvic inflammatory disease), lymphomas and other cancers etc. Dehydration is a frequent cause of low grade fever with malaise. So drink plenty of fluids and see. Anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue too can cause fever and these too should be looked into. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
