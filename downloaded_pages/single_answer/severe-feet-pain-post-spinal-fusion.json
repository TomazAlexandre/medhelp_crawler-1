It has been 6 weeks since surgery and I am having horrible right leg pain from knee down and foot and toe problems as well: tingling, burning: it is horrid: and for me it as at night time that it gets the worse too.

    "question": "Please advise me on the following difficult and unusually persistent problem:THE PROBLEM: I have severe pain on the bottom of both feet from my big toe, through the arch area, but never in the rear-heal area.\u00a0\u00a0The pain does not affect any other part of my feet.\u00a0\u00a0The pain began about two years ago.\u00a0\u00a0It has progressively worsened to the point it is intolerable.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is a burning, tingling sensation, and often a dull ache.\u00a0\u00a0It is much worse at night.MEDICAL HISTORY:\u00a0\u00a0Normal blood-sugar levels (i.e., I do not have diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0I have Restless Leg Syndrome, and REQUIP (1mg/night) is 99% effective.\u00a0\u00a0Ten years ago, I had two disks removed, and my spine was fused (L5-S1).PREVIOUS DIAGNOSES / TESTS / PAIN MEDICATION:\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ve had three different diagnoses of my feet pain from various neurologists: (1) it has something to do with my RLS, (2) it is caused by nerve damage resulting from the rupture of my disks at L5-S1, (3) it is neuropathic pain.\u00a0\u00a0Two nerve-conduction studies performed one year apart were both negative.\u00a0\u00a0I occasionally take small amounts of MS Contin (15mg, about four or five times a month) for chronic back pain (Failed Back Surgery Syndrome).\u00a0\u00a0It works well on my back pain, but is completely ineffective against the pain on the bottom of my feet.\u00a0\u00a0I have not sought treatment from my spine surgeon because I am 3,000 miles away.QUESTIONS: Should I seek treatment from a spine expert to determine etiology of feet pain?\u00a0\u00a0Should I request a Pain Management physician to assist me?\u00a0\u00a0What else should I do?Thank you for your assistance.",
