            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to parasthesia skin. Causes are neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, nerve compression, multiple sclerosis, diabetes and vitamin B 12 deficiency. Since you already have thyroid disease (hypothyroidism), so it means that you may need dose monitoring after getting your TSH levels checked.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
