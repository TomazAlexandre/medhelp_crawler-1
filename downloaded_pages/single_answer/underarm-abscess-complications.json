            "answer": "Hello,Since you are having repeated infection of the abscess, so get a pus culture or wound swab done from the area and take a specific course of antibiotics. Also get your blood sugar levels estimated as diabetes can cause repeated infections and delayed wound healing. It can also occur in vitamin C and vit K deficiency,diabetes,p-rotein deficiency or immunocompromised states. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
