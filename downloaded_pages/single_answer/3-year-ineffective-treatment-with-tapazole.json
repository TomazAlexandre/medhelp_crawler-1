Is your doctor a regular or Endocrinologist?Too me if you doctor is ignoring the symptoms then ask for a referral to an Endo, but make sure the Endo knows about the thyroid, some are only experts at diabetes.",

I feel tired all the time, I'm usually out of breath and I have a weird pain in the hands (like cramps). these past weeks I've been having a strong pain in the chest and I feel weaker. I'm freaking out I think I'm going to have a heart attack.My doctors never explained anything about my condition, I don't even know what kind of Hyperthyroidism I have. I've seen 3 doctors already.my current levels are:TSH: 0.02Free T4: 1.65T3: 227.20TRAB: 0.2",
