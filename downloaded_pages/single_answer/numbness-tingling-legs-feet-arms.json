            "answer": "Hi,Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur most often in your fingers, hands, feet, arms, or legs. This could be due to posture, injury to a nerve, pressure on the spinal nerves, lack of blood supply to an area, certain medications, lack of vit B12 and from certain medical conditions ( diabetes, migraines, thyroid problems, etc).\u00a0\u00a0It is important that the underlying cause of numbness or tingling should be identified and then treated.\u00a0\u00a0Have this evaluated further by your doctor for proper management. A complete medical history, physical examination and some tests may be done to help with the diagnosis.Take care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am having trouble with my tail bone.\u00a0\u00a0It is not painful but rather a horrible sensation that actually makes me feel sick to my stomache.\u00a0\u00a0 My legs (particularly the left one) sometimes feel like it is hollow and has a tingling, numb sensation which comes out the sole of my foot.\u00a0\u00a0I also feel it between my 2nd and 3rd fingers. When it is bad, my legs feel very heavy and I seem to shuffle my feet.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms are increasing as I can no longer lie on my stomache.\u00a0\u00a0The feeling worsens when I lie on my stomache - probably because the tail bone is being squashed in this position.\u00a0\u00a0The feeling lessens after a bowel movement then returns again.\u00a0\u00a0 I am scheduled for an X-Ray and to see a Neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0Just wondered if anyone had ever experienced anything like this.\u00a0\u00a0All of the blogs seem to involve pain and I cannot say that mines is painful\u00a0\u00a0It is just the sick sensation I absolutely hate.This discussion is related to/posts/show/894610.",
