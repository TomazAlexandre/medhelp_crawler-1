            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.You are experiencing repeated episodes of dizziness and numb patches/muscle pain. These symptoms could occur with problems in the inner ear, the brain and the cranial nerves. Dizziness could also be due to postural hypotension, where in upon standing blood pooling occurs in the legs and the brain is deprived of adequate blood supply and oxygenation. This is more common in the elderly and in people with diabetes mellitus. Discuss these options with your consulting doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am a 39 year old female in relatively good health, I thought. For several months now, I have had vertigo episodes that nearly always occur around 8 am on workdays, and will last for several hours. Nothing I try makes it better, water, coffee, eating, resting,etc. My doctor did blood tests & everything was normal except for a slightly high protein levels. In addition, for the last few days, I'm experiencing numb patches on my legs as well as muscle fatigue/pain. My doctor seems to be at a loss as to what is wrong with me & is retesting my blood and sending me out for an MRI. I just want to feel better. Any ideas???",
