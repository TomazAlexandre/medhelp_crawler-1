    "question": "I'm 36+5 and of course I'm huge, which has made me extremely self conscious. I've always had low self esteem because of my weight. At one time, I weighed 310 lbs, and spent a year getting down to 210, and obviously still had a bit of weight loss for to go(another 60 lbs until healthy weight for my height). Well, I got pregnant, and had to stop my weight loss journey, and even watching what I eat throughout my pregnancy, I'm back to 270, and absolutely hating it. I'm happy that my baby boy is perfectly healthy, and even happier that I don't have gestational diabetes being as though I was a diabetic before losing weight. But wow, it really almost puts me in tears when all I hear is how big I am. I was eating at my moms house yesterday and out of nowhere she says \"wow you're fat\", and I could've crawled in a hole and died at that point. Lost my appetite completely, and couldn't finish eating. It seems like no matter what I do, I've always gained at my appointment. My doctor hasn't said anything about it, and says everything is fine, but my self esteem is definitely not. I'm so ready to be done so I can start this weight loss journey all over again. Ugh.. :/",
