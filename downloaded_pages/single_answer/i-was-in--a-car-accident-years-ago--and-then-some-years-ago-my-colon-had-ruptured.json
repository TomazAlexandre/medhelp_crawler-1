            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear that you have gone through so much and are in so much pain. Underlying infection or inflammation (as in arthritis, IBS etc) in the body can result in the feeling of heat. Another possibility is hyperthyroidism or even diabetes. Antibiotic or other drug metabolism can also cause a feeling of heat in the body. Drink plenty of fluids, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and take multivitamins. Get your thyroid function assessed. Sjogren\u2019s syndrome is another possibility. It can also be due to heart problems, especially if you feel suffocated at night.It is important to get a MRI of the lower back to look for pinched nerves, herniated discs, arthritis etc.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetic neuropathy and neuropathy due to thyroid disorders should also be ruled out. Abdominal adhesions due to colon surgery could also be responsible for your back pain.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
