            "answer": "Hi!Blood sugar levels for both children and adults are almost same. Any fasting level within 3-5.5 mmol/L is normal. Even if you took a random sample, a level of 5.5 is normal. Excessive thirst or polydipsia can be due to several causes. The treatment will depend on the cause. Hence first the cause has to be found out. Polydipsia can be primary or secondary. It can also be psychogenic. One can feel very thirsty for hours together after a spicy or salty meal. Diarrhea, excessive sweating, exposure to excessive heat and sun can all cause polydipsia.This can also be the result of diseases like diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Heart, liver and kidney failure and also certain medications cause excessive thirst.Diabetes cannot be diagnosed by simple blood tests at home. So, please consult your child\u2019s pediatrician.Take care!",
