            "answer": "Hi,Insulin resistance, where your body makes ample insulin but does not respond as well as it should to the effects of insulin, is commonly associated with PCOS. They can happen independently as well.\u00a0\u00a0The is definitely an increased risk of diabetes in the future with a diagnosis of PCOS and/or insulin resistance--it is estimated approx 50% of women with PCOS have some glucose abnormalities including pre-diabetes and diabetes. There is some great info at this webpage:http://www.4women.gov/faq/pcos.htmIt is usually managed through dietary changes and weight loss, as well as use of specific medications like Metformin or birth control pills. A well versed PCP can certainly manage PCOS and insulin resistance, but if you are not sure about the comfort level of your own physician then an Endocrinologist is certainly of great help. GYNs also tend to be very comfortable treating PCOS.Take care.",
