    "question": "I am 29 years old. I do not have diabetes, but my doctor put me on Victoza 1.6 then 1.8 now at 1.12, no side effects thankfully, to help me lose weight.. I've been on it for about 3 weeks and have gone down 8lbs. I also have Hypothyroid and i'm on Levothyroxin for that and he also gave me Metoformin 1000mg, for CPOS. My question is.. with all this going on is there a way I can get pg? I've been trying for 8 years without luck and I so want to be a mommy.",
