            "answer": "\"The new guidance from the NRC recommends that the practitioners providing the radioactive iodine treatment counsel their patients as follows:* patients receiving radioactive iodine should avoid all direct or indirect contact (i.e., shared living space) with infants and young children following the treatment. (The specific amount of time would be determined by the doctor, depending on the dosage of iodine-131 given, but would typically be from two to seven days. More guidance on the timeframe will be detailed in the NRC's \"Regulatory Issue Summary\".) Ideally, infants and children should stay outside the home.* If a patient can't avoid direct or indirect contact with infants and young children, physicians should consider hospitalizing the patient.* If separation or hospitalization is not possible, patients should be isolated to an area of the home that can be used exclusively by the patient for a specific period of time. In particular, a bathroom should not be shared.\"Excerpt from \"Radioactive Patients: New Guidelines Issued to Protect Babies and Children from Thyroid Patients Receiving Radioactive Iodine\"",
