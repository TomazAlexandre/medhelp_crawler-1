            "answer": "Hi, unintentional weight gain can occur with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, where in due to hormonal irregularities the person has symptoms of irregular menstruation, weight gain, insulin resistance (diabetes) and excess androgenic activity causing facial hair. Again, if on HRT, symptoms of weight gain and bloating could all be the side effects of your HRT. It could also be due to hypothyroidism, it also causes constipation, weight gain and loss of appetite, it could be in the subclinical form, when it fails to manifest. Discuss these options with your doctor. Regards.",

Previously I have had Pyloric Stenosis, Fundoplication surgery for heartburn, gallbladder removal and a partial hysterectomy. Does any one know of what could possible be causing me this pain? I am giving up on doctors at this point.",
