    "question": "For the last several months I've been getting fever blisters on either the right side of my lower lip or on the left side of my upper lip. Two days ago, my lips started to itch so I applied Carmex\u00a0\u00a0to be on the safe side. This morning my lips are totally covered with fever blisters. I have no idea what's going on. What can I do to get rid of them and can my type 2 diabetes be causing this?",
