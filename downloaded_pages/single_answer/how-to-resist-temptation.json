    "question": "I live in a community that has a huge huge drug problem. I smoke pot and drink sometimes, and use to use ecstasy. Things have been really hard lately, what with dealing with my diabetes and my family. My sister is recovering from an eating disorder and my parents are having marital problems and right now I find myself turning to weed for release and relief, instead of experiencing the high. I know I've become dependent, and now I really am tempted to do E again. I just get so down and down and can't seem to get out of this funk. I have a few great friends, and they're great to talk to, but I don't want to unload all my **** on them either, I know how that feels. I've been seeing a psychiatrist for a few years now, sort of on and off. I guess I could go back to seeing him, but it whenever I walk out of a hour long session I never feel like anything productive happened. It feels more like he's just made me discover even more messed up stuff about myself.Drugs are everywhere, I know that. But here it just feels like its suffocating, tightening its grip. I'm trying to release its hold on me but with everything going on I just don't know how.Any suggestions would be so helpful, thanks.",
