            "answer": "A thyroid scan will not add much to this evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0You have a nodule (with \"negative\" biopsy) and a highish TSH - with this scenario, the scan is only useful to look for a \"hot\" nodule which is usually associated with a low TSH.Would also evaluate for adrenal under-activity.\u00a0\u00a0Test am cortisol - if >11 then completely normal, if not then consider ACTH stimulation testing.\u00a0\u00a0But adrenal insufficiency is rare.The cardiac and neurology evaluation is also appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0Unlikely a pituitary problem unless this is diabetes insipidus in which there is extreme thirst and frequent urination and usually abnormal blood sodium level.",

    "question": "I'm 40 year old female. About 10 days ago I started to have shortness of breath, heart palpitation and dizziness. I also have mild headache and eyelid itch/swelling for about a month. They all come and go. But when a bad course of the symptoms come I feel almost faint. It lasts about 30 minutes to 1 hour but sometimes I stay sick the rest of the day with a little dizziness and shortness of breath. Also at the end of this attack sometimes I feel like I'm getting diarrhea. It seems to happen more in the morning when I'm driving.About 5 days ago new symptoms started. Thirst, frequent urination and lower back pain.I was drinking water all day but after urination or bowel movement I felt more dizzy, off balance,\u00a0\u00a0shaky and lower backache was worse. With other symptoms I got scared and went to ER. They tested my blood, urine and chest X-ray. Everything was normal (not anemic, no sign of diabetes) except I was little dehydrated. After ER I got bad headache for 3 days and had to take aspirins.I also saw a cardiologist and he thought my heart was fine but scheduled for Echo Stress test.My medical history includes mild Barrett's esophagus (taking Protonix for a year), fairy large thyroid nodule (biopsy negative, TSH - a little higher side but normal range and T4 normal, size hasn't been changed much), ovarian cyst surgery in March, 06 (lost right ovary).I have had the bad course of attack a few times in the past. Also after my surgey I had shortness of breath, chest tightness and dizziness for a while. My blood pressure is always lower side.My primary physician ordered thyroid scan but I'm more worried about brain tumor or pituitary gland problems. I posted this in Neurology forum too but please help!!!",
