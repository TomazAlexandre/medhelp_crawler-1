    "question": "I'm a 48 year old male, insulin-resistant pre-diabetic with a strong family history of diabetes on my father's side, and heart disease and atherosclerosis on my mother's side.\u00a0\u00a0My mother's mother died of sudden cardiac death in her early 60's, and her father of an abdominal aortic aneurysm in his early 60's.\u00a0\u00a0I am generally sedentary and somewhat overweight (5'6\", 165 lbs).\u00a0\u00a0BP 120/70.\u00a0\u00a0Resting HR 56.\u00a0\u00a0I do not use caffeine, and I drink alcohol only occasionally.My father has diabetes and my mother had a triple bypass with aortic valve replacement (due to aortic stenosis) several years ago.\u00a0\u00a0They're both in their late seventies and in otherwise good health.My brother and my first cousin (on my father's side), have chronic pericarditis, beginning at age 15, and my father has had several episodes of pericarditis in his 70's.Several weeks ago, while on vacation, I was resting in a swimming pool.\u00a0\u00a0I suddenly started wrestling in the water with my son.\u00a0\u00a0We were vigorously horsing around for about a minute.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped because I was out of breath.\u00a0\u00a0When I stopped my heart went crazy.\u00a0\u00a0I had all sorts of palpitations.\u00a0\u00a0It was very erratic, but it wasn't especially fast.\u00a0\u00a0I was a little dizzy, too.\u00a0\u00a0It lasted approximately 15-20 seconds, and then went back to normal (fast, because I had just been exerting myself, but normal rhythm).\u00a0\u00a0This exact scenario repeated itself 2 more times within the next half hour or so.\u00a0\u00a0It really scared me, so I just stopped playing around so hard.I've had mild palpitations before and since, off and on, but unrelated to exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Lately I have been working on a project in my yard that requires a lot of exertion, but I build up to it.\u00a0\u00a0I have not had any palpitations related to that work, although I have had to stop to catch my breath several times, with some very mild pain in the center of my chest.I'm going to see a cardiologist this week, but I wanted to know what he's probably going to look for.",
