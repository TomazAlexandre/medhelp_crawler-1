            "answer": "Hi there!Emotional causes of poor erection are common in young men while physical causes are seen in older men. An erection involves your brain, nerves, hormones, and blood vessels. Anything that interferes with either of this can lead to erection problems .Stress, fear, anxiety, anger all can lead to erection problems. Repeated feelings of guilt, doubt, poor communication with your partner all can lead to erection problems. Intake of medications like beta blockers, antidepressants, and diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, and multiple sclerosis all can lead to this problem. Try to evaluate yourself and discuss it out with your partner. A relaxed mind and a good foreplay should help. In case the problem persists seek medical help. Do write to us again.Best luck!",
