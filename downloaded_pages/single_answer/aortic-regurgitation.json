            "answer": "cjpmiller,Thanks for your questions.Sounds like your doctors need to converse with one another!(1) I don't know which reading was right.\u00a0\u00a0The only way for me to know would be to look at the echo.(2) The likelihood of the aortic regurgitation leading to heart failure in a person with mild-moderate regurgitation is unknown, but probably low.\u00a0\u00a0Some experts would suggest that if a bicuspid valve is at the root of the problem then perhaps 33%-50% would eventually require surgery.\u00a0\u00a0In patients with moderate to severe regurgitation who have no symptoms, the rate of progression to symptoms (and thus surgery) is approximately 2-5% per year.At the CCF, for patients with greater than mild regurgitation, we look at the Aorta to see if a bicuspid valve is present or if their is aortic dilation.\u00a0\u00a0If neither are present, then we check labs to see if the person has an underlying disease of the vessels.\u00a0\u00a0Regular blood pressure checks and exams are performed.(3) The effect of age and exercise on the heart is variable and difficult to predict.\u00a0\u00a0Discuss this issue with your doctor in the context of the rest of your history.The bottom line is that your doctors need to decide the severity of the regurgitation and communicate this with you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "Thank you for making this forum available!\u00a0\u00a0I am a 32-year-old male who just had an echo.\u00a0\u00a0The technician said I had a slight murmur, the cardiologist said I was normal (but to get another echo in 3-4 years if I wanted), and my primary care doctor said I should be concerned.\u00a0\u00a0So, naturally, I'm confused and worried.\u00a0\u00a0Here is what my echo reads:\u00a0\u00a0The Color Doppler reveals an aortic systolic jet of .9 m/sec.\u00a0\u00a0Antegrade flow across mitral valve is normal.\u00a0\u00a0Trace-to-mild mitral regurge, trace-to-mild aortic regurge. trace tricupsid regurge, and trace pulmonic regurge.\u00a0\u00a0Now, the IMPRESSION reads the same EXCEPT for aortic regurge, which is described as mild-to-moderate.\u00a0\u00a0I am confused why the Doppler reads trace-to-mild and the impression reads mild-to-moderate.\u00a0\u00a0From what I've read on here, trace/mild is not a big deal.\u00a0\u00a0But mild-to-moderate is.\u00a0\u00a0My MD suggested antibiotics for dental visits, etc., and seemed to take the mild-to-moderate very seriously.\u00a0\u00a0Also, my EF was 55%.I don't smoke, don't drink, am not overweight, have 120/80 BP, resting heart rate of 65 or so.I have a few questions:1.\u00a0\u00a0Which is the correct finding:\u00a0\u00a0the Doppler or the Impression?2.\u00a0\u00a0If the impression is correct, what is the likelihood of mild-to-moderate degenerating to severe/congestive heart failure?\u00a0\u00a0How much can my lifestyle (BP, lower resting heart rate, no diabetes, etc.) retard that degeneration?3.\u00a0\u00a0My EF is not stellar.\u00a0\u00a055% sounds borderline.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been running this past year.\u00a0\u00a0Will my EF go up as I run more and strengthen my heart?\u00a0\u00a0Do EF's diminish with age? Thanks!",
