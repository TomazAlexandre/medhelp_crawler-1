            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Your symptoms could be due to several causes. Diuretics, given for high blood pressure can pose this problem. It can also be due to overactive bladder syndrome, urinary incontinence, prostatitis, interstitial cystitis or even cancer. STDs too cause similar problems. Diabetes insipidus too can present this way with increased frequency of urination.You need a comprehensive investigation taking all these points in consideration. Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
