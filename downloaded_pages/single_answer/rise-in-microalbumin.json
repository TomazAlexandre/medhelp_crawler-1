            "answer": "Hi there. Microalbuminuria occurs when\u00a0\u00a0the kidney leaks small amounts of albumin into the urine\u00a0\u00a0due to abnormally high permeability for albumin in the renal glomerulus. a microalbumin urine test determines the presence of albumin in urine . Normally in a proper functioning body, albumin is not present in urine because it is retained in blood by kidneys. microalbuminuria is diagnosed either from a 24 hour urine collection or more routinely from elevated concentrations in a spot sample, 30- 300mg/24 hrs and 30-300mg/L.\u00a0\u00a0This is usually an indicator of subclinical cardiovascular disease, marker of vascular endothelium, an important prognostic marker for kidney disease In diabetes mellitus and hypertension. it is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism. Correction involves the correction of underlying cause. Take care.",
