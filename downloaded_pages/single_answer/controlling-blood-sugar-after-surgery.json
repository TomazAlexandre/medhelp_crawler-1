            "answer": "Hello,Thank you for writing in on behalf of your Mom. I am afraid this rsponse may come a day late, so I am quite sorry for the delay.You are indeed correct: high glucose levels are associated with slower healing and more post-surgical complications\u00a0\u00a0s it is certainly in your Mom's best interest to have her blood sugars better controlled before she goes into surgery. Metformin is a good medication. There have been some warnings about development of lactic acidosis, mainly after radiology procedures but also others, particularly when the patient is not well hydrated or has other kidney damage. The incidence is still quite low BUT to be on the safe side most people stop taking their Metformin two days before surgery and restart it after a few days on doctors recommendations. In the interim most people are started on insulin atleast temporarily until they can restart their oral diabetes medications. This is a general recommendation based on what you have written but ofcourse her doctor knows her best, so please discuss this at length with him/her as soon as possible.All the best to you and your Mom.",

    "question": "My mother (75yrs) goes in for a bilateral mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection tomorrow morning (July 17th) ; it is scheduled as an outpatient procedure. She has type 2 diabetes that has been under control until just recently. Presently her blood sugar levels have been consistently elevated (fasting = 13-16). A few days ago she started taking Metformin to try to start lowering her blood sugar and there has been no change. I understand that high blood sugar levels are associated with higher risk for infections and complications and that Metformin is sometimes associated with lactic acidosis when taken just before/after surgery.My concerns:- is it safe for my mother (75yrs) to take MetforminHCL the day before and day after surgery?- What can I do to help if/when her blood sugar goes too high?- When (at what blood count) does it an emergency?",
