            "answer": "Hello pupzababes,I'm sorry to hear about your recent health problems. To properly answer your question I would require more specific information, particularly in relation to what you describe as a 'mild stroke', the exact medication you were prescribed, and some more details about the pain you are experiencing.The term stroke is used to describe irreversible injury to the brain (confirmed on CT scan or MRI) that results in numbness, weakness, or changes in speech, thinking, balance, or vision (among other things). Stroke in young patients requires a number of tests to try and work out why this has occurred at such a young age.A pinched nerve is a general term to describe pain or change in sensation caused by nerves being 'pinched' or squeezed, most commonly when the nerve travels close to bones and joints. Nerves supply sensation to areas of skin and so when they are 'pinched' it can feel like a band of pain or numbness. If a pinched nerve is suspected, additional tests might include an x-ray, a CT, or even an MRI.Knowing whether your heart is safe will depend upon the answers to these questions. In general, we can evaluate the health of your heart by asking questions about your family history, risk factors for heart disease (smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, kidney problems), performing an EKG, arranging blood tests, and an ultrasound of the heart (an echocardiogram). Sometimes an exercise test is helpful in understanding how your heart responds to physical work.As a first step I would write down your questions and return to your doctor to see whether you can better understand the diagnosis he has made. You can also ask whether further tests are indicated.If you believe that you did have what sounds like a stroke it is very important that you see a neurologist as soon as possible. Alternatively, a heart specialist or cardiologist may be helpful in answering some of your questions relating to your heart.",
