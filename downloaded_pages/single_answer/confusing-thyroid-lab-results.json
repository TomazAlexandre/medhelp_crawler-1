            "answer": "I am betting that the first lab is really normal, when a child is hyperthyroid even subtle the tsh is suppressed and free T4 is the one to check that would be elevated along with total t4, we don't bother with t3 since it is crazy in kids from time to time. Labs do vary and it even makes us endocrinologists crazy. So, with no symptoms of hypothyroid and absolutely NO hypothyroid labs which is what we are looking for with hair loss (rarer with hyperthyroid) I would suspect that the patches are indeed alopecia areata.Now with autoimmune disease in your family and alopecia we need to watch her for other concerns that are also triggered by antibodies. These are some of the things you mentioned, thyroid-which has been checked and if antibodies are positive then repeat at a pediatric endocrinologist office is important. Celiac disease, Addison's disease, chronic yeast infection of the skin, pernicious anemia, diabetes, and other endocrine problems. These are all rare bit important to keep in mind. My bet is that she just has alopecia areata isolated. I usually ask the dermatologists to help me with that part!Hope this helps",

    "question": "My six year old daughter started developing small circular bald patches on her scalp. Her pediatrician was unavailable (on hospital call) so I took her to a well respected dermatologist who ordered a TSH, Total T4, and Total T3, though I don't think he thought they'd come back abnormal. He dx her hair loss as Alopecia Areata. Needless to say, on 3/17/08, her TSH = 2.820 (norm 0.360-5.400), her Total T4 = 18.7 (norm 4.5-16.1), and her Total T3 = 361 (norm 121-233). She subsequently saw her pediatrician and he said she was hyperthyroid, though we needed to do more tests to determine if this was primary Grave's or autoimmune. (I have systemic Lupus and Hashimoto's myself). We saw her pediatrician 3/24/08 and he ordered a CBC, Sed rate, TSH, Free T4, Total T3, ANA, Thyroglobulin AB, and Thyroid peroxidase. We are waiting on the last three to come back. Her CBC and Sed were completely normal. Her TSH = 6.910 (high this time), Free T4 = 1.24 (norm 0.65 - 2.30), and her Total T3 = 224 (normal this time). Her pediatrician said he didn't know what to make of this, and suspected maybe a lab error occurred w/ the first results. (He's confident in the second results, as he drew her, labeled the tubes, and hand delivered them to the lab). He said the alternative was that for the first time in 36 yrs of practice, he caught an early Thyroiditis. He said that the endocrinologists no longer feel Alopecia Areata and Hyperthyroidism are connected. My daughter doesn't appear toxic. She has had alot of Strep Throat infections, and regularly c/o a sore throat, even w/o strep. She seems to have exces nervous energy at times, but does well in school. I am thoroughly confused by all of this. Her pediatrician has spoke of repeating the tests again in a month, and depending on the results, maybe then referring her to a Pediatric Endo. Any suggestions or explanations you could offer would be greatly appreciated. I am a LPN also - which makes me question this all the more. Thanks.",
