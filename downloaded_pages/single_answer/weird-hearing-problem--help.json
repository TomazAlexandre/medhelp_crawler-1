    "question": "OK, I've brought this to my ENT guy and he just looks at me like I have several heads. To Be honest, I didn't understand the cause of this at 1st and thought it had an environmental cause.OK, I've had moderate Tinnitus for around 20 years. I'm a musician and I'm sure it's caused by playing in bands.But, recently I've had 4 \"incidents\" happen all with the same symptoms:After working for a long time bending over facing down: (Twice working on lawnmowers, but also redoing my deck and driveway) I get a High End hearing loss in my left ear accompanied by very loud Tinnitus in that ear and a sort of jangling sound that's a cross between keys being jangled and soda fizzing (wind chimes??). The 1st 2 times it went away after a few hours, the 3rd time took 2 days, and this 4th time is still here after a day. There have been no balance problems. So it doesn't sound like Meniere's.I am a 61 year old Male, with the beginnings of Diabetes and on BP and Blood Thinner meds.Does anyone have a clue what this could be????Thanx!!\u00a0\u00a0JPAS a musician, anything that affects my hearing is a worry.",
