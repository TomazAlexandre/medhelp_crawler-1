    "question": "Thanks for your reply. I assume my problem to be a neurological disorder since diabetes, B12, and thyroid have all been ruled out on repeated blood tests. Nor have I ever worked with heavy machinery to account for my condition. I've seen three neurologists in two years, two giving me the diagnosis of restless leg and restless arm, another channelopathy. That being said, I get the vibrations/fasics everywhwere - my abdomen, eyelid, lips, jaw, etc.,which doesn't seem consistent with that doagnosis. Can restless leg and resless arm manifest itself as generalized fasiculations? I've also read something about sympathetic nervous system dominance. Is this an accepted condition by the medical community? What is the treatment for it?",
