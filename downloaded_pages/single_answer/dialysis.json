            "answer": "Hi,Presence of microalbuminuria is not an indication of dialysis. Dialysis is done only in established cases of chronic renal failure. I\u2019ll suggest you to consult a nephrologists for the same and get yourself examined and you\u2019ll probably need several tests to assess the kidney functions. Diabetes is the commonest cause of microalbuminuria and it needs to be tested too. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
