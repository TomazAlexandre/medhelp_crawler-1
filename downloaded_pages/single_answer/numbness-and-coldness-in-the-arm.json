    "question": "So I love being outdoors. Running, hiking, walking, tennis, etc. But lately, when I run, or do something active, my arms go numb veins bulge out. One time I was even hiking and my arms turned ice cold and I became extremely dizzy. (i had plenty of water so i wasnt dehydrated) I don't understand when this is happening. I've been told it could be from a heart disease? I'm only 22yrs old so this is nuts. Anyone know why this is happening?",
