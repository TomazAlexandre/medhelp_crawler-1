            "answer": "Frequent infections and infections that don't heal, as well as problems with feet CAN be related to diabetes. However, more common symptoms are increased thirst and frequent urination as well as fatigue. If he had a blood sugar of 195 this indicates you should test further for diabetes. \"Borderline\" means pre-diabetes which means he might be on his way to type 2 diabetes and changes should be made in his lifestyle to prevent or slow this progression. His doctor should be working with him and educating you, not just calling it \"borderline\" and sending you home. I don't know if he had a random blood sugar (which is pretty meaningless) or a fasting blood sugar but he should have an A1C which is an average of blood sugars for a couple months. That 195 is a red flag. check further and if your doctor isn't helpful, get a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist.",
