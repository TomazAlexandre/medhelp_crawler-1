    "question": "Hello everyone! I am new to this site. I am a nurse and I live in Texas. I have been living with lupus for many years. I was diagnosed in 1994. I now have heart disease, diabetes (I am on insulin), & fibromyalgia. I have been married for almost 41 years and have a son and a daughter. I only have one grandson who is 16. He's very spoiled! I also have 3 poodles that are my babies! They make me happy and keep me going. I had a angiogram on Friday and am home recouperating. I had two large areas of blockage in my left anterior descending artery. One between the two stents I had place back about 3-4 years ago and another area below that one. When they went in and did the angiogram, it didn't show up like they thought it would so I believe all the prayers that folks sent up for me worked! I was so happy because they thought I might need to have a bypass and I sure didn't want that! Anyway, I just wanted to say hello and I will check in now and then to see what's going on. I work full time as the Chief Nursing officer at a local rehabilitation hospital and am going to school trying to get my master's degree in nursing, so I stay very busy. Wishing you all a pain free week! God Bless! Susan",
