            "answer": "I agree with the testing done so far.To address your questions:1) The MRI results would make MS less likely.\u00a0\u00a0If MS continues to be a concern, a lumbar puncture can be considered for further evaluation.2) The course of MS is variable, and there may be a relapsing course during pregnancy.3) I cannot give a definitive diagnosis without evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0 A neurological condition continues to be possible.\u00a0\u00a0Nerve conduction studies can be considered to look for peripheral neuropathy, which can cause pins and needles and other paresthesias.4) I would consider the nerve conduction studies as the next step.\u00a0\u00a0Blood tests to evaluate for B12 deficiency, thyroid deficiency and diabetes should also be considered.5) I cannot answer the question regarding pregnancy without knowing the exact cause of your symptoms.Another neurological opinion can be considered if the diagnosis remains elusive.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.kevinmd_",
