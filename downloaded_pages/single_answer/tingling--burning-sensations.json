            "answer": "Sounds\u00a0\u00a0like you are doing quite well with your diabetes care with A1c being 5.2. Blood glucose values varies depending on when measured, so will not comment on that. The tingling burning sensations in your feet are due to a breakdown of sensory cell function, a complication of diabetes. It may eventually contribute to neuropathy.You can get help by learning and using an alternative therapy called WarmFeet. It is a relaxation technique designed to improve blood flow to the (periphery) feet delivering more oxygen and nutrients to those tissues. A side benefit is the stress management effect which will help lower your stress levels as well. Instructions and biofeedback assisted relaxation for this therapy is available at http://www.WarmFeetKit.com. If you decide to do regular daily practice\u00a0\u00a0with WarmFeet, I believe it will be of great help to you. Let me know.",
