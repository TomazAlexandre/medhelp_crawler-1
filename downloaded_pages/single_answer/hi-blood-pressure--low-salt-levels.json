            "answer": "Hi!High blood pressure can be corrected by several medications which has no effect on the sodium level in the blood or sodium excretion from urine. Your doctor can prescribe any one or a combination of that. You need to find out why you are losing sodium or having low sodium.Prolonged sweating, infections, drinking too much water, diabetes insipidus, adrenal gland dysfunction, kidney and liver problems, prolonged diarrhea,or vomiting, certain medications such as diuretics etc can all cause low sodium in the blood. This is a serious issue and needs to be investigated. You need to consult a doctor and run tests to find the cause. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
