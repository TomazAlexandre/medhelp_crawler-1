    "question": "Posted By George Bouchard on April 11, 1999 at 12:24:20:Just had an episode of partial field loss (50%) in my left eye following cessation (36hrs) of my anti-hypertensive drug, Valsartan (AT1 blocker), was evaluated in opthalmology and internal medicine. CT scan and MRI of brain and orbit are normal except some mild edema of my left optic nerve. No MS lesions etc. Blood work normal for diabetes, cholesterol, sed rate, etc.All my MDs think that my neuritis is ischemic. My othalmologist thinks it is irreversible ? What is your opinion. Thanks !",
