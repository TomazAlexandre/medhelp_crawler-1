            "answer": "Hi,It would best to discuss these issues with your doctor. The stage descriptions are based on extent of disease, hence it is largely anatomical. However, this anatomical extent is used to correlate with long term prognosis. Hence, the stage has prognostic impact, the robustness of the impact is usually applicable only to the initial staging. For example, if a patient presents initially with liver involvement, the impact on outcome would be different compared to someone who had the primary disease removed, and then there is recurrence in the liver after 5 years. Bear in mind also, that all of these are based on estimates. Patient characteristics, the presence of other diseases like heart disease and diabetes, weight loss, and overall activity levels day by day would also provide important information on estimating outcomes outside the staging systems. Stay positive.",
