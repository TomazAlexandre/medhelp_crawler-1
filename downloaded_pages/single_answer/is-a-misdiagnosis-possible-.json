    "question": "I had routine blood work taken back in November 2016.\u00a0\u00a0It was reported that my A1C was 7.2. The doctor that ordered the blood work called and informed me I have type 2 Diabetes. I followed up with my primary care doctor. I was instructed to monitor my blood sugar several times per day. From day one and no major changes to my diet or lifestyle, my fasting blood sugar has been no higher than 90, but runs usually between 70 & 80. My blood sugar two hours after meals has been between 80 and less than 100. I even used another glucose meter to make sure the readings are consistent. I'm confused! With these blood sugar numbers, how can I be considered diabetic? Can an A1C test be wrong?",
