            "answer": "I cannot address your poor MIL's overall condition, which cannot be good, but I can tell you what the mitral valve \"regurgitation\" can be doing especially if it is severe.The left side of the heart is pumping against the right side of the heart due to the blood which should be going to the organs of the body, being diverted or \"regurgitated\" through the leaking mitral valve. This is causing pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema and can form a pulmonary embolism (clot).This leaking blood resides in the pulmonary artery and/or pulmonary vein (the exact location of this misguided blood is determined by the pressure differential between the left and right ventricle). The higher output pressure of the left ventricle forces blood from the left atrium up into the pulmonary artery THROUGH the leaking mitral valve. If the mitral valve was not leaking, or would close tightly when it should, all the blood would go to the right place.She needs a new mitral valve ASAP, from what information you have provided. She also probably needs to stay away from salt and should probably be on a blood thinner.The Cleveland Clinic is the very best at valve repair or replacement. The famous hospital in St. Louis, and I have forgotten the name of it, is also extremely good at this procedure. Good luck.....",

    "question": "Hi everyone:I am new to this forum but need to get some advice from someone who knows more about this disease. My mother in law who is 76 has been suffering from congestive heart failure for 2 1/2 years. She has been to the er many times to have fluid drawn off but her symptoms seem to be worsening. She is staying a little swollen evern with lasix and she is naseous all the time. She has to sleep setting up and she has a fluid cough that won't go away. They did an ehcho on her heart and she has severe mitral valve infarction and her other heart valves are leaking. The general physician said she is in really bad shape and she is sending her to a cardiologist on Friday. Any input on her condition would be appreciated we just don't know what to do. How bad is this? She also has insulin dependant diabetes and has had for 40 years and she is obese,Thank you again for your inputJackie",
