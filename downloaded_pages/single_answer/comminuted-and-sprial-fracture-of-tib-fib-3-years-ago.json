            "answer": "Hi!I am not sure what exactly happened. However, maybe when the first X-ray was taken the bone was in process of healing. Thereafter the weight on the leg may have caused the fracture segments to move apart. There can be non-union too due to different causes such as ow blood supply, poor mineralization, presence of diabetes, presence of infection, poor alignment, or too much space between the fracture ends. This is treated by bone grafts, immobilization with plates and screws, or removal of scarred tissue from fractured ends. Basically all these processes need surgery. Consult your orthopedic surgeon for a confirmed diagnosis. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I had a comminuted and sprial fx of tib/fx 3 years ago. I had surg that day with Open reduction and internal fixation, IM rod and screws. I am still in a lot of pain this many years later. My ortho said that the bone looked like it heal nicely but when I had xrays taken 1 week ago it looks like there is a gap in the bone again. Can this happen?? How does it go from looking \"normal\" to a gap on the films. It is hard to bear weight completely on the leg. I have been diagnosed with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome but this pain feels diff. I have an appt with Ortho but its a few weeks out. Does anyone have any idea on what could be going on? I don't know if it makes a diff but I am female aged 36, 33 at time of accident.Any help is greatly appeciated.",
