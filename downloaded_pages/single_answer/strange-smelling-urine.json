            "answer": "Hi,How are you? What other symptoms are present? Changes in urine odor are usually temporary and are often associated with certain foods and medicines, including vitamins. However, foul-smelling urine may be due to bacteria, such as those responsible for urinary tract infections. Urine tests may need to be done to rule this out. Sweet-smelling urine may be a sign of uncontrolled diabetes or a rare disease of metabolism while liver disease and certain metabolic disorders may cause musty-smelling urine. If it persists, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking plenty of fluids may also help. Take care and do keep us posted.",
