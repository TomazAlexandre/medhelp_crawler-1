            "answer": "Hi,Your father's morning blood sugars overall appear to be very good, as does his blood pressure. Do you check his sugars at any other time of day? Given he is on insulin especially, I would suggest checking it atleast two other times(including bedtime to be sure he is okay before going to bed).In terms of the walking problem, it can be from years of diabetes or form another issue that may be somewhat unrelated. If he is having trouble walking and does not have an obvious injury, I suggest speaking with a neurologist to see if this is neuropathy related to his diabetes, or perhaps another condition.Hope this helps, take care.",
