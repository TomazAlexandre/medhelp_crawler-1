He spent 3.5 months in the hospital of which the first 35 days was in the MICU on the ventilator 4 times, infections, 3 heart attacks etc. He had to learn to walk all over again which he as been doing great but recently he's become very weak, twitching in both arms and legs which has just started happening along with sleeping all but 3.5/4.0 hours a day. The doctors don't seen concerned due to his stats being good. I know there's something wrong but I don't know where to start. Any help would be greatly appreciated. He is a diabetic also.",
