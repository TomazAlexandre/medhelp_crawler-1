    "question": "Had bypass surgery five years ago. Have diabetes, it is under control. Insulin dependent. Thin and in great physical shape, jogging three or four morning a week.\u00a0\u00a0A few days ago, noticed lower leg edema. Experienced chest pains, and went to see the doctor. the doctor did an EKG, and sent him to the hospital for more tests. They did a chest X-ray, and blood tests. All were normal! They wanted hospitalization, but the pains went away., I was not comfortable in that particular hospital. It was overcrowded, unclean, and not healthy. They did not even hook me up to a heart monitor.Left the hospital, got home and had chest pains, on and off.Could this be a heart attack? The doctor has now ordered a CAT scan of his chest for tomorrow morning. What will this show? Should he be in a hospital? Please give me your advice. Thank you.",
