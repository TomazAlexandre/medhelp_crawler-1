            "answer": "Hi!While bad or poor oral hygiene can affect teeth, since you have cough, it is possible that you have a bad gastric reflux.\u00a0\u00a0Take Omeprazole empty stomach in morning and an antacid gel at bedtime. Refrain from smoking, alcohol, fuzzy drinks, caffeine, and spicy foodExcessive fatigue can also be due to menopause/hormonal imbalance of PCOD, anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome 9this you are diagnosed with), depression, low Vit B12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 Postviral fatigue syndrome is another possibility. Persisting EBV infection or mono can also be the cause. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind even though you have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Craving a particular food type could be due to depression. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
