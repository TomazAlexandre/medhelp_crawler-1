            "answer": "Hi!It is difficult to diagnose skin disorders on net.\u00a0\u00a0Drink plenty of fluids and water. Keep a trough of water or use a humidifier at home in your rooms. You can apply petroleum jelly and glycerine on the dry area at bed time. When choosing a moisturizer, look for oil-based creams and ointments. Fresh juice of tomato, cucumber and orange can be applied. Fresh cream too can be applied on the rash.If these tips do not help, chances are that the dryness is due to underlying skin conditions like dermatitis, psoriasis etc. Vitamin A deficiency, hypothyroidism, Sjogren's syndrome, and diabetes too can cause dry skin. Localized patch of dry skin can be due to eczema, dermatitis and psoriasis.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral to\u00a0\u00a0a skin specialist.

    "question": "A few years ago, my underarms started to peel, I thought nothing of it so I put some lotion on it and moved on, few years later and dozens of bottles of lotion later my body is covered with these weird brown patches of skin. It's dry and it peels, and sometimes I can rub most of it off, but it just comes back! What is it?!",
