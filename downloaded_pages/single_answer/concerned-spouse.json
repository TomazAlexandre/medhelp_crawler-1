    "question": "My husband had bilateral knee replacements 8 years ago, with fantastic results.\u00a0\u00a0In April of 2007, he partially tore the ligament in his right knee but declined treatment.\u00a0\u00a0In Feb. of this year he began having what he described as \"charley horses\",\u00a0\u00a0in his right calf that became progressively more painful, eventually inhibiting his gait and developed an overwhelming fatigue and loss of appetite.\u00a0\u00a0He had an ultrasound that ruled out blood clots.\u00a0\u00a0A\u00a0\u00a07\" long Bakers Cyst was found which was severely infected and by then had spread to the prosthesis in his right knee.\u00a0\u00a0The cyst was surgically removed and the prosthesis removed with a spacer temporarily inserted. He was discharged to home with 7 weeks of I.V. Vancomycin.\u00a0\u00a0A new prosthesis was placed and apparently has healed well.\u00a0\u00a0The problem of most concern since then is that he continued to lose weight (approx. 60#) since March of this year; fatigue has continued; he is constantly complaining of feeling cold and achy.\u00a0\u00a0In the past 2 months he has been experiencing momentary black out spells, usually upon standing from a sitting position or after walking a short distance. He notes a \"bright light \" just prior to the collapse.\u00a0\u00a0He is slightly anemic: extremely low blood pressure, very pale and drawn.Diagnostics:\u00a0\u00a0general blood work including TSH (normal even with history of partial thyroidectomy): RBC ( slight anemia): B-12 (low);CT scan of the abdomen (negative); endoscopy (small hiatal hernia); colonoscopy (scattered polyps- biopsy, negative/ diverticulitis):\u00a0\u00a0CT of chest, pending.",
