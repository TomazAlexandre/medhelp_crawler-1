            "answer": "Dear BabsD,I am sorry to hear about your heart problems.People who have left bundle branch blocks (LBBB) on the ECG are at increased risk over those who do not. People with a prior MI who\u00a0\u00a0experience PVCs are at increased risk as well. This new finding is likely related to your previous heart attack. However, I would consider the possibility of having experienced another attack which has resulted in the new LBBB. I would recommend making an appointment with your cardiologist for another evaluation which should include an echocardiogram. You should be taking the following medications: aspirin, beta blocker, statin and an ACE inhibitor. Hope this helps.Thanks for your question,CCF-MD-KE",

    "question": "I'm a 38 yr old woman who was diagnosed at 31 as having had a silent heart attack, although the doctors don't know when it happened. I was having PVCs(benign), which I mentioned to my Internist during a routine exam. An ekg showed abnormal results, and an echo showed a small area of damage. I next had a thallium stress test, and a heart catheterization showed damage from a moderate heart attack, although I had normal coronary arteries. I had taken the Pill for 5 yrs prior to diagnosis, and my cardiologist is assuming that the MI was caused by a blood clot, possibly related to the pill, although I guess I will never know for sure what caused it.I've had several echos and stress tests since diagnosis, with no change.I don't smoke or take drugs, drink rarely and am otherwise healthy,although I am 40 lbs overweight. My EF is 50, blood pressure normal, all other tests have come back negative/normal: clotting/coagulation tests,diabetes,lupus, Lyme,excess iron,hepatitis,HIV,lipoprotein a, anti-phosholipid antibody, anti-nuclear antibody tests,etc. I currently take 1 mg folic acid, 81 mg aspirin, 25 mg atenolol, fish oil and a multivitamin. My total cholesterol:186, HDL:43 LDL:130 Trig:68.I recently had an EKG which showed something new:left bundle branch block.\u00a0\u00a0A previous stress test had shown exercise-induced LBBB, but this had never shown up before on an EKG.\u00a0\u00a0Is this something to be concerned about?\u00a0\u00a0Also, could this lower my EF?Are there any tests I should have to evaluate this new finding?I am VERY worried about this and would appreciate your help.",
