            "answer": "So her nerves are intact in some places...but perhaps walking on them when she was in pain caused her nerves to enter a traumatized/shocked state.What tests have been run on her--MRIs, CT scans, bloodwork, etc.? How old is she? Did she have any other symptoms besides leg pain? It could be a lot of different things, but tests will help us figure out more specifically what it might be. Diabetes is something that jumps to mind, as does polio--both of which are treatable. Lupus and fibromyalgia might also cause extreme pain, making it difficult or impossible for a person to walk (but the person wouldn't be paralyzed in any way, just in intense pain).Good luck, and I hope you and your daughter are able to figure out what's going on soon!",
