            "answer": "Dear Evangelina,i can't think of anything from diabetes that could bring on headaches except low blood sugars which she should check after exercise. i am not a medical person but a diabetic helping with my experience. The only other thing i can think of would be diabetes induced blood flow but that would most likely manifest during different times than just exercise. So she should try what her trainer recommends and if that doesn't\u00a0\u00a0help a doctor may be needed to investigate.Good luck for your daughter, bret.",
