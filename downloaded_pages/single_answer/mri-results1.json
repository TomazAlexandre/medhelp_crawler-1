            "answer": "Hi!What you have probably been diagnosed with is complex migraine. In this, headache is combined with other symptoms such as numbness, tingling, vision problems etc. So, if you have these symptoms, then your diagnosis is correct.Periventricular small vessel disease can cause headaches and other neurological signs resembling mini strokes such as tingling, numbness etc. Since the chances are chronic and stable, there is no cause of panic. However the cause behind it such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia etc should be looked into and kept under control.Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
