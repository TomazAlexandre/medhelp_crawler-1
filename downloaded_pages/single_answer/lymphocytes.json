            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!A single reading of low lymphocytes is not very diagnostic unless the value is really very low and can be due to a viral infection, post flu, due to low Vit B12 and folic acid. You need to wait as advised and repeat the test. In all probability it will come back to normal.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
