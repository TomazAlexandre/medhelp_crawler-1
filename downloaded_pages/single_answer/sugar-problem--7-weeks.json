    "question": "My OB just requested a OGCT and my result is 141.6 now, my OB told me to have another test which is OGTT, and if the results were not good does it mean i have diabetes? I'm so worried because it can result to stopping of my baby's heartbeat if not controlled! I hope not. Is there anybody here who's experiencing such problem? Need advice thanks",
