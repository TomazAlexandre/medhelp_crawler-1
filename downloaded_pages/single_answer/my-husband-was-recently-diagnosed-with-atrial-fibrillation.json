    "question": "The doctor put him on a blood thinner and sent him home, still in A-Fib.\u00a0\u00a0Next was a sleep study. That proved he had sleep apnea. He will need a C-PAP machine.\u00a0\u00a0But the cardiologist had talked about putting in a pacemaker.\u00a0\u00a0Pacemaker for A-Fib? CPAP machine for sleep apnea? Or is it one or the other? What does one thing have to do with the other? Or is there no connection?",
