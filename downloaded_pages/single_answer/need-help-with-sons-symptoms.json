    "question": "Hello-- I really need help figuring out what is wrong with my son.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice would be very helpful.\u00a0\u00a0He is 6 years old.For over eight weeks he has been urinating frequently, very thirsty, hungry, he has lost a little weight, has headaches, has circles under eyes.\u00a0\u00a0So, basically classic symptoms of diabetes.However, his tests, mostly done in the beginning, all came back normal. Urine, fasting, GTT, A1C.\u00a0\u00a0Could he still be in the early stages of developing diabetes?We had allergy tests done and celiac and they were all normal also.\u00a0\u00a0Of course it is great to get normal results but it doesn't change the fact that we are dealing with these symptoms every day!Our doctor is sort of brushing us off, probably hoping it will go away. I can't blame him there!Should we be pushing for more tests?\u00a0\u00a0IDoes anyone have a similar experience?Thanks so much",
