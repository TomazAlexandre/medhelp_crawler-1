    "question": "Recently diagnosed with T2 Diabetes. Complete lab work up done and all tests perfectly normal except my TSH was at 23. Also two days before the test was done had 2 teeth pulled and recently had a chest cold. Dr wants to repeat test at some point but till then do I need to worry about this? I keep reading about all these Autoimmunes that cause Hypothyroidism and am worried it could be something serious. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
