    "question": "I have a niece with diabetes and reswearching online, I learned that high glucose levels cause sorbitol to be accumulated in the eyes which result in a white lens called cataract. Does the existence of sorbitol in the eye cause tears to taste sweet? I read that someone who had cataract surgery due to diabetes had her eye eaten by ants.",
