Please speak to your doctor about seeing a neurologist who can offer other suggestions.Take care.",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with idiopathic neuropathy, mainly in my feet. I have read that prediabetes can cause a painful type of neuropathy. I had a GTT recently. My fasting BS was 97 but increased to 144 after the first hour. It then dropped to 77 at the 2 hr. mark and 73 at 3 hrs. Are these number high enough to be classified as prediabetic? Do you think high blood sugar could have caused my neuropathy?",
