            "answer": "Hi,The chest X-ray was probably done to evaluate the cough. An explanation for all of your symptoms with a single disease would be a bi tough. There is a subtype of lung cancer called small cell lung cancer. His kind may cause symptoms in the nerves by messing up the immune system, causing the immune system to attack nerves. The back pain may also be evaluated, but a different X-ray that focuses on the bones of the spine would be better requested. It would best to discuss with your doctor the rationale for each test. I understand the anxiety of being asked to do certain testing without any definite direction where it is all going. Stay positive.",
