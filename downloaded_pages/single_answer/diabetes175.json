    "question": "Hello all. I was diagnosed with diabetes 8 moths ago. All my labs tests were normal except diabetes. I had pain under armpits\u00a0\u00a0on chest and thighs n groin area.\u00a0\u00a0My internist told me its muscular neuropathy caused by diabetes. Put me on citalopram and painkillers. My 2HR glucose was 117 and after 2hrs 170\u00a0\u00a0.generally my sugar level is higher above 150 at random. I still have under arm pain and thighs pain though it has lessened now. But when it returns ,I feel bouts of anxiety and stress. I'm not on diabetes treatment. I believe I had diabetes since long. I have lipomas, when they form I'm in extreme pain. Can Neuropathy be caused by sugar levels like mine?Stop watching",
