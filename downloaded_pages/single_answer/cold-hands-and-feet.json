            "answer": "Hi,I agree with Dr Lupo that your symptoms and blood tests suggest early low thyroid disease.I do not have an explanation why your hands seem warmer to you after eating. Diabetes can be linked to poor blood flow and cold extremities, but that is not usually altered by eating. Sorry I do not have a good answer for you!Take care.",
