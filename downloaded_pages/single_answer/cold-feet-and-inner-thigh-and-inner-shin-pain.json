            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are a few possibilities like hypothyroidism, peripheral neuropathy like in diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, Reynaud\u2019s phenomenon and very cold external temperatures. You do say you live in very cold climate. So keep your legs warm. The other possibility is peripheral vascular disease. You would need angiogram or color dopplar for this. In your case this could be the likely cause as you also have inner shin and thigh pain. Please consult your PCP to rule these out and get a referral to a vascular specialist.Hope this helps. Take care!",
