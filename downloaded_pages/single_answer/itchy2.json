            "answer": "Hello,This itch can be due to contact dermatitis, hives,a llergic reaction or parasthesiae. Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the crawling sensation is gone or not. For the itching antihistaminics like Benadryl or Claritin can be taken.If the symptoms are severe then please get an evaluation done from a doctor.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Yesterday my scalp, back of my neck, and upper torso began to itch furiously! The worst is my scalp though. I definately do not have lice, none of my hygene habits have changed, and I've not eaten anything different than normal. It just feels like bugs are constantly crawling on me. Has anyone else experienced this recently?",
