    "question": "Okay so I'm 16 years old I lost my virginity October 15th 2015. Okay so short version I had sex the condom broke and my boyfriend now ex cummed inside me. 2 weeks later I started feeling nausea, back pain and just felt different. I went into my hot tub one night and after I got out I went to the washroom and found one drop of blood on my finger k. So I assumed a miscarriage but I wasn't sure. So what I did is I went to the doctors wrote down all my symtoms like back pain, constant uses of the bathroom, constipation sore boobs ect. Basically all pregnancy symptoms. First test. Negative. Blood test negative. I was tested for vitamins hormones thyroid diabetes gonorea and chlamidya all came back negative. I've taken multiple tests all been negative... So what I thought is okay it's just in my head. But things started progressing I got discharge I had bumps on my boobs I had started growing a belly and gaining weight. Since October I've gained about 13 pounds. I eat more than I usually do. Recently my stomach gave me what I thought was a Braxton hick where I felt sick got a high temperature and then all I felt was tightening it lasted for about 30 seconds... And there was no pain. Plus my stomach was like rock hard But I've been dealing with this for 5 months and if I am indeed pregnant I'm 24 weeks. But I've had spotting and still getting a\u00a0\u00a0period but it's late and my belly is hard and everything",
