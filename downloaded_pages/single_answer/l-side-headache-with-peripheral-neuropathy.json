            "answer": "Hi,There is a possibility that you are suffering from migraine. You can try OTC painkillers for your headache. Polyneuropathy can be simply because of vitamin deficiency or diabetes. I suggest you to get your blood sugar test done. Normal MRI is a positive sign. I would suggest you get a vision test done as well. Good luck!",
