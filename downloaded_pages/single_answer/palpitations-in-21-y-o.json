    "question": "So last Saturday I was working (EMT for a huge ambulance company) and I started to feel light headed and weak. I was also very aware of my heart beating. My pulse was 80 and BP 128/68. It lasted maybe half an hour but the effects remained all day, I felt beat up.Well two days ago while eating dinner with the family I felt my heart race three times very quickly. It felt like something ran across my chest. I became sob and weak, probably due to anxiety it caused.Went to the ER and the findings were unremarkable: normal sinus on the 12-lead, good chest x-ray, normal blood tests. Doc diagnosed it as palpitations with the possibility of panic attack/disorder. Told me to go see my family doc. I did and they mentioned PSVT, WPW, or maybe stress/panic attack. I am on a holter now and will be getting an echo on Tuesday. I am guessing PSVT or Panic b/c my rate is never even approaching 150, let alone coming close to 100 most times. This may rule out WPW.Family history: Dad has Marfan's Syndrome and experienced MVP. Mom has SVT due to stress the think. She has had three episodes in maybe three-four months. Other than that it is good hx with almost everyone in my family living to at least 90 years old.Any thoughts?dxu",
