    "question": "I am 25 yo and for the last 1.5 years my feet get stone cold when laying down to go to sleep. It does not matter if it is 100 deg or 5 deg out. Sometimes since they are so cold then they start to hurt really bad. Also even as I am sitting here right now I my feet are burning. I do not have diabetes. This all started after being diagnosed with Autoimmune hepatitis and I think after starting Imuran, But no doctor can figure this out. I sleep with socks and a heating blanket and it is still a issue",
