            "answer": "I am not familiar with the use of steroids for spastic paraparesis.Steroids in general have antiinflammatory actions and if used in high doses can stop the production of our own body's ability to produce steroids. So the dose needs to be monitored, and if a patient is on more than a week they need to be weaned slowly and carefully by a physician with experience. Also the steroids can affect blood sugar in a susceptible child-usually obese or those with strong history of borderline diabetes. There can be affect on growth with inhibition of growth hormone effect. Simple side effects we may see include stomach upset or long term problems include osteoporosis.All are common things we can see in any child getting steroid treatment but these side effects are balanced with benefit.So ask mom to sit down carefully with your neurology team and give them the same questions you did for me",

    "question": "I have a nephew who is 32 months old and who still cannot walk on his own. He has been diagnosed with spastic paraparesis and is being given Risatarun (not sure if name of medicine is very accurate, since they live in Europe) and was also sent to phisycal therapy. The doctors he has been seen by all have different opinions about his condition, and seem to not know the cause of this. The last recommendation is to start a treatment with steroids and we are unsure if that is something that would be safe for the child.Also, is this condition treatable, curable or is it something he will live with for the rest of his life?",
