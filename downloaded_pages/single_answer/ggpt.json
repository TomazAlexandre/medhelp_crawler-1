            "answer": "Hello!GGT is usually elevated in liver disease, obstructive lesions of the biliary tree, use of drugs like phenytoin and barbiturates, pancreatic disease, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, alcoholism etc.Though GGT measurement is\u00a0\u00a0a sensitive indicator of presence or absence of hepatobiliary disease it is not a very specific test. For diagnosing any condition it has to be correlated with other liver function tests and clinical findings. Use of Lipitor may cause a high GGT but enzymes may also be raised .In alcoholism GGT may be raised and SGOT and SGPT may be slightly or not raised at all. In case you are having any symptoms related to the conditions mentioned above it is best to discuss it with your physician.Take care and good luck!",
