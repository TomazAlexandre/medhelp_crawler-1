    "question": "I'm 15 and my name is Brayson. I've been having sensation of lightheadedness a lot lately. I'm unsure of the cause of if its anxiety or not. I've had a history of passing out about 3 times total 2 from locking my knees/ letting blood flow to legs and the second was I was sick with pneumonia and on medication and I saw a friend with diabetes test their blood sugar and they say the blood gave me syncope/fainting from the sight of blood since I was sick. None are from anxiety, But now I get light headed,feel tired, and worried. I don't know if it's from anxiety and if I had anxiety could it possibly be the fear of passing out in public again? Also this happens while standing and sitting.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I'll pass out if I stand to long even though I move my legs to allow blood flow. Anything helps thanks.",
