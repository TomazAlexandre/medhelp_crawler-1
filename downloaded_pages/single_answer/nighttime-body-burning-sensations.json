            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Burning symptoms could have many potential causes. Of the neurologic causes, a neuropathy is one of the more common. A neuropathy is a generic term for some sort of dysfunction of the peripheral nerves. There are many potential causes, most commonly diabetes. Symptoms may be worse at night though typically will occur during the day as well. Diagnosis is made based on history and examination; distinguishing between the types of neuropathy depends on the history, examination, and other tests. If your symptoms occur as you are at rest in the evening or at night, one other possibility is called restless legs syndrome; this would not typically wake you up but rather occur when you get in bed to go to sleep.Discussion and evaluation of your symptoms with your primary doctor (internist/family physician) is recommended, with referral to a neurologist as deemed indicated by him/her.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
