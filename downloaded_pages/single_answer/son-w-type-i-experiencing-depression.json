    "question": "My 24 year old son has had Type I since he was 10. He has always handled the disease with great discipline, but last Spring he was also diagnosed with Celiac Disease. A one-two punch that has really taken a toll on him. He confided in us this weekend that he's experiencing some severe bouts of depression and needs help. I'm contacting some doctors to try and figure out a plan of attack to help him. Any words of advice or encouragement on this would be most appreciated!Carol",
