            "answer": "Hi,How are you? CVA, is nothing but cerebrovascular accident or stroke. The usual risk factors for this condition are atherosclerosis, thromboembolism, hypertension, diabetes, age, hypercholesterolemia, bleeding disorders etc. In you husband\u2019s case, open heart surgery indicates he had blocks in the vessels supplying the heart, so the same could happen in the vessels of the brain.Due to CVA, there is a increase in intracranial tension and patient\u2019s conscious level can alter, nausea or vomiting, headache, papilledema can occur. Is there any blood mixed sputum or difficulty in breathing? A CAT scan (a special X-ray study) of the brain is often done to show bleeding into the brain; this is treated differently than a stroke caused by lack of blood supply. A 2DEcho and carotid ultrasound would aid in confirming the diagnosis.I think you should take him to the hospital immediately for making the diagnosis and immediate initiation of treatment.Best..",

    "question": "My husband just had open heart surgery. Three by passes and an aortic valve. He has no desire for food. He vomits every day not food only salava and phlegm. He took an EEG, it came back abnormal. It said to take an other to rule out CVA what that means i do not know i just know is is very sick we have tried every thing with no answers.It said the findins are suggestive of cerbral dysfunction which is etiologically nonspecfic. Left hemisphere slowing is suggestive of potential structual lesion and need to rule out CVA. Sharply contoured delta activity over the left temporal region is suggestive of possible seigure\u00a0\u00a0and clinical correlation is warrented . He losing weight every day from not eating because of this\u00a0\u00a0Please help us iam very very worried . Thank You.Sincerely,Geri",
