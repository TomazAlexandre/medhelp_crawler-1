            "answer": "Hi,How are you?White matter changes do not always imply as serious disease. Long standing high BP, diabetes, chronic alcoholism, old age and chronic headache can also cause white matter changes.Since the white matter changes in your case are due to small vessel ischemia, it indicates you have increased chance of getting a stroke.Please quit smoking, alcoholism if applicable in your case. Make sure your BP, blood cholesterol and body weight is within normal limits.",

    "question": "Hello, I am a 55 year old female who had a MRI scan because I constantly suffer from dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0I recieved my MRI scan results yesterday and I am worried, as they found white matter.\u00a0\u00a0I have been recieving MRI scans every year for the past 15 years, but this is the first time they found this white matter.\u00a0\u00a0My MRI scan results are as follows:MRI BRAIN:Multiplanar multisequences scan performed with thin slices to CP angles without contrast.- There are multiple small high signal intensity areas in white matter on both side in FLAIR sequence without any mass effect.\u00a0\u00a0This is non-specific.\u00a0\u00a0This could be due to ischemic changes from small vessels disease.- Tiny low signal intensity area in left parietal region just above posterior part of left lateral ventricle in FLAIR sequence and high signal intensity area in T2 sequence suggests lacunar infarction.- No signs of intra/extra axial mass or bleeding seen.- No signs of brain oedema or midline shift.- Normal cortical sulci, grey matter, basal ganglia and brainstem.- The sellar, parasellar, corpus callosum and pericallosal area appear normal.- Normal ventricular system, CP angles and basal cisterns.- IAM, IAC and inner ear ossicles appear normal.\u00a0\u00a0No mass seen in CP angles.- Prominent left vertebral artery crossing midline and forming basilar artery.- Both ethmoids and right maxillary show changes of sinusitis.- No signs of increased intracranial pressure.Thank you so much for your time, and I'd appreciate any help you could give me.Have a good day.",
