            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confiming a diagnosis is tough,but it sounds like itching due to friction rub(intercourse,friction rub with clothes),contact dermatitis ,sweat dermatitis or heat rash.Wash the areas several times with fresh water. Do not use any cosmetic products at the sites. You can apply some calamine lotion at the rash as it will help in soothing the skin.Also wear cotton undergarments.Application of mild corticosteroid cream is also helpful.If the symptoms are severe then it will be best to consult a physician and get internal diseases like kidney or liver disease,diabetes and iron deficiency anemia ruled out as all of them can have itchy skin as an accompanying symptom.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
