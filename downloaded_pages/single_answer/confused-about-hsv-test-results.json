If you aren't sure if you were tested for both hsv1 and hsv2, call and ask so you are sure.Hsv doesn't run in the family. It's a contagious infection that can be passed from family members to family members but it's not something like breast cancer or diabetes that can actually be triggered by a gene passed on in a family. Make sense?grace",

    "question": "I am trying to figure out the exact range for results in an HSV test. I recently went in for my yearly exam and my 6 mos paranoia check. This is the first time in my life that a Dr. has ever tested me for HSV. My bloodwork came back to me all tests neg, however my HSV had a slightly elevated level at .99. I am quietly freaking out because I have always tried to be cafeful with whom I have sex with and maintain long term partners. There was no definitive answer as to whether the test was generalized, or specific for I or II. I know that HSV I runs in my family with most everyone I know having had cold sores at some point in our lives. I have gotten them after running high fevers. But in my nether region I have never experienced any symptoms of having HSV II. Can someone provide some answers and information for me? Can someone help me find appropriate information to educate myself? Thank You.",
