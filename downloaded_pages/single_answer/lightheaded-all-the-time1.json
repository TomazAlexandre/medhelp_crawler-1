            "answer": "Hello,Information comes to part of brain from the vestibular system located in the inner ears which help keep the body upright and allow it to move in a coordinated fashion. Vertigo is caused due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. Ear causes are the commonest causes of vertigo. Benign paroxysmal vertigo, Meniere's disease, labyrinthitis, head trauma, neck injury, and migraine all can cause vertigo. Other possibility is that your symptoms could be due to Syncope, which is temporary loss of consciousness and posture, described as \"fainting\" or \"passing out.\" Check with your doctor to rule out anemia and metabolic disorders like diabetes. If your dizziness feels like you are spinning or the room is spinning (and especially if associated with nausea or vomiting), this might be due to an inner ear problem. The condition needs proper evaluation. Keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",
