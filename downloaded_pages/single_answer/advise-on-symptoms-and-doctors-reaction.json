    "question": "Hi.I have over the passed year been suffering with stomach problems (bad hart burn) and take medication to reduce reflux. Over the passed 6 months I have been very tired and sleep when I get home from work for about 4 hours and then I will wake up for about 4 hours and then go to bed for the night at about midnight. Most nights I will sleep fine but every night I get hot and sweaty, not bucket loads but just over clammy. I get dizzy a lose energy very quick. I have dizzy spells and some times need sugar boosts. I have had about three diabetes test that have all been normal. I get bad headaches, have a swollen belly like I am full and it is very uncomfortable. I was diagnosed with gastric two months\u00a0\u00a0ago but I have had this before and it was different. I did not have diarrhea it was soft and lost red blood. But that all healed over about two weeks and have been good for about 6 weeks. I went to the doctor again about my stomach and he done loads of tests. He told me to call in about a week for results. But this morning he called me with the results and said that all came up pretty much ok but my white blood count was quite high. He said I would need another blood test to check them again. But he did not ask me to come in to the surgery tomorrow which is when they do them but he will send me a letter with an appointment. He seemed very vague on the phone, why did he just not ask me to come in and have it done tomorrow like before???I posted here because it had similar Q???? hope this is okPS male, age 33. do not do a very active job but even getting up to wash the dishes can tire me out.Any help with this would help.",
