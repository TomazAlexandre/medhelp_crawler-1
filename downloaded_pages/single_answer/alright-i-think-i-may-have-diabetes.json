    "question": "Alright so now i'm thinking i might have diabetes. I had long going thrush infections that just won't go away, i'm always tired i can sleep from 11 to 1 the next day and still feel tired. I'm always having to wee and drink a lot of water. I've fainted twice during menstruation, at first i thought it was low iron because my periods would go on for nearly 2 weeks but i checked and it wasn't. So maybe it might be diabetes? but i really don't know because no one in my family has had it and i'm really skinny :S",
