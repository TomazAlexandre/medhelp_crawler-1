    "question": "Since age 18, I have had yeast infections regularly. 35 years later, I'm still having them, although for the 15 years they have been completely atypical. There is no visible discharge, no itching or burning. Just a piercing, searing pain both anal and vaginal. I know it's yeast because after the first miserable episode, my former ob/gyn cultured a swab and it was yeast. A course of three days on Diflucan generally clears it up with noticeable improvement within 24 hours, but it's nearly impossible to get a doctor to understand and prescribe meds. I am type 2 diabetic, which contributes to the cause of the recurrent infections. The diabetes is well controlled. Is there anyone else in the world who gets a yeast infection that sounds like this, or am I the only one? Aside from sleeping with an ice pack wedged between my buttocks and in my vagina, is there any other way to get any relief??? How can I get my doctor to believe me\u2014this has been going on for many years. I also get more typical yeast infections, though generally no discernable discharge. Those I can deal with. The searing pain with this, I cannot! Please help.",
