    "question": "I use a computer for my livelihood. I'm 57 and have noticed in the last year that my astigmatism that used to take hours to occur and then corrected itself in 10 minutes of non close eyework, now happens in 3 minutes and takes more time to recorrect. I have 20/20-20/40 vision when I don't read or use computers, but since I earn my living this way, that only happens on days off.I've also noticed that when watching TV for a long time in our theater room with a large flat screen tv that it also happens.The result is that I see images above AND below whatever I'm looking at and it's blurring my vision to where my eyes have to shut down to a slit to see anything up close accurately and I'm afraid this is only going to get worse. To pile on, I have type 2 diabetes and an apparently developing cataract in the left eye. The left eye has to shut it's eyelid almost within those 3 minutes to see a good image, the right eye fares somewhat better, but it has to shut down within an hour or two.I've gotten bifocals that don't appear to help tremendously when I have to stare at computer screens 10-14 hours a day at work. I' ve just had \"far distance\" lens glasses made from my opthalmologist's last prescription (about 1.5 years old) and they seem to help but only if I keep looking away from the computer screen making me less effective at work.What can I do?",
