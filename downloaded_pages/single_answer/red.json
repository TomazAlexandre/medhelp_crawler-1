            "answer": "\"I checked my sugar this am it was 138 2 hours after I took the Metforman.\u00a0\u00a0I ate breakfast and took a walk\"Correct me if I'm wrong, I'm gathering from your comment you took Metformin on an empty stomach, tested 2 hrs later, then had breakfast, then took a walk. What did your breakfast consume of? How much time into your walk did you feel light headed, and how much time did it take you get back home and test? How often do you test? What is your eAG [estimated Daily Glucose Average]?Going from 138 mg/dl then down to 78 mg/dl in several hours is not out of the ordinary. Getting lightheaded is and has several causes. Filling in the blanks from my questions would help narrow down the cause/s.",
