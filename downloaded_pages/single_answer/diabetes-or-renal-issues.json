You have health issues beyond our medical scope which should be directed to a certified medical doctor. I understand your position not having medical insurance and suggest you Google search for Free Clinics in your surrounding area. Some are free and some charge on per income basis - what you are able to afford at time of visit. Good luck.",

    "question": "History: Male, turning 48 in June. After getting the fall 2000 flu and not getting better, I was diagnosed with primary Cardiomyopothy, secondary Pulmonary Hypertension and Fibromyalgia. Since, my symptoms consist of chronic fatigue and pain, shortness of breath, vertigo and extreme chills for no apparent reasons. Not being able to work as an engineer or PM, I have always taken 1 to 2 mile walks when I could, and play house-husband.Lately: I went to the hospital by ambulance without insurance twice, a week apart, at the end of March and beginning of April, and the Cardiomyopothy and Pulmonary Hypertension were confirmed, along with additions: Hyponatremia, Hypokalemia, Hypochloremia and Hypocapnia. These were disregarded by the hospital MD, who stabilized my heart pains with Morphine, and sent me on my way. (I am uninsured.) From mid-March to mid-May, approximately 60 days, I lost 42 pounds, going from 189 to 147. I also think I have recurring Petechia (the only thing self-diagnosed.)Now: Before this, I switched to a nearly all fruit and vegetable diet, good juices, water and fat-free and/or calorie-free food, such as yogurt, sour cream, mayo, cottage cheese and milk. Now my blood pressure hovers at 76/60, with a pulse of 79, chronic vertigo, loss of appetite for food and drink, burning and tingling feet and hands, see-sawing between constipation and diarrhea, and a pain in/under my left biceps. After much Internet research, I\u2019m afraid I might have diabetes or a renal issue. Without insurance, I need to make a wise decision about going to the hospital, my only medical/doctor option. And the last 2 sentences are my questions. Does anybody have any ideas or opinions?",
