    "question": "Hi, my name is Brandon. I just turned 18 and got a recent check up to find out I have diabetes. I was kinda worried at first, I never knew anything about Diabetes. I struggled to find a good website. Some websites would have one thing but i was looking for a site that could be my \"One Stop Shop\" of diabetes information.Web Browsing, and waiting for people to answer you on information can be frustrating and boring. I posted a link below to the site I use, and I hope this helps someone as much as it did for me. Thank You for reading.http://www.diabetes.cc-index.com/",
