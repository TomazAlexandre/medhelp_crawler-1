    "question": "I have type 2 diabetes and have been having severe pain in my upper back area or lower left pelvis area for several weeks.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is so intense that prescribed pain killers only put me to sleep but doesn't erase the pain. Burping doesn't help and passing gas relieves little pain and the pain feels like muscle spasms. I can barely move or sit upright when in pain. Is this more than just trapped gas? I have no appetite but must eat because of my diabetes.",
