But in your case you didn't provide any information on how you are controlling or managing your diabetes, whether you test at home, what your test results are, type of medications, or whether you're a male of female.Something to keep in your mind when you are asking for help on a forum such as this:We are not standing behind you or at your side. We cannot see what is going on. If you were to imagine that you were talking to a blind person and trying to describe the situation so that they could see in their own mind what is happening, then you have a good idea of how to ask for information from us forum folks.An example is what type of water?- tap- well- bottled- steam distilledIf all the above then you may be experiencing an internal disorder unrelated to diabetes.",
