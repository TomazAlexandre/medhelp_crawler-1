            "answer": "HiThese itchy fluid filled bumps on the fingers may be due to dishydrosis, a fungal infection or herpetic whitlow. However, I would lean towards the differential of dishydrotic dermatitis more. This may start as clear vesicles covered with thick membrane that does not readily pop. The itch scratch cycle may ensue leading to an eczematous skin condition. For dermatitis, there is no definite form of therapy. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment as these may control the symptoms.Have you applied any medications on the area?Do you have any other associated disease conditions eg diabetes?",

    "question": "I looked at the forum and could not find any answers.\u00a0\u00a0My hands do not itch all the time, just sometimes. It is not limited to the palms of my hands, but that is where the itching is worse.\u00a0\u00a0I also sometimes get small (tiny) like blisters that are filled with liquid - these are usually between my fingers.\u00a0\u00a0I try not to itch them as they seem to spread.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any specific cause or could there be a number of reasons?\u00a0\u00a0Would a specific kind of lotion help?Also I am starting to get numerous age spots ( a lot that are raised).\u00a0\u00a0The majority of these are on my legs. The raised ones usually itch from time to time, and I have a tendency to dig at them. Should I see a dermatologist for this problem or is it just a natural part of aging?\u00a0\u00a0I am 60 years old.Thank you so much.",
