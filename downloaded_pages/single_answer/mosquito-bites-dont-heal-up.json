    "question": "HII have got some mosquito bites which I scratched a while back now and because I did not apply cream to them and sctatched them they have still not healed. Some have just about healed now, ut I had to resist picking the scabs off them...if you pick the scabs, a hole appears again and you have to wait for it to close again....what I can see inhibiting them is that there are red patches still around the bites, even now about 4 months later. When I get new bites now, I apply a cream which makes the redness go down and the bite becomes miniscule and then disappears but the old ones dont react to this cream... can anyone help me clear up my old mosquito bites.",
