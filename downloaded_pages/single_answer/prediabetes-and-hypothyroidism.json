    "question": "I was just told by my doctor that I have pre diabetes and that I need to cut sugar out of my diet.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a big person only 115 pounds and I have always been athletic so I wondered how this could have happened.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor told me it was genetic.\u00a0\u00a0Since I have cut sugar out of my diet I have had swelling in the bottom of my feet.\u00a0\u00a0The swelling originally started when I began taking the birth control pill ellesse years earlier.\u00a0\u00a0I would get sick with a flu or cold every time I had the swelling and it always seemed the swelling started after eating something red.\u00a0\u00a0For ex after having tylenol with red coating or red jams etc.\u00a0\u00a0It was almost like an alergic reaction.\u00a0\u00a0The most recent swelling I had just the other day was because I had ketchup on my burgers.\u00a0\u00a0I did put a lot of ketchup on my burger and i dont know if the swelling was a result of the sugar or if it could be something else like hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I was also drinking a lot of water that day.\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother had to take tyroid medication and my mother was told her thyroid was swollen but the doctor didnt do anything for her.\u00a0\u00a0Its frustrating not knowing what is a result of the prediabetes and what could possibly be something else.\u00a0\u00a0One doctor said that my thyroid levels were fine but is it possible that i have flucuations?\u00a0\u00a0I believe my thyroid level was 5.1.\u00a0\u00a0Is that in the normal range?\u00a0\u00a0I was also having some muscle pains a while back as well as in the neck and shoulder blade.\u00a0\u00a0I also had sleered speach in the summer when my neck muscle was inflamed.\u00a0\u00a0This however could have been a result of prediabetes I think?",
