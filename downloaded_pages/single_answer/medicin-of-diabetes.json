            "answer": "The drug name Tribate appears to be country specific to India. However, Pioglitazone is sold elsewhere under the name Actos. Actos falls into the anti-diabetic medication class of Thiazolidinediones. France and Germany have suspended the sale of Actos after a study suggested the drug could raise the risk of bladder cancer. Also, read the thread directly below \"safe drugs By bill1952852\" for additional comments.It is not appropriate for anyone on the internet to make medical drug recommendations - usage, dosage, changes. Without knowledge of your medical history or records only an appropriate health care provider should do so. As such, you can read about the three different oral diabetes medication classifications and drugs that fall into each class here then discuss them with your provider.http://tinyurl.com/type2-diabetes-drug-classesBe sure to search each drug using key words \"side effects\" [no \" \"]Do you have an Endocrinologist in your area? If yes, go see one. If not, go find another doctor who is up-to-date on diabetes treatment and medications. Good luck -",
