            "answer": "Hi,What you have described does not sound like diabetes in regard to symtoms but likely related to anxiety or possibly something neurological. Your blood sugars seem high though, if I understood your readings correctly. I encourage you to seek a doctor's opinion regarding formal testing for diabetes, and more importantly regarding all of your symptoms. It sounds like this is really affecting your life, so it is best you look into it soon.Take care.",
