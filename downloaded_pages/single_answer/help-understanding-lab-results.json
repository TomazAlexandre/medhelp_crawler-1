            "answer": "Hi,How are you? The eGFR test is used to screen and detect early kidney damage and to monitor kidney status. It is performed by ordering a creatinine test and calculating the eGFR.. A GFR of ninety or more is a sign of normalcy and a\u00a0\u00a0eGFR below 60 ml/min suggests that some kidney damage has occurred. he test results from an eGFR test can be a bit complicated to understand and warrants evaluation by your attending physician. Factors such as symptoms, medical history ( presence of diabetes, hypertension, etc) and results of other diagnostic tests are important considerations. Hope this helps, Take care and do keep us posted.",
