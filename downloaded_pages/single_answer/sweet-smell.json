    "question": "My 22m/o D has a very sweet sweat smell, especially in the AM.\u00a0\u00a0It can be quite strong, a sickly sweet smell, sometimes can be smelled throughout her room.\u00a0\u00a0I called the peds, went this AM and she had a non-fasting blood of 75, and nothing in urine.\u00a0\u00a0Is this signs of hypo, or diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0We are going back for a fasting reading, and this smell issue has been happening for quite some time. Thanks!",
