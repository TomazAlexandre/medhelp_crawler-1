            "answer": "How are you? How is your mom? Would you know her glomerular filtration rate? CKD may be the result of physical injury or a disease that damages the kidneys, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. It is important to check on her heart and liver\u00a0\u00a0because people with CKD suffer from accelerated atherosclerosis and are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease.CKD is a gradual and usually permanent loss of kidney function over time.\u00a0\u00a0It is divided into five stages of increasing severity. Stage 5 chronic kidney failure is also referred to as end-stage renal disease, wherein there is total or near-total loss of kidney function and patients need dialysis or transplantation to stay alive. The GRF at this point is usually less than 15.\u00a0\u00a0If this happens, waste builds up in your body and can cause vomiting, weakness, confusion and coma.The goal of therapy is to slow down or halt the otherwise relentless progression of CKD to stage 5. Control of blood pressure and treatment of the original disease, whenever feasible, are the broad principles of management.Kidneys with CKD are usually smaller than normal kidneys with notable exceptions such as in diabetic nephropathy and polycystic kidney disease.

    "question": "Hi there. My mom was diagnosed with CKD. A few weeks after she experienced enlargement of her abdomen. Our doctor suggests that she undergo several other test to check onher heart and liver. The doctor\u00a0\u00a0also suggests that my mom undergo dialysis asap. Prior to this, we consulted several other doctors but they've had different opinions. Is CKD with bloated abdomen, difficulty in bowel movement and urinating a very severe case that dialysis is the only way to go? Is there an alternative to this?",
