            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Elevated serum creatinine values are an indication of kidney disease. Also, as there is microalbuminuria, it could be due to diabetic nephropathy. Are you a diabetic? Diabetes can affect the kidneys and cause nephropathy. The earliest indication of this is microalbuminuria. The hyperglycemia produces\u00a0\u00a0increased matrix production and\u00a0\u00a0thickening of the of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). This causes the nephropathy.Since there is evidence of nephropathy you will need a more frequent follow up care to prevent further kidney damage. Take Care.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
