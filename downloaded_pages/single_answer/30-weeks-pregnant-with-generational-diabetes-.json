    "question": "Hello ladies,Anyone dealing with gestational diabetes? I am 30 weeks tomorrow and been diagnosed with GDM, my fasting levels were ok but both the 1 hour and 2 hour levels were a little high. I am on a low carb, high protein diet and some walking each day. I have to monitor my levels 2 hours post each meal and must get a reading under 120. Been managing so far, but had 2 high readings in 4 days (12 readings). Wanted to know are others in the same boat? What advice has your doc given u?\u00a0\u00a0I have gained 7 kilos so far, so no massive weight gain.",
