            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The condition you are referring to is called ptosis (drooping) of the eyelid. The muscle supplying the eyelid becomes weak or there is a defect with the nerve supply, hence the eyelid droops. The nerve pathways can be affected\u00a0\u00a0with infections, certain medications, and injuries. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, certain diseases affecting the muscles and tumors. Myasthenia gravis, is a neuromuscular disease which symptoms include eye weakness, facial expression weakness, and difficulty swallowing. This can cause bilateral ptosis. This drooping can cause defective vision and sometimes increased tearing. Treatment is basically the underlying cause and corrective surgery for the ptosis is another option. Please discuss these options with your doctor, who may then refer you to an ophthalmologist.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
