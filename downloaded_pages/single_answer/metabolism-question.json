            "answer": "The most important hormones of the stress system are adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenal glands (located one on top of each kidney) secrete the hormone adrenaline into the bloodstream.

For example, it increases the heart and breathing rates, elevates blood pressure and raises metabolic rate.",

    "question": "Hey guys,I'm a 32-year old male.\u00a0\u00a0I recently posted about some unexplained weight loss that I was having in conjunction with my with my anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0After going through a litany of tests with my GP, including thyroid, B12, diabetes, CBC, and others, and everything came back fine.\u00a0\u00a0He said the next step was evaluating my metabolism.\u00a0\u00a0I just went to a nutritionist yesterday, and they measured my RMR (resting metabolic rate), and found that it was 1860, when my normal RMR for my size and age should be around 1400-1500 or so.\u00a0\u00a0My question is - can anxiety release hormones that can alter my metabolic rate?\u00a0\u00a0My metabolism has never worked this fast before, as I can tell from the amount of food I'm eating that I should be putting on weight.\u00a0\u00a0I've gone 32.5 years with my body working a certain way, and now it seems to be in overdrive, and needless to say, it's making me fear the worst.Is it possible to get a metabolic spike from anxiety?",
