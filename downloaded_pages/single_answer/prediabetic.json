            "answer": "Who is your endocrinologist? Yes, there are wonderful studies that we do at Vanderbilt and there are many many other sites that are also part of this consortium called Trialnet, your hospital does not need to be part of trialnet for you to enroll your child. Firstly, ask your peds endo for your son to call a trialnet institution, they can send tube for blood samples and they can screen her to see if she is indeed a candidate and if so she can travel to the closest facility that has the study that she qualifies for.\u00a0\u00a0I am positive about the oral insulin study, it has just begun, I totally understand your stress, we have 2000 kids with diabetes in our practice.Get with a trialnet location, get your peds endo to call one or call 1 - 800 - HALT - DM1 (1-800-425-8361)",

    "question": "I have a type 1 son (diag. 10/07) and now it seems a prediab. daughter of 11.\u00a0\u00a0Her ICA screen: +, titer: 320, GAD 65AB:5.7,C-Pep.: 1.9, A1c 5.9.\u00a0\u00a0Fasting glucose has read between 109-123.\u00a0\u00a0These tests were run as a result of her testing herself on a whim (after 2 tacos, french fries,shake meal) & got a reading of 334! Her ped. & sons Endo see this as a wait & see situation.\u00a0\u00a0She is currently non symtomatic. We continued testing her for a bit after and she did tend to run high after regular meals (waffles, syrup, milk= 252\u00a0\u00a0or dinner chicken potato, salad =107) Suggestions were to discontinue checking, (we were going to drive our daughter and ourselves crazy),to take Soda out of her diet and try to keep her eating healthy,\u00a0\u00a0What I dont get is- it was my understanding\u00a0\u00a0one either has diab. or not.\u00a0\u00a0Eating high in surgar or carbs will not make one diabetic. How will curbing her diet keep her from becoming full on diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0I am DESPERATE to get her in some form of trial to head off any progression that seems to be imminent. CHLA has an oral insulin study but that seems to have shown not to work (per son's endo.), do you know of any other?\u00a0\u00a0What can I do- I am spinning my wheels and falling apart trying to keep this disease from taking another one of my children.\u00a0\u00a0Her Ped. said she was a person who tended to run high herself and was taking \"glucosage\" .\u00a0\u00a0What do you suggest I do at this point.",
