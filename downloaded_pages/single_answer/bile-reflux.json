    "question": "My father is 67 and has had heart disease and type II diabetes for over 20 years. For the last 6 months he's been troubled by bad abdominal pains. They started mostly on the right side, and radiated to his back and were worst at night. Over the last 5 months, he's had a colonoscopy, endoscopy, abdominal CT scan, lung x-ray (months earlier for a lingering cough), and various blood work including tests specifically looking at his pancreas. Most tests were negative: the endoscopy (in 12/09) uncovered \"mild gastritis\"and the CT scan revealed fatty deposits on his pancreas. They asked if he was a heavy drinker and in fact he is the opposite.\u00a0\u00a0He underwent a HIDA scan which revealed that his gallbladder was only constricting at about 30% so it was removed. Prior to this surgery he also had an ultrasound of the gallbladder to view the ducts. The surgeon noted during the cholecystectomy that the gallbladder was diseased and had adhesions. He said he saw \"nothing else\" concerning during the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Since the surgery my father still has bad stomach pain and also developed a bad taste in his mouth. The back and right side pain has gotten better - he thinks - but still he has almost constant stomach pain and no appetite - he has lots far too much weight. His gastro diagnosed him with bile reflux and put him on sucralfate. It's been about 2 weeks now and he's had a couple of good days since then but still has the pain most of the time and no appetite. He's not complaining of the bad taste any longer, though.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like bile reflux - do we just need to give the sucralfate more time or should it be working by now?Another note, my mother is concerned b/c he is on so many medications - for his heart, blood pressure, diabetes, choelsterol, blood thinners, etc. Could it be related to his pain?Any thoughts or leads are appreciated. I am truly hoping we have ruled out anything ominous with all the testing he's had done but am still very concerned.",
