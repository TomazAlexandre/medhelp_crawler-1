    "question": "My mom has been feeling this tingling sensation in the back of her head for almost four months now.\u00a0\u00a0It all started when she got a new prescription for her glasses from Taiwan, and it caused her left eye to be irritated.\u00a0\u00a0She later went to another optometrist and got the correct prescription.\u00a0\u00a0However, it did not elevate the problem.\u00a0\u00a0She still feels uncomfortable with her left eye and the same tingling sensation in the back of her head.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She claims that she can feel her eyelid was pressuring her eye while she was sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0Her family doctor has prescribed some migraine medicine for her to intake but it does not seem to help the condition.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a sign of migraine?",
