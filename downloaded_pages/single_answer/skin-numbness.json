            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not provide you a diagnosis for your symptoms. however I will try to provide you with information regarding some possibilities.The symptoms you describe in your arm of sharp pains followed by loss of sensation may be the result of a peripheral neuropathy. There are peripheral nerves which form from larger nerves that exit the spine and divide. These nerves provide innervation (electricity) to the muscles or skin or both. Sometimes, irritation or damage to one of these nerves can produce symptoms similar to yours. A peripheral neuropathy can be motor (affecting only nerves to muscles), sensory (affecting only nerves that supply sensation) or both. In your case, it may be a sensory neuropathy. The causes of neuropathy are multiple. It could be trauma, from for example a prior fracture or repetitive trauma in for example athletes. It could also be the result of prior surgery. Some neuropathies can be compression neuropathies, from pressure damage. In other cases neuropathy can be due to a generalized illness such as diabetes, lupus, etc. Vitamin deficiencies and certain types of protein abnormalities and cancer can also cause these symptoms. I am not at all suggesting I think you have cancer or any of these other problems; your symptoms in your arm need to be taken in the context of other symptoms you have and your general medical condition and age. Another possibility is that you have a radiculopathy, or a problem with the nerve as it exits the spine. This could be due to what is often referrred to as a slipped disc, or it could be due arthritis of the spine. However, it sounds like the area of sensory loss is small and it sounds like you dont have other symptoms such as weakness, so this makes it less liklely.Your leg symptoms are likely caused by a similar process (neuropathy or radiculopathy). In people who have undergone certain surgeries or who are overweight, a neuropathy of one particular nerve often occurs and causes sensory loss on the thigh, this is called meralgia parasthetica.You may benefit from evaluation by a neurologist. he/she can examine you and determine whether or not you might have a neuropathy or another neurologic problem. Certain tests can be done to further assess this, including a study abbreviated EMG/NCS which tests the conduction of electricity along nerves and how muscles respond.Thank you for using the forum,\u00a0\u00a0I hope you find this information useful, good luck.",
