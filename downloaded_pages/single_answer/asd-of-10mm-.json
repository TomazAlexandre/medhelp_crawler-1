            "answer": "Hi, as the ASD has been asymptomatic, its unlikely it will cause problems now. Follow up with your doctor for monitoring and blood pressure medications are modified based on your present pressures. Diabetes Mellitus is a lifelong metabolic disorder. Successful therapy requires lifelong commitment. It involves monitoring blood sugar levels, leading a healthy lifestyle and working towards preventing any serious complications that may be caused by diabetes. But don't worry though it is a lifelong disorder, it can be adequately controlled. So, keep monitoring your blood pressure and blood sugar values and follow up with your doctor. Regards.",
