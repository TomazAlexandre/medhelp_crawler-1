            "answer": "if he stopped all of his immunosuppressive medications people can develop rapidly progressive rejection.\u00a0\u00a0Patients rarely if ever lose their liver due to recurrent PBC so i do not know why he has a lot of scarring in the liver--maybe its related to a bile duct problem which the transplant team should search for and if found and treated, it could improve things.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is extremely common after a transplant--I would strongly plea that he not give up and speak to members of the transplant team.\u00a0\u00a0I think everything that is bothering your husband is potentially fixable.",

    "question": "My questions is related to my husband. He was diagnosed with stage 4 PBC in 2006 and had a live donor liver transplant in 2008. Since then he has had nothing but struggles and difficulties with complications. He has developed Type 1 diabetes due to the immunosuppressant medications and in 2010 was re-diagnosed with PBC again. His most recent biopsy has placed him at early stage 3 with some signs of cirrhosis.He has just recently decided that he has had enough and can fight no longer. He has stopped taking all of his medications including Urso to help prevent to progress of the reoccurring PBC. I am just curious if you have any idea as to a possible time frame that he has left with us.Thank you",
