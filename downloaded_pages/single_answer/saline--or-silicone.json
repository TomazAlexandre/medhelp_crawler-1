            "answer": "Saline implants do not slosh. Right after surgery, all pockets the implants are in have water and air, and you can hear sloshing as far out as\u00a0\u00a0a month. To evaluate a silicone for rupture, an MRI is recommended-2500 dollars. The silicone implant is around twice the cost of the saline. There is no difference in appearance in the two implants. The incision is bigger for silicone implants. It costs twice as much to remove a broken silicone implant, and they all break. The one advantage of a silicone is that in many instances they feel more like a breast in very thin patients than saline implants do. I hope this all helps.arch s miller ms md facs",

    "question": "Hi Doctor A:There are so many pos and con regarding implants saline or silicone??? I have read and heard so many different story about both. The fact that you work with both what do you think? I am concern due to the fact that I also have diabetes and so do not want to add any more problems to my life. I thought saline would be best for me due to the fact that if there was a rupture that my body would just absolve it. But I hear some person say that you can hear the water rolling around in you chest, that does not sound good. And then I heard that the silicone if it ruptures can cause some very bad health conditions, I don't need any more. Please give me your personal and professional thoughts on this matter.Thank you once again for your honesty,Stepaheda",
