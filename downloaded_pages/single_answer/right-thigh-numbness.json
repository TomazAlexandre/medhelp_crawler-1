            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms are suggestive of neuropathy due to compression or entrapment of a nerve.It can be due to injury to the back or spinal cord or spinal herniation or prolapse.Nerve studies and nerve conduction tests are required to confirm it.Other possibilities are diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause numbness in the knee and legs.You can take multivitamins for some time. Also get your blood sugar tested.If the symptoms persist,then pls get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how your husband is doing or if you have any additional queries.",
