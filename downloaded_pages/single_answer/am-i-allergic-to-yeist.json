            "answer": "Hi,First off the steroid inhaler can cause oral thrush which in itself can be difficult to control. After using the inhaler, use a mouth wash to rinse your mouth. The other would be to ask your doctor about a different inhaler. I went from Simbicord to Salbutamol. I have had no problems with it. I just recently was on a course of Cipro antibiotics for an intestinal infection, so I most likely will come down with yeast again. After the use of antibiotics, I make sure that I eat yoghurt.At times I have had yeast after the use of antibiotics badly enough, that I had yeast infections in the intestinal tract mouth and on the penis. The rash on the penis involved small red pimple like rash, patches of yeast on the glans and foreskin. At this time it was extremely difficult to get rid of the yeast. I usually got oral treatment for thrush and the intestinal yeast. For my penis I used either Canesten or Monistat. I had to make sure that I retracted the foreskin as far as I could and cover the entire surface of the penis. Once that was done I'd replace the foreskin and cover the entire outter surface of the penis and scrotum. It would take several months before this completely cleared up.Due to a neurogenic bladder I'm prone to kidney and bladder infections and use Cipro quite often, which results in yeast. In order for me to get multiple yeast infections like mouth, gut and penis at the same time, I usually got ver ill and was hospitalized for several days.I also at times have come down with yeast after intercourse with my wife. Due to diabetes she is prone to yeast as well. So you would want to get checked to rule out diabetes.Those with HIV infections are also prone to yeast infections. It would be to your best interest to have a full medical and get this investigated to rule out any more serious conditions.From all the yeast infections I found those of the penis and gut the worst. There was a lot of burning and itching involved. It is very embarrising and difficult to scratch these areas in order for some temporary relief.For yeast of the penis, use loose fitting cotton underwear. I at times have even skipped the underwear all together. Yeast thrives in warm most places. Retracting the foreskin when urinating and drying the glans and foreskin can make a difference. The antifungal creams should take care of the itching in a few days. Just because it no longer itches and the rash is getting better does not mean that the infection has cleared.All the best.Ron",
