            "answer": "Hi there. Your mother sustained a stroke following which she had ptosis in her right eyelid. Is her diabetes under check and does she have concomitant hypertension? Ptosis is transient and common in patients with large, hemispheric strokes. Ptosis can occur with either right or left sided infarction, but is more complete with right sided infarcts. Care of the eye includes adequate taping and lubricant eye gel to sooth it and keeping it hydrated. This also protects the cornea etc from any injury. The other morbidities need to be checked and kept under control like diabetes and if present, hypertension. Let an ophthalmologist examine her both eyes including retina and posterior chamber to rule out any vitreal hemorrhage or retinal detachment.",
