            "answer": "Hi,Bacteria are subjectively quantified in urine and may be observed as few, moderate and many. These may be insignificant contaminants such as\u00a0\u00a0small amorphous crystals, cellular debris, and small fat droplets. Or it may be associated with pathogens. Factors such as presence of other symptoms, the method of urine collection, the number and types of bacteria, the presence of leukocytes in urine, the length of urine storage, the container, and any underlying disease are important considerations in evaluation of the urine result.\u00a0\u00a0Presence of pyuria\u00a0\u00a0or white blood cells usually signifies urinary tract infection (UTI).\u00a0\u00a0The risk factors for\u00a0\u00a0UTI\u00a0\u00a0include predisposition for bladder infections\u00a0\u00a0in families; presence of diabetes, being uncircumcised,\u00a0\u00a0catheter use, decreased fluid intake, holding the urine for too long, or having a large prostate\u00a0\u00a0and not necessarily through public toilet or toilet water. Hope this helps. Take care and do keep us posted.",
