            "answer": "Have you ever had any procedures like hernia repair or scopeing of any sort in that area that would cause you to have a infection inside? The reason i ask is my husband had hernia surgery a few months back, and about a month or so later he was having terrible pain in his scrotum( hope i spelled that right) area. He could not sleep or even walk it was so painful. It hurt him to even touch it. He went to the doc and the doc said he had an infection and gave him a antibiotic and pain pills and within a few days the pain was gone. Sofar ( knock on wood) he has not had trouble since. Check to see if maybe you have a urine infection or some other sort of infection inside the vasdeferens ( to lazy to look it up how to correctly spell it) lol. Just sound it out. I wish you luck in helping find your pain.",

    "question": "I'm a 27 year old male, 5'8\" and 168 lbs. I first experienced a swollen left ankle in Sept/05. After an ultrasound, the DR. could not diagnose the problem (it was not a sprain and gout was ruled out) My ankle remained swollen and very painful to the touch for approx 8 mths (with little residual pain and swelling). The pain and swelling eventually moved up to my left knee leaving me with unexplained pain and swelling in my left ankle and left knee respectively. At this time I received an MRI of both areas, a CT scan, blood tests, ultrasounds and x-rays all showing up negative. It's also worth noting that my lower back and neck became very stiff and painful. I finally received a knee scope in July 2006, which came back negtive. However, once the knee scope was complete everything began feeling better (I didn't take any post surgery meds and followed up by physio). Once everything healed, I was feeling 100% until Feb 2007 where I began feeling intermittent pain in my neck, lower back, both groin areas, left knee and the side of both feet. This time I had to be admitted to emergency as the pain in my groin area was so excrutiating that it felt as though my leg was tearing away from my hip. Various pain would come and go within two or three week periods. I will fine for a week or so and the pain would come back at a different spot. Since April. I was 100% again where in July I began experiencing major neck pain where it hurt to swallow and open my mouth. My lower back is very painful and my groin area has once again flared up. The pain in my groin is so deep that I cannot feel for it with my hand.\u00a0\u00a0I have been labelled as a medical mystery by my doctors. Anti-inflammatory medications seldom help, pain killers are useless. I simply have to fight the pain until I it's gone. I am otherwise a healthy active person. I don't have diabetes, nor high blood pressure, etc. Can you please help me!! I have a very high tolerance to pain but this is driving my insane.Thanks,Dave",
