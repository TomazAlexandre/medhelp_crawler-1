            "answer": "Hello,The normal ranges for AST and ALT are around 0 to 40 IU/L and 0 to 45 IU/L respectively. So definitely, your enzymes are a lot elevated.Elevated liver enzymes are found in hepatitis, fatty liver, alcoholic liver disease,obesity, diabetes(uncontrolled),mononucleosis, autoimmune hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, gallstones, tumors of liver, pancreas and bile ducts and side effects of medicines like certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cholesterol medications, antibiotics or anti-seizure medications. Drugs like Enbrel may also cause liver enzymes and hence need to be looked into.I feel that you should consult a physician soon and get these possibilities ruled out. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
