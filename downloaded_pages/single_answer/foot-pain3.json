    "question": "im not really sure what is wrong with both of my feet. but lately they have hurt so much, that i cant stand for a long period of time. now i do believe its my work boots causing it. but something that has been constant for well over a year is around the ankle bone, there is pain, and it also feels like something is gonna pop, or needs to pop for that matter but cant. almost like something is caught on something else. it has been driving me nuts. about 8 months ago i had tingles in both of my feet for a while, it went away, but the doctors never found out what it was. im starting to think that it is related. they were having me tested for vitamin b deficiency, and diabetes, and stuff like that. but everything came back negative.one other thing that happens with my feet, sporadically, is sometimes when i walk, the bottom of my feet will feel like they are tearing open. almost like a razorblade is cutting them between the toes and the heels. this happens in both as well, but not at the same time, it is very random with the tearing feeling. thank you for reading, and i would like to hear anything that someone has to say on this",
