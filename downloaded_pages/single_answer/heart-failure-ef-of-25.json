            "answer": "Without being able to review the entire history of your father, it will not be possible to give you an exact answer, but the most likely cause for his CHF (congestive heart failure) is the renal failure (kidney problem) that produces fluid retention, and probably because of an obstruction of the heart's arteries (ischemic disease) that is common in diabetic patients, especially if they smoke. You did not mention if he had high blood pressure or not, but that could also be part of the problem.The fact that he lost his appetite is a concerning point, as it suggests that the amount of blood that the heart is pumping is low and just eating can produce shortness of breath; or that the right side of the heart is also not pumping well so the blood is not draining well from the liver generating congestion and lack of appetite.He should see a cardiologist as soon as possible as the specialist will define what type of studies need to be done to find the exact cause of the heart failure, and to try to prevent the progression of the kidney dysfunction.Good luck.",
