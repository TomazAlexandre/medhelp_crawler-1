            "answer": "Hi,How are you? What other symptoms are present? Post primary pulmonary tuberculosis usually develops in 5%\u201320% of patients infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This form is usually found in adults and arises from the reactivation of bacilli that lay dormant within a fibrotic area of the lung. Several factors such as immunosuppression, diabetes, malnutrition and alcoholism may be responsible. This condition may be seen as focal or patchy parenchymal opacities in the upper and lower lobes of the lung. Additional diagnostic tests such as CT scan may also be done. It is best that you discuss the result with your attending physcian for proper evaluation. A referral to a pulmonologist may also be done. Take care and do keep us posted.",
