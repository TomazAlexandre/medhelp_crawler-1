            "answer": "Hello,Such tingling sensation can be due to anxiety, contact dermatitis, traumatic damage to the nerves of penis, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis and STD\u2019s like Gonorrhea and Syphilis.I would suggest you to keep the area clean and wear cotton underwears. Also If the symptoms persist then the above said conditions have to be ruled out. Please consult a urologist in that case.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I have had a heavy tingling sensation in my urethra for about 5 days now. It is not there all the time, mainly from mid moring on and off until the evening, it does not effect me at night. I am going to the loo more often but it does not sting when i do so.Would Urethritis give this sensation and would it come and go like this, or be constant?I was tested for STD's 4 weeks ago and all was clear and have had no exposure since.",
