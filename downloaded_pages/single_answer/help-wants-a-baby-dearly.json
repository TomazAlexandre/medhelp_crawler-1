            "answer": "Your doctors are right to try to encourage you to lose weight. Weight loss can help you have your periods more regularly. However weight loss may not be enough. Your doctors can also check your hormones and perform an ultrasound of your ovaries to determine if you have polycystic ovarian syndrome or other possible disorders causing you not to have your menses.Here is some general information on PCOS from my website:PCOS can affect 5% of all women and common symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, increased growth of hair on the body, loss of hair on the head, acne, and weight gain. Based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM sponsored Consensus Workshop Group, PCOS is diagnosed in women who meet two of the three following criteria: ovarian dysfunction (not ovulating regularly), hyperandrogenism (increased male type hormones on lab testing or clinically increased hair growth), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries which show multiple small cysts on ultrasound). PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose tolerance test.These kind of services are provided by a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist who can do the workup for infrequent periods and then provide you with the proper treatment to help you get pregnant.",
