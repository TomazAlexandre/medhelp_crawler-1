            "answer": "Dear DesparateMom939,It is my experience PA State offers \u201cgeneral case management\u201d and \u201cbeneficiary assistance activities and specialized DM activities\u201d through Access Plus. These services are offered through DM & PCCM by mostly nurses but sometimes clinicians also who are specially trained and certified in particular areas (i.e. asthma, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure).The DM specialists will work with targeted clients mainly through telephonic contacts, but there will be some face-to-face contact with beneficiaries who have special needs. I recommend reaching out to the DM or case manager in charge of her case. Her PCP can also help you determine the right course of action.Sincerely,Amir Mostafaie",
