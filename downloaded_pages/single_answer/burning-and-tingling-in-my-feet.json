    "question": "I had open heart surgery on 1/29/09 and had a aeortic valve replacement with a mechanical valve. After surgery I have been taking 2 mg of warfarin for 6 days and 3 mg of warfarin on Friday. I also take 25 mg of Toprol XL every day. I was diagnosed in 04 with diabetes but it was not severe enough to take any medication or anything for it. My blood sugar readings always are between 80 and 120.In July I had to go into our warehouse and help do inventory for 2 weeks of being on my feet for 10 to 12 hours daily. At the end of that the balls of my feet were burning and tingling. It went away for approx. 2 weeks, but has returned and has been constant since then. I am going to a neurogolist this week and my family doctor said he can feel a good pulse in my feet. My question is: Could Toprol be the problem? This has been devastating. Constant coming and going of pain and discomfort. Thanks for your help.",
