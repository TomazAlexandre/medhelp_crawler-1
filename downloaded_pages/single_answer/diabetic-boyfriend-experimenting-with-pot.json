    "question": "Hi again, I just posted about my boyfriend who has type 1 diabetes. He is 18, going to college at the end of the summer, and has recently started experimenting with weed. I am already opposed to the idea of him smoking weed, but I am, first and foremost, worried about whether it poses any health risk to him, because of his diabetes. I know there is information about alcohol and smoking cigarettes combined with diabetes, but I just can't seem to find any info on weed and diabetes. If anyone knows anything about this, I would be happy to listen. Thanks.",
