            "answer": "I don't know if you can be tested right now unless you're part of the research. I have not heard about this before. I know they have a research going on for type 1 diabetes where when babies are born with certain red flags, they put them in this study. They are tested regularly for things (like once a month) for so many years after birth. Then they are left alone to see if they develope type 1 or not. They're hoping to pick out the genetic markers in this way.I'm assuming the same would true for bipolar genetics. But I don't know where to have it done.",

    "question": "I'm reading a book right now on Bipolar Disorder and the author is making mention of various genetic markers that can indicate a predisposition for BPD.\u00a0\u00a0My question,,has anyone here ever been tested for any of these markers?\u00a0\u00a0The way it sounds, if you don't have these markers, you basically won't have BPD.If you can be tested for these and this is true, I would like to be tested just to cement the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I'm still in denial a little bit,,,Rodger",
