            "answer": "I am 21 yrs of age, and I have been recently having numbness and tingling and well as pain in my arms and legs, not to mention my entire body. I am going to see the doctor re: possible fibro. Anyways, I have a deformation of my spine and on an x-ray it actually looks like I have missing vertebrae. I am not sure if this condition is causing the pain or not, but there is no need to be scared of a spinal tap.My MRI showed spots and they were fluid and pinched nerves.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diagnosed with RSD and I was going to have a spinal tap done, but I decided not to. The doctors are most likely doing this tap to check and see which nerves are causing pain. The tap does hurt, but its benefits are great. They can even deaden the nerve that is causing pain. The abnormal spots could be fluids caused from spinal injury or deformity. Hope I eased your mind a little.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed when I was in my mid 20s with fibromyalgia. In the 90s, I was in my mid 30s I had to drop out of my nursing program due to sickness. I went into Rheumatoid arthritis. My Rheumatoidologist put me on Relafin, (if that is how it is spelled), seemed to help with the symtoms immediately. I went to work and kept getting sick at the hospital where I worked as a lead pharmacy technician. I was diagnosed with diabetes and I also had shingles in my 20s. I had to go out of work on disability because I just seemed to catch everything. I would swell up with certain foods, I had IBS which was so bad at times, I couldn't get off the bed. For the last several years I have been having these spells of dizziness and then needles going up and down my arms and chest. My father fell in May and I was trying to help get him up. I couldn't walk till I went to the chiropractor. He did a x-ray. A spot showed up in the first three vertebre and he sent me to a neurologist. He did a brain MRI. When I went back he ordered a brain MRI with contrast. They called me last week and said several abnormal spots showed up on my brain. He is doing a spinal tap, which I am terrified of on Thursday. What will this spinal tap be able to diagnose as to my problems? My left ring finger and pinky are numb and the left side of my chest also. Im just scared at this point.",
