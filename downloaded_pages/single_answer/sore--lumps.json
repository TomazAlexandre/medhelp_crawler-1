            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are two possibilities. One is that the infection caused regional lymph nodes to swell. The other is that abscess or localized collection of pus has come up. The reason this is not healing could be due to the fact that you have diabetes or concomitant fungal or bacterial infection. Please consult a doctor as this has probably gone beyond the stage where you could treat at home. You may need local and oral antibacterials and anti inflammatory drugs. Also if there is an abscess, it will need to be drained.Hope this helps. Take care!",
