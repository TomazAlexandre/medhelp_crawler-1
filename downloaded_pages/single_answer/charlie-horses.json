            "answer": "Hello,Few causes for your symptoms would include dehydration, micronutrient deficiency, stress, hormonal/ endocrine disturbances etc. I would suggest consulting your primary care physician if you could try some mild anti-spasmodic medication and see if these seem to help. Other things that may be helpful are regular exercise (with warm up and cool down sessions), weight loss if overweight, intake of a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
