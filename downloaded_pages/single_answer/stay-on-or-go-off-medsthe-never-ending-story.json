            "answer": "Let's start right here. \"Weed\" is not a medication. If you stopped using that it would help you have more feelings of normality. That most certainly is making things worse. As for the rest some of the medications if you went off right away it could be dangerous (Klonopin, Xanax) and you build up a physical tolerance to them. And all of them if you went off them would return you to the way you were before. I know what its like to go off medication. I did it 15 years ago. I started to feel \"really good\" but it was hypomanic, then full blown manic, then psychotic. Then I ended up in the psychiatric hospital. Not the right way to go. But your provider could change some of your medications and titrate you off others. Just don't change anything on your own, except for going to a recovery group if you can't stop smoking marijuana on your own (note, that I'm not part of the anti-drug crowd, I know some people do that but it will worsen symptoms of bipolar regardless).\u00a0\u00a0As for the rest. Lamictal is a tolerable mood stabilizer. Cymabalta is an SSRI, anti-depressent to augment it because you might have still had a problem with depression. Klonopin and Xanax are both anti-anxiety medications or they are being used as side effect pills for the Risperdal, an anti-psychotic or both. But since they both do the same function, perhaps your provider could titreate you off one, perhaps the Xanax since it has more of a potential for addiction than the Klonopin. Dexedrine is a stimluant. I'm not sure what you are on that for. ADHD? Perhaps you could tell me. Risperdal as all antipsychotics can cause cognitive side effects. Abilify is better in that regard. And do understand that there are anti-psychotics in development of a totally different nature that will not have any of these side effects such as cognitive blunting or long term effects such as tardive dyskinesia or diabetes and promote a fuller recovery. As I've put in my posts to inform people I'm on glycine a glutamate antagonist, a new class of antipsychotic in FDA study and have been identified as making a full recovery. So there is better treatment that won't make you feel this way. But in the meantime your current medications could be adjusted and changed by your provider under their direction. And certainly if you stopped smoking marijuana that would be a first step. Just don't confuse medication with recreational drugs. One has side effects, the other the \"high\" is the side effect and its not helping you. That would be the first step to take.",

    "question": "My dilemma: I feel good. At least right at this moment. I\u2019m on medication. Lamictal, Risperdal, Cymbalta, Dexedrine, Klonopin, Weed, Xanax.....I've been on it six years plus. I just spent a year trying to come off. I didn't work. So I'm back on. I feel normal. (bipolar/ADD normal) But it\u2019s completely inauthentic. These are not my real feelings. These are the drugs that are keeping me up and running. I don\u2019t think I can rely on a pill to motivate me to show up for life. It\u2019s not fair to the \u201creal\u201d me. who is probably so much more \u201cdeep\u201d and \u201crich\u201d than the medicated me. It\u2019s so tough because to feel good and purposely go for feeling bad\u2026.I have to make art out of it. That is the only way I can do this: come off my psych meds. Thoughts?",
