            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since the crawling feeling is in your legs only it can be restless leg syndrome, pinched lumbar spinal nerves, peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, Lyme\u2019s or hypothyroidism, or it can be fungal infection.If you are a female, and in the menopausal age, then this is a common symptom. Hormone replacement therapy often helps. It is also seen in people who are very anxious and stressed out. Take up yoga, deep breathing exercise, walking etc to relieve stress. Music and aerobics are also good stress busters. Drink plenty of fluids and water (not caffeine), eat fresh fruits and vegetables and keep yourself busy throughout the day.Very dry skin and disorders of thyroid gland all can precipitate a crawling sensation.The other possibility is Morgellons disease often mimics scabies. The disease is believed to be caused by weak immune systems in people that have contracted the tick-borne Lyme Disease at some point in their life. It can also be a fungal infection like Tinea corporis.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.",

    "question": "For almost a week now i have been having itchy, crawly feels at night when i try to go to sleep. It's only on my legs though. I have tried cleaning my whole room, including taking a part my bed and even taking the mattress outside to sit in the sun. (thinking it was dust mites). There's no bug bites or rash of any kind. I have never had this problem before. The itching lessened but the next day it was back and just as bad. So far the only thing that helps lessen the itching/crawling is by using lotion Could it be just dry skin? I normally don't have dry skin unless it's in the winter and here we are in the start of Aug. I have researched into Restless Leg Syndrome but I don't fit the Symptoms aside for the itching crawling.",
