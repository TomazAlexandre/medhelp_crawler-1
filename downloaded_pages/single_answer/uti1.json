            "answer": "How are you? Urinary tract infection occurs when tiny organisms, usually bacteria from the digestive tract, cling to the opening of the urethra and begin to multiply. An infection limited to the urethra is called urethritis. If bacteria move to the bladder and multiply, a bladder infection or cystitis occurs. If the infection is not treated promptly, bacteria may then travel further up the ureters to multiply and infect the kidneys which is called pyelonephritis.Some people are more prone to getting a UTI than others. Any abnormality of the urinary tract that obstructs the flow of urine or an enlarged prostate gland, presence of catheters, or tubes, placed in the urethra and bladder, people with diabetes have a higher risk of a UTI because of changes in the immune system. In adult women, the rate of UTIs gradually increases with age.\u00a0\u00a0One factor may be that a woman's urethra is short, allowing bacteria quick access to the bladder. Also, a woman's urethral opening is near sources of bacteria from the anus and vagina. For many women, sexual intercourse seems to trigger an infection,Less than 150 mg of protein is normally lost in the urine per day. A higher level of protein loss in the urine is called proteinuria and may mean there is kidney disease. When the kidneys are unable to absorb all of them, they spill over into the urine. Transient proteinuria is the most common cause of proteinuria and it is a temporary process that is thought to be caused by fever, heavy exercise, and other benign conditions. Once protein is found in the urine, it is often important to measure how much is protein is lost in a day by collecting urine for a 24-hour period.I hope this helps. Take care and keep us posted.",
