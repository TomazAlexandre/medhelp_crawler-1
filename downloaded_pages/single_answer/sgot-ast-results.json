            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is from 5 to 40 units per liter of serum. Elevated levels can occur with liver disease, but other causes for the enzyme elevation could be muscle disease or injury. Elevated TSH could indicate hypothyroidism. Also, marginally elevated Hb A1C occurs in diabetes mellitus, when the blood sugars are not adequately controlled. Clinical correlation is mandatory for therapy.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
