    "question": "I just went to my OB on Wednesday for my 32 week visit and she discovered that my sugar is very very high. I was tested for gestational diabetes when i was 18 weeks but everything came back ok....does anyone know why this could of happened all of a sudden?Is it caused from eating too much candy?Also, she is sending me for NST testing because i really only feel the baby move at night time, so i have to go for a weekly stress test. Does anyone else just feel the baby at night when they are resting?",
