    "question": "Hi, I am worried that I may be developing signs of type 1 diabetes.Just yesterday and today I have been drinking way more water than I usually need to drink (usually after I have something to eat I get like a constant thirst), last night I woke up with pains in my stomach and was very thirsty, today at times i notice that I am breathing heavier, I go through stages of extreme fatigue and I have noticed that I have lost a bit of weight.Over the past month or so I have felt as if I am constantly hungry and are forever snacking on food, but today I haven't felt that hungry at all.Also diabetes runs in my family.But the thing I am most worried about is that my final exams for my last year of high school start in just a week and I am worried that if I go and see a doctor and get diagnosed with diabetes I might need to go to hospitaland therefore won't have time to study!If i do have diabetes, how quickly will it be before the symptoms get worse, and what will be likely to happen if i hold off seeing\u00a0\u00a0a doctor for a few weeks??",
