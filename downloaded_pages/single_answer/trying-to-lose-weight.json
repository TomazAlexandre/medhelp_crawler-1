    "question": "I'm a 34yo woman who has had diabetes for 29 years. All my life I have struggled with my weight. I've tried to achieve a healthy weight but no matter what I've tried I never seem to get there. I want to become a bodybuilder and have started training hard. although I hav put on some muscle I have put more fat on. I am extremely frustrated as my diet consists of protein 1st cereal (low GI cereal), and skim milk, protein shakes(low carbs), brown rice and green veges. This is about as strict as it will get. Ive gained weight on this regiem. Could it be the type of insulin I'm on? I currently use lantus and novorapid.",
