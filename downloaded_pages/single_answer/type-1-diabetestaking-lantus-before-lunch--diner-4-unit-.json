Fasting?\u00a0\u00a0After eating?The best way to put diabetes in remission is through adopting a low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0This diet should be very low in carbs (mostly carbs from non-starchy veges, some nuts, full fat dairy), moderate in protein, and with enough fat that you will not be hungry.\u00a0\u00a0Some people find that ketogenic diet can also work quite well.Hope this helps.",
