            "answer": "We are not doctors, so I cannot give you a diagnosis, but I would suggest that you ask your doctor to do a glucose tolerance test on your son. Some of the symptoms (the frequent urination) can be caused by diabetes, because thirst results when glucose levels are high. However, a dry mouth and fatigue and headaches and muscle spasms can also be symptoms of LOW glucose levels: hypoglycemia. If you have a relative who has a glucometer, you could do a simple finger ***** if you can catch him feeling these symptoms and see if his numbers are out of the normal 70-126 range. But a glucose tolerance test may tell you more about how his body reacts to stimulus of a high-carb food or beverage. Hypoglycemia usually will show up in the test, as will diabetes.The only warning I send is that sometimes the person being tested does not have a reactive episode during the test and the results come back normal even though it is fairly obvious to all that the person really DOES suffer from hypoglycemia. Symptoms of low glucose are as follows:1. the strange behavior you spoke of could easily be symptomatic of a glucose low2. drunk behavior3. slurred speech4. unexplained hot or cold feelings5. sweating without reason6. confusion7. headache8. irritability9. fatigue10. sleepiness11. yawning without reason12. dry mouth and eyes (can feel like thirst to the hypoglycemic person, very much like the thirst that HIGH glucose can cause)13. loss of muscle coordination14. spasms or twitches of muscles15. hunger or craving of sugar16. nausea17. depression18. double vision or sometimes things can look \"wierd\" (sort of like odd angles to everything, colors can look funny, or odd contrast is seen in objects)19. pale and/or dizzy (typical symptoms of shock)In some people, episodes of hypoglycemia seem to precede the onset of diabetes, so this is something that should be checked out. He will feel better if a diagnosis can be made and his diet changed to accommodate any special needs. The acetone in his urine could be an indication of severe low glucose levels, for ketones can be present after untreated lows as well as after extended lengths of time in which a person has high blood sugar. Both conditions set up a situation whereby the body is unable to process the carbs it needs and convert them to energy (either because in diabetes, not enough insulin is present or it is not being used by the body properly, or in hypoglycemia, there is too much insulin being secreted and not enough carbohydrates for the body to set the insulin to work on. So symptoms of both, very opposite conditions, can be very similar. Blood tests (especially the glucose tolerance test) is really the only way to know for sure if his numbers are low or high or normal. Glucose levels change all throughout the day for everyone, so he could easily be hypoglycemic at one point in a day and maybe even have high glucose levels at another.It is important to find out what his body is doing and then treat each situation as it presents itself. We wish your son the very best.",

    "question": "My son is 10. Ever since he was in about 1st grade (age 6) he has had frequent urination, sometimes going every half hour. Our doctor did urine cultures and everything came out normal except for acetone in his urine. He had one spell in first grade of extreme confusion where according to the teacher he was acting strange and sat down on the floor. He is now in fifth grade and has not had anything like that. He still pees a lot, but we were contributing it to a dye allergy which our doctor suggested and we have been avoiding red dye which has seemed to make it a little better. However, lately he has been complaing a lot of headaches and not feeling good, upset stomach, etc. The other night he said his feet were numb. Occasionally he gets real pale and complains of being dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0He also sometimes gets a lot of pain in the bladder area which seems like it would be bladder spasms. He also seems to be very tired. He goes to bed around 9:30 every night and can barely get out of bed at 7:00 AM. I was concerned about diabetes in the past, and now I am starting to worry again. Do these symptoms sound concerning for diabetes?",
