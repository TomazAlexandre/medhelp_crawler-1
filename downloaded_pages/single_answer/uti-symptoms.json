            "answer": "The risk of developing a UTI is significantly higher in woman of all ages compared to men and the risk continues to increases with age.\u00a0\u00a0Recurrent UTIs are caused by either reemergence of bacteria from a site within the urinary tract (bacterial persistence) or new infections from bacteria outside the urinary tract (reinfection).\u00a0\u00a0Postmenopausal women can have recurrent UTI due to reinfections. These infections are sometimes attributable to incomplete emptying of the bladder, which is often associated with bladder or uterine prolapse.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, concurrent illness, such as diabetes, recent antibiotic use, spermicidal use, reduced flow due to obstruction can also increase the likelihood of infection.Infection not associated with positive cultures, urologic evaluation should be performed.\u00a0\u00a0It is reasonable to have another cystoscopy, a post void residual (to evaluate the volume of urine remaining in the bladder after urinating) and functional imaging of your urinary tract.\u00a0\u00a0The goal is to rule out cause of irritative bladder symptoms.There are a number of options for the long term treatment of recurrent UTI.\u00a0\u00a0Some possible options include antibiotic prophylaxis, consisting of long courses of bactrim and/or nitrofurantoin, low does cephalexin or cipro.\u00a0\u00a0Another option is to have self start antibiotics, where you would start antibiotics yourself as soon as you begin to experience symptoms.Ultimately the treatment should be a decision made between you and your urologist.",
