            "answer": "Hello DLazzell,We are volunteers here & not medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend that you keep very detailed records of the patterns you are seeing and bring *that* to a consultative visit with a pediatric endocrinologist.A simple spiral notebook should work just find.\u00a0\u00a0Record your family history of diabetes in it (maternal, paternal linkages) and also the relevant data you're seeing on an ongoing basis.Each day, record blood sugars, activities, urination patterns, bed wetting, foods, water, stress, health, moods, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Keeping those records for a few weeks will not only provide you with a baseline of data, it might also help you to see patterns.\u00a0\u00a0Identifying patterns will likely be something that the endo will do also.\u00a0\u00a0Keep asking endo after endo until you find one who'll consult with you.\u00a0\u00a0That person will likely be the type of physician you'll trust and can work effectively with.There is some evidence that some folks go through a phase of hypoglycemia before developing diabetes.",

    "question": "My four year old son has had such a thirst in the last year.\u00a0\u00a0He can drink up to 24 oz. in one sitting.\u00a0\u00a0He obviously urinates all the time and tends to wet the bed at least once a week.\u00a0\u00a0We've had a controlled test done and the ranges were normal.\u00a0\u00a0But at home his blood sugar is either very high or about 76 in the morning.We've started using only artificial sweetners, no eating fast food, and lots of water but it doesn't seem to control his blood sugar levels.The doctor said he may be hypoglycemic, but isn't that for people who have low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0My father is diabetic but neither myself or my husband.\u00a0\u00a0Any clues as to what we should do or look.\u00a0\u00a0No endocrinologist will see him because his controlled tests were normal.***@****",
