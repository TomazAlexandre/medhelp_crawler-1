            "answer": "Hello,this does sound like it could be hypoglycemia.Do you have access to a blood sugar meter?\u00a0\u00a0If you do, you should test about 1 1/2 - 2 hours after eating, and also when ever you are feeling bad.\u00a0\u00a0 Normal blood sugars should be in the range of about 70 - 120.If you do have hypoglycemia it could progress to diabetes some time in the future.Best approach is to have small regular meals.\u00a0\u00a0 You should avoid sugars and all refined carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0Although it sounds counter-intuitive a low carb eating approach such as Paleo may be helpful as by avoiding sugars you avoid the low that would follow after the immediate highs.Your meals should contain plenty of healthy fats as well as complex carbs (such as those from veges), and protein.\u00a0\u00a0The fat will help slow down the absorption of the carbs and help stabilize your blood sugars / prevent lows.You could also ask to be assessed by a Dr to see if your symptoms really are from hypoglycemia.",

    "question": "Hi, I'm a 14 year old female, active and don't have any history of the condition- Grandmother had diabetes, if that helps. So, I've always felt faint if I, say, miss breakfast, or not eat enough of it, but i'm starting to feel this way all the time. I get really really hyper if i ever eat anything containing sugar, and then crash so low that I struggle to keep my eyes open. I also get very tired after eating, and if i don't eat for around 3 hours, I get quite dizzy, confused and also slightly shaky and sweaty when I get stressed. I've almost passed out quite a few times, but have had these episodes written off to being in the heat for too long ect. Does this sound anything like Hypoglycemia to you? Thanks (I'm not diabetic)",
