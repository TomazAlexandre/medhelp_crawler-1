            "answer": "Changing lifestyle habits can go a long way in controlling type 2 diabetes. Restrict & avoid refined sugars, practice and adhere to weight control, do some sort of exercise daily, practice stress management, and get adequate sleep. These are all important in managing this illness, the most important, along with proper nutrition, is physical activity.The most common causes for high blood sugar are bad food choices, sugary liquids, and lack of physical exercise. During that same period, the circulatory system and nervous system is put under stress. Caffeine stimulates the production of stress hormones, which increases glucose production by the liver.Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates (starches like chapathi) carefully too. For example-- things like breads, potatoes, pasta, crackers, etc. can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar if you aren't careful. (They are converted to sugar after you eat them.)Other foods/drinks need care too (example; milk, fruit, fruit juice) can also cause blood sugar to rise (so serving sizes and moderation are important). With fruit it\u2019s important to eat them with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose (fruit sugar). I'm NOT saying that these foods aren't allowed. What I AM saying is that you need to use care and follow the guidelines for diabetic nutrition.If you have an Endocrinologist, a diabetes doctor, or a diabetes nurse, or a nutritionist they can help you a lot with nutritional guidelines. (Serving sizes, and how many servings of each type food that's safe for you.)If you cannot bring down your glucose [blood sugar] levels by the above recommendations you must resort to medication to help control your glucose levels.",
