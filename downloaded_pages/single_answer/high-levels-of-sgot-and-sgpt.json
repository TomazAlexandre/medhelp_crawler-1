            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Normal values for SGOT is 0-35 and SGPT is 4-36. So, the values mentioned are on the higher side. Considering your history, the elevation could be due to fatty liver changes. This can be assessed by an ultrasonogram. Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. This can progress to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. So, prevention or cure is by avoiding all alcoholic drinks and treating diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
