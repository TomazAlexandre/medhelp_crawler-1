            "answer": "Hello Lolu,We are volunteers and not medical professionals, so your first instinct for your daughter to see a physician is a *must.*The symptoms you describe are often reported around diagnosis of diabetes; however, a blood test is needed for diagnosis as there are many things (such as the stress of med school) that can lead to many symptoms you reported.The rigors of medical school lead many students to not eat well, not get enough rest, not get enough physical activity, and not have enough outlets to dissipate the stress.If I were her mother, I'd urge her to see the school physician, report her symptoms, and ask for the necessary blood work.\u00a0\u00a0There is little else that can be done until a physician identifies the root cause(s) for her symptoms.I hope she listens to you.\u00a0\u00a0If she does have diabetes, reach out right away to JDRF \"Online Diabetes Support Team\" (ODST) a sister-initiative from JDRF.\u00a0\u00a0They have extraordinary volunteers (some of whom \"work\" here, too) who are so helpful for newly diagnosed individuals adn their families.YOu can reach them at www.jdrf.org and volunteers there will be able to help you 1:1, usually with help being offered by someone in your local area who has been in a similar situation -- and has come thru it.\u00a0\u00a0Do mention that we referred you, since we try to coordinate our activities.If she is diagnosed with something else, I wish you similar success in finding peer-support.",

    "question": "Our 24-year-old daughter is exhibiting what seem to be some signs of \"sugar problems.\"\u00a0\u00a0She is fatigued all the time, urinates frequently (to the point that she suspects she has a bladder infection but often does not, has had a black-out experience three times in the last few years, has frequent headaches, anxiety, depression and flu-like aching.\u00a0\u00a0She is in med school and stays \"stressed out\" with her workload, but we believe there is more going on here than just stress.\u00a0\u00a0Her grandfather and paternal grandmother both had adult onset diabetes, and we are just in the dark about this whole potential concern.\u00a0\u00a0She has indicated that she doesn't eat balance meals but DOES eat off and on during the day.\u00a0\u00a0She says she craves carbs on a continuing basis.\u00a0\u00a0Last evening she was actually nearly asleep on our couch until I gave her Cream of Wheat, and she nearly instantly bounced back with this surge of renewed energy.\u00a0\u00a0(This seems so bizarre, though her sister and I have both recognized that we get irritable and low on energy if we don't eat frequently--i.e. every 2 hours or so.\u00a0\u00a0Neither of us have had unusual sugar levels in physicals.) We have encouraged our ill daughter to get an appointment for a routine but very thorough physical.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any suggestions for her/us?\u00a0\u00a0What are our best sources of information on this, and what sort of support/aid can we give her?\u00a0\u00a0We value any suggestions you might have to help us in approaching this problem.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
