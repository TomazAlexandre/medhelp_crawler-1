            "answer": "The cholesterol that we generally focus on is LDL and HDL. As you stated, your HDL is good. Depending on your concurrent medical conditions, your LDL may be at a good level as well -- 110 is actually quite good. People who need their LDL less than 100 are people with history of stroke, diabetes, coronary artery disease, prior heart attacks, peripheral vascular disease, or carotid artery disease. If you don't have any of these, then I'd leave well enough alone and ignore the total cholesterol. If you are really worried, you could see a Preventative Cardiologist, who would know much more about the different cholesterols and how to deal with them.",

    "question": "Dear Dr:I'm 52 yr. old female.\u00a0\u00a0I'm at least 3 years into menopause and do not take hormones and am not overwieght.\u00a0\u00a0I just got the results from my Berkeley Heart Test back.\u00a0\u00a0The results are as follows:Total Cholesterol:\u00a0\u00a0300LDL:\u00a0\u00a0110 (mostly large buoyant particles but some small dense)HDL:\u00a0\u00a0182\u00a0\u00a0(large particle)Triglycerides:\u00a0\u00a040The test also yields some specialized genetic information that I'm not real clear on but is as follows:ApoE genotype 3/4KIF6 genotype\u00a0\u00a0 719 Trp/Arg heterozygousI also had a calcium score that was 0.Anyway, my Dr. said he wasn't sure what to do, if anything, but was uncomfortable not treating a total cholesterol of 300.\u00a0\u00a0His recommendation is for me to take a low dose of Lipitor.\u00a0\u00a0 I've always had high HDL, about 130, but it really shot up when I started taking fish oil, which I take for its general health benefits.\u00a0\u00a0 I've always heard that you want your HDL as high as you can get it.\u00a0\u00a0Is that really true?\u00a0\u00a0 Should I stop taking fish oil?\u00a0\u00a0By the way, I don't think I'm going to take Lipitor.take Lipitor.",
