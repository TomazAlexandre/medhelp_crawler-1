            "answer": "Hi you!\u00a0\u00a0I just finished reading all of your posts, and I think I can help ease your mind a bit.Let me first say,\u00a0\u00a0I too had horrible anxiety attacks, (that were brought on by XANAX!\u00a0\u00a0hate the drug with a passion.\u00a0\u00a0I had a horrible time going off of them, and had to sleep downstairs in the living room of my parents house for 3 weeks because I was afraid I would need help and would not be found until it was too late!).\u00a0\u00a0I no longer have anxiety attacks and cured them without meds!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0I wondered if I would ever feel normal again, and i do! And you will too, I swear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0If you need any other help with anxiety attack stuff, just post it here and I will give you some techniques that work!!!\u00a0\u00a0Oh and all of the tests I have had done for my heart palpitations, (tread, ultrasound, holter moniter) have come back benign.\u00a0\u00a0(similar family history as yours)\u00a0\u00a0and let me say, when people have never had an anxiety attack or heart attack, they\u00a0\u00a0just don't know how scary or real they are!!!!!Secondly, please read this entire article, it is from a family practice Dr, who uses traditional and complementary alternative medicines, and it addresses how he has been treating and CURING people with almost every condition you list from, thyroid issues, to PCOS, to Diabetes, and even depression.http://www.optimox.com/pics/Iodine/IOD-10/IOD_10.htmPrint the article and take it to your new Doctors in Las Vegas, and also call Dr Flechas office and ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0They were very nice and super helpful.\u00a0\u00a0And you might want to talk to them about your son, because they told me there is a Doctor in Kentucky who is doing a study of 200 of his autistic patients, to test for the possibility of a link between iodine deficiency and autism!!!\u00a0\u00a0Since your thyroid is out of whack it could be becasue of iodine deficiency, which would have affected your pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0It will sound odd to some of your Doctors, which is why I say bring the article with you!!!Also, go to Dr Flechas website at www.helpmythyroid.com\u00a0\u00a0for their number and even more info on iodine deficiency.Hope this helps!!!! and if you need any other help, keep writing me!!!\u00a0\u00a0Godspeed to you and your son, I believe good things are coming soon for you both!!!!take care!\u00a0\u00a0abl",

    "question": "I am really not doing well and need some help. I have had Hyperthyroidism for about 5 years now and apparently every year it has gotten worse but have never treated it. I was always borderline and not able to be treated for quite a few years. I think it only really started to drop around two years ago. I neglected it when it wasn't borderline anymore due to the fact that I was on Medicaid on and off for years and at some long periods of time had no Medical Insurance at all. Currently, I am not covered since I just moved from NY to Las Vegas and have not had the time to sit in a Medicaid Welfare office for a whole day or two. I have SO much stress and things going on with my son and the school system out here that I always put myself last, my son is Autistic and he MUST come first.",
