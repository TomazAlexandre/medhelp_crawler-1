    "question": "HelloI am new to this group and have a few questions I hope to find answers to. Receiving an ecg at the doctors office it was discovered that I had had a previous heart attack. I was sent for a stress test that turned out ok. I have family history of heart disease (both parents), high blood pressure, hypothryoidism, high cholesterol and diabetes 2 on insulin. After the stress test turned out ok the doctor says she will \"watch\" me. She says to go to the hospital if I have any chest pains. The thing is I have some kind of chest pains every day and can not spend everyday at the hospital. Obviously, the attack I had must have been somewhat on the silent side and I still wonder if I am going to have another one. My question is should more testing be done besides the stress test? Are there questions I should be asking my doctor on my next visit? I was told I should have had blood work as well as x-rays done and yet these were not ordered. A CK level was done which is high but because of the thyroid problem they pretty much ignore it. Also I have been keeping track of my blood pressure at it is sometimes alot higher than it has ever been then at times normal. Getting up in the morning it is always high. I have been having many headaches wondered if this is a connection . Ok this will be enough for now (LOL) will wait to hear from someone. Thank you for listening.",
