            "answer": "Hi,Erysipelas and cellulitis often coexist, so it is often difficult to make a distinction between the two.Cellulitis is an infection of the deep subcutaneous tissue of the skin. Cellulitis can be caused by normal skin flora or by exogenous bacteria, and often occurs where the skin has previously been broken: cracks in the skin, cuts, blisters, burns, insect bites, surgical wounds, or sites of intravenous catheter insertion. Skin on the face or lower legs is most commonly affected by this infection, though cellulitis can occur on any part of the body. The mainstay of therapy remains treatment with appropriate antibiotics.Erysipelas is the term used for a more superficial infection of the dermis and upper subcutaneous layer that presents clinically with a well defined edge.Treatment consists of resting the affected limb or area, cleaning the wound site if present (with debridement of dead tissue if necessary) and treatment with oral antibiotics, except in severe cases, which may require admission and intravenous (IV) therapy.Do get your blood sugar levels checked to rule out diabetes.It would be best to consult a doctor to find out the cause of your symptoms.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with Cellulitis or Erysipelas although the doctors were unsure if this diasnosis was correct.\u00a0\u00a0This worries me.I woke up on Tuesday morning at 7:30 with a 4 inch triangle of rash in the center of my chest just under my breasts and a heavy feeling in my chest.\u00a0\u00a0After 2 hours, I became very chilled and the heaviness or tightness in my chest was more noticable.\u00a0\u00a0My breastbone was tender to touch.\u00a0\u00a0I rested for a couple of hours and by 2:00 p.m. my symptoms were not going away.\u00a0\u00a0The rash had spread down to my belly area (it was a mass of red, hot to touch but not itchy).There were numerous tests done to reach a diagnosis and after 2 days of antibiotics intravenously, I am now at home taking meds orally.\u00a0\u00a0What worries me is that no one is making any connection to the heavy feeling in my chest which was relieved once I received meds, returning one night but again relieved with some tylenol.I would like some advice, please.Lincoln_lady",
