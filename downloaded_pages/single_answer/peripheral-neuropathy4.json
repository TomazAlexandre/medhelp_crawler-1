    "question": "My doctor is surprised that I have periperal neuropathy when I am not a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I experience alternate sensations of heat and cold in my feet and legs to my calves, especially at night.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the heat sensation is only in my knees, to the point of waking me up.\u00a0\u00a0If I get up and walk around for a while it goes away, but it is quite intolerable while it lasts.\u00a0\u00a0What do I do?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor has advised Lyrica, but I am reluctant.\u00a0\u00a0I eat a careful low-fat diet, using little sugar, only Himmelayan Crystal salt, coconut and olive oil, some mostly-spelt bread, lots of green and yellow veggies, fruit, and I take a pure glutathione-building protein powder that gets the best results, but not full relief.\u00a0\u00a0My discomfort greatly affects my walking at times.",
