            "answer": "Hi!There are many other causes of nerve disorder causing\u00a0\u00a0paresthesia or abnormal sensations like water running down the leg including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Multiple sclerosis and G B Syndrome (less likely) are two other possibilities.Since I cannot examine your mother and know other related conditions she may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
