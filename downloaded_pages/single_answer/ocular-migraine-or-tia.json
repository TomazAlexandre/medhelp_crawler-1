            "answer": "Hi, like your doctor mentioned, it could most probably be an ocular migraine again. This is more so as the problems with vision was followed by a headache. It can also be TIA, which can present as single symptoms or multiple. This could be more relevant if you are a smoker, are overweight, have a positive family history, are a diabetic and have hypertension. But usually in cases of TIAs the imaging studies may not present any abnormality. The therapy for TIAs is focused on controlling high risk factors like diabetes and hypertension and improving blood supply to the brain with blood thinners like Plavix. So, you can focus on controlling high risk factors and discuss with your doctor about Plavix. Regards.",

    "question": "Last October 2012 I was sitting on couch got up to get something and my vision suddenly had zaps of light in it and black circles. I went to eye dr maybe 25 mins later Optomologist he ruled it as a Ocular Migraine I was good with that.. Now fast forward to yesterday..I was working out in the heat laying rocks around my ditch bank stayed outside from 6 30 a.m. until about 10 00 a.m. came in cooled off for 15mins then took a shower. I got on computer and all of a sudden the words got a little dark to me and hard to read about like it did last October. I didn't notice much of he zaps of black circles but the room was bright this lasted maybe 15 to 20 mins. Soon to follow was a headache just like it did last October.which eye dr told me usualyy when you have an ocular Migraine its a sign of a migraine coming on. Anyway when I sneeze now my right side of my head hurst and even if I cough. Which again just like before same symptoms as in October..So I guess what I am asking with a TIA do you have more than one symptom or can it be just one symptom?Does it sound like I had another Ocular Migraine?I have had an Ultra sound of Heart almost a year ago and also neck arteries been in drs office every 3 months. I am on 5 mg of lisinopirl and I take 300mg of zantac I take a b12 shot every 3 weeks and I am taking a shot fot testosterone 100mg a week along with .05 mg of Klonipin that's all I take.Should I be worried about a tia or stroke after yesterday??",
