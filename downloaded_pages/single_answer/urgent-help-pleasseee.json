            "answer": "Hi there,These sensations experienced by you could be suggestive of some neuropathy. The common causes are diabetes (which causes progressive nerve damage), numerous medications, nutritional deficiencies (especially B vitamin deficiencies), and thyroid problems. Multiple sclerosis, pinched nerves, radiculopathy all can cause such symptoms. I will suggest you to get a neurological examination by your doctor. This is merely an advice and not a substitute for clinical examination Consult your doctor for more queries and assistance. Keep me posted.Best luck and take care!",
