            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I am sorry to hear about this. Two possibilities come to my mind right now. One is that your husband has diabetes. Do a fasting blood glucose and a two hour after food sample along with a glucose tolerance test.The other is that he has developed a fistula. How deep the fistula is can be detected by radioactive dye\u00a0\u00a0by ultrasound guided probe. Talk to your surgeon and see what he says.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Maybe you can seek another opinion if this surgeon is not cooperative or unavailable. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
