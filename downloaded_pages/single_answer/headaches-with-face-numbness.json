            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth, dental caries, etc\u00a0\u00a0can all cause facial numbness and pain. They can also cause ear numbness that spreads to face.Hemi facial numbness is also seen in Bell\u2019s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia where a spasm may cause numbness, or due to acoustic neuroma which is a benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss these possibilities with an ENT doctor and a neurologist. Take care!",
