            "answer": "Hi!Blocks in arteries can only be corrected by stenting, ballooning, and by bypassing the block. Hence if surgery is not an option, and you have symptoms, then doctors can try stenting and ballooning.Also, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and hypothyroidism all predispose to thrombus or clot formation. So, if you have any of these, this problem will need to be adequately managed. Blood thinners are often started to control further clot formation. Please discuss with your treating doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "Male, 68 yrs,\u00a0\u00a0Recently had ultrasound on leg arteries. Left leg 50% blockage, right leg 75% blockage. Supp to go for more specific tests, Dr says maybe they wont do operation. What can I do to try to unblock leg arteries? exercise, special foods? No pain but some fatigue climbing stairs, also around ankles if I stand up long capillaries burst and bright red turns brown cause I guess blood having restrictions to return. Am wearing compression socks, also under toes behind them at front of under foot feels kinda tight all the time..heating pad to increase circulation? Also when going to sleep, heart rate slows down and think blood pooling by foot cause heart seems to work harder 90 mins later diminishes if i walk around. No pains in leg and nothing blue, want to truy to unblock. If they do bypass where they get the vein? This one is blocked? Thanks for reply",
