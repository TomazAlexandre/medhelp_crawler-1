            "answer": "ok, not sure but the endocrine concern is possibility of ketones-these are acids made from breakdown of fat during fasting, or in patients with diabetes due to lack of insulin and the body breaking down fat for fuel. Also this breath may be considered to be related to a sinus infection, strep throat, tooth infection, it is hard to tell! I would start with your pediatrician and it sounds funny but a urine test may help us-it can pick up sugar and ketones and tell us how concentrated he is. Then if it worsens there are other metabolic tests if they have any other concerns that look at how we break down proteins-rare but something far off to consider.",
