            "answer": "Hi!A bad odor coming from nose is usually due to a foreign body, sinusitis, nasal polyp or even due to post nasal drip. Usually treating the cause takes care of the smell. You can try drinking plenty of fluids, using saline water for nasal irrigation, taking steam, and doing warm saline gargles. Even nose-rings are known to source of infection. Also check your diabetes status. High blood sugar level often is the cause for persistent infection despite treatment. Please consult an ENT for proper diagnosis and treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",
