            "answer": "Hi!Well, spinal nerve compression can cause fasciculations. Apart from spine problems in the back and anxiety and panic attacks, muscle spasms can be due to several causes. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, muscle fatigue, pinched nerve due to wrong posture could be the cause in your case. Try and use the correct posture while sitting and walking and consult a physical therapist regarding some stretch exercises which you can perform to help relieve tension.If this does not help, then I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes, Lyme's, lupus or hypothyroidism can also be the cause. It can be benign fasciculation syndrome if all causes are ruled out. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I am having muscle fasciculations all over the body for past 4 months. Now recently I have been feeling dizzy/weak for past few days. I have a history of hypochdria. I have been tested for ECG/MRI (brain, spine). The ECG was normal but the mri revealed the loss of lordotic curvature and pressing of nerve roots. Now i want to ask if these tests are sufficient? Or do I need to take blood tests too. My doc said it is due to the spine issues but I think i must take blood tests too. What should I get the tests for? I think (CBC, thyroid, blood chemistry, lyme) would suffice? Please guide. THanks.",
