            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Yes, uncontrolled diabetes can affect brain. It can cause small areas of infarcts in brain and this can cause aphasia. It can also be due to stress and anxiety.Aphasia is also found in people with lupus, Sjogren's Syndrome, and Hashimotos thyroiditis. Hence all these need to be ruled out. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
