            "answer": "Hi!It is very difficult to say whether it is a STD or a simple infection of the hair follicle (typically called a boil) caused by shaving.You can treat this by applying a warm cloth to the area twice or thrice a day alternating with antibacterial cream. This encourages the pus to come to the surface, make a mouth and drain. Once the boil has drained, the area should be washed with antibacterial soap and an antibacterial cream applied and kept dry, bandaged and sterile.\u00a0\u00a0However, if you have any medical problems like diabetes, please consult a doctor, and do not wait for it to heal. Also if the boil appears to spread, the area around it becomes progressively red, then also consult a doctor. This may need incision and drainage.If this treatment does not help after a day or two, please consult a doctor for further treatment and to evaluate the need for a STD panel. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello,I have had a blemish since last weekend(two weeks ago) after I had shaved. I noticed there were other little black spots with little hairs sticking out, but they went away after a couple days. Now, I have this blemish that used to hurt and it still does a little bit. Now, the blemish has a really dark red pimple with red surrounding it. I'll also note that I'm sexually active with my girlfriend for about a year. Also note that before it was a pimple, it was more roundish, white, and a bit squishy(as if it was full of puss) So my question is: what is this? Could it be an STD?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance.",
