    "question": "My 76 years old dad who resides in Nigeria had a stroke over 3 weeks ago with paralysis on the left side.He is also diabetic and has a severe wound on his right leg. There has been no change in his condition, he is unable to communicate and is been tube fed.We have been told that he will probably be sent home in the next week or two because there is nothing more that can be done at the hospital.My questions are:Since we reside in the USA, what can we do ?We would like to send some medical supplies for his wound dressings, bed sores and some diabetic enteral nutrition and anything else possible since he is unable to travel out of the country due to his condition. We know that the doctors are doing their best based on the best technology and info that they have but we cannot help but wonder if more can be done if my dad could travel to either The UK or The USA.Please advice.Thank you.",
