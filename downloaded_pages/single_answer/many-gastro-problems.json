I'm tempted to just STOP taking medicine completely. Might that help or would it be too detrimental? I refused to take Interferon treatments because of all the negative side effects. I've recentlty had a liver biopsy, ultrasound, and many lab tests. The only gastroenterologist we have near here is very unpleasant and also unhelpful. I'm a 72 year old woman; I know we are often invisible to physicians. Also, I can't digest meat very well so I have to eat vegetables, fruit, bread.\u00a0\u00a0Those are all carbo foods which tend to cause flatulence, right?\u00a0\u00a0What CAN I eat?Frustrated in IdahoThis discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/235874\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/235874</a>.",
