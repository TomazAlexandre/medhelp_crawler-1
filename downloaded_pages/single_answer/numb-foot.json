            "answer": "Dear mam, welcome to the medhelp\u00a0\u00a0neurology forum with this query. Diabetic neuropathy is the damage\u00a0\u00a0to the nerves following diabetes and longstanding poor sugar control which has been so in your case as per the brief furnished by\u00a0\u00a0you. It causes pain, numbness, tingling and burning . Diabetic neuropathy can be of 4 types, peripheral, autonomic, proximal and focal.\u00a0\u00a0Peripheral neuropathy of foot can cause pain, burning sensation, tingling and numbness. Proper foot care must be taken like wearing proper fitting shoes, apply moisturizer if dry, examine your feet regularly and take care of your nails.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor might be right in considering back problem as the cause like sciatic nerve compression, lumbar intervertebral disc prolapsed, or worse cauda equine syndrome which is a medical emergency. It is due to compression of lower nerves causing sciatica, saddle sensory loss, lower extremity sensory and motor loss, bowel and bladder incontinence. So please do not delay your MRI scan and get a detailed assessment of various systemic effects of diabetes in you and keep it under a tight control with dietary modifications, regular exercise(hold on till the leg problem is diagnosed), oral hypoglycemic agents to control the blood sugars. Take proper foot care so that you don\u2019t injure it while it is numb and since injuries don\u2019t heal easily in diabetics and can lead to complications like foot ulcers , gangrenes, necrosis and eventually may warrant foot/leg amputations.I hope this information helps. You are most\u00a0\u00a0welcome with any further queries.",
