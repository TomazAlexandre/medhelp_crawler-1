            "answer": "Hi, its best to avoid laxatives, as its difficult later for the normal bowel movements to return. Even if you need to use then use them for short periods of time. IBS can produce a feeling of incomplete defecation. Then again please check for Diabetes as this can affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves leading to bowel symptoms. This can be detected by a simple blood test. So, would advise you to discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time. Regards.",

    "question": "Hi there, what are the chances that I may have damaged my nerves due to laxatives? I have had a sluggish bowel since the age of 10 or so, I feel it is because of a spina bifida/scoliosis problem. I am 32 now and have taken miralax and metamucil for about 5 years. The Miralax always gave me diarrhea and the metamucil never really worked much either.I started taking laxatives about a year ago. I would take them weekly sometimes. I did that for about a month and then stopped and had trouble ever since then. I also started taking 'fiber' gummies to speed things along. That helped for awhile and now those are also ineffective.I don't really get the 'urge' to go very well anymore. I have to sit on the pot and 'strain' out the prior days meal. But I also notice that my stool is very very loose and I can't 'feel' it coming out very well anymore. (sorry to be so blunt) The only other change I have had in my diet is the removal of all processed foods, dairy, meat, rice, soy and gluten. I feel like these changes have almost made things worse, versus better. I now can no longer even eat so much as a taco or I'll get constipated. I also did start enemas here and there (switched off of fleet and I now use my own) and then tried suppositories. I felt both made matters worse.Anyway... I'm very concerned about all of this, understandably so. I feel like I honestly didn't 'abuse' laxatives or even use them all that much. Is it possible to get peristalsis back?",
