The mainstay of therapy is to prevent theblood from cloting by using Asprin, not as a painkiller but because itthis the blood. Most Doctors recommend a dose of 325mg so fourtablets sounds like a lot, and may cause stomach upset. If Asprin isnot strong enouh a drug called Ticlid is used.It sound slike you are on the right track although a second opinion tofine tune therapy might be a goo idea.**********************************Second question did noe upload correctly, please repostBy the way asprin THINS the blood , apologies for my typing mistake.Thanks for your quick response.\u00a0\u00a0I forwarded your information to him and have been trying to find any information possible that would help him to better manage his health while he is incarcerated.\u00a0\u00a0He has been on a weight management program, which includes jogging, weight lifting and upper body strengthing.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a possibility that he is doing too much in this area?Any other suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible to reduce your risk of stroke with diet managment?",
