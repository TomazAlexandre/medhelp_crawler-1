            "answer": "Hi!First of all\u2014are you sure you have Dercum\u2019s disease\u2014I mean it has been diagnosed by a doctor? After from being overweight (which is why you probably want to lose weight), do you have other signs and symptoms of Dercum\u2019s such as being easily bruised, diabetes, impaired memory, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances, depression, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, constipation, bloating, joint and muscle aches, fatigue, and weakness? If not then the lumps could be due to neurofibromatosis or lupus or tuberculosis, sarcoidosis or any other granulomatous disease.If it is Dercum\u2019s disease then the treatment is only pain relief. Your PCP can do this for you. The lipomas are not removed as part of treatment. You can lose weight to some extent by exercising as much as you can and eating healthy. It is best to join a dietician and a physical trainer. Otherwise in really obese cases gastric bypass surgery is performed for weight loss. Pease discuss with your doctor. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
