    "question": "My 12 year old son has been treated for migraines with Imitrex for two years now. The doctor had asked to keep an eye on what was triggering the headaches and it is clear that it is whenever our son is delayed with or skips a meal or has cake or sweets. The imitrex does not always work. Could this be diabetes or hypoclycemia. My grandmother, and both uncles are lifetime diabetics using insuling all their life. My sister is hypoglycemic but neither I nor my husband suffer from this. I asked his pediatrician about this and he did not seem concerned. My concern of course is that we have misdiagnosed his symptoms of diabetes or hypoglycemia as migraines when in fact we need to regulate his sugar. Please advise.",
