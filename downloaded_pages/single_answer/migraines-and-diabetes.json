            "answer": "Her migraines do not sound like diabetes. And cheerios is a very healthy breakfast. Symptoms of diabetes in children usually include elevated thirst (noticeable), constant hunger, inability to gain weight, and fatigue. If she shows none of these symptoms, it doesn't sound to me like it would be diabetes (although I am not a doctor, so maybe for your own peace of mind you may want your doctor to run some blood tests to check on this and maybe other things when she is HAVING one of her spells).Have you thought about food allergies? Maybe having her tested for food allergies would be helpful. Many people have gluten intolerance, but Cheerios have no gluten. Food allergies are just a thought.Another possibility is hypoglycemia, which can cause headaches. If a headache is caused by low blood sugar, it usually goes away after the person drinks some juice or eats some carbohydrates. It doesn't sound likely, but is something you may want to discuss with your daughter's doctor. A hypoglycemic headache is awful (I have been there, done that), and is usually in the very front of the head, in the forehead, although the whole head can hurt when it happens.We do wish your daughter the very best. Good luck to you helping her. Maybe you should avoid the Cheerios and see if the headaches recur without them.",

    "question": "My daughter has been getting severe migraines since she was old enough to speak. Late last year she was diagnosed with migraines and given several different medications. Until recently we've just been going through the lists of what your not supposed to eat when one would get migraines. Her migraines were very well timed, like clock work, every monday wednesday and saturday... those are her cheerios days. She loves to eat plain cheerios and milk (no sugar), and she likes to have apple slices with it. Every day she does this the school nurse calls me to say that my daughter has another migraine. Before this we were blaming cheese because she's like a mouse. So my question is, should we be looking into diabetes testing again? Maybe something was missed the first time. It was kindof just skimmed through by the doctor because it was normal and there is no family history.",
