    "question": "I had been searching for a few symptoms on the internet that correlate with a \"vibrating sensation\" and stumbled on to this website.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I have a cell phone on vibrate in extremities, mainly left and bowel and bladder area.\u00a0\u00a0I just found out about 3 months ago that I had a 16mm tonsillar herniation.\u00a0\u00a0I had thought I was loosing it, and have been put on a variety of Antidepressants, although I am not depressed.\u00a0\u00a0I've been diagnosed from diabetes, fibromyalgia and chronic daily headache syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0After a MVA, alot of these symptoms started to increase, intermittent numbness and tingling, sharp shooting and stabbing headaches, hand tremors, the list goes on.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone in this forum have an increased knowledge of Chiari Malformation, I have checked out a lot of websites, and the chronic headaches are similar, but are not the main focus of my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
