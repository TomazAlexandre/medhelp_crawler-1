    "question": "My husband and I have been trying to conceive for some time now. After coming off the pill I did not have a period for a year and so had some tests and it turns out that I have PCOS and Diabetes. The doctor's have prescribed me with Metformin and suggested that I lose a little weight.(I am not massively over weight just carrying a few extra pounds but have been losing around 2lbs a week regularly). Anyway, I thought that last month we had conceived so I was a little disappointed to receive what I think was my period, but it was so unusual.Day one was one tampon of thick black tar like substance (sorry if that's tmi) but not much after that. Days 2,3,4 & 5 were just spotting with brown blood and a little light pink/red blood every now and then. I had no period pains which is not like me, I only experienced some pulsing/twitching/pulling sensations in my left side.I took a pregnancy test when I was spotting (it was a cheap test) and it was negative. I do not have any other symptoms of pregnancy. I was just hoping for some advice/theories of what this could have been?",
