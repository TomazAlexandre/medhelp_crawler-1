            "answer": "I have read that when diabetes is poorly controlled, hair loss can occur. I believe that this is reversible once the person gets the glucose levels under good control. Pumps are indeed a wonderful help to many people, and yes, pumps are good for women who plan to get pregnant or\u00a0\u00a0who are pregnant. There shouldn't be any problem with getting pregnant while using a pump.",

    "question": "Hi, I have diabetes tipe 1 and I've been loosing my hair a lot. I went to a dermatologist and he didn't see anything wrong. I took some test and they were negative so I think my problem is caused by uncontroled diabetes. I wanted to know if I get to control my diabetes, can I get my hair back as it was before?I also wanted to ask about insulin pumps. I was talking to my husband about the posibility of gettin a insulin pump but I am concern about the effects it could have (if any) if I get pregnant because we were planing to have a baby as soon as possible. It is a good idea to get a insulin pump before I get pregnant?",
