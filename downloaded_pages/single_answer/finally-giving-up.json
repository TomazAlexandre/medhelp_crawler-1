            "answer": "Hello. Sadly, there is little you can do for him unless he wants to change. Alcoholism is a disease that tells the sufferer that they don't have a disease. It is characterized by denial, minimizing, and eventually an inability to distinguish between what is true and what is false. Additionally, the alcoholic has a mental obsession and a physical allergy to alcohol- they react to it differently than others. Even those that want to quit find that they can not do so on their own, willpower alone is not enough. An analogy is a person taking a laxative and using willpower to not go to the bathroom. The laxative affects the body in a way that the person can't control, alcohol affects an alcoholic in a similar fashion. It is also a chemical whose effects they can not control. But unlike a laxative which only affects the body, alcoholism has an effect which is physical, emotional, and spiritual. In addition, there is no cure, but it can be treated much like conditions such as diabetes. You stayed that your father remained sober for ten years. How did he attain that? Did he use aa, therapy, medication? You are in a tough spot, I watched my dad die from drinking, and it was horrible. But there are available resources like alanon that can help and support you, even give you advice that will help you deal with the situation. There are also many people on this forum who are more than happy to help and/or answer any questions. I wish you guys the best and will keep you in my prayers. You are not alone. Take care, GM",
