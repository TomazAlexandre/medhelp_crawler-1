            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Was this a one time event?Was it localized to one limb or side of the body more than the other?Did you have any residual pins/needles feeling?How long did it last?Have you checked your temperature during this episode? Systemic infections can lead to whole body sensations.If it localized to one side of the body, conditions such as stroke or mutliple sclerosis would be in the differential. An MRI of the brain would rule these in or out.Pins and needles sensation is a form of neuropathy (i.e., pain from the nerves). If localized to an extremity/dermatome, the differential would include metabolic, endocrine (such as diabetes or thyroid), autoimmune, toxin, neoplastic, genetic, and hereditary causes, to name a few. If the symptoms migrated from one spot to the other, the differential would then include seizure, migraine, or metabolic such as low calcium. If the burning sensation is recurrent and occurs when you are at rest and is accompanied by an urge to move, you should be evaluated for a condition called restless legs syndrome.Sometimes symptoms of whole body burning sensation may reflect emotional/psychiatric problems related to stress (what is called somatization disorder). The latter is a true medical condition whereby instead of a patient experiencing depression or anxiety, they experience physical symptoms, and once the stress is addressed, the symptoms resolve.Fibromyalagia is another medical condition that leads to whole body pains.These are just some causes of burning/tingling. If the symptoms persist you may need to have neuroimaging performed of your brain. I recommend that you follow up with your primary care physician to have a complete neurological and general examination. You may need basic lab work such as a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. If the sensations continue, there are medications such as pregabalin and gabapentin that can provide some relief.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
