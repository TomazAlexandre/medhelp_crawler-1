            "answer": "Hi,How are you? What are other symptoms present? It is good that initial diagnostic tests were negative for infection. Aside from infection, the glands around the urethra may be inflamed by injury\u00a0\u00a0such as sexual intercourse,\u00a0\u00a0use of a diaphragm, tampon, or pessary; or\u00a0\u00a0even a long bike ride.\u00a0\u00a0Other possible causes are spasms of the muscles around the urethra, diseases such as diabetes and even psychological factors, such as stress. To determine the underlying cause and to rule out hpv, additional diagnostic tests may need to be done. You may also benefit from seeking another urologist's opinion. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hi, I had vulvar wards hpv 15 years ago treated by laser. When I was diagnosed my symptons where burning when urinating and constant need to urinate. I waited 5 months for surgery, but symptons continued and ended 2 months after surgery . Doctor then told me my symptons were problaby not related to hpv as then disappeared for no reason. She understood there was no need to check my urethra for hpv. Since then, once or twice a year, I have again those same symptons of urethral inflammation, sometimes after sex or for no reason. They can last for 2 weeks or Even up to 2 months to disapear, with no aparent reason. Did all tests for infeccions by bacteria or other agents and they are negative. Just read that hpv can affect the urethra and I am worried that something was left inside the urethra unidentified by the doctor although the lesons outside were treated. Can This be? I can spend a year without nothing and then have this for weeks, then get ok again. Can symptons come and go like this? Urologist and ginecologista say it can't be urethral hpv but also can't find the cause! Can it be hpv? what should I do?",
