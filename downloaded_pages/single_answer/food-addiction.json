            "answer": "Hi!If you have a weight problem, it just may not be addiction to food. Common causes like overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, hypothyroidism have to be ruled out in your case. You must then look for other causes. One is water retention due to low serum protein. This along with anemia can cause unexplained weight gain. Adrenal gland problems are the other cause. Cushing\u2019s syndrome should be looked for. The kidney function too should be assessed. Late night snacking and poor sleep too can cause weight gain. Polycystic ovary too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out by an ultrasound of abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain. Also the diet should contain more of green leafy vegetables, fruits and protein and less of spaghetti, potato etc. If overeating or food addiction is a problem, then just psychotherapy will not help. To control your emotions you need to undergo cognitive behavioral therapy wherein the patient's though process is channelized in the right direction to help control cognitive behavioral therapy wherein the patient's though process is channelized in the right direction to help control addiction. Please consult a counselor. Take up yoga for that too helps a lot. Take care!",

    "question": "I need help for a serious food addiction. It is way out of control and I just can't stop it...like a runaway train and I'm afraid of what may be facing me at the end of this track!\u00a0\u00a0It's already affected my health seriously, and every (skinny) doctor I have says the same thing...LOSE THE WEIGHT...yet there is no help in my area for food addictions. My problem can't be fixed by taking a diet pill or joining a weight loss clinic. It's not about hunger, it's about emotions. I go to counselling to try to get my emotions under control, but I'm suffering from much emotional and physical pain with seemingly no end in sight...no help,and I just can't do it alone. I have a son to live for, and I feel as if this is \"death by food\".\u00a0\u00a0Any help out there?\u00a0\u00a0Jillian57",
