            "answer": "Wait and see what the endo. comes up with. However, go to an endo. who deals in many thyroid patients a year.\u00a0\u00a0Most deal in diabetes and thyroid down their list of expertise.Your levels suggest subclinical hyper thyroid, but your low TSH with normal Ts is off to me.I have three points though:TSH could have been Lab error, which is not unusual, so a second test is always suggested.Going to an endo. might use a different Lab and levels might be different.\u00a0\u00a0So a second test would be suggested to see if levels repeat.If you are an estrogen female, by whatever means, the FTs (Frees) should have been.\u00a0\u00a0Estrogen interferes with the Ts (total) and therefore will not relate to your accurate thyroid status.\u00a0\u00a0Whereas, estrogen does not interfere with the frees, therefore relating to accurate thyroid status.Endo. will figure it all out, so good luck.",
