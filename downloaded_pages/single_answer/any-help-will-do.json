            "answer": "Hello.Your symptoms of muscle fasciculation all over the body do give an impression of \"Benign Fasciculation Syndrome\". But the pin pricks and blurred vision suggest neuropathy.I would like to ask particularly about your Blood Sugar level. Are you a diabetic, or is there any family history of diabetes? We just want to rule out diabetic neuropathy.Also, did the MRI of the spine reveal any cord compression at the C4 - C7 level ?Regards",

    "question": "About 2 years ago I started having muscle fasiculation in my left arm. Within 6 months in had spread to my whole body and new symptoms began to appear. I have uncontrolable tremors in my hands, pin pricks in the palms of hands, blurred vision, the feeling as if a tuning fork is on the bottom of my left foot. I have gotten hot spots on my outer thighs as well as sharp stabbing pain in my head. I have pain between my shoulder blades and at time muscle pain in my legs. Some of these symptoms such as the pin pricks in my hand has only happened once and never again. I feel at times like my legs can't hold up my body as strange as that sounds. I have been tested for ALS, brain tumor, metal poisonings, lead poising, lime disease, and vitamin deficiencies just to name a few. I have had 4 emgs, the last one shows nerapathy is my neck muscle between c6 and c7 as well as my bicep in my left arm. The neurologist has tried to get reflexes and I have none in my legs or arms. I have had an MRI of my spine which showed degenerative disk disease between c4 and c7 but no lesions. I have had 3 brain MRI's which the first 2 came back fine, the third with a lesion that the neurologist states is age related. I video taped the muscle fasiculation because it doesn't stop and the Dr. said it is beignine and so are the tremors. How can I have so many beignine things? I'm frusterated because I know there is something wrong and I know my Dr.'s know there is something wrong. whether they can pin point it or not, whether they have ever seen this or not, there has to be someone else out there experiencing the same thing. I;m a 30 year old female from upstate NY. Any help will be appreciated.",
