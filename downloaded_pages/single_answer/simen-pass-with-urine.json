            "answer": "Hi there!This is likely to be due to retrograde ejaculation and could occur due to a few secondary causes such as surgery, diabetes, medication side effect etc. It may occur continuously or intermittently and the diagnosis would need to be confirmed by a urine test. A few medications are available that may help control the situation and possible complications with non-surgical causes. I would suggest consulting a urologist for an evaluation and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
