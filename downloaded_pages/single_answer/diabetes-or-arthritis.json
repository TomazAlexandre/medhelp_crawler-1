            "answer": "Hi,The symptoms seem to be related to neuropathy. It may be caused by Carpal tunnel syndrome as well\u00a0\u00a0since you are left handed. There could be median nerve compression at the wrist leading to the symptoms of pain, numbness and weakness. Please go for MRI of the wrist and consult a neurologist to confirm the diagnosis and take treatment. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",

    "question": "I'm a 46 yrs old female, been diabetic for almost 45 yrs,I had laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy back in 1989 and 1991, was diagnosed with celiac disease and gerd about 2 months ago, also have some level of neuropathy on feet and hands, and restless leg syndrome. Well, besides that I'm fine and healthy (I think). But lately I've been feeling numbness in my left hand (i'm a lefty) and sometimes a little bit of pain, I'm loosing some feeling on 3 of my fingers, i'm having a hard time writing, cutting, even holding a cup or a glass, it seems like I'm loosing the normal movement of the hand, also sometimes my fingers get stuck or cramp when I'm working with my hand. My questions are, Is this problem caused by diabetes or arthritis?\u00a0\u00a0Is there a treatment for this (medicine, therapy?) Should I wear a brace?\u00a0\u00a0Is there a test?",
