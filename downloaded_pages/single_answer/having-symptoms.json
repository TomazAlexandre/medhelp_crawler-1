    "question": "About 6 months ago I had an episode where I woke up one night and the room was spinning / distorted and the next day my neck was very sore where I could not move my neck side to side for several days. A few months after that I started feeling short of breath and my heart starting beating real fast. After that I started to feel weakness in one arm and numbness in one hand (Tingling feeling). The weakness has now spread to other parts of my body and just in the past two weeks I have started having muscle spasms and twitching all over my body, but mostly in my legs / arms. Just yesterday I feel like the tip of my tongue is numb and I feel like I having trouble talking and pronoucing some words. I have also noticed a problem with my vision - near and far blurriness, and a hard time focusing.Thoughts",
