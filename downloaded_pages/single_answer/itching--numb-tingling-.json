            "answer": "Hello,Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but are often felt in your hands, feet, arms, or legs.Various possibilities for this can be injury to the back or spinal cord, Lack of blood supply to the arms as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels, diabetes, stroke,motor neurone disease, autoimmune disorder like multiple sclerosis and lupus and underactive thyroid or parathyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause tingling in the peripheries.Another possibility is of brachial plexus injuries. A brachial plexus injury occurs when the nerves that connect your arm and spinal cord get stretched or torn.Nerve conduction velocity tests are required to confirm it.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.My opinion is to get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.Pls keep us posted if you need any more information.Regards. Take care.",
