            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Blood in the urine (hematuria) is a common urological condition. The cause can be range from urinary tract infection to kidney stones to more serious cancers like renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma.In addition to hematuria you describe proteinurea (protein in urine). This condition is usually related to reduced kidney function (i.e. reduction in the glomerular filtration rate) secondary to long standing conditions (hypertension or diabetes) and less often to pathologies in the nephrons (nephritic/nephrotic syndromes).Follow up with your nephrologist is recommended. A CT should be performed to rule out more serious issues.Sincerely,Ashutosh (Ash) K. Tewari, MDwww.cornellroboticprostate.orgThis forum is for information only.

    "question": "About 2 months ago after doing some lab work my physician informed that there was blood and protein in my urine. Even thou it is not visible but I have noticed for a while that my urine constantly has a strong bad smell. It has been 3 times that I actually noticed blood drops dripping from my urethra after urinating and this would go on for about 24hrs then nothing at all. The 3 times have been far apart as the last one I noticed was back in March 2009, the 2nd was around January 2009 and the 1st time was back in November 2008. I was diagnosed with an UTI and was given ciprofloxacin HCL 500mg twice a day for a period of 7 days. I am currently seeing a Urologist and had a CT Scan with Dye of my abdomen. I'm concerned of the diagnoses and can't imagine what could it be...any ideas if you would please.",
