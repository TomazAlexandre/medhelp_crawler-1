    "question": "This is my first pregnancy, at 7 wks, and it feels like from the beginning there have been medical problems. I have had asthma my entire life and I can't take advair while pregnant, which us the only med that has ever prevented attacks. I've been to the emergency room once already sincr I found out and stopped the advair, and take my emergency inhaler every two hours... now my eyesight is getting much worse which I've been reading may indicate gestational diabetes, and I'm feeling terrible, nauseated at all hours (but no vomiting yet thank goodness), dizzy, asthmatic and wheezy... I get blood test results tomorrow to find out if I have diabetes but for now I'm just stressed and depressed. It feels like my body is falling apart. Anyone else have this experience?",
