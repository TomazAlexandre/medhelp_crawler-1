    "question": "I am just wanting to know if this is normal? My left index finger just suddenly went stiff, I did not injure it recently or even in the past. I was at work writing in a chart (I wright right handed but do everything else left handed) and all of a sudden my finger was stiff and straight. with my palm facing the floor my left index finger was pointing straight down. I didn't really hurt just felt unusual, when I tried to force it to bend it hurt and I was afraid I would break my finger so I stopped. I started to kind of panic because I had no control over my finger. After about 2 minutes (which seemed like 20) it just went back to normal. I did notice the rest of the day and the following day the palm of my hand and all of my lower arm muscles were really sore. It has been 2 days now since it happened and my left index finger is still a little tender when I move it. Does something like this just happen or is this something I should call my PCP about? It has never happened before and I have so many other things going on right now such as migraines a sleep disorder undiagnosed GI problems. I hate to add something else to the list or even seem like I'm calling for every little thing that happens.",
