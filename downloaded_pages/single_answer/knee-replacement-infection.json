            "answer": "Hi!Yes, infection is one of the complications after knee replacement. It can happen immediately after surgery. Otherwise it can happen anytime in the next year or two. Though infection is not common, however obesity, smoking, diabetes and injury are considered to be predisposing factors. So, yes, a fall can cause infection.The treatment may involve anti-inflammatory drugs with antibiotics. If the infection persists then the implant is removed and the infection treated with antibiotics for six weeks. Thereafter another replacement procedure is performed. However, please discuss this with your treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
