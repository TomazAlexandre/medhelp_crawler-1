    "question": "Hi all...Here's my story...During the months of Sept-Oct of 2009, I had protected intercourse but unprotected oral with a man of unknown status.\u00a0\u00a0Oral only once, protected sex 3 times (as far as I know, no condom issues....he did not tell me of any).Was okay until the end of Feb. and was diagnosed with oral thrush BY a DOCTOR!\u00a0\u00a0Since then I have had sore throat, tingling tongue, headache, slight cough and sometimes a strange taste in my mouth.\u00a0\u00a0The doc gave me mouthwash to swish and swallow for the oral thrush BUT what scares me is I keep reading over and over on the net that adults get oral thrush for a reason.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabetes and was NOT on any meds!!!\u00a0\u00a0I keep reading that adults get thrush due to immune response unless there was another reason (as stated above)...Please tell me that adults can just \"get\" thrush???Anyway...The doc did do an HIV test at the end of Feb (this year of course) and it was negative.I know there is that little 1% of possible people that do not seroconvert by 3 months...Do you feel I am in the clear?\u00a0\u00a0And what about that diagnosed thrush without any other known reasons?Thanks so much for the help...Very scared...",
