            "answer": "Hello,This shooting pains in the foot can be related to burns but other possibilities like compression or entrapment of the nerves cannot be ignored as there is a long time gap between your symptoms and burns of the foot..One important possibility is tarsal tunnel syndrome.It is a compression, or squeezing, of the posterior tibial nerve that produces symptoms like severe shooting pain,tingling or numbness .Other possibilities are morton\u2019s neuroma(inflammation of the nerve),diabetes and arthritis.I sincerely advise you to consult a podiatrist/neurologist and get yourself evaluated for these possibilities.Treatment is entirely different for all and a confirmatory diagnosis has to be made first.Investigations like blood tests for diabetes and arthritis and nerve conduction studies may be required to confirm the diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing and if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "I was burned as a child on my lower legs and feet witch resulted in\u00a0\u00a04th degree burns and full thickness.\u00a0\u00a0I have severe shooting pain as well as throbbing, it comes and goes. At random times.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be related to the burns or could it be the nerves in my feet?\u00a0\u00a0It is mostly my left foot.\u00a0\u00a0I have always had discomfort but have lived with it fairly well.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to be getting worse and at times almost unbearable.\u00a0\u00a0I have soaked my foot in ice. It seems to help for about 45 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is the nerves that where damaged when I was burned. Do you have any answers?Thank you,Antete",
