            "answer": "Your concern and worry are certainly understandable. Having diabetes can be hard enough, but being a mom and responsible for someone else's diabetes must have its own stress. Please know that this is the hardest time of all; the adjustment to living with type 1 diabetes can be very difficult emotionally and their is SO much to learn. But in time it will become somewhat routine and your daughter can do all the things other children do once diabetes management becomes an integrated part of her life. I highly recommend the book Using Insulin by John Walsh. It has a lot of information. What you will find is though your medical team is very important, the day to day management is really up to your family and your daughter herself as she grows. I am also sending you a private message with a website with nearly 15,000 diabetics and there is a special thread for parents. Best of luck to you!",
