            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!What you have is probably polydipsia. Polydipsia means excessive thirst. It can be due to several causes. The treatment will depend on the cause. Hence first the cause has to be found out. Polydipsia can be primary or secondary. It can also be psychogenic. One can feel very thirsty for hours together after a spicy or salty meal. Diarrhea, excessive sweating, exposure to excessive heat and sun can all cause polydipsia.This can also be the result of diseases like diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetes insipidus (DI). Heart, liver and kidney problems and also certain medications cause excessive thirst. DI is pretty rare. DM is very common.A comprehensive investigation is required to know why you have this problem. The blackouts and fatigue may be related to this problem.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "For the past 16 years of my life, or at least as long as I can remember, I have been blacking out. It only occurs for a few long seconds but it starts out just everything I see goes completely black, then after afew seconds the black fades in and I start seeing thoughs little stars that usually occur when you're about to faint. But i never have fainted. Along with that, i've been having trouble breathing if I do a certain movement, it's like I can hear myself breath inside me when it occurs. Other symptoms I have that may help are i'm always cold, i've been sleeping at least 8 hour more than i've ever!, i have very frequent urination, and I'm thirsty 24/7. In the past 30 minutes i drank 128oz. of Ssips iced tea and I'm still dying of thirst.",
