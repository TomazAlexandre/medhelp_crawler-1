            "answer": "I am a type 1 diabetic. I have been diabetic for 10 years. I am a 25 year-old female.This is what high blood sugar does to me:-extreme thirst-feeling of being hot-headache-blurry vision-fatigueLong-term high BG numbers can damage your retinas and your kidneys most of all.Do you take a short acting or long acting insulin?I remember I used to have to mix Novolog (clear - short acting) and Novolin (cloudy - long acting) when I was first diagnosed. But over time, I had to take Lantus, a 24 hour insulin, and then shoot Novolog, a short acting insulin, every single time I had to eat!You just might need to change up your insulin routine or switch insulin types.You body can build up an immunity and/or not respond to a certain type of insulin. I have had it happen to me before.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with diabetes in June 2007 at the age of 24, And I have to take insulin to keep it under control. Two shots a day, morning and evening routine. For a while I seemed to have it under control.....BG staying in below 150 everytime I tested. My constant thirst and the constant bathroom trips went away (thank god). But here is my problem, I have heard that high BG lvls cause fatigue....For the past two weeks.....my BG has been averagnig 250+ and I work out and the like with no fatigue at all....if anything I feel fine...a little easily aggitated at work.....but fine.What are the hidden affects of high BG levels.....I know its bad to have high BG but not sure what other problems it causes that are not visible or easily identifiable.Thanks,Fingertips of Steel",
