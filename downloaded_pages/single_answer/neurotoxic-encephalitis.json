    "question": "For many years I have been treated for deppression (but it kept getting worse) then Bipolar disease (although my symptoms weren't typical). All that time, the medicines never gave me complete relief and they would lose their effect after a year or so. So, the psychiatrists would just keep adding more medicine.It comes to be that, over the last two years, it's been discovered I was developing brain damage from exposure to toxic chemicals where I worked. The psychiatrists were only treating the apparent symptoms without knowing the actual cause.So, hear I am now with a lot of brain damage from the chemicals and still taking Wellbutrin, Effexor and 1800mg of Eskalith CR a day. I still have mental illness problems but I'm not sure if these are right kind of medicines for me to be taking.Here are my questions.1. Can neurotoxic encephaly of the brain cause symptoms that are like mental illness (depression, Bipolar illness, ect)?2. Should such symptoms be treated like regular mental illness or are there other kinds of medicines for my illness?3. Could the medicines I am taking now be making things worse?",
