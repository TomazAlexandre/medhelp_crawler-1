            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.According to the National Kidney Foundation, normal results range from 90 - 120 mL/min/1.73 m2. Older people will have lower normal GFR levels, because GFR decreases with age. With a GFR of 59, you fall under the chronic kidney disease stage 3. When the GFR falls below 15, it is defined as kidney failure and then dialysis is the option. Until then managing the hypertension, diabetes, bone problems and anemia form the basis of therapy.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
