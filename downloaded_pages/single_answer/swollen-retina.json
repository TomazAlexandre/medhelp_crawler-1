    "question": "Hello,On holiday in kenya I went to see a doctor about my blurred vision. He told me that I have swollen retina due to either uncontrolled sugar intake or some sort of hormonal imbalance. In the UK I have always been told I do not have diabetes by GP's, but using a self testing kit at home, it shows my blood sugar level is well above the normal. It sounds to me like this links in with what the doctor is saying. He said I'm suffering from GLOSIS? I am in my early 50's, I am so terrified of going blind. Will I? What can I do?",
