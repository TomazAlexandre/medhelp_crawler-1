            "answer": "Hi,I think perhaps giving the Lyrica a bit more time to show its effect is the first thing. You may also be able to increase the dose after speaking with your doctor in future, to see if this helps. There are also other medications that can be used for diabetic neuropathy, so don't despair. If your doctor is having difficulty finding a treatment that works, you should request a referral to a neurologist who specializes in neuropathy--they will always be the most up to date on treatments. It is also very important to ensure your blood sugars are well controlled because high numbers will worsen the neuropathy.Take care.",
