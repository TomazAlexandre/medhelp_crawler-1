            "answer": "How different was it? You would expect it to be different due to the plumbing of the arteries. I believe a difference of 20 in systolic (top number) is allowed and 10 for the lower number, diastolic. Anything more than this can be a sign of artery disease, heart problems, kidney problems or diabetes.However, you should also take into account that not all blood pressure measuring devices are not the most accurate in the world. The best way to check this, is have your Doctor measure your BP using a cuff and stethascope. I have no idea why, but every auto blood pressure machine says my BP is something like 180-185/90-104. But whenever it's done using a stethascope it's around 120-125/70-75. This is a huge difference and why this happens is beyond me. Maybe the sensors have a problem finding my pulse.",
