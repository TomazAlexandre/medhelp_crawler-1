    "question": "For the past 13months i noticed houseflies follows me everywhere i go. I have no diabetes. Even if we are 10 people they only prefer to land on me. I have no body odor. I sweat much in my ampit. So i use deodorant. My family and i use the same water but it's only me who experience this problem. They\u00a0\u00a0even try to stand on my lips or any where they feel like standing. Onetime an housefly even entered my nose. Hope to find an end to this uncomfortable situation.\u00a0\u00a0You can email me on ***@****",
