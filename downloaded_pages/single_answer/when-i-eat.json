            "answer": "If you are experiencing nausea whenever you eat and feeling tired a lot you need to consult your doctor. First of all what do you mean by \"they said I didn't have it\". You need to see what your blood sugar is, fasting and two hours after meals. For your fasting anything over 100 is pre-diabetes and anything over 126 is diabetes.If you are not pre-diabetic or diabetic than you need to persist with your doctor and tell them you are not feeling well so they figure out what is going on.",
