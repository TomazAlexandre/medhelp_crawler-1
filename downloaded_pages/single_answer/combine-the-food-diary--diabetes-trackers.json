    "question": "Great site!For diabetics at least food & medication is closely intertwined. It would be nice to be able to log everything in one place. However if that is not possible, could you pull over the total carbs from the food diary into the diabetes tracker?Also it would be easy to calculate an insulin taken/carbs consumed ratio and chart this. That would make it easier to spot the reason for highs or lows and make adjusting insulin dosage easier.Another thing that would be great would be one mobile app that can update all your trackers?Again great site and keep up the mobile versions (especially Android versions).ThanksDoug",
