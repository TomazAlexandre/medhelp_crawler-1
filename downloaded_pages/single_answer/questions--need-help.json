    "question": "I have been experiencing some strange symptoms for about 5 months now.\u00a0\u00a0They all seemed to have started around the time my father almost died from a ruptured Aortic Anureism.\u00a0\u00a0I also have had a lot of other stressers during this time peroid. It started with a tingling/numb sensation in my big toe, then every time I bent my ankle it would start to tingle.\u00a0\u00a0My GP sent me for and xray and it came back fine.\u00a0\u00a0I soon began to feel slight tingling and tightness in my fingers and wrists (both sides).\u00a0\u00a0My major complaints have been dizziness, the sensation of sometihng in my eye (no vission loss or diusturbance)\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0stifness and dull achiness in both sides of my legs, mostly in my quads, calfs and behind my knees.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen my GP several times he thought possible Fibromalgia or a aniexty disorder.\u00a0\u00a0He sent me to a Nuerolgist who did testing on me with electrical currents on my arms and legs wich turned out normal.\u00a0\u00a0Reflexes and visual testing turned out normal as well. He sent me for an MRI with contrast to rule out MS.\u00a0\u00a0He also did blood mork to rules out Lupus and Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Blood work came beack good and MRI showed nothing he even compared to an MRI from 5 years ago and it showed no change.I went on meds for anxiety andsstress, seemed to help with symptoms for about two weekdsand then everything returned.Looking for anwers???",
