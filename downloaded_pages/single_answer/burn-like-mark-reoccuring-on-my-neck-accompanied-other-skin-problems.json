            "answer": "Hello,For such symptoms dermatitis skin and parasthesia should be ruled out. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then get it evaluated from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have had crohnes disease since 13. I am now 28 and have also been diagnosed with ra and osteoporosis. I have ha many weird side effects from crohnes such as arrhythmia nodosun.Currently I am extremely photosensitive. I feel like a vampire on movies getting Byrne every time I step into the sun. Mainly on arms face and neck. My neck gets a reoccurring burn mark that mimics those that would come from a curling iron. It always happens in the same spot, lower left neck superficial to my anterior scalene.I am worried because I have been on humira for a couple years an have been worried about side effect. I was also on 6mp which I do know is a major risk. I told my doctor of the mess risks but he said I needed them. I took myself of 6mp because I do not want white tcell lymphoma cancer.I have heard it could be shingles but my professors say it would be more uniformly spread through my upper arms.Any advice? My wonderful doc never called me back?",
