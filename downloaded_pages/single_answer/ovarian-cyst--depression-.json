            "answer": "Well, I'll take your questions one at a time.If you are depressed or stresses, it can be accompanied by increase hunger.\u00a0\u00a0If your are eating as a stress reliever, than it is possible to put on weight quicker than you expect.\u00a0\u00a0That is of course assuming that you aren't struggling with losing it when making an effort to eat healthy.Type II Diabetes can run in families, but my understanding is that there are other risk factors to consider, weight being one.I'm not sure on the ovarian cancer issue, but one thing to remember is that survival rates for most types of cancers have improved greatly, especially with earlier detection.\u00a0\u00a0That said, ovarian cysts aren't the uncommon, and most often women never realize that they have them.I do know a couple of people who struggled in excess of a year to have their first baby, and their second (or third) came along with no problem.",

    "question": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0I just found out that I may have ovarian cyst. (I go get an ultra sound done at the end of the month) I've been trying to get pregnant for the past year. So I have taken this news really hard since it will be very hard for me to get pregnant in the future. I'm very depressed and I'm always hungry. Is this normal? I have gained 15 lbs in the 5 months that I have not had my period and now I'm considered obese. This makes me so self conscience. What should i do? I'm scared I'm going to drive myself insane.I've read that Diabetes II can come from this disease would it be higher likely for me since Diabetes II runs in my family? My grandmother passed away from ovarian cancer could this be inherited?",
