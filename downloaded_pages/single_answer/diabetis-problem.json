My Doctor advised to go for a LFT, my SGPT is 92,GGT is 141, and SGOT is 40. I had TB in 2004 which was thoroughly cured after 11 odd months medicine intake. What you suggest from this report Do I Have Fatty Liver..? I used to drink but now I had stopped for almost month and a half. Kindly give your valuable advise...Thank You,Sudheep.",
