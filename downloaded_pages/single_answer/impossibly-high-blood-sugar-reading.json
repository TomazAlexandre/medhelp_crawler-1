            "answer": "Personally, I don't think Why is the most important question, or the easiest to answer when it comes to diabetes, which presents n wildly varying ways sometimes. Hopefully the insulin will start to bring her down quickly from those highs and she will feel dramatically better in a matter of days. I have heard of other people with similarly high readings on diagnosis (even higher!).She has a lot to learn and do, and again, the whys are just a way of staying in denial imho. In addition to the insulin she needs to learn about diet, exercise and weight loss. If she loses a significant amount of weight she could see dramatic decrease in the need for insulin over time, maybe get off it and put on oral meds. I would suggest she do some reading and learning and also ask the doctor for training in using Insulin:Carb ratios to determine her mealtime doses. There is no reason at all to believe this is a precursor to cancer in my (non-medical) opinion.",

    "question": "What in the world would cause this 55-yr old woman to go from NORMAL (no family history of diabetes) sugar readings -- no higher than 111 in the past, with regular 6-month reads -- to present in the ER with a blood sugar level of 670?\u00a0\u00a0She is obese at 250 lbs., though active and non-sedentary. Blood pressure recently dramatically low if that adds to mystery (69/32).\u00a0\u00a0Patient being sent home on both long- and short-acting insulin, 20 units long and 8 units x3/day. Patient expresses concern with finding out the WHY of this ... as well as questioning whether such a high, unusual reading (consistent over 3 days in hospital) might be precursor to pancreatic cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone with advice or thoughts?This discussion is related to/posts/show/478319.",
