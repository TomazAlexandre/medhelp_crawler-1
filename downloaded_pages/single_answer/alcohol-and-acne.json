    "question": "I am a 52 year old male generally in good health and taking no medication. In the last 10 years I have developed acne-like lesions on both upper arms, I notice if I drink wine or hard liquor every day, the lesions intensify. By scratching and peeling them, they turn into permanent marks. Latley, I used Oxy and tee tree oil on the affected areas which then helped in subsiding but not eliminating the flare-ups. I have also reduced my alcohol intake and limited it to weekends.A friend sadi the cause could be related to liver problems or diabetes. I have had a clean bill of health in my last two physical check-up. Not sure what to do next.",
