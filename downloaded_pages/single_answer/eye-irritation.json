    "question": "Every time i get the slightest cold, allergy attack, or even just a really bad nights sleep, my eyes (mostly the right eye) get really irritated, watery, itchy, burning and\u00a0\u00a0red. This has slowly been getting worse each time over the past couple of years. I also seem to be having trouble reading. I picked up a pair of cheap reading glasses at Walmart to help. I feel like I'm kind of young for all this to be happening at 43. I'm sure I probably need to see a doc, but it hasn't been in the budget for the past 6 months. I'm mostly wondering if this is just something that is just allergy related, and I just need to suck it up during a cold, or if it's a sign of something more serious, ie a caterac or something. I do have family background of diabetes and my mom had a caterac in her eye around the same age. I'm not diabetic, but did have gestational diabetes during all 3 pregnancies. I\u00a0\u00a0do watch sugar intake, but have gained a few (20)lbs in the last year and a half due to a knee injury and lack of proper excercise. I'm not a total flake when it comes to the excercise and diet, but I definitly don't work out the way I use to. I'm 5'4'' at 165lbs.",
