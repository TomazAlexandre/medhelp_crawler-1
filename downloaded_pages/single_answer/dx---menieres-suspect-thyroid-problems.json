            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Sinusitis involving the frontal and maxillary sinus can cause facial swelling that goes down with antibiotics. You need to get the X-rays of the sinuses along with probably a CT scan. If the sinuses are really filled with a lot of fluid, it would need to be drained.The swelling could also be due to water retention as in low protein in blood, kidney problems, severe anemia etc. There are chances that you have a kidney problem too\u2014say an infection that responds to antibiotics. A kidney function test and a urine examination is a must.It could be due to hypothyroidism too (however you have had several tests). An autoimmune thyroid disease can be detected by doing a microsomal antibody tests. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms.The diagnosis and further tests will depend on whether the swelling is a pitting edema (causes a dent on pressure) or a non pitting edema.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
