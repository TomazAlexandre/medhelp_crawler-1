            "answer": "Hello,Frequent urination in adults can be due to many causes. The primary cause which needs to be excluded is diabetes. Diabetes not only causes frequent urination but also numbness and tingling sensations.I would advise you to get a fasting blood sugar and Hb A1 C test done.If diabetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are urinary tract infection, prostatitis(inflammation of the prostate gland),UTI, interstitial cystitis, Kidney infections, overactive bladder syndrome and other neurological diseases ,urinary incontinence,bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction .Please consult a urologist in that case.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. Treatment can be started only when the diagnosis is confirmed. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "My first problem started about a week ago. I went to use the bathroom like any other day to urinate, however my urine felt warm and not in great amount. Even though this was strange, there was no pain while urinating. For the next couple of days I found myself having this urge to urinate 24/7. The urge was most extreme right after I had just used the bathroom. I thought this could have possibly been a UTI or an STD so I went to see my doctor to get my urine tested. The test came back negative for UTI and STD which was a relief, however I still have this urge to urinate, which like I said isn't painful but is starting to become annoying and messing up my sleep patterns. The urge is not as extreme as a week ago and only occurs off and on (mostly at night time while I am sitting in bed).Then, just recently (as of one day ago) I noticed that my testicles begin to feel hot when touched.\u00a0\u00a0The hotness is felt mostly on the left testicle.\u00a0\u00a0The hotness continues for a few minutes then goes away if untouched.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have any lumps on my testicle, no extreme swelling, or redness, but just a hot, burning sensation when touched.\u00a0\u00a0Could this have anything to do with me having this urge to urinate?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe epididymitis? Maybe my urine test was wrong?\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate any help.I am a 19 year old healthy male, 5'7\", 130 lbs, with no major problem before this.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
