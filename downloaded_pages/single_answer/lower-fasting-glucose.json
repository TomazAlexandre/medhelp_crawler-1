    "question": "Dr Ramsetty thank you for your recent response on lowering fasting glucose.\u00a0\u00a0You said you needed more info.\u00a0\u00a0I take metformin 500mg with breakfast & dinner.\u00a0\u00a0Then at bedtime I take Januvia 100mg.\u00a0\u00a0I eat a low glycemic diet and exercise. Sometimes I eat a snack at bedtime, sometimes I don't, and still cannot get my morning fasting numbers lower than 117 to 130.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to get the 100's.\u00a0\u00a0During the day I test twice and my numbers are 94-120. Also would you know why I continue to lose weight?\u00a0\u00a0I've been diagnosed with diabetes in the last two months but when initially diagnosed I had already lost about 20 pounds in 2 weeks and now, a month later, I have lost 7pds more in 2wks. Thank you for all your help - I greatly appreciate it.",
