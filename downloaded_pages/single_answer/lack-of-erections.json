            "answer": "Hello.Diabetes can affect blood flow to your penis. I'm not aware that Advair (asthma medication) is associated with any erection side effects.If you're not waking up with erections, this is a good indicator that there's something physiological going on. You have several medical questions which can best be answered by a urologist, and I suggest you post them in the Urology Expert Forum:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/show/113",

    "question": "I have noticed recently that I have not been waking up with erections very often. I am also not getting them as frequently in general in recent times. I just had some pulmonary function tests and my Oxygen level is low. 70 on the PO2 level. Could that in itself affect my inability to get good erections? I also have long standing Diabetes (27 years) with many complications including CHF, CAD, CKD and Moderate/severe Neuropathy. However, I have had pretty good erections up until my breathing problems have worsened. Also can Advair have that as a side effect as I recently have gone on that? Thank you for your help.",
