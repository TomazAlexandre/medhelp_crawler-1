            "answer": "Hello,Vit B 12 deficiency is one of the causes of numbness and muscle twitches.It is not the only cause.Other causes include diabetes, hypothyroidism,hypoparathyroidism,peripheral vascular disease, carpal tunnel syndrome transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus, acid-base imbalance in the body,low sodium,calcium and vit D deficiency,ALS and muscle fasciculation syndrome.For a confirmatory diagnosis,thorough investigations are needed to rule out these conditions.An evaluation by a physician and neurologist will be the best.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi I went to the doctor a few weeks ago because I have been feeling very tired and weak and have been experiencing numbness in my hands and feet. I've also been finding it hard to use my hands and find that the muscles in my arms and legs and neck have been twitching for no reason.He ran some tests and has said that my b12 was low at 52. Could this be the cause of my symptoms? I ask because he put me on pills about three weeks ago and I haven't noticed any improvement. The pills are 50mcg cyanocobalamin 3 times a day. The doctor doesn't seem too concerned with the levels and said that they wouldn't cause my symptoms. He also said he ran a test to see if my body was absorbing the b12 which it is. So I don't understand how it could be so low. I'm not a vegan or anything like that so I'd assume I'm getting enough of it in my diet.Thanks for any help.",
