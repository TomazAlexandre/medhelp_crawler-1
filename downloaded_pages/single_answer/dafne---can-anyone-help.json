            "answer": "I've never heard of DAFNE. You might try googling it or posting on a diabetes website that gets more traffic if this system really worked well for you. But the key to getting good blood sugars is generally accurate carb counting and matching the carbs to the correct insulin bolus. You might want to try reading Using Insulin by John Walsh which teaches you how to develop your Insulin:Carb ratio so that you can figure out how many grams of carbs you can cover with one unit of insulin. Calorieking.com is a good website which lists carbs for all common foods and even restaurants. Bottom line is you can't forget to test your blood sugar because that is how you know where you're at and how certain foods affect your blood sugar. Exercise of any kind affects blood sugar and sex is exercise so you might want to have a snack beforehand to avoid hypos.",

    "question": "I've been type 1 diabetic for 19 yrs and it has never been what the doctors would say 'under control'. October 2008 I went on a course for a new regime called DAFNE - dose adjustment for normal eating. The first 6 months were great my bg levels came down to the range they should be in, my HBA1C came down to single figures. Since then I became unemployed and have recently quit smoking and my bg levels are all over the place. I sorget to test my bloods before meals and can't seem to get my carbs n insulin right. Also I seem to have alot of hypo's after sex when my bloods have been high before hand. Is there anyone out there on DAFNE that can give me some handy tips how I can get back on track and get my bloods down????Thanks :)",
