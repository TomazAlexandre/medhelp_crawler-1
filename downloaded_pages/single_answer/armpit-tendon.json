            "answer": "Hello!You should rule out any swollen underarm lymph nodes and skin lumps and infections such as an infected skin follicle in underarm hair etc.It can be due to diabetes or peripheral vascular disease. Rule out nerve compression and brachial plexus injury. Any accident, injury involving your underarm in the past or peripheral neuropathy should also be ruled out.With a proper examination, scans, complete history you will be able to diagnose your problem with the help of a physician for treatment.If pain continues then visit a neurologist.Take care!",
