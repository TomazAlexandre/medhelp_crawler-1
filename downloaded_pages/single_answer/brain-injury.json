            "answer": "Hi!The first thing that you need to do is consult an ophthalmologist. The problem could be a foreign body or glaucoma or any inflammation. It can also be an inflammation of nerve. It could also be poor eye sight as in near or far sightedness. Since you have a headache too, possibility of pinched cervical nerve, trigeminal neuralgia, temporal arteritis, benign intracranial hypertension, hypothyroidism or diabetes causing neuropathy etc too should be looked at. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor and get a referral for an ophthalmologist and a neurologist. It's important to urgently consult a doctor. Take care!",
