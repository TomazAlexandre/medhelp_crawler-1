            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Uric acid is slightly higher so go slow on spinach, cauliflower and tomatoes. Monitor this once a year or if you have joint pains. Triglycerides and cholesterol could be high due to diet rich in fat, dieting, or due to weight gain or weight loss. However the cholesterol breakup is fine, hence not a cause of major concern. Still eat healthy and exercise regularly. ALT too is marginally raised and factors like diabetes, anemia, medications etc should be thought of too. Get an ultrasound of liver. Consult your doctor once. Take care!",
