            "answer": "Your question is not an easy one to answer as everyone has different needs. One item not posted is you diabetes medication; How much, how often, and when plays an important role.You can try starting a daily food log of what you consumed by portion and size. Adjacent to it your preprandial and postprandial glucose readings. This should help you realize the balance you require as you can quickly reflect what you ate to what your glucose levels are doing.Lastly, call and discuss with your doctor as he/she has better insight than we do of your medical history. A referral to a diabetes nutritionist/dietitian may be in order too. Sorry, I wish I had better answers for you. Good luck.",
