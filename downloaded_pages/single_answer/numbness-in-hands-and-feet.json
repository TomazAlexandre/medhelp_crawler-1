            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Numbness in your hands and feet may be due to an njury to a nerve , pressure on the spinal nerves/ peripheral nerves, lack of blood supply to an area, and other medical conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, diabetes, transient ischemic attack (TIA), use of certain medications or vitamin deficiencies. If it persists, have this evaluated further by your doctor. Your doctor should identify and treat the underlying cause of your numbness or tingling. This may reverse the symptoms or prevent them from becoming worse. Take care and do keep us posted.",
