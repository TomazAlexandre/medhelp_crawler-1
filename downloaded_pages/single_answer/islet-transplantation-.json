            "answer": "Hi,Yes islet transplantation has shown some good promise in regard to curing Type 1 diabetes, but the procedure is complicated and usually reserved for folks that have failed usual therapies despite their very best efforts. (You would have to show that you failed on your pump while doing everything right on your own.) The procedure has some possible complications, just like any surgery , and you will still need to receive immunosuppressive medications to prevent rejection. Most impotantly also, the data is still not great that this lasts, meaning that many people who have this procedure end up needing medications(sometimes insulin) in future again. The procedure is being refined very aggressively and I expect it will continue to improve and have better results.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know specifically about weight requirements or loss in reard to the transplantation.Take care.",
