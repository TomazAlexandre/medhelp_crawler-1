            "answer": "Hello,Recurrent urine infections could be due to various reasons. Most common causes are stones in kidney, changing sexual partners frequently, pregnancy, diabetes and childhood infections. The urine can also be due to retention of urine anywhere in its flow due to obstruction. Consumption of energy drinks increases caffeine content which acts as a diuretic and there is increased urination. A high sugar content of these energy drinks increases your urinary frequency.\u00a0\u00a0In your case it may be possible that your infection is persisting though urine tests may be normal in few cases. Management of UTI is usually with antibiotic treatment. Discuss the possibilities with a urologist. Take care and do keep us posted.",
