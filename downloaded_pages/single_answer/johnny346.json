            "answer": "Hi,Type 2 diabetes can cause excessive gas, especially if there is bacterial overgrowth in the bowel(which can happen when the bowel does not move normally). There are also many other disorders that can cause gas production besides diabetes, as well as medication side effects, so I think it best that you discuss the many possibilties with your doctor and go from there.Take care.",
