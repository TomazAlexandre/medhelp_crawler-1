    "question": "Hi, I'm a bit of a hypocondriac at times and I've had a dry throat right at the back behind my tongue, kind of on the roof of my gum and around the adams apple part. It seems that when I wake up and after strenuous exercise it is at its worst in that i almost (although never actually have gagged) but whilst i'm outside or throughout the day when I'm out of the house I am absolutely fine. I don't know if it is an allergy or something more serious, I visited the nurse about it at my institution and she said it looked inflamed like maybe a throat infection. I am a healthy weight and fit and do not have any history of diabetes in the family so I am unsure what I should do or what you people think it is, It seems to be better than from a few days ago and I have not experienced excessive thirst or excessive urination or anything of the sorts",
