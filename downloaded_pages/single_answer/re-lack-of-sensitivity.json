During the last six monthsI have noticed a dramatic decline in the ability to feel an orgasm.I have no problem getting or maintaining an erection, but there is nosensation associated with orgasmic release. My sex drive has also allbut disappeared. It seems as if my genital are is becoming totally de-sensitized. It is causing a problem for me and my wife and any informationyou could give would be extremely appreciated.Ray, I think you need to see your doctor and be checked for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Myhusband has diabetes and his problem started this same way.\u00a0\u00a0The feelingisn't there because of nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0The more damage that occurs, the lessfeeling there is.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure that there are other things that can cause thenerve damage but I know for a fact that diabetes does.\u00a0\u00a0Been there, done that!!!Also, don't wait too long because if something can be done to help stop the progressionof nerve damage, you want to stop it.\u00a0\u00a0My husbands has progressed beyond the nerve damageand he is unable to have an erection at all.\u00a0\u00a0Urologist have tried meds, shots etc. but nothinghas helped him now so be sure to have it checked out before it is too late.",
