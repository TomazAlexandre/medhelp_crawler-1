    "question": "hi, my 6 year old daughter had a UTI and when her urine was dipped, she had blood, nitrates etc (explains the UTI) and high 3+++ glucose.\u00a0\u00a0a finger ***** test was done this was 7.8 and then a fasting glucose test which was normal.\u00a0\u00a0at this point she was under her Gp.\u00a0\u00a0one week later she passed out and as we were worried we took her to the A and E.\u00a0\u00a0here they decided that the fainting was due to being overtired and a little under the weather, but they did find out that although the UTI had cleared she still has high levels of glucose, Lucocytes and a trace of keotones.\u00a0\u00a0She has had lots of blood taken for analizing and we await the results.\u00a0\u00a0We have been given urine sticks to dip her urine daily and record what we find and are to go back to the hospital in 14 days?\u00a0\u00a0I am quite concerned, my daughter drinks alot, is really tired, wee's alot and wets the bed most nights at least once if not twice and is eating as if theres no tomorrow altough she is quite slender and has always eaten erraticaly before! Any thoughts?",
