            "answer": "Hi lily, my son was IUGR, and I had Pre-E, and HELLP syndrome with him, he was born at 32 weeks due to this. I have several medical issues as well, and at the time I was also morbidly obese which didn't help anything. When I found out I was pregnant with my daughter 15 months after he was born I was frightened, but I started out by going to my OBGYN confirmed the pregnancy, and was monitored extremely closely the whole pregnancy, I never had to go to any specialist, this pregnancy I had no issues during it that is!\u00a0\u00a0My daughter was born at 38 weeks, which is considered term, she was small though, apparently I have issues forming my placenta properly, and she also was Comms positive, which has to do with my husband and my blood type conflicting.\u00a0\u00a0The Comms (which I hope I am spelling right as it has been almost 3 yrs now, and I haven't thought about it in so long lol) I would have no way of knowing about while pregnant anyways.\u00a0\u00a0Long story short from my personal history, and on my opinion you shouldn't have to see a specialist unless your OBGYN tells you so they will definitely send you if there is a need, and it should save you the medical bills as well.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know if you are pregnant and have no insurance you can qualify for free health insurance, I believe it is medicaid that I was on till my husband left for boot camp.\u00a0\u00a0I lived in New York at the time just for reference of state.",
