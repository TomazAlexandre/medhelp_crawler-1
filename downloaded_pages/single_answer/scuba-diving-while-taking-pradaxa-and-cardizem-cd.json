    "question": "I am a 55 year old male who was diagnosed with A-fib and had corrective operation July of 2011. The doctor put me on Pradaxa and Cardizem CD. I am also a type 2 diabetic on Levimer and Victosa. My diabetes doctor said it was ok to go diving but my heart doctor was not sure because of the medications. Can I still scuba dive while I am on those medications and or is there any restrictions I should be made aware of.Thank you",
