            "answer": "Hello,One of the possibilities for your symptoms is parasthesia which can occur due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not. The other possibility is of notalgia parasthetica. It is usually associated with paresthesia, pain or hyperpigmentation. I suggest you to consult a dermatologist and get a skin biopsy of the skin scrapings done to confirm the diagnosis.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "My back is burning and it has been for several years, doctors can't figure it out they attribute it to stress but I wake up with it and if you touch it it's burning up yet the skin color is the same and I'm not running a temperature. I have been tested at mayo clinic for everything, they couldn't even figure it out. The only thing that I can think of is that my diet is poor and I very rarely work out.Any insights?Thanks.",
