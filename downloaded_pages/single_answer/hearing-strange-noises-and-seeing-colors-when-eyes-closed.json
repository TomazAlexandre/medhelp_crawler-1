    "question": "This is really strange.\u00a0\u00a0A few years ago I had a huge amount of scar tissue removed in a surgery on right ear.\u00a0\u00a0My eardrum was healthy and I could hear until the healing process created more scar tissue.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of months ago I had same doctor clean debris out of that ear, and I have been able to hear a bit better.\u00a0\u00a0However, I get noises in my head coming mostly from the right side, it seems.\u00a0\u00a0Kind of whooshing sounds, not ringing in the ear.\u00a0\u00a0It is steady, goes down occasionally, but is always there.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had cataract surgery on both eyes this past year.\u00a0\u00a0I notice that when I lie down for a nap with eyes closed, I almost drift off and suddenly I am awakened by color best described as a sheet of color while my eyes are closed.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it is all green, sometimes all red.\u00a0\u00a0Between the ear and the colors, I am feeling like I might have a stroke.\u00a0\u00a0I need to see my doc, but I can't since it is 200 miles away and I can't afford to travel at this time (I live on So. Oregon Coast).\u00a0\u00a0This all worries me.\u00a0\u00a0What kind of doc to see?\u00a0\u00a0Primary care?\u00a0\u00a0He will refer me to somewhere, what kind of specialist would I see?\u00a0\u00a0I also started insulin for diabetes two months ago.",
