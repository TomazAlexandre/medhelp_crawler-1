            "answer": "Hello,A common possible cause of frequent urination with associated presence of protein in urine is diabetes. Other then the UTI which was ruled out this would be my second port of call. Do you other associated symptoms of diabetes such as: frequent urination, increased thirst (even though you are drinking a average amount), increased appetite, fatigue and loss of sensation at feet and fingers. Other possible predisposing factors: diet high in sugers, family history and a sedentry lifestyle.To test for the presence of diabetes you should undergo a glucose fasting test which can be done by your local GP.RegardsDr Foot",

    "question": "Hey everyone!Maybe someone can help me. About a month ago, I went to the doctors for what I thought was a UTI. They never called with the urine analysis results, but gave me medication for 10 days. I took it: didn't help. The symptom of constant urge to urinate, only resulting barely a trickle continued for about a month, when FINALLY I just could not take it anymore. I scheduled another appointment.I find out at the doctors that I didn't have a UTI when I went a month ago, and still don't have one! WHAT THE HECK!! However, I have protein in my urine. Huh?? So tomorrow I'm getting a metabolic blood test--whatever that means--to check for whatever those tests check for. Does anyone have any ideas as to what is wrong with me? I'm a highschool senior and sitting in class feeling like I have to pee makes it really hard to concentrate and I'm in AP classes. Please Please Please help! Thanks a bunch!~ohdear91",
