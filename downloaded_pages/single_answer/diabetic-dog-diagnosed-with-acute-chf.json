            "answer": "I am sorry to read of you and your dog's suffering.I do not know what a \"Min Pin\" is.\u00a0\u00a0What is the normal life expectancy for that breed.\u00a0\u00a0Some breeds don't make it to 10 years... usually larger breeds, but I suspect not limited to only large dogs.The combination doesn't sound like they are related, cause/effect, but understand they can both be active and their effects are additive to suffering.I do not know anything specific about CHF in dogs, but in humans it shows up as shortness of breath and general fatigue - there is nothing that can be done to reverse but it is possible to stow down the progress of CHF.Regardless of the breed life expectancy I think we all have to consider the quality of life, when it seems to us that the dog is suffering most of all of its time, putting the dog \"down\" needs to be considered.\u00a0\u00a0I'd consult the vet on such matters.\u00a0\u00a0Even us humans have to take such into consideration when we consider the extent of our treatment when life is ending.\u00a0\u00a0 Here we limit the treatment, in a dog we can take action to end the life.",

    "question": "I have been trying to research, but I can't find much info that answers about CHF for my dog WITH diabetes. I have a 9 yo min pin that has had diabetes for 3 years. She started hacking badly about 2 months ago. I researched it and it sounded like CHF. She mostly hacks at night (or while resting) and it's not a little cough but sounds more like a cat hacking up a hair ball (min pins have very little hair!) I took her to the vet and they insisted she had an infection because when they \"squeezed' her throat she coughed (which she did all the time, and if I squeeze your throat you'd cough!) ANYWAY! I asked my my male min pin didn't have the hack then, and they said he would develop it (which he didn't) after the $200, I took her home and gave her the antibiotics. A month later I decided I should spend more money, so I called the vet back and let them know she was still hacking. They did an Xray and saw she has severe CHF. NOW, to the questions, sorry, you needed some back story :) I have been giving her 2.5mg of Enalapril for 3 days and have noticed zero difference. The vet wasn't sure if she would ever improve at all because it's so bad, but we are VERY limited on what we can give her because of her diabetes. Does anyone know how long it takes for these meds to help? Or is it getting close to time to tell my furbaby good bye? I appreciate any help you can give, it's been so hard to find anything that talks about CHF AND diabetes together!",
