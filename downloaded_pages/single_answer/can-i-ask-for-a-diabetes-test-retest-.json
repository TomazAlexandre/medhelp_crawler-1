    "question": "Barely passed the first one (as in my sugars were 132 and cut off for passing was 135) i brought up a few new symptoms to my dr yesterday and was told hypoglycemia sounded like the culprit. But i am now noticing more symptoms of gd such as increased thirst (im up every 20 minutes at night drinking at least 16 oz of water) increased urination (due to drinking so much) and headaches that have no culprit behind them but come on after i eat. I started trying to eat something high protein every 2 hours but have noticed my headaches are worse right after eating. I am shakey before eating but after eating i have a headache..Can i ask them to repeat the test? I dont feel right and i hate feeling this way (sleepy headaches shakey thirsty all the time etc)",
