            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, if you have so many clots then new clots may develop. In most cases the origin of the blood clot cannot be traced. However, history of heart disease, diabetes, thyroid disorders, increased cholesterol, recent surgery, clotting disorders, and deep vein thrombosis increase the possibility of thrombus or clot formation. You need a comprehensive investigation considering all these points.Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
