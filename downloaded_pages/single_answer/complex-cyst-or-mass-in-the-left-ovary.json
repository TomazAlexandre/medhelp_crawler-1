            "answer": "Early in 2005 I went to see a gastroenterologist for stomach problems, constipation and acid reflux.\u00a0\u00a0I already took the rx protronix for the acid reflux and the problem was stable till early 2005. He ordered an endoscopy and an empty stomach scan.\u00a0\u00a0The endoscopy confirmed I had acid reflux so he just changed my meds to nexuim 2x per day and added zelnorm for the constipation.\u00a0\u00a0The empty stomach scan came back as abnormal. There was no explanation for this abnormal result which is usually seen in patients undergoing chemotherapy or dx with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He prescribed reglan which has helped my condition somewhat.Recently, I went to my gyn for irregular cycles that I had had for many months now.\u00a0\u00a0I delivered a baby by c-section 5/04 and I had thought by this time that they would return to normal. He ordered horomone blood work and a pelvic-tv u/s. The horomone prolactin was elevated so he referred me to an endocronologist.\u00a0\u00a0This doctor said it was probably due to the med reglan.\u00a0\u00a0She ordered a fasting prolactin test to confirm which I did and it did come back with normal limits.\u00a0\u00a0She also wanted a copy of my ultrasound and now wants to do a hysteroscopy as a result of that report.\u00a0\u00a0My gyn called and said that he only wants to repeat the u/s in 6 weeks to see if my complex cyst grows to the size of a grapefruit. The results of the u/s are simple cyst on left ovary 3.3 x 2.3 x 2.7 cm, possible hydrosalpinx on the right, multiple follicles on the right ovary, complex nabothian cyst 12 x 9 x 20 mm, fluid in the endometrial canal.I am concerned.\u00a0\u00a0All that I have read leads me to question of ovarian cancer, a/k/a silent killer and some people also have the same stomach complaints as I have had. I need peace of mind.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know your comment on my situation.\u00a0\u00a0I am 42 with an infant and two older children.",
