    "question": "So I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes even though I am boarder line not official on my tests they are having me basically do everything you do if you have it (to be honest it isn't much different than my every day lif!) Anyways before I was diagnosed with it I wasn't scheduled to have any more ultrasounds after 20 weeks because our baby is healthy and there really wasnt a need for it (which is awesome but I want to see him!) Now I am 35 weeks and I finally get to see him again this afternoon!\u00a0\u00a0Yay! Good things always come out of bad if you are positive! I am scheduled for a c-section in 16 days(yes 3 weeks early due to former surgery) so I am also so close to actually holding him!\u00a0\u00a0Anyways I hope all my fellow preggos are having a great day!",
