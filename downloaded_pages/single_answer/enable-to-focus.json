            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!There is a possibility that you need to get your eye examined for a change in power, addition of a new refractive error like myopia etc, or any other eye problem. Well smoking, high far sightedness, retinitis pigmentosa, air pollution, heavy alcohol consumption, squint,\u00a0\u00a0and glaucoma should also be looked into apart from diabetes. Please discuss this with your ophthalmologist. This is beyond the expertise level of an optometrist.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have had migraines w/ aura since I was a child. I also have contacts for astigmatism. Over the past 6+ months I have had a harder time focusing. I am under stress which I know can effect my migraines and focus. I know it's 'normal' for someone who gets migraines w/ aura to see lights, voids, and things move around 20 mins before the migraine starts. However, I'm experiencing these symptoms daily and they last a lot longer than 20 mins as well as vertigo, fatigue, and pain around my eyes. I have also had headaches that last days, even weeks. I've been doing research but I'm coming up empty.",
