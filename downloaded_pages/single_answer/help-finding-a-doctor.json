    "question": "I have seen 2 different endo's which offered me no help with my problem. They both told be that my antibody levels are impressive & they suggest that something is going on, but my other blood tests are within the normal range, so they cannot treat me. I have been told by some people on the boards that based on my test results, I should see a thyroid specialist because some endo's only \"touch\" on thyroid disease and mainly specialize in diabetes. I live in NM & was wondering if anyone of you on the boards could help me find someone who is going to know how to treat me! This up & down rollercoaster I've been on for the last several months is getting real old.Thank you in advance for your help!",
