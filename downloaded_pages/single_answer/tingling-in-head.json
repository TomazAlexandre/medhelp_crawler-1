            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Tingling in head is seen in peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes. It is also seen in peripheral vascular disease. Since you recently had dengue fever, there is a possibility of mild hemorrhage in brain or spinal cord or from a major vessel like carotid artery.Compression of cervical spinal nerves too can cause it. It can also be due to cold and sinusitis. In all probability it is cervical nerve compression. Without examining you it is difficult to access the situation. Please do not ignore it. Get a neurological consultation ASAP\u2014maybe from ER, to rule out any hemorrhage in brain (however minor it may be).Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
