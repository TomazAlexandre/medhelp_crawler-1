            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Your symptoms could also be due to peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or vitamin B12 deficiency. Please consult your doctor about these.Another possibility is peripheral arterial disease (PAD) which can cause numbness and pain in extremities.MS does not seem a likely cause as of now as the more common causes need to be ruled out first.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "My left foot and the outer side of my left leg have been feeling numb or have a loss of sensation. It used to be happening at night, but now, it is constant. There are times when the toes feel an achy pain as well. My father died from complications due to MS and this is a real concern. Doctor did xrays looking for compressed nerve as cause, but this is not the case. Could it be MS? What should I do?",
