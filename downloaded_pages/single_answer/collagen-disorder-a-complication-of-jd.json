    "question": "I have been chronically injured several times - almost the entire time I've been a juvenile diabetic I have been in pain from a major injury.\u00a0\u00a0After second major injury - a dislocation of shoulder involving 3 years of intense physical therapy and disability - I returned to working full-time and found that an unsightly disfigurement of palms of hands was developing that is caused by abnormal collagen regulation and associated with chroinic injury and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any information about Dupuytren's or collagen disorders -- how it is connected with diabetes or how to counteract the collagen disorder?\u00a0\u00a0I also have a problem with a contiguous head injury where collagen/cartilege has disappeared at the injury site (sinus opening) and mouth.\u00a0\u00a0This is not considered Dupuytren's but obviously is related don't you think?\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone share info or resources?",
