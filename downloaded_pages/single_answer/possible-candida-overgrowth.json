            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Well, a systemic fungal infection can cause the symptoms reported by you and should be looked into. The other possibilities are Vitamin D and Vit B12 deficiency.Testicular pain and ejaculatory dysfunction can be due to pudendal nerve entrapment. Maybe you can discuss this with your urologist or even a neurologist can help you out with this.Diabetes, hypothyroidism and disorders of parathyroid gland should also be looked into. The stool should be tested for occult blood.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have had an array of symptoms since march of this year. I have had horrible testicular pain and sexual dysfunction that has been present for 6 months and common disorders ( Torsion, Epididymitis, and hernia) have been ruled out. I have also had constant headaches/ dizzyness that began while I was weightlifting and taking protein supplement. Next i got an aching in my lower back that tends to be worse when sleeping in the morning. More recently I have developed a significant weakness especially in my hands and legs. I have also had a slight numbness in my feet. A slight defect has actually been found in my lower back but the doctors said it was not unusual and that it isnt pressing any disks etc. The lower back situation doesnt explain the headaches and hand weakness. I have also noticed that I have black specks in my stool now regardless of what I eat which hints at either internal bleeding or yeast die off. Could I have a Candida overgrowth and if so could it cause symptoms of this severity? Maybe more than one condition is involved.",
