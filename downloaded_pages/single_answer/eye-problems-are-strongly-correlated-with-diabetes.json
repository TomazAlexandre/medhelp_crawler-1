    "question": "Diabetes is the foremost reason of loss of sight in the United States. Fortunately, many eye problems correlated with diabetes are treatable if they are identified early. One of the most serious eye problems caused by diabetes is retinopathy. In this disease, fragile blood vessels grow in the back of the eye and can bleed easily. Such bleeding can cloud the vision and lead to permanent scarring of the back of the eye (the retina).Diabetes is the foremost reason of loss of sight in the United States. Fortunately, many eye problems correlated with diabetes are treatable if they are identified early. One of the most serious eye problems caused by diabetes is retinopathy. In this disease, fragile blood vessels grow in the back of the eye and can bleed easily. Such bleeding can cloud the vision and lead to permanent scarring of the back of the eye (the retina).People with diabetes also have the problem of cataracts (a perma\u00adnent clouding of the lens), \u201cfloaters\u201d that temporarily interfere with vision, and a swelling of the eye nerves that can cause permanent damage to your sight (mac\u00adular edema). Abnormal function of the nerves that control the eye muscles can result in a problem such as double vision. People who develop double vision should see an eye doctor as soon as possible to rule out other possible causes, such as a small stroke. Cataracts can be cor\u00adrected surgically. Laser therapy helps stop retinopathy or macular edema if it is performed before there is too much damage.A yearly eye examination by a doctor who special\u00adizes in diabetic eye disease is the best way to detect eye problems in the early stages. In addition, keeping your blood sugar near normal can help reduce your risk of eye disease.",
