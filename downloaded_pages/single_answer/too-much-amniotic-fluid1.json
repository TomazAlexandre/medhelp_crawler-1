    "question": "Hi ladies. Was measuring an AFI of 23.1 at 20 weeks. Dr. scheduled ultrasound in four weeks & said he wasn't going to worry yet, but if levels are still high he will send me to a specialist three hours away to remove fluid. Anyone ever have too much amniotic fluid? (btw, anatomy scan showed no congenitial defects so they don't know why fluid level is high. So fat no gestational diabetes either. Oh and I've been on weekly injections of progesterone since week 16). Thanks guys.",
