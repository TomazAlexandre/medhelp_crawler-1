            "answer": "Yes, first even with perfect health visual acuity, like strength, speed, hearing, decreases with time. At age 80 you will not see as good as you did at 40, just like you can't run as fast. Second at age 80 you have some degee of catarct, everyone does this also will keep you from seeing as good as you want. Look at it this way, if you went to ****'s Sporting Goods and bought a $150 pair or funning shoes it won't help you run as fast as you once did.I would accept that the glasses are the best your eyes can have and go to a MD Eye Physician Ophthalmologist to determine why you don't see as good as you wish.JCH III MD",
