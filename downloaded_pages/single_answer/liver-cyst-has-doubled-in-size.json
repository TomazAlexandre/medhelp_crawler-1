    "question": "I have lots of things going wrong lately. I had breast cancer 4 yrs. then an adrenal adenoma, then severe chronic diarhhea which is now called inflammatory bowel disease, then a fatty liver, ( i don't drink ) then pre-diabetes. About 15 years ago Dr found 5-7 angiomiolipomas in one kidney. A year or so ago I had ct scan abdomen and it only showed two tiny cysts. What happened to the 5-7 well encapsulated angiomiolipomas? I understand they don't go away. Could the early ultrasound be wrong or is the CT scan wrong. Vert frustrating. Then during follow up for breast cancer they found a liver cyst. Now four years later i had an abdominal ct scan for the bowel disease and they called me to say the cyst has doubled in size. What does that mean and how are they likely to fix it? I only have a small community hospital. Should I go to Boston for treatment?Thanks",
