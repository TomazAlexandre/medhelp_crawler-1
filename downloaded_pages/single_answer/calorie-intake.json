            "answer": "Since adipex is a weight loss drug, I would assume that you wanted to lose weight??Following is an excerpt that I copied regarding the use of adipex ----\"Adipex-P, an appetite suppressant, is prescribed for short-term use as part of an overall weight reduction program that also includes dieting, exercise, and counseling. The drug is for use only by excessively overweight individuals who have a condition\u2014such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol\u2014that could lead to serious medical problems.\"If you are losing faster than you want and are not feeling right, you should stop taking it and see your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Some people can have adverse effects from weight loss pills.\u00a0\u00a0And if you are \"forgetting\" to eat, the most likely your boyfriend is right that you are not getting the right food.\u00a0\u00a0You need a good balance of lean protein, low/no fat dairy, whole grains, fruits and veggies, \"good\" fats, etc.........My first suggestion, though is that you see your doctor.",
