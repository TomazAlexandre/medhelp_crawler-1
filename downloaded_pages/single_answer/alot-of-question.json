            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The therapy for temporal lobe cyst will depend on the size and the symptoms it is causing. The cysts on the ovaries could be due to Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, where in due to hormonal irregularities the person has symptoms of irregular menstruation, weight gain, insulin resistance (diabetes) and excess androgenic activity causing facial hair.\u00a0\u00a0But the good news is that with medication the anovulatory cycles can be made ovulatory (with eggs) and the periods will also be regularized. So, don't worry and discuss these options with your doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
