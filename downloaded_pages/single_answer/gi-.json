            "answer": "Hi!Your daughter suffers from chronic constipation and yes, it can be really painful at time due to trapped gas. Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber and also due to dehydration. A high roughage with low water too could be a cause.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes and hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc can all cause constipation. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. Too many tape worms or round worms forming a bolus or ball could also be the cause. It is important to run tests to find the cause. Do discuss this with your GI doctor and get her examined. Take care!",

    "question": "I have a fourteen year old daughter. Since the end of Feb. she has had constipation and pain on the left side. The doctor said she was completely back up. For the next 2 and\u00a0\u00a0half months we have been taking miralax and at magnesium citrate to clean her out.\u00a0\u00a0This has work some of the times but never last more than a few days before we were back up again.\u00a0\u00a0During this whole time the pain has never left her lower abdominal pain. On a scale from 1-10 (1 being zero pain and 10 being the worst pain you can imagine) she has been between 7 & 10. We have been to the doctors once a week with the same problem and got the same diagnoises: constipation. Plus the ER once they said the same thing. We got into the GI specialist in May with the same problems except the pain is on lower admonial but now its on the lower to middle on the left side. She now takes miralax, senna, and dicyclomine twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0To clean her completely out she take magnesium citrate. The first time we did two bottles in a day and half. We for an xray which showed she was still full. So. we did four bottles in two days. That work xray showed she was clear which only last for a fews days without constipation but the pain nevers leaves. We just had the upper and lower Gi which showed nothing except her spleen was pronounced. We are waiting for the biospys. She has missed school since this start. We go nowhere. She goes from the bed to the couch or doctors. Her sleep is off, she is nausea, and has headaches. The thing that plays a part in this is she doesn't run fevers. Never she and she used to have UTIs, pneumonia, flu, but never ran a fever. Please help us.",
