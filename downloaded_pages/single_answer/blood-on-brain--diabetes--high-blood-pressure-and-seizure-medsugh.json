            "answer": "Hi!Yes, this is a tough situation. Anti-seizure medications usually help control diabetes, not aggravate it. I am not sure what medications your husband is on, nor can suggest a change on net. You can talk to his treating doctor in Vegas and describe his blood sugar reports and BP records and ask their advice. Maybe they can fax across all his reports to your neurologist in home town. Meanwhile consult a diabetes specialist and try controlling his sugar.\u00a0\u00a0 Take care!",
