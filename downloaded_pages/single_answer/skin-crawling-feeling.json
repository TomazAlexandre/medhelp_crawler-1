    "question": "Hi, I've been having this crawling feeling on my skin, all over, but usually comes with pain between my shoulders. It often happens at the same time when I feel sick and/or nauseous. I also have type 1 diabetes, which went undiagnosed for couple of years.I suspect it may have something to do with nuropathy. Please let me know if anyone suffers the same sensation.",
