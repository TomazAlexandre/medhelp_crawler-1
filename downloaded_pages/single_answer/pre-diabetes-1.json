            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Yes, your doctor is right. The fluctuations in the blood sugar could be related to the calories you have taken and to the type of food that went in. You should consult a nutrition expert and plan out the diet depending on what you can tolerate and what you cannot. Just taking protein shakes may not help. Chicken broth, and white of egg make good protein options, but may not help if you cannot tolerate them. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I am 36. My mom has diabetes. A few weeks ago I wasn't feeling right -- I was very hot and dizzy. I took my blood sugar and it was 65. After oj it came up to 88.\u00a0\u00a0I requested my dr check my a1c and it came back as 5.7%.\u00a0\u00a0In jan it had been 5.6%.\u00a0\u00a0The dr today said she is not concerned-- it's just something to watch .\u00a0\u00a0I can't exercise due to severe physical disabilities. I also am tube fed but due to Gi issues I on most days get one can in ( tasked 3 hours) and eat a little by mouth.\u00a0\u00a0The dr. thinks perhaps it's too little food and when I do eat it spikes then drops. My fasting bs I've taken have ranged from 104 to 110. She suggested trying to eat more protein foods when I do eat little orally. What are some good protein foods?",
