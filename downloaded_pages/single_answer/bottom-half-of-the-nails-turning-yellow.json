    "question": "lately i've been noticing that as i'm removing nail polish, filing and repainting my nails, the bottom half of them are turning a yellowish color. they don't hurt or feel any different and nothing in my diet has changed. i read online that it could be a symptom of number of diseases or malnutrition, but i'm pretty sure i don't fit into any of those categories, and i don't smoke so i can't blame it on that. any ideas on how to turn them basck to their normal color?thanks in advance.",
