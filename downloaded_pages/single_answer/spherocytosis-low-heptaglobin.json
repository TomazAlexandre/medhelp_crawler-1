            "answer": "I know doctors don't want to remove an organ if its not absolutely necessary.\u00a0\u00a0I also have family members that have delt with medical problems that I am just starting to see.\u00a0\u00a0Eventhough, i'm predisposed to getting Diabetes because of genes, I still have not gotten it.\u00a0\u00a0That doesn't mean I won't.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like they won't do anything until it breaks completely.\u00a0\u00a0you know somethings not right, way before the test show it. It makes since to spare you the pain once the test show that you're going down the same road as your relatives.\u00a0\u00a0Some Dr.'s are good at making these decisions based on Quality of life issues.\u00a0\u00a0In their mind, you don't take it out until its broken.\u00a0\u00a0In my mind, once its broken it is too late.\u00a0\u00a0Why not prevent future damage to other vulnerable organs and make life more comfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I guess there is a financial motivation to strech it out as long as possible. (Not that all Dr.'s do this, but it is possible) (It's kind of like job security)\u00a0\u00a0I really do believe that most Dr.'s really want to help and make things better.\u00a0\u00a0There are complications when removing organs and things don't always work out the way they are supposed to.",
