            "answer": "Hello,Since you were having erections earlier, you may be having erectile dysfunction which is psychological in nature. Causes may be psychological, smoking, alcohol, illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord and neurological causes. In your case it looks more psychological.Also since you are having testicular pain, infection of the epididymis causing epididymitis should be ruled out.I hope it helps. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
