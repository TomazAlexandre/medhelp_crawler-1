    "question": "My mom (62) was diagnosed with Diabetes 4 months ago. Doctor started her on usual course of medicines including metformin. However in the last 2-3 months she lost sense of taste and has not been able to eat anything and is losing weight rapidly. Doctors are unable to pin point loss of taste to any reason, but suspect metformin as the issue. We need to solve this at the earliest as my mom is unable to eat & is losing weight. Can anyone kindly help me on this?",
