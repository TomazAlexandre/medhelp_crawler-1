            "answer": "Hi there!It seems like your condition cannot be diagnosed that easily due to its complexity. I would just like to give my thoughts regarding what could be possibly happening.I noticed that you had psoriasis and fibromyalgia which are autoimmune disorders.\u00a0\u00a0Having said this, I would be inclined to think that what is happening in your eye maybe another condition pertaining to your immune system, a condition called myasthenia gravis.\u00a0\u00a0This condition causes one muscle weakness on repeated use of the muscle.\u00a0\u00a0The pins and needles sensation can be due to neuropathy brought about by diabetes.I suggest you make an appointment with a neurologist to evaluate this completely.\u00a0\u00a0Multiple sclerosis is also possible though it needs to be proven through imaging studies.\u00a0\u00a0Your neurologist can help you with these.Well, I hope these thoughts help.\u00a0\u00a0Be strong and don't give up.\u00a0\u00a0Regards...",

    "question": "Four months ago, after going thru a difficult year with added stressors, I experienced a sensation of pins & needles beginning first in my left fingers, traveling up the arm across the shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, I felt a pressure on my chest.\u00a0\u00a0This scared me to the point that I lied down on the floor because I felt I was going to possilble have something result that might cause me to fall to the floor.\u00a0\u00a0This lasted probably less than one minute.\u00a0\u00a0Afterwards, I was scared but also, my arm was heavy & exhausted.This repeated itself probably less than 12 times in the next two months but growing to the point of affecting both hands and fingers.\u00a0\u00a0Pins & needles sensations traveled up both arms and across the shoulders and going up past my neck and through out my head and almost feeling like it exited thru the top of my head.\u00a0\u00a0I lied on the floor, scared & feeling drained in those parts of my body.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually these feelings caught me while shopping and I was unable to lie down.\u00a0\u00a0I would lean on a shopping cart and let it run it's course and feeling somewhat drained of energy at the end of probably no longer than a minute.My doctor had me do a thallium stress test which revealed a possible clogged artery.\u00a0\u00a0A angiogram was performed and it was good...no clogged arteries.I seem to tire easily now but have had no more of these sensations for a month or more.\u00a0\u00a0However, my son noticed my left eyelid appeared to be drooping at two different times.\u00a0\u00a0The second time, he noticed another change whereas underneath the same eye, it appeared more puffy and whitish.Today another son, noticed the drooping of the same eye again.My doctor recently took me off glipizide a couple of weeks ago and is tapering me off of cymbalta.I also and have for a few years now, had osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, fibromyalgia, psoriasis & sleep apnea.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 59 year old female recently diagnosed with type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on lyrica for a few years because of osteoarthritis inflammation that pushed on the nerves in my feet in varying places causing pain.\u00a0\u00a0In 2004 and again in 2006, I experienced sensations in one and then the other side of my neck, as a precursor before developing Bell's Palsy on each side of my face approimately 5 to 6 days later. Do you think this could be an indicator of Multiple Sclerosis or another disease?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
