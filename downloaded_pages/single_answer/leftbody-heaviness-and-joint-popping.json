            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Since you have a bad ache in your neck and heaviness on the same side of body, it could be a pinched nerve in the upper neck. You do mention MRI and CT, but did that include the neck region? If yes, the other possibilities are fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, electrolyte disturbance, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or Lyme or lupus. For a doctor in your area ask your pharmacist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
