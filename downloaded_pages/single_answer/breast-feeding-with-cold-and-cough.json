            "answer": "Since she is breastfeeding there isn't a whole lot she can take tylonal and motrin. I do believe that sudafed is safe to take. It has to be the one that pharmacists keep behind the counter that ya have to sign for. I also think that plain robitussin is ok. im not sure how any of these would affect her diabetes your best option is to contact a pharmacist since the doc is unreachable.",
