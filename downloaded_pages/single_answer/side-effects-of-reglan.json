    "question": "My husband takes reglan for gastropareses brought on by diabetes. I am aware that a new warning has been issued for it. He was thought to be one of the patients the good out weighed any bad.\u00a0\u00a0My question is this, he can barely keep his open sometimes. He does not realize he is doing this...he's not sleepy, his eyes just shut for 5-10 seconds at a time.\u00a0\u00a0You would think he was on something else, but he isn't. Has anyone else experienced this...Thanks!",
