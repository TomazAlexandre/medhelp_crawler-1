    "question": "Im 21, male, straight.When i was 16 (5 years ago) i had sex for the first time with a girl a knew and had a friendship with. I knew her ex boyfriend who she was with for 2 years previously. They were both happy and showed no signs whatsoever.Anyway, recently i found how she was abused as a child. Then it was national aids day and i was reading some information online about symptoms, and started to back track. Now im worried sick. I still know the girl and she is happy and in another long term relationship with a decent job etc, nothing to show she is suffering from HIV.I dont have a clue, where my anixety as come from, this is the only sexual encounter ive had which was unprotected. With the girl and somehow ive manged to convince myself that she might have HIV.Also, couple of days back. The girls ex-boyfriends new girlfriend was rushed to hospital as she fell very ill, she was in hospital for a few days and they said she had diabetes hes been with her since she was 18. Which got me even more panicked.Can somebody give me a piece of mind here to put my mind at rest?Thanks alot guysJake",
