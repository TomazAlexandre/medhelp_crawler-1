            "answer": "I had my gallbladder removed last year. You do need to watch what you eat. Eggs can be very bad for you. Also red meat. If you are still in alot of pain you need to have your pancreas checked out, mine was damaged due to the Gallbladder being bad for so long and I do not drink. you can also still have stones in their somewhere. scar tissue maybe a factor but not likely.\u00a0\u00a0Regular soda can even hurt you.Eating is a huge factor. I'm not rich or even near it but we make due.I hope this helps you out alittle. If you have anymore questions you can email me at ***@****",

    "question": "I have a lab in 3 1/2 hours and I cannot sleep due to crying over pain in my lower back where my gallbladder used to be.I have had this pain since my gallbladder was removed 3 years ago.This is the most severe it has been since the removal. I have been up crying for hours, and cannot take any thing for the pain since I have labs to check my cholesterol in the morning.When my gallbladder was removed the doctor did tell me that stones could form in the duct again. But no one gave me information on what I should or should not eat.I told my family doctor about the pain and he poo poo'd me telling me it was more then likely simple scar tissue that I was fine.I am not making excuses for our poor eating, but this is the truth and I am seeking advice on how to fix this.We eat a lot of hamburger etc. because quite frankly we cannot afford to buy fresh fruits and vegetables and are not able to grow them where we live now.I am purchasing organic farm fresh eggs now, so that is a good thing.Please would someone advise me as to what is good to eat and what is not good to eat.Also I wish to add that my body seems to react quite differently then most I have read about on these forums.Before my gallbladder surgery the doctor asked me some questions and I have learned my answers are quite odd.I have never had heartburn in my life.I have always had loose bowel movements all of my life.Never had a pain in my stomach with the gallbladder only in my right lower back and right shoulder.Even since the removal of the gallbladder I have yet to have heartburn, or what people consider a normal bowel movement mine are still loose which has always been normal for me.I have even been checked for Diabetes (sp?) because corn, potatoes, bread, pasta etc. cause me to swell up with in 20 mins of eating them and gives me diarrhea about 20 mins later as well. (Even though I todl the doctor I did not have this) Glad to say I do not have Diabetes - could this be ab alergy due to the gallbladder attack before removal?Sorry for the long post but I was researching trying to find an answer to what is going on when I found this site and would appreciate advise.I am also over weight due to working on the internet and computers and getting very little exercise.I do think my lifestyle needs to be changed dramatically.Thank YouRoselle",
