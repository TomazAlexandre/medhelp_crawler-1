    "question": "my question is that my husband is in his 40's and the last few weeks he has been sounding like a teenage boy again. I was wanting to know what could be wrong with him? What I can tell you is that he does have type 2\u00a0\u00a0diabetes, he's a smoker and that he works outside a lot. Should we go seek help from a doctor or just wait and see if it gets better?",
