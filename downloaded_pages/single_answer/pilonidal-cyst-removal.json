            "answer": "Hi!Well, I am sorry to hear about this. To me it looks like as though a pilonidal sinus has developed which is a common complication of cyst removal. Pilonidal cyst and sinus are almost the same. A sinus is always there and if its outer mouth is open, it keeps draining fluid and hence presents as a sinus. If the outer mouth is closed, then a cyst forms. Both begin with a hair invading the skin layers through a dilated hair follicle, thus forming a sinus tract. You probably know by now that Pilonidal sinuses are known for their recurrence. It is necessary to keep the area free of hair and infection. Laser pilation of hair in adjoining area is also necessary along with the surgery to close the sinus. If your son is a smoker, he needs to stop smoking to facilitate healing. Also check if he has diabetes. This could be the cause for low grade infection resulting in recurrence. Also, if there is a drainage and it is foul smelling, it should be cultured and a sensitivity test run to see what is causing the infection and the antibiotic that will be effective. Do discuss this with your son\u2019s doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "My 16 year old son had his pilonidal cyst removed in June of 2012. The site still has not healed!! We keep going to have it packed and see the surgeon every 1-2 month. The surgeon and wound care people are not concerned. We say the surgeon on jan 3, 2013 and he says it looks great. Should it really take this long? Sometimes it looks like we are making progress and then a pocket of drainage opens again and the 2 holes are bigger again.. It smells too!!\u00a0\u00a0I am at the point were I am starting to lose trust in the surgeon!",
