    "question": "Hi ladies, I'm 17 weeks pregnant and I have an early gloucouse test this week as my mother had it when she was pregnant. Lately I have been so so thirsty but only for water and so sleepy, (TMI) and no matter how much water I drink (sometimes it is nearly 3 litres a day) my urine is still quite yellow. I know that's normal in pregnancy but could this be a sign of gestational diabetes?Thank you.",
