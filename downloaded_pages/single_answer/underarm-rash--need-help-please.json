            "answer": "Hi,This could be folliculitis, dermatitis, or allergic reaction. In most individuals there are outbreaks of folliculitis from time to time.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Patients with chronic unresponsive folliculitis may require investigation into the source of the infection. S. aureus bacteria can live in the patient's nostrils, periodically triggering a folliculitis outbreak.Individuals who are predisposed to folliculitis should be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months.If there any of the mentioned medical causes then treating those will reduce the occurence of the condition.http://www.dermatologychannel.net/follicle/folliculitis.shtmlSome stubborn cases of folliculitis have been responsive to laser-assisted hair removal. This process uses a laser to destroy the follicle. This reduces the scarring that results from folliculitis.Let us know if you need any other information and consult a skin specialist if the lesion is persistent.Regards.",

    "question": "Hi ive had an underarm rash for about 2 years now, i have been to the doctor several times and they have precribed me various 1% cream such as limisil. The rash went away for a while (a few months maybe), but recently has come back as bad as it was before! the symptoms are:red irritated skin (sometimes its not red, but the skin goes scaly and is clearly not normal);it stinks of B.O. badly, especially when doing exercise,itches a lot and gets easily aggrivated from tight clothing,and it has small spots around the infected area that look like small bumps.I would really like help with this though as it interferes a lot with the type of sport i do as the skin rubs against skin, and when this happens it makes it especially bad! :(Its only under my left armpit and hasnt spread anywhere else on my body, but i have been reading some other forum posts and i think it may have originally come from using deoderant (i have stopped using deoderant under that armpit now). It definately gets bad in more humid climates as well.I have been treating it by washing it thoroughly in the shower and then applying antibacterial soap by hand, i then wash it again and use a hair-dryer to dry it (to stop any more physical contact with the infected area). I have been treating it like this because the cream that my doctor prescribed to me recently didnt help and in fact made the infection worse!!Thanks a lot and i would be very grateful for any help you can offer. :)",
