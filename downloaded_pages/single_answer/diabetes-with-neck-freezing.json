            "answer": "Curiosly, diabetes can cause a problem with cervical pain, resulting in limitation of range of motion. The reason is osmoloysis. The etiology is as follows: With high glucose levels the cellular structures around the nerve sheaths leading between the vertebrae swell, impinging on the nerves. Usually there is a diagnosis of spinal stenosis to go along with this. keeping well-hydrated and glucose levels under control will help resolve the problem. Thus, some diabetics maintain that an injection of Novalog will reduce neck pain. They are not experiencing a psychiatric episode. Providing their is not significant arthritic deterioration range of motion exercsies through the limits of pain (consult your physician) and axial traction for several minutes several times a day may help. Do not take muscle relaxants or wear a cervical collar. This will result in loss of muscle tone and exacerbate the discomfort.",
