            "answer": "Hey Jim!\u00a0\u00a0It actually advisable for type 2's to go low, low carb.\u00a0\u00a0I avoid medication by living a Paleo dietary lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0I did so because my blood glucose had crept into T2 territory after years of dancing with the devil, \"high fructose corn syrup\". That and the near constant M&M drip line that sat on my office desk all day.The first couple of weeks are literal pain.\u00a0\u00a0There is definitely a carb withdrawal period.\u00a0\u00a0I had crushing headaches, and peed like heck as my body began to wring out every gram of readily available carb it was storing.\u00a0\u00a0I'd get the shaky legs, but a test prick showed BG levels around 100 to 120.\u00a0\u00a0My body had grown use to the available sugar levels!\u00a0\u00a0I pushed through the shaky legs, and going to the bathroom every hafl hour, and by the third week, I felt pretty good.Then the weight began to fall off.\u00a0\u00a0Between the new diet and exercise, I lost 15% of my body weight, and 2 waist sizes.\u00a0\u00a0Rather than dealing with glycemic indicies of various foods, I adopted a simpler strategy.\u00a0\u00a0I avoing any food that was \"white\", and began to look at labels.\u00a0\u00a0This meant no pasta, rice, flour, potatoes, anything with sugar (and that's a lot!).\u00a0\u00a0In addition, I laid off peas, corn, bananas, raisins, and the like.I check my blood 4 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0Morning fast, before lunch, and before dinner, and before retiring.\u00a0\u00a0I hasten to add that this may not be the recommended test periods, but it works for me.\u00a0\u00a0GET YOURSELF A METER AND STRIPS!\u00a0\u00a0It's the single most important tool in judging how you're doing.\u00a0\u00a0Don't wait for your periodic doctor visit.\u00a0\u00a0The meter became my competition; how'd I do, what was it going to be this time?\u00a0\u00a0Was I going to beat the meter with a new low.As the weigh shed, so did the BG readings.\u00a0\u00a0My 6 month A1C tests plunged.\u00a0\u00a0My physician was dumbfounded.\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't overdo it\" he said.\u00a0\u00a0It was almost like he couldn't bear to see my beat his deadline before going on Metformin.I took and continue to take occasional ketone readings.\u00a0\u00a0After heavy exercise, power walking or skating, my urine will show some mild ketone readings.To supplant the candy, cakes, and miscellaneous carbs that were a good part of my diet, I chose nuts and seeds.\u00a0\u00a0I eat pounds and pounds of almonds, peanuts, walnuts, sunflower seeds, pastachios, cashews.\u00a0\u00a0I take a snack size baggie to work daily (two fist fulls) of nuts. I love them!\u00a0\u00a0Now....things that I really miss.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't had a plate of pasta and tomato gravy, baked or mashed potato, peas (I love peas and butter) mac and cheese, rice (brown or white) in nearly two years.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the only thing I allow myself daily are two slices of Pepperidge Farms \"Carb Style\" bread so I can eat a sandwich.\u00a0\u00a0It has 8 grams per slice of carbs.So there you have it. That's how I did it.\u00a0\u00a0I guess you could say I'm the low carb poster boy!\u00a0\u00a0This lifestyle works for me.\u00a0\u00a0Once you're on it, you really don't miss them.\u00a0\u00a0The things you can eat are amazing.\u00a0\u00a0In work, I live for \"Bacon Friday\" when breakfast entrees are weighed.\u00a0\u00a0A plate of bacon can be had for less than a buck. My wife and I love McDonalds on the weekend.\u00a0\u00a0We sit and chat and review the week's events, I have two round eggs, and a sausage patty on a plate.\u00a0\u00a0Net carbs....6 grams!\u00a0\u00a0You can easily do it.\u00a0\u00a0You just have to adapt a little.",
