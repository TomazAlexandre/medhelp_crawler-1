You do have some imbalance of your ovarian funcion. the most common syndrome is polycystic ovarian syndrome or PCO for short. This is associated with being overweight. It can be associated with diabetes. It is also associated with the development of cancer inside the uterus - endometrial cancer - if you do not get regular periods.The treatment includes:1- keeping the uterus safe by staying on the pill until you want to have a child2-losing weight3- many women also take regular diabetic medications such as metformintake care",

    "question": "I am 23 years old I never had any children and my period has always been irregular. I have went 2 years before without a period. I went to the doctor to find out why I wasn't having one. They checked my thyroids and diabetes everything was normal. I am overweight and I use to take birth control pills and that seems to be the only thing that keeps my period normal. They did a ultrasound of my ovaries about a year ago and didn't find anything abnormal. I was given some hormone pills from the health unit to take for 5 days. Two weeks later my period started it was normal but the next month and now 11 months later I still haven't had a period. Family and friends seem to think I may have ovarian cancer or pre-menopause. I don't really have the many signs of either. I know I should see a doctor but I really can't afford too. Please give me any advice if you have any. Thanks,Michelle",
