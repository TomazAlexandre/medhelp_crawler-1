            "answer": "Hello!I would suggest you to rule out conditions like anemia, local injury or diabetes.You would need scans on the present day (X-rays, MRI etc) to diagnose for any bony or soft tissue involvement of this chronic nagging pain.If anatomically you do not have any damage then by wearing proper shoes and some physical exercise it can be treated.Apply ice packs and take intermittent NSAIDs to relieve the pain.Take care!",

    "question": "I have had ankle pain for about 7 months now.\u00a0\u00a0It started as a sleight pain every now and then.\u00a0\u00a0It has increased to where I had trouble walking in the morning and then it would loosen up throughout the day then it would start to hurt later in the day to the point where i couldn't walk without a great deal of pain.\u00a0\u00a0I got a new pair of shoes and it has helped.\u00a0\u00a0I dont have the extreme pain that i did have in the morning and after a day at work but still have pain. The pain i have now is on my heel and on the outer part of my ankle.\u00a0\u00a0after being a work for a while my ankle stiffens up and i have trouble flexing it both up and down (toward the air and toward the ground.)\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas or anything would be helpful.",
