            "answer": "Hi,I actually was successfully using Humalog before they no longer have it available here.\u00a0\u00a0Are you sure the insulin is not expired or exposed to heat that would make it inactive.You need to go back to your doctor and ask your dr to intervene.\u00a0\u00a0This is not acceptable that you cannot get your numbers down.\u00a0\u00a0Insurance company maybe would consider your case with dr request.Please ask them if they have any alternative fast acting insulins that they cover.\u00a0\u00a0maybe there is a different one you can try.\u00a0\u00a0Now the critical part is to get your blood sugars down.",

    "question": "Hi everyone,I was a Type 2 and my pancreas had failed and no longer produces insulin. I no longer fit into a Type 2 community as very few are an insulin resistant former type 2s and that board is filled with newly diagnosed folks looking for answers about diabetes and no so much about the logistics of meds, dosages, etc.I use a Medtronic Mini Med paradigm insulin pump and right now am struggling mightily since going on Humalog about 5 weeks ago.I was achieving good results with Novolog but my insurance company at the time decided it no longer wanted to pay for a brand name and basically ordered me to switch to Humalog, a low cost generic. I can mark to the very day I switched on my downloaded numbers when all my glucose test numbers went up a 100 points along with greatly increased insulin boluses!...and will not go down. I had worked so terribly hard to get down to an A1C of 7.9 and now that's a memory. I am now testing in the low 200s consistently between 200 and 243. Which is high 9 to 10.I am 60 years old and have been diabetic for around 15 years so I have been there, done all the things type 2 people do until my pancreas decided not to wait and retired early.Has anyone else who may have been taking Novolog for some time switched to Humalog and had something similar happen?Thanks!Colleen",
