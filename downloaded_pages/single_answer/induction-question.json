    "question": "So I'm almost 37 weeks and today I had an ultrasound because I have gestational diabetes and my baby is measuring 2 weeks ahead. They think he's over 7 pounds. The doctor told me to talk to my doctor on Thursday about being induced. In your experiences how do your doctors feel about induction? I know all docs are different, but I'm just very anxious as to what my doctor will say.",
