            "answer": "First be sure you don't have diabetes as a cause of this. Undiagnosed or uncontroled diabetes can cause strange fluctionations of glasses and contacts. Your doctor can order a test called an A1c and rule diabetes out.The odds of you being able to continue to wear contacts are really small. Hormonal changes and dry eyes are related. Dry eyes are 4-5 times more common than men the same age after menopause.If you stop wearing your contacts your glasses prescription should not flucuate like the contact lens after they have not been worn for a couple weeks.I don't see anything baffling at all. In situations like this I just tell the patient that I don't think she can be fit with contacts that are clear, comfortable and stable.\u00a0\u00a090% of the time I'm right. I'm happy for the 10% that eventually finds a solution to stay with contacts.JCH III MD",

    "question": "I just turned 45 years old and had a hysterectomy in October 2005.\u00a0\u00a0By December of '05 my vision began changing.\u00a0\u00a0I was wearing monovision contacts and every couple of months I needed an adjustment because either my close or far vision would decline.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of months later the same thing happens.\u00a0\u00a0The next time I may revert back to the prescription of 4 months earlier.\u00a0\u00a0I can see clearly for a month to two months and then like turning a light switch it changes.\u00a0\u00a0In other words it floats back and forth between the same powers of lenses again and again. I have seen two different eye doctors can't seem to figure the problem.\u00a0\u00a0One says that as long as I am experiencing hormone flucuations that this will continue to happen.\u00a0\u00a0The other thought dry eye was the cause.\u00a0\u00a0I now wear bifocal contacts and the same thing happens every month or so.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors seem baffled and I am at my wits end because I still need to be able to see.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I am afraid to try glasses since my vision isn't stable and glasses can be rather expensive to change every month. Thank you for your help.",
