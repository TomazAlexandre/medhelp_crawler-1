Regarding the clinical condition you will have to discuss with his doctor The best way to keep diabetes under control is to Eat sensibly i.e. avoid fat to the lowest extent possible, do not use easily digested carbohydrate i.e. I mean conjees are easily digested while rice is not, refined atta is easily digested while wheat bought and ground is not refined atta, pizzas are refined flour while rotis made at home are not and so on.\u00a0\u00a0Include a whole lot of fruits and vegetables in your meal.\u00a0\u00a0A nutritionist should be able to give you a sample meal plan.\u00a0\u00a0Fat is taboo in any form, restrict usage to the least.\u00a0\u00a0Remember however that we are all humans and that moderation is the key to success. Indulgences in foods that you like in small quantities without actually gorging is recommended in order to keep the heat on. Regards.",
