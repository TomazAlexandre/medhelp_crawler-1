            "answer": "Hi.I am sorry to learn that you are suffering from these symptoms. I do hope your condition will resolve soon.It might be possible for the bulging discs to be associated with the pain and lower extremity symptoms you are experiencing. You should go ahead with the MRI and second opinion from the neurologist.It might also be advisable to talk to a counselor to help you deal with all the psychological stress that you are experiencing.Good luck.",

    "question": "Thankyou for responding to my letter.\u00a0\u00a0I had a nerological workup plus diabetes test and many blood tests. Diabetes test ok. neuropathy test not normal. Elevated liver ensymes, but not bad. I have metabolic syndrome, numbness tingling allover my body and i feel LIke my body is on fire. I mentioned in my last post that when I lay down shocks down spine, dizzy,nausha. Abnormal mri, but nothing that led to diagnosis. Very sensitive to light and sound. Bulging discs in lower spine and neck. Pain in the upper right side. Pain is now in the upper rib cage on both sides. I feel like I can't take a full breath. Most of the pain is in the upper back. If i breath hard or move my shoulders and ribs lockup with pain. My body feels like it's being destroyed but no diagnosis. I now have another neuro doc, just for second opinion. Mri squeduled but feel it will be to much damage to reverse if I even get a diagnosis. Can't walk on my heels and can't flex left foot. So tired that i can barely funtion. I have full time job and seriously ill huband. I'm the caretaker. I am barely functioning. it takes all my strength to get up and dress in the morning.. I'm not depressed but I am discouraged.I feel I'm losing this battle with whatever is wrong with me. I'm tired of tests. Also I have Vitamin c problems but pills and fruit don't seem to help..",
