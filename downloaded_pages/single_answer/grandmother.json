            "answer": "Hi!The ball like stools could be due to constipation. Either her bowel moves too slow resulting in all the water getting absorbed or it could be due to milk allergy or allergy to certain foods. Sometimes formula milk (dry re-constituent formulas etc) also cause ball like stools. In such cases increasing the water intake often helps. Chronic constipation can also be due to dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, and diverticular diseases. Please discuss these possibilities with her pediatrician. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
