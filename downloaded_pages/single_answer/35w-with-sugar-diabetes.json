I am sure that he or she will be happy to explain it to you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!Bridget",

    "question": "Hello, I'm 35w and in week 25 I found out I had sugar diabetes. At first I went on a diet but wasn't enough. For the last month I get insuline shots every day. Now my doctor decided to induce at 37w and gave me a cortizone shot. Sugar level went sky high. Baby is fine. Why do I have to get an induction that early?",
