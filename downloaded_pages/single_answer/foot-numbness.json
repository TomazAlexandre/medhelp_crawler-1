            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling?Pain, tingling and numbness are signs of neuropathy. Nerve involvement may be single (mono-neuropathy) or multiple (poly-neuropathy).This neuropathy can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.You should be doing HbA1C, ESR, serum protein/immuno-electrophoresis, and vitamin B12, BUN, and creatinine levels.These investigations are done to rule out all of the above mentioned common disorder.I feel in your case the pathology appears to be due to nerve compression in the night and hence appearance of symptoms in morning.The involved nerve seems to originate from S1 vertebrae and I think it might be Lat. Plantar nerve or Sural nerve.I think you should be consulting an orthopaedician and physician for further evaluation and treatment.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",
