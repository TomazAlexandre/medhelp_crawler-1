    "question": "Hello, i'm reaching out to anyone who can advice or is in the same situation. I have very dark skin color under my arms, neck, and genital area :(.. I've tried EVERYTHING! bleaching creams, home remedies, showering 2-3 times a day. And nothing seems to help. This has affected my life for years. Now I met someone and I'm just scared to show my body or have sex with the light on or during day. Anyone know how I can get rid of this problem? Any help will be greatly appreciated :)",
