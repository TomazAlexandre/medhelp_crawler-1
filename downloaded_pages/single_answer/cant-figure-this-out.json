            "answer": "\"I was tested for diabetes last year through blood work and it was negative and I told the doctor about this problem and she didn't have a clue.\"If your problem is being triggered by sugary foods you need to see an Endocrinologist and get properly tested for diabetes. You may have other health factors that a physical exam with blood work may uncover. If your last doctor is clueless go find another one for a 2nd opinion. Hopefully others will post suggestions too. Good luck.",

    "question": "I'm a slightly overweight male with a major surgar problem.\u00a0\u00a0When I eat too much sugar the next day when I wake up my whole body is in pain.\u00a0\u00a0My arms get the same feeling as if I had been doing curls all day.\u00a0\u00a0My legs and feet hurt and my hands don't work very good. When this happens it takes alot just to be able to put on my pants in the morning I have to sit down and pick each leg up with my hands to get them in my pants. I know this sounds strange but I'm getting sick of it. I have cut sugar out of my diet for the most part and that works but sometimes I slip up and eat too much and sure enough this happens to me. I was tested for diabetes last year through blood work and it was negative and I told the doctor about this problem and she didn't have a clue. Does anyone else out have the same problem or know what I'm going through cause I can't find any answers. HELP!!!!!!",
