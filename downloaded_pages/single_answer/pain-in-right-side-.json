            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.Most common possibility in your case could be nerve impingement, irritation or compression of nerve and underlying disorder like diabetes/alcohol abuse that may result in neuropathy (nerve pain like numbness and tingling at affected areas). If you suffer continuous weakness and notice reduced strength of muscle bulk in arm as well, please arrange an appointment with a neurologist right away who may be able to differentiate in both the possibilities first. These \u201cred flags\u201d could be indicative of nerve compression and its nerve branches and early treatment is essential if permanent damage needs to be avoided. Further referral to a physiotherapist for exercises could be beneficial and may produce relief of symptoms. Hope this help. Take Care & Stay Healthy!!!",
