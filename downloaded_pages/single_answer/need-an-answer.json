            "answer": "I hate to ask, but did you check the credentials of the three Endo's?Do any of them specialize in Thyroid problems?The first Endo I ever saw specialized in Diabetes, and apparently that was about all he had experience with. On my initial consult, he had a letter of introduction from my GP, detailing my recent history and problems. There was a bloodwork sheet right under the letter showing that I was extremely Hyperthyroid. Under those papers was a file two inches thick with all my medical records, including multiple blood tests showing I had been Hyper for quite a while.He palpated my throat, told me my only problem was that my GP had taken me off Synthroid, and I should go back home and resume the Synthroid therapy. He was an idiot.I doubt you saw three incompetant doctors in a row, but I would consider the goiter a problem. I would think at least one of the doctors would have given some thought to bumping your TSH up a notch just to see if you felt better by doing so.I guess if it were me, I'd pick one of the three endo's, the one you are most comfortable with, find out if he/she has much experience with Thyroids, and go back and discuss your concerns, your symptoms, and your desire to try something productive. Ask them how big the goiter has to be before it is considered a problem.If they ask you about depression, tell them the truth. Tell them depression is a symptom of thyroid disease, among a hundred other possible causes, and being depressed is not a reason to dismiss you out of hand.Best of luck to you.",

    "question": "Told by 3 endos that I'm fine. All symptoms are hypo, Goiter with 4 nodules, one is 1cm half solid. fatigue, weight gain is 15 -19lbs, intolerance to temp changes and many many more. Here's the latest blood work. TSH 0.65. T4 free 1.15. T3 321. Calcium 9.6. Cortisol total 25.3. Blood work comes back similar every time with lower TSH and T4 higher end of normal. They say \"Are you depressed\" all the time. I feel like ****, and if it's all normal, then what might be the reason that I feel this way? Some suggest low adrenal function, peri-menopause, Gained 15-19 lbs, eat very healthy and exercize. Was 126 in Jan 07 now 143 and can't loose the weight. So now I am getting depressed. They say we'll watch it. Well \"it\" keeps growing, and so am I. How big do we let this get, and how big do we let me get before someone beleives me.",
