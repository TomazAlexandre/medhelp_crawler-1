            "answer": "Hi there,It is important to know a detailed medical history and clinical examination findings before arriving at any diagnosis. High creatinine usually reflects kidney functions. Drinking lots of fluids, regularly exercising, and consuming lots of roughage can help keep creatinine levels in check. A good diet may help in regular detoxification of the blood and reducing the load on the kidneys. High WBC count indicates presence of an infection. It is best to consult your doctor for more details and queries since he knows your medical history best.Do keep me posted on how you are doing.Best luck and regards!",
