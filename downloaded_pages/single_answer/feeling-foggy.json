            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Hypothyroidism, diabetes and hormonal imbalance in women due to either menopause or any other cause like PCOD, hysterectomy should be investigated. I would suggest a complete hormone panel including female hormones (FSH, LH, estrogen progesterone, prolactin), insulin, thyroid, parathyroid and adrenals. Hormone replacement therapy should help you.Then you also need to investigate other causes of brain fog like liver dysfunction (get liver enzymes done\u2014liver function test), kidney dysfunction (get kidney function test done), and anemia. Poor sleep pattern and sleep problems like sleep apnea too can cause brain fog. Sleep studies by sleep specialists can help diagnose this.Low Vit D or Vit B12 too could be the cause.From you symptoms alone it also sounds like chronic fatigue syndrome. This usually presents with widespread myalgia and arthralgia, headaches, chronic mental and physical exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, concentration difficulty and memory problems.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
