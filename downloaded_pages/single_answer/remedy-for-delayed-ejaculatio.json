            "answer": "Hi.I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u201cED,\u201d since it\u2019s a vague term that covers everything from a medical condition affecting orgasm, to not having an erection one time after having a fight with your partner and drinking six beers.As you know, diabetes can affect blood flow, and impeded blood flow affects erections. I wish men wouldn\u2019t refer to \u201cgood\u201d erections, as though there were some that are \u201cbad.\u201d The only person judging your erection is you. Give your penis a break and accept it for what it is\u2014a wonderful part of your body that feels good. The less you put those judgments on yourself, the better your sex life will be.I don\u2019t know of anything that will enhance sensation in your penis, but I do know that your brain is your biggest sex organ, so maybe if you can short-circuit your anxieties by conjuring up a hot fantasy during sex, you might find yourself more relaxed, which will make orgasm more likely.I don\u2019t know how severely your diabetes has affected erection and/or orgasm for you, and I\u2019m not a physician. If you want to know whether diabetes has reduced your sensation, I\u2019d suggest you consult a urologist to find out if there are any other options for you. But I\u2019d be very cautious about any procedure that\u2019s permanent.You state that you and your partner enjoy lengthy sessions of sexual activity, but you\u2019re frustrated because you have to \u201cwork so hard and long to achieve an orgasm.\u201d Here, again, I think language is getting in the way. Orgasms aren\u2019t a JOB; they\u2019re about pleasure. My suggestion to you is that you relax and enjoy the pleasure and stop worrying so much about orgasm.Right about now you\u2019re thinking: \u201cI bet you wouldn\u2019t say that if YOU weren\u2019t always able to orgasm when you wanted to, Dr. J\u201d And you\u2019re right. It\u2019s easy to tell someone to stop putting pressure on themselves to orgasm, and it\u2019s no so easy to actually do that.I think that for men, it\u2019s related to the fact that you\u2019re taught that sex isn\u2019t about your pleasure, but about performance.Our society does a terrible disservice to men by raising them to think that their penis has to be 10 inches long, hard as a rock and last all night. The more you think of sex as being about performance, the more worries you'll have. If you're stressed, you'll probably worry even more. And this can be a vicious circle. For most of us, sex is about fun and pleasure. If you think of it as performance, or a \u201cjob,\u201d you\u2019ll set yourself for a stressful experience. Remember: Performance can be the enemy of pleasure and fun.If you continue worrying about this, all it will do is make you anxious, which will make your penis very uncooperative. And remember you don't need an erection to be sexual, have fun, experience pleasure, etc. Maybe it\u2019s time to talk to your partner and remind her that you do, in fact, find her wildly attractive and love having sex with her, and that you have a medical condition which sometimes inhibits your orgasm. Why not talk about trying some other pleasurable, non-orgasm-oriented activities? I bet the two of you can come up with some very enjoyable play together.Relax, enjoy your own unique sexuality and stop judging yourself. Best of luck to you. Dr. J",

    "question": "I am a 55 year old male, insulin dependent diabetic, with hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0I do enjoy a regular sex life.\u00a0\u00a0I have E.D., but inject Caverject to achieve good, firm erections.\u00a0\u00a0Since I only use the injection once a week or so, other sexual activity usually involves hand stimulation from my partner, or oral.\u00a0\u00a0I find all types of stimulation very pleasurable, but cannot seem to achieve an ejaculatory orgasm through intercourse.\u00a0\u00a0This frustrates my partner, and I think she has the opinion that she doesn't feel good enough to me.\u00a0\u00a0Also, when I achieve and orgasm from her masterbating me by hand, or from oral, it seems to take me forever sometimes to finally climax.\u00a0\u00a0I know some guys who have a premature ejaculation problem would probably be glad to exchange problems with me.\u00a0\u00a0Although my partner and I both enjoy lengthy sessions of sexual activity, it is so frustrating to have to work so hard and long to achieve an orgasm.\u00a0\u00a0When it finally does happen, it is usually great, but sometimes the extended activity leaves me sore.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any remedies out there for this type of problem?\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps a topical solution that might help enhance the sensations; something that really DOES work, not just claims to help.\u00a0\u00a0I realize that some of this has to do with my diabetes, but hopefully there's help.",
