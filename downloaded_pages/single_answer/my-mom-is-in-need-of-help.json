            "answer": "Sorry to read both you and your mother are having such a bad time.The symptoms you describe could be caused by the heart, even with a pace maker, is not beating fast enough. Do you have a heart rate number?\u00a0\u00a0A rest number of 60 beats per minute should be enough, depending on a lot of factors.I assume her slow HR was down in the range of 30, which is as I understand it the point at which a pacemaker is indicated.The \"racing chest\" sounds like a fast HR, but some numbers on the HR would be the defining measure.\u00a0\u00a0If the HR is normal, then it seems possible that the heart is not pumping efficiently.\u00a0\u00a0In any event it seems further discussion with her doctor is in order.I read your efforts to reduce/quit smoking and that would help for sure.\u00a0\u00a0That may be a big part of the \"labored breathing\"... we need both efficiency\u00a0\u00a0in our lungs and in our hearts to get the needed oxygen into our blood stream and moved around to muscles and organs.",

    "question": "Hi There,My name is Jamie and I am in desperate need of some help for my Mom. She has been feeling terrible for almost a solid year now. Let me tell you a bit about her.My mom is 55 years old, lives alone in an apartment, works full time and unfortunately smokes. A lot. I try to tell her to cut down and even more importantly QUIT but she will not listen. She is also diabetic, which, she is taking very good care of her diet. Her sugars have been at a decent level along with her cholestorol.My mom has had the pacemaker surgery because she was feeling horrible heart problems. She found out from a doctor that it was actually her heart slowing down and the pacemaker is going to help get it pumping to a normal speed. (Im sorry that I sound ridiculous explaining this) After the surgery she was fine for a week and then her heart started acting funny all over again. Her doctor blames it on Anxiety and now she is taking medicine for anxiety/depression along with medicines for diabetes.She gave me a list of her symptoms: Racing Chest, Wired, Shakey, Dizzy, Weak in Arms and Legs, Feeling like she is going to faint, Labored breathing.Even typing these symptoms makes me very sad for her. I want to be able to help her. I cannot stand to see my Mom in this kind of discomfort and pain any longer. Any ideas on what can be happening??",
