            "answer": "Hello,Ingrown toenails usually due to extra pressure on the toe. In people suffering from diabetes nerve damage in the leg or foot, poor blood circulation to your foot, or an infection around the nail, can put at additional risk. Take good foot care. Soak your feet in warm water for two-three times per day for 15 to 20 minutes, it will help in reducing pain. Apply a topical antibiotic ointment to the red area to reduce inflammation and infection. You may stuff tiny pieces of clean, moist cotton between the ingrown toenail and the skin to help separate them and provide a little cushioning to the skin. This cotton may be dipped in an antiseptic cleanser .Wear shoes made of soft fabrics with a wide toe .For more information do consult your doctor.Best luck and take care!",
