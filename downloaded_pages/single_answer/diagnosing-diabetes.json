            "answer": "My first thoughts on reading your post were diabetes and thyroid as well. One question is how long you have been eating low carb? If it has been quite awhile that might have lowered your A1C into the normal range. Another possible test is the OGTT which tests your response to a sugary drink over a couple hours. You could also try yourself eating something very high carb and then testing two hours later. Non-diabetics rarely go above 120 no matter what they eat. My concern is that if the doctors feel they have ruled out the more obvious problems (I thought of them and I'm not a doctor!), and the symptoms are continuing, then they need to look for less obvious explanations. I would look for a doctor who will stick with it, seeking answers to what is going on.Not to worry you, but if you start to have flu-like symptoms with vomiting, you need to go to the ER. That could be symptomatic of DKA an emergency situation brought on by consistent high blood sugars. However, since you have a meter at home, that is unlikely to happen without your awareness.",

    "question": "Hello, I'm a 22 year old female (about 5'7, 129 pounds) who is having trouble getting diagnosed. I'm practically bedridden with shakyness/shortness of breath/fast heart rate/ weakness, as well as a constant appetite and must eat every 2 hours otherwise the above symptoms intensify. Even though I've been eating so frequently (and not able to move around much), I still feel unbearably hungry and I have been losing weight. Since this illness has started I was about 146 pounds (almost two months ago) and now I'm at 129. I'm also always thirsty and have had episodes of what seems to be kidney/lower back pain. This pain reduced when I switched to eating a lower carb/high protein diet, which I only did when I found that eating breads, sugary fruits intensified my shortness of breath/shakyness. Finally I have also had episodes of numbness and tingling in my arms and legs that come and go in various intensity.My family thought diabetes seemed possible and I was taken to an endocrinologist, who checked my fasting blood glucose and my H1AC (glycated hemoglobin). The results were 82, and 5.5 respectively. She stated these figures were perfectly normal and had no further questions. This left me and my family confused as to where to go from here. She also checked my thyroid function (complete panel) and my adrenal function (ACTH stim test) and stated those figures were normal too.I've also had my blood sugar checked randomly at home with a blood glucose meter and it's so been in the 80's, taken at random intervals (over the course of 4-5 days)Does anyone have any suggestions as what could be going on?Thanks in advance for any advice",
