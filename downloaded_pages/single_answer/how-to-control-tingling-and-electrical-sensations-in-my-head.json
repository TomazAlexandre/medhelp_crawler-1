            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Along with the drugs you are taking, test for diabetes and peripheral artery disease. Both can compound an existing problem causing a patient to not to respond to drugs. Also get a MRI of the cervical spine to rule out nerve compression. If there are any such underlying causes, then treating them will solve your problems considerably.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I suffered a MTBI in May 2009. I've come a long way in my recovery. The Zoloft \"kicked in\" in mid-August and I was able to return to work. The headaches seemed to be subsiding during the fall but then came back towards the end of December. I'm now on Amantadine and Neuronton since January in additition to the Zoloft. The tingling and electrical sensations in my head are pretty much constant and get worse as the day progresses. I am able to sleep with the help of Ambien. I'm also on Inderal for HBP. My question is: What else can be done to control the tingling and electrical sensations and improve the quality of my life?",
