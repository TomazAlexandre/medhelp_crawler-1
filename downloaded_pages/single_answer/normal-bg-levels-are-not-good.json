            "answer": "Hi.I am afraid that the advice you received is pretty much correct--your body feels \"relatively hypoglycemic\" because it has bene used to high blood sugars for so long. When you are now down in the 100-range it probably feels terrible, right?\u00a0\u00a0There are two ways to go about this:1)reassure yourself that even though you feel terrible(weak, a bit shaky, really hungry, cranky), people do not pass out from blood sugar problems when their sugars are in the 100's. This happens much lower(usually below 40mg/dL). So even though it feels like you are unsteady, this is not likely to happen. If this is your situation, hang in there and know that your body will feel better in a few short weeks, when it adjusts to the normal blood sugar range.2)If you are feeling DIZZY, that may not be related to your blood sugar but possibly something else--dehydration, medication side effects etc. If you feel truly unsteady on your feet, you should discuss this with your doc and be seen in the near future to be examined and go over blood tests etc. If you feel unsteady when getting behind the wheel--don't do it. Have someone else drive you.I hope this helps. Please take care and talk to your doc again soon.",
