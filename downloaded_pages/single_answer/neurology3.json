Numbness of lip and tongue could be due to malnutrition and vitamin B complex deficiency, metabolic causes like diabetes and neuropathy. Do you have any temporomandibular joint pain? This misaligned jaw can put pressure on the nerves just next to your ears. You could be feeling numbness due to involvement of sensory nerve to face in particular lip and tongue and hence the numbness. Do you have any other systemic symptoms like loss of balance or memory loss to suspect certain nerve disorders? Any previous dental surgery or history of trauma? You can take vitamin supplements of B1, B6 and B12 available over the counter. You need to consult a physician for complete evaluation including screening for diabetes and TMJ conditions. Specific management would include identification of cause. Wishing you all the best and take care.",
