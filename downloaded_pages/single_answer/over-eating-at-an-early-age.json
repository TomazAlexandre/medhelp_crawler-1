    "question": "I work in a school system and recently encountered something unusual.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is a 4 year old child, that, well let me try and explain the child is always eating.\u00a0\u00a0She takes food, snacks from other children, goes through the garbage looking for food, she is wetting her pants at least 3 maybe 4 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0She has been taken to the doctor, and the doctor seems to think all of this is ok.. I asked the parent if the child has gained weight?\u00a0\u00a0She stated that she has gained\u00a0\u00a010-15 pounds over the last year.\u00a0\u00a0My question is what can I tell these parents to help this child.\u00a0\u00a0I suggested that they take her to another doctor, the weight gain, and the consistent over eating could be dangerous to the child.\u00a0\u00a0She sometimes eats until she throws up and then still wants food.\u00a0\u00a0How or what can I do to help this child?",
