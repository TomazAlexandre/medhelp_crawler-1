    "question": "My husband has been diagnosed with genitofemoral nerve pain and has been receiving nerve blocks for this with little results, is there any other treatment for this problem, and can this be because of the nerve being pinched, bhecause he has never had surgery and does not have diabetes which are usually the cause of this, also should he be seeing a neurologist for this because his regular dr diagnosed this and sent him right for the nerve block?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you",
