            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The numbness of the fingers could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar nerve at the elbow level. Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause numbness of middle, little and ring finger. Please consult a neurologist. Take care!",

    "question": "Almost every night I am awakened by both hands, the outer 3 fingers on each, being numb and tingling. I have to force myself to shake them, wiggle them to get the sensation to stop. An hour later, or sometimes hours, it will happen again. Once in a while it will be the whole hand, or the inner fingers/thumb, but not as often. This happens whether I sleep on my back, or either side.",
