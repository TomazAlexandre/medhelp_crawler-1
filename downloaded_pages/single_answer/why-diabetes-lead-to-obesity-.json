    "question": "To regulate the food intake human beings have 2 centers called feeding centre and satietary center. Feeding center stimulation leads to increased food intake and uncontrollable hunger where as satietary center stimulation causes cessation of food intake by inhibiting feeding center activity. There are some receptors called glucostats which gives response increase blood glucose content which occurs as soon as the person takes his meal. Glucostats excite the satietary center which inturn inhibits the feeding center.But in diabetic patients because of deficiency of insulin hyperglycemia occurs which cannot stimulate the satiety center. So even though the food intake is normal the satiety center is not stimulated and feeding center is always active which lead to increase in the food intake and uncotrolled hunger leading to obesity. So diabetic patients are advised to take low calorie diet and sugar free drinks.",
