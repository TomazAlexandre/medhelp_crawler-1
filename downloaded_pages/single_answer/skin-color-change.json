            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor with your parents to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.Fungal infections of the human body are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "About a year ago, I noticed that the skin on my forehead (just between my eyebrows) took on a lighter shade in white blotches so it looked almost like I had sunburn. It sometimes itched and turned red, especially if I had walked in the sun. At first I thought it was some sort of skin fungus, but after visiting my dermatologist I was informed that I had a reaction on my fatty glands from being exposed to extreme change of weather. I was also told that the skin becomes scaly and was given ointment for it. The white blotches has now disappeared, but the skin area remains reddish. I lately notice that the same pinkish white blotch also appears on my fingers just on the knuckles, and what worries me the most is that it is also appearing on the skin of my penis. And it seems to be spreading down the shaft of my penis. It doesn't hurt and it no longer itches, but I am extremely worried nevertheless. Please help!",
