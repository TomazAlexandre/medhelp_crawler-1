    "question": "I am so confused! I found out I was pregnant on Friday July 13th...and I had a bad feeling about the pregnancy, about 6 days later I had brown discharge, then 2 days after that I started spotting, so I went to the ER and they called it a threatened abortion, well 4 days later the actual miscarriage started and I passed a clot and tissue about the size of a golf ball, and have been bleeding ever since. Well first off they thought I was only just going into the 5th week,\u00a0\u00a0they weren't sure because my hcg level was only 429, and they did a trans vag ultrasound and saw absolutely nothing,but if it was that early would the clot have been that big? and also I have prediabetes and am wondering if that could have caused the miscarriage..I have a healthy 2 year old son, but I had gestational diabetes pretty bad when I was pregnant with him.....thank you!\u00a0\u00a0this is the WORST thing ever!!!",
