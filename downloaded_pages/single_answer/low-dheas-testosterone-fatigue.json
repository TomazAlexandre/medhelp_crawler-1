            "answer": "Age?Thyroid testing is a good place to start...You need to ask for TSH, FREE T3 and FREE T4...important to have these last two, as TSH not a good marker for thyroid function. It can be wrong, or not sensitive enough to mark a problem...but having the FREE T3 and FREE T4 with it is much more important...(not to be confused with T4 and T3, must have FREE in front. Many drs are hesitant to test these two if they say your TSH is \"normal\").If adrenal glands not working properly, you will see reductions in these hormones.\"DHEA and DHEAS are the most abundant hormone bases in the human body, and influence more than 150 repair functions throughout the body and brain.Starting at about age 25, DHEA levels begin to decline, and this loss of DHEA accelerates as we age so that by about age 70 most people are producing only 10% of the DHEA they were producing at age 25.High levels of DHEA are strongly associated with longevity, good diet habits and regular exercise.Low levels of DHEA are associated with depression, dementia, obesity, asthma, Adult onset diabetes, autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis, increased risk for cancer, and increased cardiovascular disease.Low levels of DHEA are associated with increased risk of death from all causes, and an increased risk of mortality for many disease states such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"Good to rule out the underlying causes as you mentioned, and ask dr about supplementing if they feel this is necessary, after other tests to determine problem.A person can have a mix of adrenal fatigue and thyroid issues...so good idea to get it looked into for sure, with symptoms as you said of fatigue. Any others?Take care...C",
