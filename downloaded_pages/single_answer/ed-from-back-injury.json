    "question": "two years ago I injured by lower back. MRI showed bulging discs in the lumbar area. The pain was severe and I was in a wheelchair for two months. Through PT , chiropractic, and pain management( two injections into my spine) I am about 90per cent back. Through the months though I have gotten less and less sexual drive. To the point now that I have flat lined. Nothing. No abililty to get an erection. I eat well am physically very active don't smoke do all the right things. I am 61 and do not think that this is normal. I talked to my regular doctor and had my testosterone level checked. They came back in the normal range. Can you give me any advice as to what else I might do to correct tis problem",
