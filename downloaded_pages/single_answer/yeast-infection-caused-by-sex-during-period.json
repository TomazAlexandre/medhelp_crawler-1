            "answer": "Hello,During cold, immunity levels are low and hence fungal or yeast infections can occur. Various reasons for recurrent or persistent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Treatment resistance can be overcome by applying a cream with a combination of antifungals (Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1% and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%) or using oral antifungals under a doctor\u2019s guidance. You should get it evaluated from a doctor and get your blood sugar levels checked.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "The past two months I have gotten a yeast infection after my period. Both times I had sex while on my period and was wondering if that could potentially be the cause of it. The first time I used Monistat and it worked. This time the symptoms are not nearly as bad, but it is still annoying to have two months in a row. Also, I have had a cold for the past week or so and was wondering if maybe that could be a factor. I am a 22 year old female with no previous health issues.",
