            "answer": "HI Janet,I cannot guarantee it, but there is a good chance that you can decrease your dose of medication, or get rid of it completely, with weight loss. Both type 2 diabetes and hypertension are linked to being overweight and for many people this can be managed through weight loss and dietary changes. I suggest meeting with a dietician to help develop a meal plan, and start exercising slowly with a goal of atleast 30 minutes 5 times a week. (Check with your doctor before you begin any exercise program).Good luck and take care.",
