    "question": "My sister in law who is living with us eats in excess of 8000 calories per day. She eats about 5 meals a day (not small) and several snacks per day. She sees nothing wrong with the amount of food she eats. An example of her snack is a double jr bacon cheeseburger, loaded backed potato and drink from Wendy's. So, you can imagine what her meals are like? She is hungry all the time and never gains weight. In fact, she has lost about 30 pounds since moving in with us a little over a year ago. She currently weighs about 115. In that time in getting her to go to the doctor (had very little medical check-ups prior to moving in with us) she has been diagnosed with HTN (180's/100's), a small PFO. She has a normal thyroid, and fasting blood sugar. I should also mention she has little or no muscle tone (her whole life), extra teeth (adult) and multiple baby teeth that have never come out and webbed toes. Please help!! She is eating us out of house and home. I have asked her to keep a two week food diary but I don't know if she will.Last night for dinner she ate a KC strip steak, baked potato with everything, corn on the cob, roll and then she left 30 minutes later, went and got a large double cheeseburger, and large onion rings and ate it (PUKE), I felt like it.",
