            "answer": "Hi!Scattered foci of Flair signals indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Though they are of no immediate threat, all these causes, and the presence of ischemic changes can be a risk factor for future stroke. Hence, prevention methods should include a healthy lifestyle, and a combination of diet, exercise, and medicines. Please discuss with your treating doctors. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history.

    "question": "No evidence of diffusion restriction to suggest recent or acute ischemia.Patchy areas of FLAIR signal changes are seen within the right frontal lobe (series 5 image 17) and the left parietal lobe (series 5 image 17). A small amount of increased gyriform T1 signal is seen within these regions. No definite evidence of enhancement. No suspicious enhancing lesions identified. Slightly increased FLAIR signal changes are also seen in the posterior aspect of the pons bilaterally. Juxtacortical foci of FLAIR signal abnormality also seen in the right parietal lobe.Mild periventricular FLAIR signal changes are present likely related to chronic microvascular ischemic changes.No extracerebral collection. A partially empty sella is noted. The parasellar structures are unremarkable. Posterior fossa is unremarkable. Ventricles and sulci are within normal limits.",
