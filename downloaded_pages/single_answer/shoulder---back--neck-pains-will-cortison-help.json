As you can not tolerate anti-inflammatory meds, cortisone/steroid injections are a possible alternative.\u00a0\u00a0The most important thing is to avoid any further trauma and playing an aggressive sport such as hockey can be a risk ( but if you are a good player and do so defensively, you might play without sustaining more damage).I am not sure about the diabetes connection mentioned in your post. If you were diabetic, you would probably have additional symptoms such as increased thirst, frequency of urination, etc.\u00a0\u00a0A fasting blood sugar as a screening tool could help rule this out.Please post back with your progress and any additional questions/concerns you may have.Best wishes ---(P.S.\u00a0\u00a0Hope your team wins!)",

    "question": "What can I do next?First off I have always had lower back pains that I have learnt to live with these pains that are hereditary and have been around since I was 15.Since my recent problem that has happened about 2 months ago... my lower back pains seem to have disappeared replaced with other pains that are much less disirable7 years ago I had my shoulder operated on as it would easily dislocating on a regular basis... they repaired the bunker and reattached the ligaments. Physio and everything was fine until about 2 months ago.2 months ago I discovered a pain in my previously operated shoulder (left). Can only describe it as the same type of pain I would have when my shoulder dislocated... (Only my shoulder is still no longer dislocating *knock on wood*) the muscles in my arm (bicep area) reacting weird to the simplest of movements. At the same time discovering that I had lost almost complete mobility in my arm.\u00a0\u00a0If I try to repeat the movements that cause the pain I can't. It\u2019s almost like a reflex movement that causes the pain in the muscle.\u00a0\u00a0Along with the lack of movement in my arm and this pain in the bicep and triceps area on sudden movements I continuously have a slight pain at the shoulder...It has been diagnosed as tendinitis and for the past 2 months I have been doing physio... and started to try acupuncture. Anti-inflammatory have been discontinued as even with something to help protect the stomach it was causing digestive problems...A few weeks into my physic it was brought to my attention that it may not be tendinitis but actually something possibly worse. (caliptius ????) Something commonly found in diabetes but I don't have diabetes.The pain is not as severe as it was 2 months ago but it seems to include the back and neck area as well as the shoulder and arm. The mobility in my arm has improved somewhat it has kept me out of my favourite pastime and lone activity (hockey) for the past 7 weeks.I have been anxiously waiting since the beginning of the year for a hockey tournament that will be held in about a month. I'm running out of time for this issue to heal in order to be able to play. I was hoping would a cortisone shot be a possible solution to temporarily resolve this issue long enough for the tournament?\u00a0\u00a0I understand it is not a permanent fix but am hoping that it will relieve my pain soon enough and long enough to compete in the tournament3 things in the run of a week could be possible causes...twice during hockey before my problem, my good shoulder (right) seemed to dislocate exactly as my operated shoulder did before the operation (left) since all the muscles are attached together I thought it may be because of this... also I did fall while walking the dog but don't think my left shoulder or elbow and hand actually had any impact but I may be wrong..",
