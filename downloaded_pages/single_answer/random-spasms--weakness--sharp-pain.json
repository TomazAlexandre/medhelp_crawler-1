            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum.\u00a0\u00a0There can be various causes of these generalized muscle spasms. This could be overuse of muscles due to strenuous exercise or unaccustomed physical work, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, or systemic illnesses like anemia, diabetes, thyroid issues and renal disorders need to be excluded. Your doctor may also investigate for nervous system diseases like multiple sclerosis if these common causes are ruled out. You need to recall any over the counter medicines or protein or vitamin supplements that taken could cause these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0You must consult a physician who would do a detailed examination and relevant blood tests like complete blood count, electrolytes sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, blood glucose and serum creatinine. Metabolic panel including thyroid function test would complete the blood testing. You may require detailed and extensive nervous system testing if nerve or muscle disorder is suspected. Management would be accordingly. Wishing you all the best.",
