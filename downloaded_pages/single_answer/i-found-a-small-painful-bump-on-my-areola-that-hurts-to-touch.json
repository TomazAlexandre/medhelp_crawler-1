    "question": "Yesterday I found a small painful bump on my areola that hurts to touch. It\u2019s smaller than a pea, but I can feel a bit hardness underneath the surface. The bump is a bit raised and red on the surface and almost has a small indentation? I\u2019m 18 and in college, and even though it\u2019s only been a day I\u2019m kind of freaking out about it. I did some research and keep thinking I have a subareolar breast abcess?\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m really worried and don\u2019t know what to do\u2014I don\u2019t have an official adult doctor yet, and pretty much still go to a mainstream pediatrician. It feels better today than it did yesterday, but I\u2019m panicking over the things I\u2019ve read about these things sometimes being rare forms of cancer.I have no history of breast cancer or anything in the family, and nothing like this has ever happened to me. I have no nipple piercings and don\u2019t have diabetes which websites said were risk factors for breast abscesses in woman who aren\u2019t breastfeeding\u2026what could have caused this? Is it safe for me to wait a few days and see if it goes away on its own or do I need to rush to a doctor? And if so how do I do that if I don\u2019t have a doctor yet? I would like to avoid bringing this up to my parents if it\u2019s a trivial problem that can go away on its own.I\u2019m really scared, any advice would be helpful. Thanks",
