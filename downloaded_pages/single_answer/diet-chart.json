            "answer": "Hi,Changing your diet can help protect your kidneys and help you control other co-morbid conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure. There is no one diet that is right for everyone who has kidney disease and a referral to a dietitian can tailor a diet based on how well\u00a0\u00a0the kidneys are working.\u00a0\u00a0It is highly recommended that regular follow-up is done with attending physician and regular testing to monitor your lab results. Limit salt, protein,\u00a0\u00a0fluids, and minerals, such as potassium and phosphorus. Diet chart may be requested from attending physician or dietitian and may be downloaded in the net. Diet may change also over time as the disease changes. Take care and do keep us posted.",
