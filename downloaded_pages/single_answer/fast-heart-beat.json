            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Hypertension, diabetes, strokes or\u00a0\u00a0transient ischemic attacks too should be looked into. The symptoms do look like TIA. Hence all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc.Another possibility is seizures. Ofcourse it could be something as simple as anemia or low sugar or disturbed sleep pattern, cervical nerve compression or just stress. Your husband was right in taking you to ER for prompt evaluation. Please do so if the symptoms repeat.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Yesterday while shopping my heart started racing , i felt tingling in my arms and fingers also my legs were weak, then i fell down. I was so surprised, i have had my heart race like that before and felt a little out of breath but nothing else. I was wondering if it could have anything to do with my low platelet count ( ITP). The same day I woke up feeling hot and last night the same thing, so hot and clammy. My husband wanted to take me to the Emerge but I did not want to go.Thanks to all who can help",
