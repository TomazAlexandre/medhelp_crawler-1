            "answer": "Hi There,Thanks for writing.The possibility of neuropathy cannot be ruled out entirely even though your thyroid levels are normal and cervical spine MRI is clean.Other possibilities like diabetes and B complex deficiency also need to be looked into.I would suggest you to do some gentle breathing exercises and take B complex supplements and see if it helps with your symptoms.Good luck!",
