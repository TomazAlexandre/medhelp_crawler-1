    "question": "Im due september 3rd.. I'm currently 19 weeks 5 days. How much should i be gainig with twins? So far ive gained 12 lbs....I started off 50 lbs heavier than i did with my first pregnancy, and i had high blood pressure so my OB put me on low dose asprin to regulate it. ( so far its working) But he told me he only wants to see me gain 20 lbs this pregnancy because im more risk for diabetes. How much am i supposed to gain with twins? ive been gaining 3-5 lbs every month so far.. so im guessing ill end up gaining more than 20lbs this pregnancy.",
