    "question": "I'm currently 34 weeks pregnant but my midwife is telling me that I measure about a week and a half bigger than what I am. I aslo failed my gestational diabetes test by 4 points but she didn't retest me and kind of shrugged it off. I've went from being 117lbs pre-pregnancy to 152lbs now . Does this mean I'll have a big baby\u00a0\u00a0? Is gaining so much harmful to the baby or me ? Should I refrain from buying newborn size clothes and stick to 0-3 months ?",
