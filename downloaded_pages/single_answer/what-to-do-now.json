    "question": "My problem: my blood sugar was 126\u00a0\u00a04 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Last week it was 120 and my fasting glucose was 5.5.\u00a0\u00a0My mother had type 2 diabetes as did my paternal grandmother.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that's it for my family.\u00a0\u00a0I am surprised and saddened by this diagnosis since I work pretty hard at eating and behaving well.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice or ideas as to what's going on? I am a 65 year old 62 inch, 122 lb. woman who has been a quasi vegetarian for 25 years, I do not smoke, eat junk food or fast food of any kind, ever.\u00a0\u00a0My cholesterol is low, my blood pressure fine, my spirits good.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think I have any real stress in my life.\u00a0\u00a0I drink wine, tea, and eat dark chocolate, cheese (maybe too much of this), whole grains, lots of vegetables, eggs and fish. all of which I would hate to give up but will if necessary.\u00a0\u00a0I walk a minimum of 4 to 5 miles daly at 4 mph, (ex-runner) do yoga 2 times a week and lift weights 2-3 times a week. What now?Thanks",
