    "question": "I had been having problems with my feet and ankles, which was subsequently diagnosed as arthritis, but not rheumatoid. I also have the problems in my hands, wrists and neck.I then had a wisdom tooth removed and took dexamethasone, which caused me to urinate a lot and all the inflammation and the edema I had had for years disappeared.I got the doctor to give me blood tests, and they found that I am diabetic but not bad enough to require medication. It has taken four years to reach this point. Four years ago, I reached menopause and had already been taking HRT for many years, due to other problems. I continue to take the hormones, but my weight ballooned and I am double the weight I was four years ago.18 months ago, I had some blood tests, and the doctor said everything was normal. I did not see the results until now, but wish I had done so because my thyroid was 5.1 and my glucose was 6.1Now I have arthritis and diabetes. I eat good food and never buy convenience foods although I have been eating bread (whole grain with flax) and dairy products, and my fat and starch consumption has increased. I rarely eat sugars or baked goods.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone from about 115 lbs. to about 215 lbs in four years. I am fatigued all the time, and have been suffering from anxiety and depression now for 13 years, which was prior to the weight gain and foot pain.Since taking the dexamethasone, my frequent urination has been maintained. I now notice that I don't have the inflammation and foot pain because I am urinating frequently - not out of urgency like cystitis, but because of a full bladder. The edema in my ankles that I had before has gone.Last week, my diabetes reading was 7.1 with a 2 hour glucose test result of 12.1. My thyroid test was 4.5I feel I have a thyroid problem, but my doctor says I am within range and sent me for urine testing for irrable bladder syndrome and liver problems.What do you think? Could it be thyroid causing all my problems, including the diabetes sugar level?\u00a0\u00a0 My mother had thyroid problems and osteoporosis, which is why I take HRT (to avoid osteoporosis). There is no history of breast cancer. On the other side of my family, both of my grandparents died from cerebral thrombosis or cerbral haemorrhage, with high blood pressure. My blood pressure has always been on the low side.This discussion is related to/posts/show/226548.",
