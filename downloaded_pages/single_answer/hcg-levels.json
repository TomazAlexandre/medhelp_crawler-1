            "answer": "Hi there and congrats on your pregnancy.Your HCG levels look great.\u00a0\u00a0Dr's will often test HCG levels every 2 to 3 days as an early indicator of a healthy pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0THey want them to double every 2 to 3 days and yours certainly did that.\u00a0\u00a0Your progesterone level is good too, another indicator that things are going well.To answer your question about chances of miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0Right now things look good and that is what to focus on.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, miscarriage can still happen, and odds in any pregnancy are about 33%.\u00a0\u00a0However, many of those happen very very early, and every day that goes by with no bleeding (although spotting is common and usually no big deal) combined with cramping takes you closer to a positive outcome.As far as special concerns go, there is really nothing dramatic.\u00a0\u00a0We \"older moms\" have a higher rate of things like pre eclampsia (high blood pressure), gestational diabetes and of course chromosomnal abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0DO NOT let that make you afraid.\u00a0\u00a0The majority of us have completely normal and healthy pregnancies, with perhaps slightly closer monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0I was a week away from 41 when my son was born and both he and I are healthy and happy.\u00a0\u00a0When I say increased chance, I mean slight increases as we age, and your Dr. will order any additional tests he/she think necessary.\u00a0\u00a0It truly is nothing to worry about.So enjoy that growing life inside of you and I wish you all the best!",
