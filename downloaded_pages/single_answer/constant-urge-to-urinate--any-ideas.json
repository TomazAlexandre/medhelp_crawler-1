            "answer": "Hello,These symptoms can be due to prostatitis. The typical symptoms of prostatitis are fever, pelvic, testicle, or rectal pain, frequent and painful urination and ejaculation and incomplete emptying of bladder.A culture of the expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) can help in ruling out or confirming the diagnosis. A test named as Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test can also help as PSA is raised in Prostatitis. A Urologist can diagnose the condition by digital examination.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "20 year old male. I've had an almost constant urge to urinate since late September, roughly 3 1/2 months ago. It started out of nowhere one day and has been affecting me ever since. Even after I use the bathroom I still feel like there is pressure in my urethra to varying degrees/urgency. Never a feeling of complete relief. For the first couple weeks I would regularly go in excess of 10 times a day, since then I can limit it to 6-8 times a day most days. This is more than I used to normally go, and like I said the urge is always there to varying degrees so I have to force it that low.I have no pain to speak of, no discharge as far as I know, and no blood in my urine. I had my urine tested in early and late October, both times it came back clean. I visited a GP in late October and had a digital rectal exam where the doctor said my prostate felt slightly enlarged but never really followed up on it. He also tested my blood for diabetes and kidney illnesses, but apparently both came back fine as well. Had an ultrasound of my bladder in early November which also seemed to show that my bladder was emptying properly.The first doctor in early October prescribed me a twice daily dose of doxycycline for a week which didn't solve the problem. 2nd doctor prescribed ciprofloxacin, ditto. Haven't seen any doctors or taken any antibiotics since then due to a lack of insurance. My new health insurance started with the new year so I plan on seeing a urologist soon who will hopefully know what is wrong with me.I don't know if this is a UTI that is eluding urine cultures, an irritated urethra, enlarged prostate, or even interstitial cystitis. I have absolutely no idea what is wrong with me, except I apparently don't have diabetes. Any help would be appreciated.",
