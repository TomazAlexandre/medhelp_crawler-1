    "question": "I have a 6 year old who has recently had occasional high blood sugars. I tested her one morning first thing in the morning she was 128 that was over 8 hours with nothing in her system. I checked the next morning and it was only 107. Most of the time I check her she is within a normal range however there have been 3 times within less than a week she was over 200 more than 2 hours after eating or doing a random check. Last night I checked her when I came home she was 239 all she had eaten prior to that was an apple and a juice box which had been almost 2 hours before. I always use an alcohol wipe before testing to make sure there is nothing on her hands. She is always hungry, seems to always be thirsty and urinates frequently. Could this be the start of diabetes for her? I know she is obviously producing some insulin because her sugar will eventually go down. I just don't know what I should do for the most part her sugars seem to be within a normal range but I do know a non diabetic should never go over 200 no matter what they eat. If anyone is in the same situation or can offer any advice I would greatly appreciate it.",
