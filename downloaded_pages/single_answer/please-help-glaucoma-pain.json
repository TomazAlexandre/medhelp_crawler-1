    "question": "I have awful pain rather often from glaucoma. I dont know which kind I have because I have not been able to see a doc for it because I have no insurance. I only know its there because i had a retinal detachment and a diabetic bleed and through an eye fund I was able to have surgery. within 3 months i had another bleed and the doc informed me that there was no point in having another surgery and she was sorry. She sees me for free is the only reason I even know. But she says there isnt much she can do for me. I need a glaucoma doctor. the 2 times i seen her my pressure was 36 and 38 and painful. well the pain comes back entirely to much.i was wondering if there was anyway to lower eye pressure at home or to help with the pain?? Im on 4 drops as it is and have no idea what im going to do once the sample bottle are gone. I have no scripts and couldnt afford them if i did. Please if there is anything at all i can do from home i would love to know. thank you",
