            "answer": "Hello,3 years is a pretty long time for an ulcer. I suggest you an immediate dermatologist\u2019s consultation for this. This needs debridement and a proper course of antibiotics. Debridement is the process of removing non-living or necrotic tissue from pressure ulcers, burns, and other wounds. The four major debridement techniques are surgical, mechanical, chemical, and autolytic.After this you need oral or injectible antibiotics after a wound swab is sent for culture. Delayed wound healing can occur in vitamin C and vit K deficiency, diabetes, p-rotein deficiency, immunocompromised states and if the person is taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. So check out these drugs and your blood sugar status.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have had a nasty ulcer on my ankle for 3 years and have tried lots of treatments, under doctors of course, but it refuses to heal and it often smells really bad. In desperation I have tried loads of online'free medical advice' sites. But once you have asked your question, they ALL then ask for money before they will give an answer. I'm desperate but I'm not going to be conned. My problem is a physical thing, I am not mentally retarded. I hope you have some advice as per the ad for this site being free. Thank you,django47",
