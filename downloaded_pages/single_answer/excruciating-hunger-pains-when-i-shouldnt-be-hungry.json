    "question": "I am a 20 year old female 5'7\" tall, 200 pounds (I'm pretty overweight). I dont know if its because I have a large stomach that can hold a lot or if I have some kind of disorder, but for the longest time when I get hungry I'm instantly starving. and if I dont eat right away, the hunger pain gets worse and its like an acidic burning thats unbearable. I start to shake and feel sick. it even happens within a couple hours after I eat. its gotten so bad that I am actually afraid of leaving my house without bringing food with me. do I have acid reflux? or some kind of diabetes? I try not to over eat but the pain forces me to stuff my face when I know I shouldn't be hungry. I cant afford to see a doctor, can someone please help me?",
