            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Urinary tract infection are very common in diabetes and IBS. Because there is reduced immuno-competency in these conditions, patients are more prone to get infected.Infections are most commonly due to fungi. Antibiotics might not help. Get an urine examination done along with culture and sensitivity. Examination of a urethral swab might also help making the diagnosis.Pain while passing urine can occur due to stones in the urinary tract. Reduced urinary stream with pain might occur. Get an ultrasound done to confirm the diagnosis.Passing urine in the night is quiet common in diabetics. Consult your urologist for evaluation and treatment.Take care.",

    "question": "Have had recurring bladder infections since my 20's. The last 10 years less often. Have had complete hysteroctomey and have Diabetes and IBS & Fibro. Recently, have had urination abt 2-3 times a night. Abt. 5 min after urinating, will have an aching start at sides of my back, sometimes spine in that area also hurts. This may only last perhaps half an hr. ( or less ) and let up but will wake up again 3-4 AM needing to urinate and have a repeat of the aching/ or just wake up with aching. This time I used an herbal med & at first that seemed to almost stop it but went in for the urine test anyway which at that time was negative for Bacteria. Was given an antibiotic anyway but due to effect on stomach, I only took half. Things seemd to be ok for abt 4 days after that but now am having mild stinging and same incidents at night, No Pus, Blood or so far feeling of restriction. I don't understand why this seems to be worse at night. I know one should use all of the prescribed meds and i will return to Dr. Tues if I can get in. Urine is mostly clear, tho occasional casts.\u00a0\u00a0Have read that Fibro can cause a sensetive Bladder.Thanks,PJ",
