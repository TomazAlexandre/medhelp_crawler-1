    "question": "I get the burning feet sensation all day/night -- I end up having to remove my shoes at work even though its not hot at all. When I do remove the shoes, the cold floor sensation is relatively better than burning feeling, but still uncomfortable (now, too cold). I do see correlation of this discomfort to my prev night alcohol consumption.",
