    "question": "wasn't sure where to direct my question. i'm 43 yrs old and diagnosed with type 1 diabetes about a year ago. 3 weeks ago, my palms became very red with a burning sensation. my finger tips began to feel numb. i can feel, but my sense of touch is really strange. it feels like i have gloves on that are too small and very tight. the skin on my palms and fingers has become very hard and leathery.my skin is now peeling on my fingers and palms and now my toes are starting to have the same numb sensation. my doctor was unsure what could be causing this. any ideas?",
