    "question": "Hi Everyone, I posted a few posts a while back and just wanted to update people and ask for your advice again as this is kind of worrying me.I am 19 years of age (male) weighing around 11.5 Stones and standing 5.5 feet tall approximately.I always seem to be very conscious about my heart rate recently. It seems to be around 45 - 60bpm resting. It's started to be like this very recently and never happened before.I do get feelings of dizziness and I panic about it every now and then.Sometimes I get a slight numbness down my left arm, or pins and needles in my left hand.I dont know if its relevant, bt sometimes especially when I wake up and try to use the toilet, I find it difficult to urinate, as if theres something blocking the flow? It doesnt happen all the time but most mornings it does, and som times throughout the day too.I've had every test known to man in the past and I was diagnosed with chronic anxiety in 2010 including the following tests:ECGs24 Hour ECGsBrain MRIsNeck MRIsPhysiotherapyFull Blood TestsChest XraysHeart UltrasoundNeck XraysCBT CounsellingTests for DiabetesAll have come back completely normal, and the most recent blood test (about a week ago) tested for absolutely everything, and still came back normal)I don't exercise much so I wonder why my heart rate is that slow?I keep worrying and thinking I'm going to die. It feels like my heart sometimes skips beats and its really terrifying. I try to tell myself I'm young and its very unlikely to be anything serious but nothing appears to help.It only really starts to bother me around 6 -7pm and especially if I'm laid down.I keep thinking the doctors have missed something and I find myself unable to stop worrying. The problem feels so serious and worrying, and especially when I get the numbness down my left side accompanied by the dizziness.Any help would be great guys.",
