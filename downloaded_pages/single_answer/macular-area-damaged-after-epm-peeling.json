    "question": "I had retinal detachment and vitrectomy with buckle on right eye on 1/7/07.\u00a0\u00a0On 4/15/07 had cataract surgery. Vision recovered. On 7/10/07, macular hole developed and doctor recommended to do vitrectomy with EPM peeling.\u00a0\u00a0Just after surgery, I realized my vision was blocked by a \"doggy-shaped\" dark area.\u00a0\u00a0Doc said my vitrous was cloudy due to hemmorage, so we waited.\u00a0\u00a0In 8/20/07, he said, he does not know why I have my macular area damaged.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I was so disappointed and went BCM Retina Center.\u00a0\u00a0The new doctor tells me my one of layers of my macular area is permanently damaged -- but no one tells why though.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect that I had complication due to the use of iodine based pigment interacting with hemorrhage the first doctor used during the second vitrectormy and EPM peeling in July.\u00a0\u00a0Any idea what to do or ...\u00a0\u00a0I cannot read with my right eye anymore.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I am worrying with my left eye, which has presbyopia and had laser sealing done on 1/7/07.\u00a0\u00a0I am 52 year oriental male. No diabetes.Can anyone tell what happened during the EPM peeling process???Any help will be appreciated.",
