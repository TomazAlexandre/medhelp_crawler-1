    "question": "28 weeks and tested abnormal for the one hour glucose test, so doc had me take the 3hour glucose test, which sucked! Results are I have become glucose intolerant with the pregnancy. Thankfully its not gestational diabetes but I have such a sweet tooth and can have almost no sugar ;( it has been driving me crazy gave in and bought sugar free candy but they don't have many choices. Just wondering if anyone else is going through the same thing???",
