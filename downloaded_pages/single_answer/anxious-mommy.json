            "answer": "well first the information im giving you may not be accurate im not a doctor of any kind. So please just take what im telling you only as information that has been given to me by other people.\u00a0\u00a0I know someone that has diabetes and high blood pressure (insulin dependent) that has had diabetes for 20 years and high blood pressure for 5 years she has 3 kids and pregnant rt. now with her 4th. so I will say to you take care of yourself by lowering your a1c count and drink plenty of water and diet cranberry juice to keep your kidneys flushed and lay off the starch. Then talk it over with your husband or boyfriend about it and be lead from there. But mainly get your diabetes under control before you take that step. Good luck on whatever you decide.",
