            "answer": "Hi there. It is important to make note that white matter lesions on a brain mri does not necessarily mean Multiple sclerosis. White matter lesions can be seen in various conditions. These represent micro vascular ischemic changes in the brain hence these white matter abnormalities on mri are common in patients who have microvascular and macro vascular risk factors like history of hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol. White matter signal changes on MRI are seen in infectious and other inflammatory conditions and migraine headaches. These white matter signal changes on brain mri need to be correlated to the history, clinical examination and other ancillary investigations. Hope this helps. Take care.",

    "question": "One of the issues listed on my MRI:There are numerous, greater than 20, punctate foci of T2/FLAIR hyperintense signal of the sub cortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally.\u00a0\u00a0There is also sparing of the junxtacortical white matter. What does this mean?Also,Nonspecific supratentorial white matter disease.\u00a0\u00a0No enhancement.\u00a0\u00a0Differential considerations includes changes of demyelination in the setting of multiple sclerosis, small vessel ischemic disease change in the right clinical setting as well as vasculitis change.\u00a0\u00a0Please correlate clinically.I need some answers if anyone can help.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
