    "question": "I am a 38 and female. I recently had some blood tests done due to some symptoms of: blurred vision, dizziness, fatigue, headache, night sweats, abdominal pain on the left side and some nausea, nosebleeds, numbness in feet, weightloss (50 -60 lbs in 7 mos), Joint and bone pain, weakness, Type 2 diabetes well controlled, lumps that come and go in my armpits, and leg and foot cramps. I had a referral to rheumatologist for the joint and muscle pain. She assessed that I had no arthritis or autoimmune issues. I have no infections known of. The Drs. do not seem concerned, but I am concerned with the symptoms combined with abnormal results. I'm concerned about maybe MGUS or cancers, as they run in the family. What are your thoughts?Tests were as follows:C-Reactive Protein \u2013 16.7\u00a0\u00a0H\u00a0\u00a0(<3.0)SPE:Albumin \u2013 3.0 L (3.4-5.0)Alpha-1\u00a0\u00a0- 0.3 (.15-.30)Alpha-2 \u2013 1.5 H (.65-1.20)Beta \u2013 1.5 H (.8-1.2)Gamma \u2013 2.1 H\u00a0\u00a0(.7-1.8)Total Protein\u00a0\u00a09.1 H\u00a0\u00a0(6.4-8.2)A/G ratio \u2013 0.7No Rheum.
