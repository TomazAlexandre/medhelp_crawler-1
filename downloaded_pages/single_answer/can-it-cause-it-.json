            "answer": "H. Pylori is a kind of bacteria. It lives in extremely acidic conditions. Some people have this bacteria in their gut and it can cause problems such as stomach ulcers. I don't know if it's understood why or how some people get these in their stomachs. Only an antibiotic will remove a bacterial infection. (Although that doesn't always work.)Yeast is a type of fungus, as different from bacteria as a plant is from a dog. It is naturally occurring on and in a body, however sometimes it does grow crazy and can cause an infection. This is thrush- which can be in the mouth, on the nipples, in the vagina and even between skin folds. It prefers a warm, moist place to grow. Only an anti fungal will remove a yeast infection. Some of the reasons yeast grows out of control is: it's in a place it shouldn't be such as a skin fold and nothing is competing against it so it has all the room it needs to grow. A similar reaction will be caused by antibiotics. An antibiotic will not kill a fungus but it can kill good bacteria. So if it kills too much of the bacteria that is supposed to be in/on you it leaves opportunity for yeast to grow out of control. A third cause I can think of is diabetes. People who have uncontrolled diabetes are more likely to get yeast infections -both oral and vaginal. I'm am sure there are more known and unknown reasons that cause yeast infections. If you have thrush in the mouth, see a doctor. I believe there is a prescription oral drug that both kills and relieves the symptoms.I hope I answered your questions.",
