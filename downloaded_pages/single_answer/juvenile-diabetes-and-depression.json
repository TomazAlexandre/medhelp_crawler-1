            "answer": "First, I'd like to point out that I had excellent grades in high school, I had participated in many academic activities, and I was suicidal simultaneously. Good grades in school does not equal current happiness or future success in life -- just something to keep in mind in case you are skeptical about your daughters possible suicidal ideation.I'd also like to point out that many psychiatrists/psychologists overdo the medication route and don't consider things such as diet and other medical conditions that affect the mind. The medical industry tends to treat the symptoms and not the causes. In many cases, that simply does not work. I'd find another psychologist or psychiatrist that takes other things into consideration. This person you have is just not competent in the mind-body connection area of science.Finally, I bet a support group of people her age that enforces sticking to her diet would do wonders for your daughter instead, and would probably clear up any problems with taking responsibility, possible suicidal ideation, and so forth. Google around for one in your area or check the phone book for one that exists in your area.Good luck with everything, and God bless.",
