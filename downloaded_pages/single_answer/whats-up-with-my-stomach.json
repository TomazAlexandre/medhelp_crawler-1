    "question": "So this happens randomly to me, sometimes I have it for weeks, sometimes days.When I think of certain food, my stomach turns. Not all foods, but some. I eat normally and as a college student, I try to have 3 meals a day. When I'm hungry, I usually always eat something unless I am too busy. I do have a history of anxiety, and I don't have diabetes, but my doctor did say I have blood sugar issues. Could it be that maybe? I'm 80% sure I'm not pregnant as well. But this is very random for me.",
