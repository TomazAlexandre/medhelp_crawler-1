            "answer": "Hello and sorry for what happened. Therapy for stroke will depend on whether it is hemorrhagic or ischemic. With low pressures, it could be ischemic. But like you already mentioned, now the doctors are trying to stabilize her, once done they may focus on rehabilitation. As the edema and inflammation in the brain subside, she may regain a few functions after which her doctors will decide what the best rehabilitation program is for her. Her dermatomyositis could be a limitation for her rehabilitation.For ischemic strokes, therapy is focused on increasing the blood supply to the brain with blood thinners like aspirin and controlling any high risk factors like hypertension or diabetes. So, you can discuss this with her treating physicians. Regards.",

    "question": "I need some advice \u2014 relatively quickly if possible.My significant other has Dermatomyositis. She contracted a bad case of pneumonia and I took her to the emergency room. She was admitted to ICU on 7/10/13 and at some point, the doctors think it was around 7/14/13, she had strokes on both sides of her brain. The doctors are not sure what caused the strokes, but one theory is low blood pressure.In the last week or so she has started to open her eyes and look around. Her eyes can stay open for a few seconds or up to 10 minutes. She also moves her mouth, but there has been no other movement. She does not respond to commands (blink, open your eyes, etc). It appears at times that she may understand when I am talking to her, but I understand that we tend to see what we want to see and she might not understand.She is still being treated for the pneumonia, and for other infections, but there has been no treatment for the strokes. She went from ICU to DOU (Direct Observation Unit) yesterday. The doctors are talking about moving her to a nursing care facility within the next couple of days. Rehabilitation, apparently, is not an option if the patient is not alert.I am afraid she is just being fast-tracked to a nursing home where she won't really receive any care for her stroke. This is a Kaiser facility and so far we have really had zero input into her care.Is there anything that can be done to treat the stroke? Is there anything I can ask the doctor to look for and/or do?",
