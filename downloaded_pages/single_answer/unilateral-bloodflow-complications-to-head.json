            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms are suggestive of marijuana side effects.Marijuana is one of the most commonly used and dangerous drug to be used.It has the same CNS depressant properties as alcohol.It causes CNS depression, increased heart rate, impaired coordination and balance, delayed reaction time,diminished short-term memory,anxiety and panic,nausea,vomitings,tremors ,sleepiness and altered body temperature.The other possibilities to be ruled out are alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium,calcium or potassium level),,vit B12 deficiency,neuropathy(esp in diabetes),neurological disorder and hypothyroidism.Without examination,it is very difficult to confirm a diagnosis.So I sincerely advise you to consult a physician and discuss these possibilities with him.Also pls try to leave smoking marijuana.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing or\u00a0\u00a0if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "I am a 21 year old male w/ bipolar disorder. Back in January, I was going through a period of hypomania, which, I must say, was the craziest, happiest and best month of my whole life. I felt like I was on top of the world. I was also smoking excess amounts of marijuana at the time, which elevated my euphoria. Everything was fine until one day it finally got out of hand. That night I was smoking a joint in my basement, and out of nowhere I just started freaking out(hardcore paranoia). But this wasnt just any ordinary pothead paranoia freak-out. I felt a massive rush up the left side of the back of my neck. My face turned bright red and felt like it was going to explode. My limbs started going numb and my palms were sweaty. When I started coming back down, I layed down and fell asleep. When I awoke the next morning, the entire left side of my head and face were tingly and stiff.It feels like somethings obstructing the bloodflow to the vessels in my head, particularly my temporal artery and the area on the back of my neck. Does this sound feasable? Its been bothering me for almost a year now and its to annoying to ignore. SOS",
