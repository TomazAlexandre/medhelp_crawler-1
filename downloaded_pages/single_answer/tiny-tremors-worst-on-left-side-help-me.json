            "answer": "Hi!Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You will need blood sugar monitoring, MRI of brain and cervical spine, T3, T4, TSH, sleep studies, serum electrolytes, brain EEG, etc to reach a diagnosis.Some of the tests you had, others you can discuss with your doctor.Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "hi I recently began noticing that I have some sort of vibrating/tiny tremors of my armas and legs. They are barely noticeable I began feeling a sensation of vibrating from my back all the way down to my legs. It is worse while at rest. I do not have slowed movement and I am 20. I have had an mRI, cat scan, blood tests all ok. Could this be Parkinson? I have not had changes in my writing skills. Could it just be anxiety or something else?
