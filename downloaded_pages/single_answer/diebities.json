            "answer": "Hi,I think that you should definitely start with some dietary changes, including decreasing the amount of simple carbohydrates and sweets, as well as possibly some calorie counting depending on your current weight. Meeting with a diabetes nutritionist is your best option for good dietary advice.Start exercise gradually with the goal of 30 minutes per day.Your numbers are quite high, especially your fasting glucose and cholesterol, so I think you should actually be started on medication now. I do not know if you need insulin based only on those numbers. But I encourage you to speak with your doctor soon to get started on treatment and tested to see if you should be on insulin from the start.take care.",
