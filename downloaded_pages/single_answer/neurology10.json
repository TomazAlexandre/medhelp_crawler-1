            "answer": "Hi!Yes, the symptoms you describe can be due to bulging spinal discs causing pinched nerves. The symptoms can also be due to fibromyalgia, electrolyte imbalance, hormonal imbalance, Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
