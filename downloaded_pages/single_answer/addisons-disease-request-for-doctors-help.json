            "answer": "Hi,Your symptoms certainly could be from Addison's or other forms of adrenal insufficiency , so you should be checked for those. Oddly enough, some people with pheochromocytomas do have low blood pressures at times, so if your other symptoms still fit the pattern you should be checked for it anyway.But you are right, high blood pressure is often seen in Pheos.take care.",

    "question": "I would like to ask if my symptoms could be due to Addison's Disease. A few weeks ago I asked you if I could have Diabetes or Thyroid Disease, and the advice you gave was great. In fact you mentionned getting checked for a Pheochromocytoma which is actually one of the things I am being checked for. However, my symptoms have changed somewhat although some are the same. Basically I am cold all the time which as you said could be due to a slightly high TSH. But I am now suffering from permanent hypotension, episodes of tachycardia, cold flushes, weight loss and I still have the sort of inner trembling/buzzing feeling at these times. When these episodes occur I do become very anxious. I just wanted to ask if this could actually be due to Addisons rather than a pheochromocytoma as my BP is never ever high as would be the case with the latter. Thank you very much.",
