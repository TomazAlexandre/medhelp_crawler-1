            "answer": "my 42 yr boyfriend had nose surgery to straighten his nose...ever since he has had moth ball breath...so strong it has changed our closeness... he is a candadate for every reason on this site that i have read...he was on strong antibiotics for slight sinus infection (drugs? ; sinusitis?) his mouth was very dry for 6 weeks from surgical nose plugs and not seen a dentist in 5 yrs (gum problems?) he is due to go and check his blood sugar as type 2 diabetes is suspect (keytones?) before we read this column we thought even something like cancer because he is a long time smoker, the smell is that bad...i dont feel that so much now having read all these stories...he is due to see dentist, doctor and nose specialist to get to the bottom - but he really hates this odor, he hates what it is doing to us - he likes to be clean and attractive, and this really throws a wrench into that",

    "question": "I just began searching for information about moth ball breath when i came across this site.i see that some other users have described the problem, but i see no remedies.My husband started having this breath like moth balls (not a sinus or tooth decay problem)after he began taking high blood pressure meds, as well as lipitor.He brushes,flosses,uses a water pik, as well as Listerine.Nothing helps.Anyone have a remedy, or also notice a connection between the above named meds and moth ball breathe (not like alcohol or other bad odors, but specifically like moth balls)?Thank you.",
