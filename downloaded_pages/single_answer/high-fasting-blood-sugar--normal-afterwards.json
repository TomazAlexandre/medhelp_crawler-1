            "answer": "A fasting blood sugar of 120 is considered pre-diabetes. Anything 126 and over is diabetes. No, it isn't normal and you should be getting other tests such as A1C which measures average blood sugar over a period of a couple months and/or OGTT which measures reaction to a sugary drink over a couple hours. If she is, in fact pre-diabetic as it sounds she needs to find out more about controlling blood sugar through diet and exercise. Being \"in good control of her diet\" for high cholesterol is not the same thing as diet for high blood sugar which involves lowering carbs.",
