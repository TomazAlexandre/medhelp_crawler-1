            "answer": "Hi,Piles is not one of the known causes of prostatitis.Risk factors for prostatitis include bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., stone, tumor, BPH), diabetes mellitus, a suppressed immune system, and urethral catheterization (i.e., small tube inserted into the bladder through the urethra to drain urine). Some sexually transmitted diseases (STDs; e.g., nongonnococcal urethritis, gonorrhea) increase the risk for developing bacterial prostatatis. Unprotected anal and vaginal intercourse can allow bacteria to enter the urethra and travel to the prostate.Regards.",
