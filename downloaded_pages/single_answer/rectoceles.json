            "answer": "Hi!Yes, POP (rectocele) can be corrected. The treatment is surgical. However prior to that the cause for the development of POP will need to be identified and corrected (such as lifting heavy weights\u2014need to learn ways to lift weight without putting pressure on the abdomen; chronic cough or constipation; diabetes and other metabolic disorders etc.). For those not preferring surgery, vaginal pessaries are fitted. Kegel and other pelvic floor exercises are taught to help strengthen the pelvic floor and reduce the need for surgery. Even if you undergo surgery, you will need to perform these exercises.Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!",
