    "question": "Hi,I have a problem of ear canal Paraesthesia for 9 months now. It started with a simple sensation of touching of the inside of the ear\u00a0\u00a0 only when quiet or not talking and stops when I talk or move my Jaw. Sometimes it increases in frequency and sometimes I have a hot sensation in the ear. All the symptoms are just mild in nature. MRI and CT scan were normal. Not dizzy and hearing is OK. Even the seventh nerve as per the MRI is OK.Please share your thoughts about a possible cause.Regards",
