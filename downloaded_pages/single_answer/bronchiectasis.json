            "answer": "I too have bronchiectasis (one day, I'll learn how to spell this), plus possible pulmonary fibrosis, definite GERD, sleep apnea and if that's not enough, diabetes thanks to prednisone (well at leaste I can pretend to eat healthy! ).Apparenly I have the dry kind of bronchiectasis, since I have no phlegm, and never have.\u00a0\u00a0I've had multiple (20) pneumonias since 2004, 6 of ;'em since 2/08.\u00a0\u00a0My recent PFT showed a 50% drop in numbers and a restrictive pattern rather than obstructive, which makes them pretty sure it's fibrosis, not copd - copd usually is a gradual decline, not an abrupt drop but IPF can have abrupt drops and improvements, drops and...you get the idea.Sounds like maybe it's not clearing up (maybe like my pneumonias, I don't know - some docs think they're aspiration, some don't - it's hard to get a straight answer, but then again, they can only guess based upon symptoms, and mine are pretty peculiar :/I had two tests early part of this week that I hope will determine whether or not I have IPF (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), because it's a fatal disease usually within 2-3 years of diagnosis, and then I can get moving - get myself on the transplant list, start taking meds to slow down the progress, and any other stuff that I can do to help myself.\u00a0\u00a0My doc came into my hospital room the day before discharge early August from my 6th stay, and said something about \"we are going to look at lung transplants, U of M, get things going\" and when I got out, my doc had those tests ordered.\u00a0\u00a0(an HRCT and echocardiogram).\u00a0\u00a0Usually pulmonary hypertension goes hand in hand with IDPF (with COPD too and sleep apnea).\u00a0\u00a0I know that I\"m retaining fluid (2+ pitting edema), but I don't know if it's from prednisone, right sided heart failure (a result of IPF), or what...I might call my doc Monday to let him know that lasix isn't cutting it.Hope this helps!\u00a0\u00a0God Bless!Gina-MI",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed as having a bronchiectasis problem. In the middle right lobe is the problem. I have been diagnosed only a few months , but I have complaints about an irritating feeling for over a year. After a treatment with Zithromax during several weeks, I was free of symptoms. But directly after some symptoms came back, especially the irritated feeling is the air-pipe.I there somebody who has about the same symptoms? I read that CF-patients also have many infections, caused by their lung-disorder.",
