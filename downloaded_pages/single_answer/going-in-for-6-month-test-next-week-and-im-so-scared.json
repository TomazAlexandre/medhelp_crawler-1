    "question": "Okay i tested negative at 2 1/2, 5 1/2, 8 and 12 weeks......i had every symptom known to ARS swollen testicles,pain in lower abs,diarea,fatigue etc.... Well its been 6 months since my possible exposure, it happend on May 5th. Well i am going next week for my 6 month blood test and am very scared....I have been feeling ill for 6 months, the palms of my hands have a blotchy blood flow and have been sweaty, my feet sweat like crazy, my underarms sweat like crazy. I also have had a sore throat that comes and goes and for 4 weeks recently and i have been getting sick alot these past 6 months, my underarms also hurt, im always tired, I have had a cough for 4 weeks striaight as well and i have floaters in my left eye and my vision in the dark is snowy(this started about a month and half ago)....I just havent felt myself one bit this whole time, im not stressed out i dont even think about this **** anymore, my doctor said i was totally negative after my 4th test. But my G/F of 4 years keeps having a swollen lymph node in leg and has been having horrible back pain and gets sick like i do. Im thinking maybe MONO that has gone untreated or Syphillis?!?!?! Uhhhhh this *****, I also drink heavily about 3 nights a week, but i have been doing that for awhile, this **** all started after my sex encounter....She recently went to the hospital for 3rd degree burn treatments, i dont know if they blood test you while your in the E.R. with that type of problem, but i havent heard a damn thing about her having it. Im worried stress may have triggered a cancer, diabetes, liver problems etc.....The first 2 run in my family.",
