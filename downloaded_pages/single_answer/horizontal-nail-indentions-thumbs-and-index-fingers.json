            "answer": "Hello,These horizontal lines sound like Beau\u2019s lines. They are horizontal and going across the nail. It may be caused by an infection or problem in the nail fold, trauma, coronary occlusion, hypocalcaemia, skin disease, and may be a sign of systemic disease. It may also be caused by an illness of the body, such as diabetes, psoriasis or certain medicines. I would like you to consult a dermatologist and get investigated for all these causes.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I recently noticed that I have horizontal indentions on both of my thumbs as well as my index fingers. None of the nails have had any form of trauma to them.I have a very healthy diet and take vitamins. I have in the last few months had issues with raynauds (primary) yet I have no systemic issues or other autoimmune problems. Although my issues with raynauds rarely affects my thumbs. I also have had some issues with stomach problems having been presribed prilosec along with some antacid use.I am just curious if this is normal or if I should be concerned about possible underlying issues.",
