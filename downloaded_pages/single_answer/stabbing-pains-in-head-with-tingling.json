            "answer": "Hello,From the description of your symptoms the stabbing pain that you are having can be due to cluster headache. There is severe shooting pain and is located behind the eye (periorbital) or in the temple, sometimes radiating to the neck or shoulder.Diagnosed by PET scans during active headaches. Over-the-counter pain medications (such as aspirin, paracetamol, and ibuprofen) typically have no effect on the pain from a cluster headache.It is treated by triptans,steroids and calcium channel blockers.Tingling that you are having all over the body can be due to vit B 12 deficiency or abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body.Take multivitamin multimineral supplements for some days and see if they help.If the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist and get other possibilities like diabetes,hypothyroidism and neurological disorders ruled out.Hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
