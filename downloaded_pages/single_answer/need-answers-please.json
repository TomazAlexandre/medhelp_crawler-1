    "question": "Yes, Im 26 years old. I have been to two diffrent local hospitals and both have done Cat Scans, blood work, urine work etc. But the results come back negative. Some times I feel very out of breath and feel like fainting. But most of the time I just get dizzy spells, and my muscles on my left side of the face just twitch. Can It be due to the asault that I recived during work. I got hit in the back of my head back in 2005. I work in the prison system. Diabetes does run in my family though I have been check but come back negative. High Blood pressure also runs in my family, I have had that during the times going to the hospital but once there I calm down and it gets back normal. Im going to see a neuroligist in August. I think I cant wait till then due to me being worried.",
