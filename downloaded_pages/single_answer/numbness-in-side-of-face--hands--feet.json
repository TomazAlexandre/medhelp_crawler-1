            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Well yes, TIA or transient ischemic attacks which are precursors of strokes are a huge possibility. However there are many causes of numbness like:\u2022\tInjury to a nerve -- for example, a neck injury may cause you to feel numbness anywhere along your arm or hand, while a low back injury can cause numbness or tingling down the back of your leg\u2022\tPressure on the spinal nerves, such as from a herniated disk\u2022\tLack of blood supply to an area -- for example, plaque buildup from atherosclerosis in the legs can cause pain, numbness, and tingling while walking (this is called vascular claudication)\u2022\tOther medical conditions, including:o\tCarpal tunnel syndromeo\tDiabeteso\tMigraineso\tMultiple sclerosiso\tSeizureso\tStrokeo\tTransient ischemic attack (TIA)o\tUnderactive thyroido\tRaynaud's phenomenono\tAbnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your bodyo\tA lack of vitamin B12 or other vitamino\tCertain medicationso\tToxic action on nerves, such as that from\u201dRefer: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003206.htm You can read more about this on this link. Rule out the possibilities one by one. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.GERD or gastric reflux could be the cause of your chest pain.Omeprazole is a good drug to combat this. Along with it you can try over the counter antacids. Avoid heavy meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Go to bed at least 2 hours after food.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "HelloI have been to the ER several times for sever chest pains and numbness of extremities. I was sent home after all the chest symptoms were looked at, blood tests, ekg, all came back normal. no diabetes, good cholesterol, no anemia, blood clots, etc. Since then many of my chest pains have subsided, I've had a stress test that i passed with an A plus. My concern is all the doctors seem to be over looking the numbness i've been feeling on and off -and are more concerned with the chest pains that they have all ruled out - numbness in the left side of my face and sometimes in my arms and feet. I was prescribed adivan and paxil, adivan I quit after a few month ( i tapered off) because it was making my chest pains worse. I have not had an MRI - nor have\u00a0\u00a0I seen a neurologist. The other symptoms are mild vision disturbances from time to time (like a veil is on my head), very mild pressure behind my eyes sometimes and pressure in my head that will move around, and a numbness or mild burning sensation in the right side of my face and ear, dizziness on and off throughout the day, my muscles tense up from time to time too. I've also been waking up with my feet numb every now and then. I went to a homeopathic doctor and the medicine he prescribed just seemed to make the symptoms worse. I was told that adivan withdrawl can last awhile and mimic phantom symptoms (which i won't deny my symptoms worsened after I quit the adivan) but my question is should I be concerned and look for other problems immediatly. i'm 27 - don't smoke, have no early history of heart diseas, cancer, tumors, ms, or anything like that. Some early diabetes (40s) and strokes related to diabetes (late 40s) run in my family but the family members were not taking care of themselves.",
