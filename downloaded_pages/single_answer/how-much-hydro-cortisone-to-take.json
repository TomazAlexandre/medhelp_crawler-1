            "answer": "Infections do call for an increase in HC.Usually if one runs a fever, you have to start to increase. With a fever, one can double or even triple a dose temporarily. Sometimes you just need to add 5-10mg - it takes knowing what you need.You are taking a pretty hefty dose to begin with - so you may be tired as you may have steroid induced cushing's. 20mg is the usual replacement dose.I have no adrenals. I would also make sure you are taking enough salt, and fluids. Do you take florinef?",

    "question": "Hi,I was diagnosed with adrenal gland insufficiency last year and I take 30-35 mg hydro cortisone a day. Today my dentist told me that I have a bad infection in my jar and a tooth needs to be pulled. Because of my other health problems (diabetes, low thrombozytes) I need to go to a clinic next week. I feel very weak and tired and wonder if I need to increase the hydro cortisone until the tooth is pulled. I am taking antibiotic medication and cannot reach my endocrinologist. Has anybody had the same situation and know if and by how much the hydro cortisone needs to be increased? Any direction would be helpful!Thanks in advance,Bob",
