    "question": "I have type 2 diabetes and have had since 1989. I take glucovance for it two times a day. I have recently developed a rash on my lower legs that is like heat rash in appearance. It itches quite a lot in the day but not severly until night time when my legs get hot from my diabetes. I have never had it before and thought it might be because my dr. put me on a higher dose of glucovance. What do you think?",
