            "answer": "You really don't give enough information in your post to respond. How long have you been diagnosed Type 2? I'm assuming your doctor tried you on diet, exercise and oral meds for awhile before those stopped working? If your body is no longer making sufficient insulin, than there is no alternative but to take insulin externally. We can't live without insulin whether from internal sources, external or a combination of the two. You need to consult with your doctor about the nature of your \"liver problems\" and what can be done about that. When you say you are unhappy with the injections, what do you mean? You hate using needles? That is normal. One other option is to switch from MDI's to the pump which means you will not have to do injections 4 or more times a day. Are you unhappy because your blood glucose numbers are not good? Talk with your doctor about adjusting your insulin doses and learn how to minimize those dose needs with exercise and diet.",
