            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Heart causes will be ruled out fully only if a TMT and ECHO are done. EKG can be normal at rest and when you do not have pain.If you have chest pain along with hemifacial numbness, then it can be a bad gastric reflux as well. Take Omeprazole empty stomach in morning and an antacid gel at bedtime. Refrain from smoking, alcohol, fuzzy drinks and spicy food.Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, Bell\u2019s palsy, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth, dental caries, etc\u00a0\u00a0can all cause facial numbness and pain.A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hello I'm a 36 year old female fairly good health except that I smoke about a pack of cigarettes a day. Over the last year I've been experiencing right sided facial numbness and blurred vision which sometimes feels like my eye is crossed but its not. It lasts anywhere from 5-10 minutes sometimes longer. I've had an MRI, ct scan and blood work and everything has come back \"normal\".\u00a0\u00a0I don't get migraines just an occasional mild headache that aspirin takes care of.\u00a0\u00a0I've recently been getting chest pain on my left side under my breast that takes my breath away and it lasts about 2-3 minutes. I've also been experiencing dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions on what this is all from?\u00a0\u00a0I thought maybe heart disease of some sort but the Ekg I had was fine according to the doctors. Should I be asking for some other test?\u00a0\u00a0I'm really getting nervous about it because it is happening more and more and the doctors don't have any answers for me. I just get this feeling that they are missing something or I should be asking for different tests. At this point my pcp isn't taking it seriously. Any help would be appreciated",
