            "answer": "These numbers, 21 (378) and 12 (216) are quite high. Blood tests are the correct way to check glucose levels. The urine test was testing for something different. What is your doctor doing to treat your diabetes? He should be having you change your diet to reduce carbs and giving you an oral medication. Those numbers need to come down and you will feel much better.",
