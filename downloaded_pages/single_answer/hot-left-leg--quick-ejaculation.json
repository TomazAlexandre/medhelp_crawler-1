            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You probably have deep vein thrombosis affecting the leg and penile veins. A duplex ultrasound is required for diagnosis. Other than this premature ejaculation can be due to due to anxiety to perform. It could also be due to building up of sexual tension and arousal happening too fast. You should discuss this with your partner and both of you should pace yourself such that he ejaculates at the right time. However if there is a problem in maintaining erection too, then there may be some other problem too like use of drugs, diabetes, low testosterone, varicoceles, neurological or vascular problems (peripheral vascular disease, heart or thyroid conditions) etc.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
