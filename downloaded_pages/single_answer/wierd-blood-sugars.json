            "answer": "Yes, you absolutely should see a doctor. You are correct that people who don't have diabetes don't generally see numbers like 212 or 34 and both are dangerous (212 for longterm complications and 34 for diabetic coma).I'm sorry but I think you may be right that you have diabetes and you should have it taken care of ASAP.Good luck to you!",

    "question": "Hi everyone.I'm 22 years old and recently I've noticed some changes in my blood sugars that kinda have me worried.\u00a0\u00a0The other day I developed one of the worst cases of cotton mouth I've ever had while I was at work.\u00a0\u00a0When I got home I had my mom check my sugar.\u00a0\u00a0She's been diabetic since she was 10 years-old, so I knew dry mouth and thirst were signs of high blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0My sugar was 212, so Mom basically flipped, and we've been checking my sugar off and on for the last two days now.Every time we've checked, other than that first time, my sugar has been low.\u00a0\u00a0I did have a 97 reading (yay!), but the others have been 79, 70, and 34... 34!\u00a0\u00a0Isn't that kinda bad?\u00a0\u00a0Would a normal person's sugar swing like this?\u00a0\u00a0I haven't changed my diet or eaten anything... abnormal.\u00a0\u00a0At the time of the 34 blood sugar, I also felt extremely tired and my mom said I was pale and my eyes were glassy.\u00a0\u00a0I kinda knew it was going to be low because of the way I was feeling.Should I see a doctor?\u00a0\u00a0I'm afraid I may have diabetes, but I thought at the onset of diabetes your sugars stayed high all the time?\u00a0\u00a0What do you think I should do?",
