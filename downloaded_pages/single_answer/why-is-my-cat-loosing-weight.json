            "answer": "I can see your concern, I'd be nervous too!\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes in a multiple cat household, if there's not enough dishes out- the other cats might be eating her share of food.\u00a0\u00a0When I had 3 cats at one time, that happened to my submissive cat-she didn't get enough to eat.\u00a0\u00a0Boy, did I feel awful about it!\u00a0\u00a0So, ya see, it could be something that's as easy to correct as that is.Are there any other symptoms that you can think of?\u00a0\u00a0Potty habbits, appetite, playing etc.?\u00a0\u00a0This could also be diabetes, kidney disease, hyperthyroid and other conditions as well.Your best bet is to get this looked into.\u00a0\u00a0It's not normal by any stretch for a cat to lose half her body weight like that.Good luck!\u00a0\u00a0Please post an update and any other additional symptoms, we will be able to help more!",

    "question": "I have a three year old cat that seems perfectly healthy other than the fact that she has lost a huge amount of weight. She was extremely overweight when I rescued her from the shelter that I work at, but now she is half the acat that she was. She was tested for fiv and leuk, but came back negative. She did have alot of fleas, which I have given her a capstar and bathed her for, and I gave her a droncit incase she had tapes. What could be making her loose weight? None of my other cats are, just her.",
