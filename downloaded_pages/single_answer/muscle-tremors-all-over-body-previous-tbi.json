            "answer": "Dear Friend,Many thanks for the post.We are aware of the main cause of this problem.We need to find out if something from the brain itself is causing this issue or not. Sometimes there are Sharpnells insude the brain which may be causing this symptoms.Hence the best way is to get a CT scan done, for the brain, which would help us to know the main cause (whether some physical problem inside the brain is causing all these things or not).Once the CT scan is done, then we can plan ahead.I have not suggested you for the MRI scan, as if there are some sharpnells present, then it may be magnetic in nature and can cause some serious damage to the life, while doing MRI scanning.Beside this, there doesn't appears a single other reason, which can be causing this issue.Please feel free to discuss further.Regards.",
