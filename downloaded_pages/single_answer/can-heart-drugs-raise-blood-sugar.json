    "question": "I have been on heart medicines for more than four years following ischemic MI in 2007. During last two years I find my blood glucose gradually raising from absolutely normal to 115 (fasting) and 150 (PP).I did not have any problem of blood sugar or high bp prior to MI. Post MI also I am leading very desciplined lifestyle in terms of diet (low fat low sugar, greens etc.), exercise, stress and medications. No smoking or drinking.Looks like one/some of the drugs I take could be causing this. I am worried this make take serious proportions after some time.Can someone advise on what could be causing this and what could be remedial measure to stop this deterioration.I take ACE-I Ramipril, betablocker Carvidilol, asprin/clopidogrel, statins, dieuratics, aldectone.I will be highly thankful for your feedback and advise.Regards",
