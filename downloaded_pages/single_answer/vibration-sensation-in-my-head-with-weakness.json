            "answer": "Hi!I think I have answered this earlier and you mentioned something about diabetes being controlled by diet and exercise and you putting on weight. Recheck your diabetes and HbA1c status\u2014you may find that diabetes is not under control. Also, you may be having diabetic neuropathy due to long standing border line or fluctuating high blood sugar.Another possibility is a pinched nerve in neck. It can also be low vitamin B12. So pleaseconsult your doctor regarding this as soon as you can. Hope this helps.

    "question": "I often get a vibration sensation in my head that is very brief (a sec or few) and is accompanied by feeling like I might fall (almost feeling like I am being pulled down) . I have noticed that sometimes I feel like it's harder to move my body (especially hands and fingers) than normal for a little while afterward. I really have no idea what is causing this and it has been going on for about 5-6 years. It used to only be the falling feeling. The vibration sensation started about 3 years ago. Thank you to whomever takes the time to read and respond; I would really like to know what is going on, as it concerns me while driving...etc.",
