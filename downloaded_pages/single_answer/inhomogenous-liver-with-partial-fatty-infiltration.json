            "answer": "Hi there!Well, these tests aim at looking for possible causes of neuropathy in your case. If blood sugar levels have been normal despite Type1 diabetes marker positive, diabetes is an unlikely cause, normal B12 also rules itself out as a cause with other metabolic causes and heavy metal poisoning may need to be considered in the situation. Peripheral neuropathy is generally irreversible unless an early side effect of medications and is largely managed symptomatically. The medications may take some time to act, though id these do not seem to work; a few other medications may be tried instead.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
