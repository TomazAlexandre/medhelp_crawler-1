    "question": "My Story, on the 1st of June whilst in Spain I met a local girl in a night club, I went back to her home and we had unprotected vaginal sex and I performed oral on her, she assured me she was clean and she asked if I had a condom but was happy to have sex without as there wasn't any condoms available.She came whilst I was inside her and I pulled out and ejaculated, I washed a few hours later and left.The next day I had a mouth ulcer appear, I thought this was strange as I never get them and I never really suffer with any ailments, I felt tingling in my penis and the tip felt itchy.The next day I developed a thickly cough that lasted for 3-4 days andA few days later I went to a uk GU clinic for tests for every STD including HIV blood test, all negative, 10 days after exposure I felt nausea and I was physically sick for 2 days and I felt very fatigued and tire and I developed all over body itching like a sharp itch in all areas at random times.on the 20th June I spoke to my GP and they advised me to get a Liver/kidney and diabetes blood test - all negative, a few days later 3.5 weeks after exposure I had a very sore neck and I felt muscle aches in my upper body and joints.The neck pain subsided on the 5 July but i still felt a slight sore throat and I developed a rash on my right shoulder and the back of my neck that looked like a cluster of spots slightly raised bumps and flaky skin.I also got some skin tags develop under my arm pits and I had all over body itching still.My rash is still present on week 7 and I am soon going to be tested at week 8.I know with all the symptoms I am pretty much a closed case but I just need some views and opinions to ensure that I'm not over reacting.Please be honest, do you think I have HIV?I know you cant pin point HiV with symptoms and I know I was stupid for having unprotected sex, also I know testing a 3 months is the answer, I just want some opinions and thoughts from others that may be in the same situation or people that have tested negative with similar symptoms etc Help!!!!Do I have any chance of getting out of this negative?",
