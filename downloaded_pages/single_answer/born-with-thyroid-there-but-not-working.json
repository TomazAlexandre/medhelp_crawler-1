            "answer": "People stop by from time to time and say \"hello, and by the way, I was born with no thyroid\". It is not terribly common, but your daughter is not alone.As you can see, there are other threads listed (in blue) from such people, below my reply. The ones I have talked to personally have had minor difficulties over the years, but by and large they are going to college and living normal lives.It is something akin to Diabetes in as much as the thyroid hormone levels will need to be monitored frequently and dosage changes will come along that will rock the boat from time to time. Trying to maintain the proper hormone levels can be a bit of a balancing act.It will be a lifelong issue for your daughter, but if she is treated properly she has a very good chance of living a normal life.",
