    "question": "Hi everyone, i'm 15 years old and quiet a bit overweight. Lately i've been getting pain like everywhere, on my neck, chest, abdomen and back this pain is pretty strong but it is not constant. I done some research people said this might be swollen lymph nodes and etc.These days i found 4 of these little tiny red spots i believe its called petechiae, they are like the size of a pins point and it is bright red. It is located on my right arm starting from the back of my hand all the way to the elbow, it sort of makes a curve. Now i get frequent sore feeling on my whole right arm, also my left upper leg and i guess around pelvic as well as headache.I do sweat a lot these days and been drinking heaps of water, but i believe this is caused by summer. However i never sweaten this much before. I did had some nosebleeds as well, but i do nosebleed a lot before until my doctor told me to use nasal spray and it helped me stop bleeding for around a month. The nosebleed are not hard to stop but it comes all in a sudden or when i poke my nose.I have went to my family doctor a month ago before i had red spots and sore feeling. I went there because i had abdominal pain and loss of appetite. I had a blood test (don't know what kind of blood test is it) and an x-ray on abdomen, i was told that i am all fine but low on 'good' cholestrol due to lack of exercise.I do not have too many symptoms of leukemia but are there a chance? Could a simple blood test from my family doctor detect anything?(took blood test before having red spots and other symptom)\u00a0\u00a0Also my parents never had any cancer before.Or am i just too worried and need to calm down to stop thinking of these things?",
