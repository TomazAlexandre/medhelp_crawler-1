Please tell your parents to get you an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'd go easy on the exercise until you get some answers.",

    "question": "Hi I am a 16yr old boy who is about 140-145lbs of weight. I recently started exercising a lot more as I used to just play basketball. Well I've also started to lift weights along with playing basketball. I'm not considered the most active guy and I really think I'm pushing my body to its limits with this exercise out of nowhere. Well with the weight lifting and basketball that I've been doing, I've experienced these headaches and blurred vision along with nausea with some of them. I looked it up online and saw that it could be hypoglycemia, but this relates with diabetes right? So I'm like freaking out right now. I've had a problem with a sweet tooth, but I learned how to calm that down. Also I talked to my grandmother and she said the problem could be that I don't eat before I exercise and bring the appropriate items to keep me fueled up (like Gatorade, water, light snacks, etc). I'm really nervous right now and don't know what to do please help me. I also found out online it could be\u00a0\u00a0kidney damage? Please help and if there any tips to help me build lean muscles that would be greatly appreciated and what type of exercise plan I need to have and maybe what I should eat and not eat. Thank you so much and I apologize for the very long paragraph, but I just don't know what to do.",
