            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I would suggest you look for generalized causes like Vit D or B12 deficiency, hormone imbalances, calcium deficiency, hypothyroidism, parathyroid disease, diabetes and maybe even anemia. There is a chance you have deep vein thrombosis too.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
