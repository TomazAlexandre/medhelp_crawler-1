            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!From what you have explained in your post, it does sound like an anxiety and panic disorder. The treatment is by Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) with or with out medication. This includes muscle relaxation training, breathing relaxation training and gradual exposure to situations that cause you to panic under expert guidance. Stress can be reduced by adopting yoga in daily life. Also sessions are held to understand your thought process that leads you to panic.The other common cause is acidity. Take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
