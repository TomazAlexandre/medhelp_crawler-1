            "answer": "Hello,Four possibilities are there.Fistly,it can be a boil or furuncle. Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders.Secnd possibility is of swollen lymph node.They are caused by infections(viral or bacterial ) but can be caused in cancers also.Third possibility if of herpes sores which are commonly found in the anogenital region of women.Lastly,it can be sebaceous cyst. Sebaceous cyst is a closed sac or cyst and fills with a fatty white, semi-solid material called sebum produced by sebaceous glands of the epidermis.It is usually painless but can become painful if infected.I sincerely advise you to get evaluated for these possibilities from a dermatologist as without clinical examination,confirmation of a diagnosis is tough.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.",
