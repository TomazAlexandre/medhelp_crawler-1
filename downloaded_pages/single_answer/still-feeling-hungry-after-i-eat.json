            "answer": "Hi there,It may be difficult for me to determine the cause of your symptoms without an evaluation. Diabetes mellitus, peptic ulcer, worm infestation and hyperthyroidism are few conditions which can lead to unintentional weight loss. I will advise you to rule out above mentioned possibilities. You may try eating foods that are low-energy dense and which are low in calories. When a person eats low-calorie foods he/she is able to eat more of them, which can stretch the stomach and activate the hormone receptors that trigger feelings of fullness. I sincerely hope it helps.Take care and regards!",
