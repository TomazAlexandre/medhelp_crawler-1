    "question": "Okay I am a 21 year old male I am obese and I really up till about a month ago never really had \"good\" hygein.\u00a0\u00a0Well I started noticing my neck was kind of light brown like it had just built up dirt and I have tried scrubbing it with many different body soaps and under my armpits I also noticed that they are kind of light brown.I was considering this was most likely just dirt that embedded itself good in my neck and such but no matter how hard i scrub it doesnt want to come completely clean.\u00a0\u00a0Then I started doing an online search on what I could use to clean my neck and I came across an article about Acanthosis Nigricans.Now diabetes does run in the family somewhat as I believe about 2-3 of my relatives have/had diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This got me worrying alot because I am only 21 but I am obese.\u00a0\u00a0And the thought of Diabetes just impacted me.Now I know Acanthosis Nigricans can be treated since it is \"pre-diabetes\" and I have a doctors appointment in a few weeks and am going to get tested.\u00a0\u00a0If I shape up and start eating better/get out more with Dr's advice would I be okay?I have never liked being obese but for me it has always been hard to lose weight/stick to a diet but now that I learned about this I am seriously thinking about taking my life in another direction.So I guess i want to ask is there really any other symptoms to Acanthosis Nigricans than browning skin around the neck and other places?",
