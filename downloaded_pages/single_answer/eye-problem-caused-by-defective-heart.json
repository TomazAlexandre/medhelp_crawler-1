    "question": "Dear Doctor:I have symptomatic retina detachment and have been diagnosed a year a a half ago.\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks ago I have another happening and went to my Retina Specialist.\u00a0\u00a0He told me he thinks that I will have a detachment within 2 months.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have diabetes, but am concerned that the reason why my retinas are so thin is because oxygen is not sufficient.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't discussed this with him.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure is really low, 100/59 was the last reading.\u00a0\u00a0I did have a blood pressure of 117/80 about 3 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0I sometimes have irregular heartbeats and palpatations.\u00a0\u00a0My Carbon Dioxide levels in my blood have risen from around 24 to now the highest normal level.\u00a0\u00a0I'm concerned that oxygen is not getting to my eyes or my brain.\u00a0\u00a0Am I on the right track or way off base?\u00a0\u00a0I asked my doctor about the levels and he didn't seem concerned, but don't these all tie into the other?",
