Peeing a lot can be due to a UTI or conditions like diabetes mellitus.It is suggested to consult your doctor. The most important laboratory test is a urine analysis. It may be possible that you may need antibiotics depending on the culture sensitivity report. I sincerely hope that helps. Keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",
