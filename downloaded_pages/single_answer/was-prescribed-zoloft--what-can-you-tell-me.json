            "answer": "Everyone's experience is different. It isn't like a Tylenol that pretty much everyone who takes it will get some degree of relief from pain. Some people can't get any relief from ANY anti-anx meds but one out of the two I trialed worked well for me.I see you have had some health issues. GERD which can drive anyone anxious and depressed, pre diabetes and you mention some anger issues. I had heartburn for the last 6 years but it mysteriously eased up in the last 18 months. I still get it once in a while. Have you tried to isolate the cause? I followed a bland diet for a few months cutting out the culprits. It seems sipping water to dilute the acid, avoiding hot foods and onions were the best things for me to do.I would take meds as a last resort and would see a therapist first. With the therapist, I would work on the anger issue as that can be a flashpoint for stomach upset\u00a0\u00a0too. Here is an excerpt from a CNN article on anxiety and dep.\"my therapist, explained how our thoughts, feelings, moods and behavior were interwoven, and taught me how to identify negative, self-defeating thoughts and replace them with positive, life-affirming thoughts.\"http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/04/health/ramprasad-depression/index.html?hpt=hp_t3",
