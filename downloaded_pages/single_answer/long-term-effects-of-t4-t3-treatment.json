            "answer": "Untreated hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism can cause permanent damage to the body system,\u00a0\u00a0as well as med. induced suppressed levels or even undermedication to the hypo end.\u00a0\u00a0TSH suppressed levels are .1 to .01 or less.\u00a0\u00a0There will be a difference in levels from Lab to Lab because they use different procedures, so you will see variations of levels.There should be no problems as long as a person is properly treated and stays within their Labs reference range with meds.\u00a0\u00a0 To do this a person need monitoring and tested on a regular bases and\u00a0\u00a0meds. adjusted as needed to that of the thyroid issue and treatment.Levothyroxine - - Synthroid , Unithroid, Levoxyl and Levothroid thyroid hormone medicationsdoes not cause\u00a0\u00a0long term health issues. They are not a chemical meant to trick our system in any way.\u00a0\u00a0It is not toxic like other medications since it is made the same as our naturally occurring thyroid hormone.ATDs\u00a0\u00a0that treat hyperthyroidism, are another matter, they cause liver problems, sometimes resulting in death. They can cause decreased levels of red and white blood cells and platelets. This may cause an increased risk of infection, serious bleeding, anemia, and other problems and\u00a0\u00a0lower the activity of the immune system making you susceptible to infections. Some brands interferes with the conversion\u00a0\u00a0of T4 to T3.T-3 is used for conversion problems.\u00a0\u00a0But some people say they feel better taking it. However there is no scientific study that proves such, in fact the opposite.T3 causes higher than normal blood levels of this hormone, posing a risk for dangerous cardiac arrhythmias and heart attacks, especially for elderly individuals or anyone with heart disease. Thus most thyroid patients are treated with thyroxin alone and generally feel well.Some people develop TED when they take animal-based extracts such as Armour, because the immune system\u00a0\u00a0react to foreign proteins found in glandular extracts. Synthetic meds. doesn't cause this problem. Armour Thyroid tablets should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease and it may increase the symptoms of diabetes, mellitus, diabetes inspidus or adrenal insufficiency\".If a person gets treated before damage and treated properly, there should be no health issues other than that in which has already been done or caused by and from other health conditions.",

    "question": "I don't know much about the thyroid, can someone explain some things to me?I know with the adrenal gland that artificial hormones like corticosteroids can shut down the gland and cause it to irreversably atrophy (president Kennedy had this problem). Does treatment with T4 or T3 cause irreversible atrophy of the thyroid gland?How does medication actually help? In my mind it seems like if your thyroid levels are low and you supplement with T4 or T3 that your body would respond by just lowering natural production until you were hypothyroid again or you were completely dependent on medication.If either of these is true (suppression occurs due to treatment and suppression causes permanent atrophy), what is done about it? Is there a bare minimum TSH where anything below that causes permanent thyroid gland damage or long term health effects? I've heard 0.5 TSH is the minimum, but I have heard it was lowered to 0.3 and some people are at 0.2 and feel fine.",
