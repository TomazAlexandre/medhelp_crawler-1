            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms it looks like boils. The other possibility was of herpes sores but your mentioning that it is full of thick pus, lessens its chances. Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil.Apply warm compresses on the boil and keep the area clean. Drainage of the boil is done only when it becomes soft and forms a head. Take some over the counter pain reliever and consult a doctor for examination and antibiotics prescription. If there are recurrent boils, then please get your blood sugar levels estimated as recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
