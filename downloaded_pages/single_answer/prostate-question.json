            "answer": "HI,There is no real association between prostatic abscesses and sexual abstinence. Abscesses are caused by infectious agents. Sexual intercourse with multiple partners or with a partner with an infection predisposes to acquiring an infection. Other patients who may be predisposed to developing infections are those who have large prostates with obstructive symptoms (as the stasis favors the accumulation of microorganisms). Some medical problems such as diabetes render the fight against infection less effective. Some patients who have diabetes may have erectile dysfunction and hence may have less sexual intercourse. Under such a scenario, there may be some truth to the statement of the urologist (but I think this was spoken in jest), but the association is due to the defective immune system and the prostate abscess, not the erectile dysfunction/sexual abstinence and the prostate abscess. This was why I used the term \u201creal association\u201d, because a relationship may indeed be made if you select certain populations.There is no specific sign for prostate cancer, but this would be among the things that the urologist would have to consider for your age group. In general, a PSA of higher than 4 would raise the suspicion for malignancy, but if you have some other findings such as an abnormal rectal examination \u2013 a consideration for malignancy may be significant enough to raise the topic of performing a biopsy (or sampling the prostate to look specifically for cancer).Stay positive.",

    "question": "I am a 55 year old male who has recently had symptoms pf prostatitis. Went to my family Dr. who treated me withCiprofloxicin for 3 weeks, with no results. He advised he would send me to a Urologist for further evaluation. The Urologist conducted a DRE and PSA test. The PSA result was 2.44. The Doctor now wants to do a cystoscopy on me to try and determine the cause of my symptoms. He said he suspects an abscess on my prostate.\u00a0\u00a0I am having pain in my lower back, above hips, above belly button, left testicle, and lower abdomen. I started out several weeks ago with pain on the tip of my penis, and in my urethra but those have disappeared. I asked him what could cause a abscess and his reply was lack of sex. Is this true or was he joking? Could this also possibly be prostate cancer? Any answers would be appreciated.....Dave",
