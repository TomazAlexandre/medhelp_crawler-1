            "answer": "I think the doctor is just making sure all the bases are covered with the neurology referral as you have significant medical history in this area. This is an appropriate step for a doctor who does not specialise in such things. However, I would be concerned that you have any connection to your diabetes ruled out. Bilateral reflex issues wouldn't be a common presenting sign for MS, and it's usually best to rule out the most likely causes before moving on to the less likely one. In the words of the girl in the commercial, \"why not both?\" If you've already been given a referral, you may as well make and keep the appointment. But I'd be speaking with my endocrinologist too.",

    "question": "I'm 54 and was in a car accident when I was 17. I was on large amounts of pain killers for migraines for almost 20 years. 2 years ago I got off of all the drugs but have since been diagnosed with diabetes, sleep apnea, silent reflux, low blood pressure and a heart murmur. I've had epilepsy all my life, but the seizures seem to have gotten much worse the past 3 to 4 years. The doctor told me that I had no reflexes in my ankles yesterday. My feet have been tingly and feel like they're on fire for a couple of years. I figured this had to do with the diabetes since my sister went through the same thing. After reading some of the answers on this site, I was wondering if anyone knew if it may have something to do with neurological problems rather than diabetes since my pain doctor, who diagnosed these reflex problems referred me to a neurologist. I wonder about this since I was in 3 other car accidents and rolled 5 times, backwards on an escalator. Luckily, the only problem that continues from the accidents are the migraines.",
