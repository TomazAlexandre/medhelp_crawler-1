            "answer": "Hi!In all probability these are boils or sores due to infection. You can treat this by applying antibacterial cream. This encourages the pus to come to the surface, make a mouth and drain. Once the boil has drained, the area should be washed with antibacterial soap and an antibacterial cream applied and kept dry, bandaged and sterile.\u00a0\u00a0However, if you have any medical problems like diabetes, please consult a doctor, and do not wait for it to heal. Also if the boil appears to spread, the area around it becomes progressively red, then also consult a doctor. This may need incision and drainage. Take care!",

    "question": "A while ago over the summer, I got what seemed like a large mosquito bite on my hip bone. It was itchy and roughly the size of a dime. It's the same color as my skin and when I itch it a lot it develops a red, dried blood-like center. The \"dried blood\" is underneath the skin but is still visible. Once there was a scab on one and pus was leaking out a few drops and then it went away when the scab was removed. If anybody has an idea of what this is comments are highly appreciated. I'm only sixteen I really don't wanna go to the doctor over this",
