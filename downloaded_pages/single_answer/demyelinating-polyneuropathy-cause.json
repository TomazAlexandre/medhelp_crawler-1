            "answer": "Hi there!You could possibly check for micronutrient deficiencies and hormonal/ endocrine abnormalities since nerve conduction studies and EMG have been abnormal and tests have been negative for heavy metal poisoning. If negative the symptoms may need to be managed symptomatically. I would suggest consulting a neurologist for the same.Hope this helps.Take care!",

Hx recurrent shingles, autoimmune hepatitis (sm muscle/ actin +), hx drug induced lupus sec to seizure drugs (childhood onset). Abnormal nerve conduction, abnormal EMG (demyelinating polyneuropathy), abn nerve biopsy: severe demyelinating neuropathy, No onion bulb formation, no new myelin, no vasculitis, no white cells.\u00a0\u00a0Have not had MRI or spinal tap. Don't drink or have diabetes, all blood tests including heavy metals neg (no gamma spike), and slight increase in urine for porphyria of some type felt to be inconsequential. Neurologist dx is Charcot Marie Tooth (no known relatives with same). This means nothing to do. If MS, I could take something.
