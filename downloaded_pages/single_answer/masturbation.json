            "answer": "Hi!Not all women have the classical orgasm. The idea is to enjoy. If you do, it is fine. There is no need to stress yourself out trying to achieve what someone else has and in the process losing all the pleasure you are receiving. This also does not mean that you are abnormal. Every woman enjoys sex in her own way. Many women do not get the typical orgasm yet have a satisfying sexual life. So relax!Inability to enjoy sex is called frigidity. However you may not be frigid. What you probably mean is that you never had an orgasm. This could be achieved by proper stimulation of clitoris, G-spot in vagina, increase the foreplay, watch movies that stimulate you, create an environment around you that stimulates you.The other possibility is that you have vaginal dryness. There are many problems that cause vaginal dryness such as hypothyroidism, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, vaginitis or inflammation of vagina, dermatitis of skin around vagina, condom allergy, or allergy to soaps and lotions. Other causes could be stress, tension, hormonal changes, vaginal infection, depression, PCOD and diabetes.Talk to your doctor regarding this. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm an 18 year old girl and I have been masturbating since I was about 13 but I have never had an orgasm. When ever I tell people about it they laugh at me and think I'm joking which makes my problem even worse. I have talked to some of my closer friends about it and they say it isn't normal...is it? Lately the stress and tension has been getting to me and I have been getting really bad headahces that won't go away for days. So does anyone have suggestions on how to fix my \"problem\"? I have looked all over the internet and tried almost every suggestion :( Help?",
