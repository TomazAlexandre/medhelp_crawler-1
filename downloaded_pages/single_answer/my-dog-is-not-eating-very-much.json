    "question": "My dog is still eating, however, she is not eating as much as she used to. She otherwise doesn't seem sick. We recently moved to a new apartment, and I am wondering if that has something to do with it. She is an 8 yo dachshund. I normally feed her in the morning and by the evening she will have eaten all of her food. Now she only finishes half.Thanks for your help",
