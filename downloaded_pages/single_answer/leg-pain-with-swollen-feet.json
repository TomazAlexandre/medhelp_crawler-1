            "answer": "Hi and Welcome to our Pain Management Community. There are no physicians or experts on this forum. Some of us have medical backgrounds but none of us are experts. Any suggestions you obtain should not be taken in place of consulting a medical professional.I am sorry to hear about your painful symptoms. How long has this been going on? I am wondering if your legs may be swollen to some degree also. Have you had a recent injury or back pain?I don't know your general age and certainly your symptoms could be from several medical conditions but it sounds like it could be a circulatory issues. PAD, (Peripheral Artery Disease) and similar conditions can produce the symptoms you present. Are you on a diuretic or do you have diabetes?The best suggestion I can give you is to consult your PCP (Primary Care Physician). These symptoms can also be suggestive of cardiac insufficiency.... so please see your PCP.While you are waiting for that appointment, and I hope it's not too long here's what I would do. Elevate your legs above your heart as much as possible, avoid salt and foods containing salt and avoid sugary foods. When you call for that appt be sure to impress upon them the totality of your symptoms.Please let us know how you are doing. If you would like to add additional information please do so.Take Care,~Tuck",
