Your doctor should advise.There is a stress test (treadmill, etc,) that monitors an individuals vitals with increasing demand for blood oxygen as exertion is increased.\u00a0\u00a0Based on an individual's vital signs, the\u00a0\u00a0examiner can conclude the degree of exertion would be beneficial.I hope this helps provide a perspective for you.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the question, and if you have any followup questions you are welcome to respond.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",
