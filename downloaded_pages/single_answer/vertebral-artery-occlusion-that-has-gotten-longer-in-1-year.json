    "question": "My Father is a 72 and extemely fit and active and leads a healthy lifestyle...he does have type II controled Diabetes, all lab values are normal if not low. His BP is normal due to medication , he is on Glucophage for his Diabetes, he also takes Zocor for Cholesterol and a baby aspirin for the Vertebral Artery Occlusion that he was diagnosed with last year.Last week he went in for a follow up and the CT scan revealed that his clot is encapsulated but has gotten longer.What is the pronosis for this and can this be treated surgically, with medications or is there ANYTHING we can do to prevent an on comming stroke?\u00a0\u00a0Any information would be so appreciated. We don't know what to do or where to go for help. He is getting treatment through the VA administration and it's all been very confusing. What should he do to protect and prevent a problem and what are the chances that he will have a stroke with a clot that is getting longer in diameter?",
