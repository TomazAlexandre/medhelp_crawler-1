            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.As you can see the values have normalized after abstaining from alcohol consumption. You should refrain from taking alcohol, as this will cause further injury to the liver. Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. This can progress to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. So, prevention or cure is by avoiding alcohol and treating diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels. So, in addition to avoiding alcohol, check your blood sugar and lipid profile. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
