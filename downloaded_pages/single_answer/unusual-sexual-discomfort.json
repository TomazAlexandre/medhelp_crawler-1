These include poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, spinal cord and neurological problems.

    "question": "Hello,for almost a month now I've been having a couple of symptoms that continuously worry me. For a starter, my sex drive has diminished by a ten fold. Having in mind that I am a sexually active 20 year old man I do not think that this is normal. Recently, this was accompanied by a feeling that is somewhere in between tickling and slight pain whenever something comes into contact with the tip of my penis. Finally, my erection started to go away in seconds unless my penis is being stimulated. Previously, it would remain for a while even after ejaculation. This is a condition I have never been in before so I am extremely worried. What are the possible causes for that and of course solutions? Additionally, I have to say that I had unprotected sex but only with my girlfriend (I have been with her for four years). She recently had a complete examination and she had no STDs whatsoever. I haven't had any serious illness so far in my life, I haven't started taking any new pills, I do not take drugs, do not smoke but I drink quite often. Yet, this has been the case for over three years now and it never had an effect on my sexual performance. Thank you in advance for your prompt help.",
