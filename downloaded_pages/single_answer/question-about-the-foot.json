            "answer": "HiYou have mentioned of dry and cracked skin. If this is the case, you may need to have this assessed further as xerosis or dried skin may be due to several factors. Irritant dermatitis, decreased blood supply due to vascular insufficiencies, autoimmune diseases,diabetes, and dehydration may present as dry skin. In your wife's case however, you have only noted the skin of the lower extremities to be primarily affected. If this is the case,then an irritant dermatitis may be likely.I suggest that her blood sugar levels be determined, a duplex scan of the lower extremities also need to be ascertained.What baseline tests were done so far?",

    "question": "My wife has had extremely dry and cracked skin on her feet for about 2 years now. The cracks sometimes bleed. It is all over her feet not just between her toes it is all over her feet. Do you think that it could be some sort of Fungus other than athletes foot? If so what she we do to treat it.Thanks",
