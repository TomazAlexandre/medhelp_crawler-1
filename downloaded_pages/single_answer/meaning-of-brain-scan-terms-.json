            "answer": "Hi!Mild diffuse cortical atrophy is usually seen as an age related process where minute portions of parts of brain called cortex die. Usually seen in old age or after traumatic brain injury or as complication of prolonged hypertension, diabetes, metabolic disorders etc.Encephalomalacia is not an illness. It is basically a softening of the brain matter as a result of an ischemia or infarction, degenerative changes, infection, craniocerebral trauma, or other injury. Posterior horn of right lateral ventricle (CSF filled space) is dilated giving an impression of encephalomalacia in that region. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
