            "answer": "What you describe sounds like you are having post-nasal drip .\u00a0\u00a0If that is the case a \u201ccheap\u201d and often effective treatment would be what are called nasal washes or nasal irrigations with normal saline (saltwater solution).Now that you have quit smoking, I urge you to never smoke again.\u00a0\u00a0Also one month of smoking cessation is a short period of time to expect improvement in the mucous and you might want to wait another month or two before deciding that smoking cessation is not the answer.Your dry nose and \u201cfeel like thirsty for water\u201d could be signs of another disease such as diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You should definitely have this checked out by your doctor.Good luck",
