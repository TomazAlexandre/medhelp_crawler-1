            "answer": "Hi,It will help us to know if you suffer from anxiety problems because anxiety can result in these symptoms of generalized tingling and numbness. Also conditions like diabetes, thyroid dysfunction and Vitamin B 12 deficiency have to be looked into because these conditions can cause peripheral neuropathy which results in similar symptoms.Indigestion and gas formation can result in difficulty in burping.I would suggest you to eat soft bland food for few days drink plenty of water and take B complex supplements. In the meantime get a clinical evaluation done.Thanks",
