            "answer": "Hi Shiva and welcome,Your question has landed in the MS community where there is only patients helping other patients, we are not dr's but collectively we have a lot of knowledge about MS...You said \"Three weeks ago I've got a sudden sensation of tingling in my left leg. This feeling of tingling was then spread across my other leg and both hands after some days.\"....symptoms that rapidly spread 'and or' multiply to include all peripheral limbs and in a very short time frame of weeks, are 'not' the suggestive or consistent symptom pattern of a neurological condition like MS.You also stated \"I should add that I don't feel tingling constantly, and it comes and goes. I have this feeling in different part each time.\"....symptoms that come and go without any consistency 'and or' move around from one location to another, are additionally 'not' the suggestive or consistent symptom pattern of a neurological condition like MS.Sensory symptoms with out any clinically abnormal neurological signs, and the additional inconsistent symptoms pattern are all red flags pointing away from a neurological causation....I would suggest you consider seeing your GP for the standard blood tests to rule out the most common causes of all over tingling eg vitamin deficiency - B, magnesium etc infections, diabetes, arthritis etc as well as the potential of the other common causes like hypoventilation, anxiety, structural spinal issues degenerative disc etc etcHope that helps........JJ",

    "question": "Dear Doctor,I'm a 30 year old woman. Three weeks ago I've got a sudden sensation of tingling in my left leg. This feeling of tingling was then spread across my other leg and both hands after some days. I visited a neurologist who told me all brain and neurological examinations are fine. He didn't ask for any more tests such as MRI or so. What should I do then since I still have this feeling of tingling? I should add that I don't feel tingling constantly, and it comes and goes. I have this feeling in different part each time. I don't have any loss of sensation or numbness. Is it necessary to visit my doctor again and ask for some more examination and tests? I'm really worried....Thanks for your time,Shiva",
