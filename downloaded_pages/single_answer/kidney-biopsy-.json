            "answer": "HiI had a kidney and pancreas transplant in December last year. i had a kidney biopsy done on 21 August this year. I went into hospital for a day. i didn't have to go into theatre. i lay on the bed and the doctor came along with an ultrasound machine. he checked exactly where the new kidney was. He made a small nick with a scalpel and injected some anaesthetic into the area and waited until it had gone all the way down to my kidney. he then used a metallic looking object, pushing it down to the very edge of my kidney. He pressed a button and a piece of kidney (half the length and width of a match) was 'grabbed'. None of this hurt at all. he did this twice but i believe if it is your kidney you may need 3-4 bits 'grabbed'. I had to lie flat for two hours (drove me round the twist). i then had to pass two lots of urine without any blood showing up in it before I could go. I had the biopsy done at 12.15pm and was allowed to leave at 5.15pm. i was ok until the anaesthetic wore off and then i was hobbling along like a cripple. It was tender for several days after and i did get a bit worried but it has calmed down now. They told me the results would be ready in a week but I'll wait for my next transplant appointment before I find out the good/bad news!! I had end stage renal failure (due to diabetes) and the only options I had were dialysis and/or transplant. i got the transplant before I needed dialysis. Hope all goes well for you. Cressida",
