    "question": "I love my pregnant body but getting weighed and seeing the number on the scale depresses me... Like I've gained 12lbs and I'm only 24w. That's alot for baby to only be around a pound :( I guess I'm ranting, sorry. Just had a down day, thanks hormones. I had my glucose test today and my blood pressure was a little high AGAIN, so I'm also kinda of worried about that stuff. Anyway, thanks for listening/reading :) Hope you ladies had a wonderful day and your next is even better.",
