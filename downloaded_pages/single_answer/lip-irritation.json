            "answer": "Hi,You have mentioned that you have started to experience rash and dizziness when you started using the antibiotic cream?For how long have you been using this?I suggest that you seek prompt consult with your dermatologist. At this point,we can not really say that the medication caused the rash and dizziness, however it is best to be promptly assessed in case you need to have the medications modified or changed.If you have been medicating the skin condition and it has been unresponsive to the medications, a prompt consult is necessary. Sores on the lip have several differentials. This may be due to obstructed salivary glands, an allergic reaction,a fungal or viral infection, aphthous ulcers, stomatitis or cheilitis, or it may due to an underlying vitamin or nutrient deficiency.Do you have any underlying disease such as diabetes?Are you under a lot of stress lately?Are you eating well?",

I have also had dizziness and rashes since I've started using it. What should I do?\u00a0\u00a0Should I see a dematologist?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor is fantastic; I'm not sure what I should do though after 2 months on irritation.",
