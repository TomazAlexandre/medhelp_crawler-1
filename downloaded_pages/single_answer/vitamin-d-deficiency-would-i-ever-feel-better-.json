            "answer": "I had low vit D, took replacement for over a year and never noticed a difference. Same with testosterone. Recently, I went on strictly no gluten diet high in tryptophane (humus, etc), and started mega doses of Vit B complex and a sudden improvement. It feels like I'm taking a powerful antidepressant.BTW, I have been taking high doses of C for gout for a few years too. Not sure what helped, it could be a combination of things.IMHO, Vit D itself is much overrated, or one has to approach all vitamins together and not just D.",
