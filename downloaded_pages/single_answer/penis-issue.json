            "answer": "Hello,I think it is pretty safe to say that there is range of size for the flaccid state.\u00a0\u00a0It can be contingent on several factors.\u00a0\u00a0Flaccid state tends to be bigger in the morning;\u00a0\u00a0where\u00a0\u00a0Testosterone levels are higher and bladder tends to be more full.\u00a0\u00a0 In addition, I do think anxiety can decrease flaccid state, since when the penis is relaxed this is essential for blood circulation in the penis.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, anxiety or depression can contribute to psychogenic venous leakage.I don't think it is essential for the flaccid to stay one size.\u00a0\u00a0My flaccid tends to be\u00a0\u00a0bigger while wearing boxers opposed to briefs. I think it simply because I am more relaxed.\u00a0\u00a0The exercise should help and not decease flaccid state.When you see your doc you may look into cholestoral , excess smoking, diabetes, or any vascular problems.\u00a0\u00a0They may also check into any changes in sexual activity..",

    "question": "I have a concern about my penis. The size of it changes constantly while it is in its flaccid stage. Sometimes its fine and it will be loose and have some length to it and my testicles will be loose, but then it will shrink up completley to where you can barely see the head and my testicles will be all drawn up. Its linda of like a guy jumping into a cold swimming pool and getting that effect. It does this all day long, why won't it stay the one size. I have been on a health kick for about 2 months and have lost almost 30 pounds by going to the gym 3-4 times a week, but I have noticed that the condition is really bad after working out. Is this all normal or could something else be going on. I been to the doctor, had blood work, etc. I'm not diabetic. What else can it be. Thanks.",
