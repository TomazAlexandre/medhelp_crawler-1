            "answer": "Hello,You seem to be having the symptoms of metrorrhagia(heavy periods). Various factors causing it are endometriosis,ectopic pregnancy,hormone imbalance,endometrial hyperplasia,polyps,use of IUD\u2019s and depo shots, sexually transmitted diseases,PCOS and benign and malignant pathologies of the uterus.I would suggest you to consult a gynecologist and get a pelvic examination and swab culture done to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment depends on the confirmation of diagnosis.Delayed wound healing can occur in vitamin C and vit K deficiency,diabetes,p-rotein deficiency,immunocompromised states and if the person is taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. You are taking prednisolone which may be causing the delayed healing of cuts.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have been bleeding for the past 4 weeks after missing 2 periods before that. I am 43. My gyno put me on a 10 day med to stop the bleeding. It did not stop but lightened a lot. I finished that 5 days ago and the bleeding came back with a vengeance. Last night I bled through 2 pads and woke up in a puddle of blood. I am passing lots of lining. I seem to be going through a pad every half hour and a lot comes out when I go to change it. I don't think I can leave the house. Of course it's a Saturday so my dr is not available, I can't really afford to go to the er.\u00a0\u00a0When I tLked to him 2 days ago he said it was normal,to get my period now, but it's the volume of blood that I am concerned about. I feel like I will bleed to death.\u00a0\u00a0When I have looked online I see that other people have gone through this and survived but I am still scarred. I have a history of anemia so started back on iron last night. I am also trying to boost vit c through pineapple and lemon juice which I read helps.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything else I can do to get through until Monday when I can see my Gyno. ?\u00a0\u00a0I am on 10 mg prednisone, 20 mg methotrexate and recently started orencia for RA. Also can the orencia be contributing to the blood loss? I have noticed that I am healing much slower from cuts and scratches these past few weeks....just wondering if it's related. Thank you",
