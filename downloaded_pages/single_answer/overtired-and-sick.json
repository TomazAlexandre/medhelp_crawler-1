            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!What you have is probably a vasovagal syncope caused by overtiredness and lack of sleep. The complex group of symptoms are mediated by the vagus nerve. This nerve is irritated by prolonged standing, standing up suddenly, stress, pain, hunger, dehydration, intense emotion etc.\u00a0\u00a0This is intensified by tiredness and lack of sleep in your case.A person may experience just one of the group of symptoms under this category which also includes dizziness, ringing in ear, visual symptoms and vomiting.Since this does not always happen try to avoid getting tired. If sleep is an issue, maybe you can go back to sleep if you have been tired and then get up refreshed. Check out and see if you have anemia or diabetes which is making you very tired.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "It doesn't happen everyday or even every month but about every 3-4 months if I am overtired or wake-up too early I will vomit, A lot. It isn't just like I vomit once and it's over with I vomit probably every half hour until I take a nap. It's very inconvenient because it's happened at work and at school and how do you explain to someone, no I'll be un-sick once I take this nap...it sounds fake but it's a real problem and I don't know what to do about it. If anyone has ever heard of anything where you vomit when you're overtired any help would be greatly appreciated.",
