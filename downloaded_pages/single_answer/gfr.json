            "answer": "Hi,You have mentioned taking medications for the fibromyalgia. I suggest you have your current medications\u00a0\u00a0evaluated as some drugs ( especially those metabolized by the kidneys) may alter GFR.There seems to be no direct method of increasing GFR. Th underlying cause for a decreased GFR needs to be ascertained and that cause needs to be managed to prevent the GFR from decreasing further. For hypertensives, dopamine and ACE inhibitors are given to improve GFR. In one study, intake of glutamine increased GFR but studies in humans have been very limited.",
