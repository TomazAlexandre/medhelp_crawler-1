    "question": "A dilemma. I am blind in one eye. In the 'good' eye, I have a large central cataract. I also have glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy (diabetes type II).How do I determine the point when my vision is so bad that the risks of removing the cataract outweigh all other risks? I can only read using a Kindle, or a computer screen, as on either I can enlarge the type. I can't drive anymore. I ride a pedal cycle, but even that is becoming difficult as sometimes I can't see traffic coming from left or right. My vision has been going downhill slowly for a year or two, but more rapidly in the past couple of months.On the plus side, I can walk, cook, see TV (just about), see blue skies and sunshine.I am 66, and also have CKD, CHD, and one or two other age-related ailments.Or should I just toss a coin?Allen.",
