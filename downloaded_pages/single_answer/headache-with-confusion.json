The symptoms of migraine keep changing with time.However at this point it is important to rule out stroke because stroke also presents with similar symptoms like headache, photophobia and memory loss.Do you have any risk factor for stoke like high BP, obesity, smoking, high cholesterol, and diabetes.I would suggest you to get a clinical evaluation done to rule out stroke.Do keep us posted!",

    "question": "Hello and thank you for your time.I am a 42 yr old caucasian male. I have had migraine headaches for the past twenty years with an average of 3-5 per year. They start off with what I call a partial blurredness or a bright spot (lasts about 20 minutes) where my vision is affected by 50% or more. After that I get a headache centered around my eyes and then I feel nauseas for the next 24 hours. The last headache I experienced was different. During the blurred vision I had total confusion (amnesia). I could not remember the names of anyone around me (I\u2019ve worked side by side with my co-workers for 7 years). Their faces were familiar to me but the names I could not remember. This only lasted as long as the blurred vision (25 minutes) and then my memory started to come back to me. For the next 7-8 days my thoughts were very slow to come and it was like my mind was in the idle mode. I have always been one to ponder, but for a week I thought or pondered basically nothing. Should I be concerned? What are some of the causes at why this happens?Thank you again for your time and consideration.Scott",
