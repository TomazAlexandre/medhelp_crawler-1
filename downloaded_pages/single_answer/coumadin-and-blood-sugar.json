            "answer": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I first want to say, 'Ouch!'\u00a0\u00a0I can't imagine just how much that hurt.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you're doing well.One of the things that doctors are finding that happens when you have other medical issues is that your blood sugars rise, whether you are diabetic or not.\u00a0\u00a0This apparently occurs because of how the body reacts to the issue.\u00a0\u00a0That reaction has gone away when the medical issue gets better.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, many drugs have carbs in them (too bad they aren't required to have a nutrition label!!), and unless you adjust your insulin dose for those carbs, that can also make your blood sugars rise.\u00a0\u00a0With simple antibiotics, for example, we add in 5 grams of carbs per teaspoon of medicine.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to work with your doctor to figure out the carbs in the medicines you are taking.\u00a0\u00a0Bringing down your blood sugar will help your body heal faster, so the more you can do on that front, the better off you'll be.",

    "question": "I have been put on blood thinner for life...following a deer attack 15 months ago, still have a clogged artery and damaged vein in my leg where the antler went completely through the right leg. I had a few episodes of blood clots in the leg, and have been put on coumadin permanently, 12.5 mg daily. My blood sugar has been tough to stabilize (goes too high too often) About the same time, I was put on the new diabetic drug \"Januvia\". I take insulin daily, sometimes have to take Humulin R to knock down from 400's. Any correlation to high sugars with any of these drugs?",
