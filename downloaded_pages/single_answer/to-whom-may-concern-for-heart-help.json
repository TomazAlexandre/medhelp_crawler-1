            "answer": "HiM.Marinum has been implicated in a wide variety of infections ranging from skin infections, arthritis to liver damage. (Ref : http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no11/03-0192.htm#table). More serious complications are usually seen in patients who are immunocompromised.You can consult your doctor who can schedule certain investigations (culture, skin or tissue biopsy, PCR or CT scan for deeper lesions etc) to diagnose M.Marinum infection.Infections due to M. marinum can usually be treated with antimycobacterial drugs. The good news is that with treatment, prognosis is excellent, if the infection can be identified at an early stage.Some links for your reference (http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic1538.htm)Hope this helps.
