            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling?The complication associated with rotator cuff surgery is Stiff shoulder which may happen secondary to postoperative scarring. Early postoperative pendulum or Codman exercises and passive ROM exercises minimize the risk.Repair failure is higher in those who smoke, have diabetes, or undergo too-aggressive rehabilitation. Postoperative infection is also noted.Deltoid avulsion: Releasing the deltoid during an open procedure requires a secure reattachment.I think there would have been disuse atrophy of pectoral muscle due to pain. You should be started on physical therapy as early as possible and try to find out the cause for disuse atrophy.You should also be doing a NCS study and EMG study to differentiate between a neuropathy and myelopathy.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",
