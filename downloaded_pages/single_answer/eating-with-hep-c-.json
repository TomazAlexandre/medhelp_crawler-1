            "answer": "Hi,That\u2019s very kind of you to help your pop like that; I\u2019m sure he appreciates it.You\u2019ll want to speak with his doctor about this; does he have a primary care or a GI doc? Perhaps you can attend an appointment with him? He should be counseled regarding his diet for diabetes; but Hep C doesn\u2019t have any specific dietary requirements unless he has cirrhosis.Often, a doctor will refer the diabetic patient to an educating nurse, and sometimes a registered dietician for counseling. They can help work up a diet plan that helps him maintain a healthy blood sugar and weight. You might have him ask his doctor about this? I\u2019m sure if you went to a meeting with the dietician and your father, it\u2019d be a big help.Good luck to both of you\u2014Bill",
