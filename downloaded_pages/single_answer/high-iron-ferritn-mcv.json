            "answer": "Hi!Ferritin could be high in many cares, and if it is 1000ng/L or more (probably the 110 signifies this in another unit\u2014could be mg/L) then it is probably hemochromatosis.Alcoholism, some types of anemia and thalassemia too can raise the ferritin levels very high. A high ferritin level with normal iron saturation is seen in conditions like\u00a0\u00a0alcoholic or infective liver disease, chronic inflammatory disease such as arthritis or asthma, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes. Discuss with your doctor and run tests to rule these out.MCV can be high in hemolytic anemia, pernicious anemia, vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency, and in alcoholism. Since iron is high it can be due to hemochromatosis.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral to a hematologist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I went for a general blood test last week and as my iron was high (163) I thought I would do the right thing and go and give some blood. At the hospital they wouldn't accept my blood as they said I could have a problem as my MCV was also high (47.5). They suggested I go for a Ferritin check. I now have the results and this in 110 (also a bit high). No I am worried after reading things on the internet and the doctors are now not open till Wednesday due to Easter",
