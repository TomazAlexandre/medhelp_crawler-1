            "answer": "I reccomend eating small meals close together. Healthy meals, of course. When I was pregnant with my son, I ate small meals about every 2 to 3 hours. Mostly just snacks. That way you can keep your blood sugar in check between the bigger meals. I got really tired of eating with my last pregnancy. My jaw literally hurt because it seemed all I did was eat. But if you snack on healthy stuff between meals it'll help you fight off temptation for higher carbs later on. Just relax. It's tough and overwhelming but it's only a few months. Good Luck!",
