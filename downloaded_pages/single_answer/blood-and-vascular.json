            "answer": "Hi! Taking warfarin can increase your chances of bleeding either internally where you cannot see or from nose, ear, in stool or in urine. However, if there is a need and you are not taking it, it can increase your chances of blood clots. Both are equally dangerous. So if you are reluctant to take warfarin, you should go for the international normalized ratio (INR)\u00a0\u00a0test. Normally patients on blood thinners are kept at an INR of 2.0 to 3.0. For patients who have an increased risk of clot formation the INR needs to be higher - about 2.5 to 3.5. So if your INR is higher than this, you may need warfarin to bring it down.As with other drugs, warfarin can cause allergy, rash, itching and GI symptoms like diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. It can cause loss of hair, joint and muscle pain, swelling of hands and feet, shortness of breath etc.Bleeding into brain can cause stroke, and into lungs can also be serious.If you are on warfarin you will need to get INR test done regularly to avoid any mishaps. Take care!",
