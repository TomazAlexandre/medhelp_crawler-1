    "question": "Hi,Another very worried new member (F - 56 years old). About a month ago, my face, hands and feet started tingling just as I was lying down to go to sleep. About a week ago, the tinging, burning sensation spread to my legs, arms and back and became almost unbearable. Now, today I have noticed fasciculations in my feet and legs. I am of normal weight (5'7\", 135 pounds) and I exercise daily for 1.5 hours and have done for 17 years - so I am in pretty good shape for my age. I have had tingling before and I have numbness in my feet, but this is several years old. (My mother, both grandmothers, aunts, brother and the family cat all have type 2 diabetes - that is one of my motivations for maintaining a health weight/life style - so I have written off the numbness to pre-diabetes.Now I am very worried I am developing ALS. No sign of weakness that I am aware of - lots of burning sensations and tingling especially in hand, feet and face, but it does migrate to other locations.I would appreciate any insight.Thanks.",
