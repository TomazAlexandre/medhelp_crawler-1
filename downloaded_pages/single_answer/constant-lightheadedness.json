    "question": "I am a 53 year old male and have been a type 1 diabetic for 41 years, fairly well controlled and have had a constant lightheadedness, which is similar to how a diabetic feels when thay are approaching a hypoglycemic event.\u00a0\u00a0I have had this feeling for the last 18 months from the moment I wake up until I go to bed..whether I am standing or sitting, blood sugar is high, low or normal..blood pressure is high..low..or normal.\u00a0\u00a0I am unable to focus, concentrate, have a stiff neck and short term memory lapses.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot\u00a0\u00a0feel hypoglycemic events approaching, have diabetic neuropathy in hands and feet and also have ED.\u00a0\u00a0I have had the following tests:\u00a0\u00a0MRI, MRA, stress test, EKG, EEG, tilt table test, sleep study, balance studies.\u00a0\u00a0The balance studies suggested I had a 40% dysfunctional right inner ear and one ENT said that would not explain lightheadeness but would explain dizzziness and another ENT said he was sure this was the problem and the only thing I could do was yoga or Tai Chi.\u00a0\u00a0MY PCP said that was crazy and proceeded to request the other tests I have had.\u00a0\u00a0All tests were negative except tilt table where I fainted after given nitro glycerin and blood pressure fell to 73/39.\u00a0\u00a0I do not faint normally.\u00a0\u00a0The cardiologist at the test told me to add salt to my diet yet my daily blood pressure was never below 110/70.\u00a0\u00a0My neurologist said my heart and brain are both working fine but may not be communicating\u00a0\u00a0right with each other.\u00a0\u00a0He suggested I take an anti-depressant or get further tests from a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0After discussing with my PCP and aware of side effects of anti-depressants we decided this would not help my lightheadedness and she did not feel I was clinically depressed.\u00a0\u00a0I believe it is the long-term effects of high and low blood sugars over a 41 year period but cannot find anything on the net that discusses such a possibity.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any suggestions.",
