            "answer": "I began to use a pump last year and although it doesn't stick to my body as you describe, it is the typical small (size of a pager) external infusion pump with a small tube leading to the infusion site.\u00a0\u00a0I use my abdominal area for the infusion site.\u00a0\u00a0 I must tell you that it took me only a few weeks to get so adjusted that I forgot the pump was there.\u00a0\u00a0 Sleeping was the easiest adjustment of all.\u00a0\u00a0 I clip my pump to my bedclothes at the neck, collar, waist or whatever and it stays intact all night.\u00a0\u00a0 I was told by another pump user to try just laying the pump beside me in bed.\u00a0\u00a0 Although my tube is only 23 inches long, that method worked just fine as well.\u00a0\u00a0 I, too, get up during the night and soon learned to just check the security of the pump before I got out of bed.The pump stays on during my tossing and turning, rising and movement, even making love.On the rare occasions when the pump clip became loose and fell, it was no big deal.\u00a0\u00a0The whole thing stayed attached at the infusion site by the tape which holds the cannula in place, and did not hurt or pull anything loose.I wish I had obtained a pump years ago.\u00a0\u00a0 It has made my life amazingly simpler, and my health much stabler.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you are able to try it, give yourself a month or so, and I suspect that you will be very surprised if you don't learn to love your newfound freedom.",
