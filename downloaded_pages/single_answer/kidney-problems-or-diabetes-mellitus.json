    "question": "Hi everyone,I was wondering if anyone could shed any light on my symptoms which ive just began to have. I have really bad smelling urine- so bad i cannot use public loos because the smell is so pungent.Sometimes it smells sweet, but most of the time it smells of a smoked fish aroma.Also, i am going to the loo a lot and am very thirsty lately, but have lost no weight,- but i am overweight a little.The colour of my urine is often brown or orange and i do drink a lot of fluids so i know its not dehydration.Im not sure if its connected but i have pain in the upper left quadrant of my abdomen -sometimes sharp, sometimes dull.Please offer any advice you can.I am due to visit my GP next week.Thankyou.",
