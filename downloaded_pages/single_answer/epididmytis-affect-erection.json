            "answer": "Hi there!The antibiotic is unlikely to have affected the erection, though infection/ inflammation could be a temporary contributing factor. Other possible contributing factors include psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders, peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, hypertension, diabetes etc. Assuming it to be due to the infection, this is likely to get better in a few days. Anxiety and stress play an important role in compounding the issue and at a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors with your partner. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, I would suggest seeing your urologist for appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Epididmytis early January of 2012. I was on Cipro and it did nothing. It has affected my erections as they are weak. My Dr. said it shouldn't have anything to do with the Epididmytis but I respectfully disagree. Also my ejaculation has changed.I then was put on Dioxcylene (?) and that worked well except\u00a0\u00a06 weeks later I still feel it.I would like to finally get rid of it but also would like my erections to return to normal as it is starting to affect my marriage a little.Please advise as I have to back to Dr. and would like another opinion. Thank you!",
