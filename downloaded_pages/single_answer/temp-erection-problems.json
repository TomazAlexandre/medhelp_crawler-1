            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Hormones, blood vessels, nerves, and muscles must all work together to make an erection. Your brain starts an erection by sending nerve signals to the penis when it senses sexual stimulation. Touching may cause this arousal. Another trigger may be something you see or hear. It may be a sexual thought or dream.Erection problems may be caused by physical problems, such as injury to nerves or loss of blood supply to the penis. It can also occur due to diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol etc. In your case as you faced this problem earlier also and the cause was problem in blood vessels, I would suggest you to get a\u00a0\u00a0ultrasound and angiography of the vessels of penis. There could be a possible damage to the vessels of the penis.If this confirmed treatment can be done by medical and surgical methods. Drugs like viagra, levitra or cialis can be prescribed by your doctor. Surgery to repair the blood vessels of the penis may be an option for a small number of men younger than 40 who had an injury that caused poor blood flow to the penis.For confirming the diagnosis apart from the above mentioned tests, hormone levels and general health check up might be required to rule out other possible causes of erectile dysfunction.Consult a urologist for further assistance.All the best.'",

    "question": "ok, here is my problem. i was having intercourse with my g/f about a week ago and she moved to a different position and caused pain in my penis. Since this day, I have lost my erection. I still can partially get it up with stimulation, but it goes down quickly. I can still have an orgasm...however I can not be stimulated without actually being touched. I have never had a problem before, ever. I am 32, very healthy..in great shape..this sort of thing happened to me about 10 years ago, my doctor said I got a kink in the vessels that cause an erection and it would go away in a week...I am freaking out and have made an appointment with a urologist for next Wednesday...",
