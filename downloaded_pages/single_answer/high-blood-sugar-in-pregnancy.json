            "answer": "Hello,yes, if you have diabetes before pregnancy, you definitely have diabetes during pregnancy.Diabetes in pregnancy is dangerous for both mother and baby, and blood sugar needs to be carefully controlled to ensure optimal outcome and healthy baby and mamma. Although metformin is sometimes used in pregnancy, it is quite standard practice is to change to insulin, which does not cross the placenta and which gives much better control of blood sugar than just oral medications.The ideal blood sugar ranges in pregnancy are;-Fasting 70 - < 95 (ideally in the low to mid 80s).1 1/2 - 2 hours post eating < 120Before next meal < 95Never more than 140.Insulin resistance increases during pregnancy so your ability to control blood sugar with diet and metformin would tend to get much poorer as the pregnancy progresses.You should work with your dr and medical team to continue to have excellent control.Let us know how you go.",
