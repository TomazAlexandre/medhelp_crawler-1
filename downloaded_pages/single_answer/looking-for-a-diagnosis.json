    "question": "I have been having health problems for about 2 years now.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone to several doctors for countless office visits and tests. Long story short, I have been diagnosed with the following: Periperhal Neuropathy in both legs/feet and hands/arms, Fibromyalgia, RLS, slight Reynaud's, insomnia, anxiety, depression, GERD, carpal tunnel in both wrists and cubital tunnel in 1 elbow. I have put on approx 35 pounds. The doctors keep asking about diabetes in my family and I keep telling them no. But the insist on running the tests, which come up negative for diabetes. I recently have started having involuntary muscle movements in my legs/feet and hands. I am starting to forget small things like asking the same question minutes apart and loss of concentration. None of the doctors can nail down why this is happening or what is causing this - any ideas? Looking for a diagnosis that would cover all of these symptoms.",
