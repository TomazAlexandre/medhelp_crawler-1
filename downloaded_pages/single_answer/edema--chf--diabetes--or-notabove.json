    "question": "I'm a 36 year old male, 270 lbs, on a beta blocker for anxiety and intermittent high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0My last doctor's visit (quarterly checkups) was about a week ago, with a 130/80 bp and a clean EKG.\u00a0\u00a0I was stress tested last June, and had an echocardiogram (? . .\u00a0\u00a0the test where they listen to your circulation) of my heart, arms and neck concurrently.\u00a0\u00a0All tests were spectacularly negative.\u00a0\u00a0My bloodwork is always clean -- no diabetes, and just a touch of high cholesterol that wavers in-and-out of norms by a hair.\u00a0\u00a0But I seem to always retain a large amount of water in my left leg in particular.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I even feel the fluid shifting en masse (or some other cramping) around my shin, ankle, top of foot, etc.\u00a0\u00a0My loose-knit socks still leave a crimp in my shin or ankle, and over the past few days I've been noticing a background pain in my leg, slight reddening between the knee and ankle, and a slight blue-graying of my toenails.\u00a0\u00a0I sit a long time at my job, although I do get up occasionally, and I walk two or three times a week, several miles each instance.\u00a0\u00a0I've suggested CHF to my doctor, and he doesn't believe this to be the case.\u00a0\u00a0A diuretic isn't practical, because I also have mild gout.\u00a0\u00a0I plan on losing the weight and by and large I've been doing a good job, but there are relapses.\u00a0\u00a0Is my condition reversible with constant, regular exercise and just a bit more preventative maintenance, or am I well on the path to permanent damage somewhere, whether the heart, legs, or what-have you?\u00a0\u00a0As I said, I am an anxious person, and this mystery is causing me a great deal of stress.\u00a0\u00a0Any input would be welcome.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance.",
