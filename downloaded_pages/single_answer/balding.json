            "answer": "Hello,From the pattern of baldness, it sounds like male pattern baldness. Androgenic alopecia is a common form of hair loss and typically occurs in M shaped pattern.Men who have this type of hair loss usually have inherited the trait. Other causes may be use of some drugs, infections and underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. A biopsy (taking a small sample of cells to examine under a microscope) of your scalp may be needed to establish the correct diagnosis. Depending on your type of hair loss, treatments are available. If a medicine is causing your hair loss, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine and if it is due to infections or systemic disease,then treating it will treat baldness.Medicines which are useful are minoxidil and finasteride(Propecia) but please use them after consulting a dermatologist because of the side effects involved. Finally one can resort to hair transplantation also.I sincerely hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing. Warm regards.",

    "question": "Hi, im 20 yrs old and im losing my hair. Its not really noticeable yet cuz when i shower and shampoo my hair it thickens up. but when i don't use shampoo and my hair is still oily, i have a bald spot near the crown of my head. My hairline is starting to go back a little bit too. I was wondering if anyone has advice on propecia. I feel like if i start now that it will have better results for the future. I am aware of the side effects and feel like if they do come about that i will just stop taking it. Anyone have any advice?",
