            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!Your pains I think are related to posture, prolonged computer use or sitting at desk or at one place to read or due to eye strain. Have you got your eye tested for refractive errors?It could also be cervical spondylitis or excess muscle strain to neck muscles. Please sit in an erect posture. Try out rotator exercises of the neck. Ask a physiotherapist what other exercises you can do to relieve strain on the neck and upper back muscles.Get yourself tested for diabetes too. That should help.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "For the last week I've been plagued with a hard-to-explain feeling all over my head. You know the hair-standing-on-end feeling you get if a teacher drags her fingernails across a blackboard? It's similar to that - a fuzzy sort of feeling (almost like 'pins and needles' or goosebumps feelings) that covers my entire head and even down to the ears and neck.I've been to my GP and she thinks it is stress related, but it happens even when I'm completely stress-free. It is worst when I'm working on the computer or reading or concentrating on something, and pain comes with it too. Sometimes it gets so strong that I feel like I might pass out, but that hasn't happend yet.Because of long-term pain in my head I have had recent scans of the brain but they didn't show anything wrong at all. And I've been to a neurologist, psychiatrist in addition to my GP, but no-one seems to be able to explain the pain, nor give advice on how I can get rid of it along with the more recent fuzzy feeling.Do you have any ideas why this is happening and what I can do about it?",
