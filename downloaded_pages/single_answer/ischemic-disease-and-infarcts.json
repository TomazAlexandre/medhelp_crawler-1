    "question": "Could you please explain to me what is \"small vessel ischemic disease\" and\"small lacunar infarcts\".\u00a0\u00a0This patient also has a history of CAD and CHF.In your opinion would a person that is 50 years of age eventually developesome mental deficits or is a potential canidate for a major CVA.Thank You for your timeRespectfully,Lance________________________________Dear Lance,There is a distinction in stroke patients between small and large vesseldisease.\u00a0\u00a0Large vessel disease typically refers to stenosis or ulcerationof the carotid artery or the larger named arteries in the head.\u00a0\u00a0In some instancepatients are considered for surgery such as a carotid endarterectomy or cerebralbypass surgery.Small vessel disease, on the other hand, implies that the strokes are fromocclusion of small vessels in the head, usually in the setting of hypertensionor diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This has different therapeutic implications in that surgeryis rarely an option.\u00a0\u00a0These patients are managed with medications such asplain aspirin and ticlid, along with optimizing treatments for hypertensionand diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Patients with large vessel disease are treated similarly,though surgery is an added consideration, depending on the situation.Here's hoping this has shed some light on the subject for you.Good luck.",
