            "answer": "Hello,Such pain and stiffness in legs can be due to overextension of the muscles, overweight, prolonged standing during the day, dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium, calcium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease(narrowing of the leg arteries which causes poor circulation),sarcoidosis, excess alcohol, nerve compression, and sometimes liver disease.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
