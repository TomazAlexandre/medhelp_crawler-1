The other possibility is that she has an endocrine or hormonal problem, and thyroid should be tested.

    "question": "My 8 year old daughter has constant recurring fevers for the past 4 years. She had grade 3 urinary reflux that was fixed with the deflux surgery.\u00a0\u00a0All symptoms of urinary tract infections have since gone away. When she was two she was at daycare playing outside and got very red in the face and disoriented. We have had no problems with disorientation since that time. For the last two years everytime she spends time outside in the warmer weather she ends up with a fever of 101-103 degrees for at least a day or two. Yesterday we spent the day at Sesame Place, she was fine while there. This morning she woke up with a 101.3 degree fever. Does she have a temperature regulation problem? Is there anything that can be done?",
