            "answer": "Jeeesh, I'm sorry you're in such a health mess. I really only know about the cirrhosis part, so I'll address that. I don't know of any supplements that doctors would actually support. There's a lot of talk of milk thistle, but I don't have any experience with it. When I was first diagnosed, they were really concentrating on controlling the ascites with a low sodium (less than 1.5g/day) and a low fluid (less than 48 fl. oz.) diet. In addition to that, I got diuretics (water pills). I was told by my hepatologist to NOT take advil at ALL. The only safe OTC pain killer is regular strength tylenol (seeing as you don't drink) and still not too much. I was also put on Nadolol for my portal hypertension.As far as the doctors, I would aim first for a big university clinic doctor. Hope this gives you a few things to go on, but for all I know the diabetes could put an entirely different spin on your treatment.Good luck and let us know when you get your appt!!",
