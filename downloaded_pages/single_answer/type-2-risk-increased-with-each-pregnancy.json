            "answer": "Hi,I have not been able to find a reliable resource that quotes this \"100% risk after three pregnancies.\" I do know that the risk of developing diabetes in future is raised with subsequent pregancies with gestational diabetes, and the chances are high that you will have GDB in your next pregnancy. Speak with your doctor and OB-GYN about optimizing your overall health, diet and weight prior to becoming pregnant, as well as developing a plan for care after your delivery. Careful lifestyle changes can impart a significant change in your risk for future diabetes, so do not discount those.All the best.",

    "question": "I had gestational diabetes with both of my pregancies. I realize that having a GDM pregnancy increases my risk for developing type 2 diabetes in the future by up to 50%. I have already accepted this risk as fact. However, I would like a third child, but am concerned that the risk for developing type 2 diabetes increases with each pregnancy. I found this statement on another site: \"The more pregnancies you have with GDM, the greater the risk for type 2 diabetes. The risk approaches 100% if you have three such pregnancies.\"Is this true?",
