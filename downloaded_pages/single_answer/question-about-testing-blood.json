            "answer": "\"gets harder to control as you get older.\"Besides not eating sugary foods one must restrict carb intake to minimum, avoid foods made with white flour and starches like white rice and potatoes. Exercise and weight control play important roles too. I posted a link about foods - what to eat, how much t eat, what to avoid - in this thread below. Scroll down and go to it for valuable info.info on dietBy rainbowpainter\"how often to test blood sugar?\"As far as testing, there is no age limit on testing. Everyone should adhere to the same basic principle until they have their diabetes well under control and managed; test before meals to get a baseline measurement, then 2-3 hours later to see how the foods you ate affected your glucose levels. Your postprandial [after meal] level should be <141 mg, optimum <121 mg. If it is higher then avoid those unhealthy\u00a0\u00a0foods. If you're on insulin also test before bedtime and dose accordingly to levels. Test first thing in morning prior to eating or drinking any colored liquids. This will provide an insight on how much glucose your body is releasing in anticipation of your needed energy upon awakening.Keep in mind most primary care physicians have limited knowledge on diabetes care. An Endocrinologist is the specialist to see. Good luck",
