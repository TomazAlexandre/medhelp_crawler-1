            "answer": "Sounds like maybe type two diabetes. Even he's pretty healthy, he could still have it, especially since there's history of it in the family.But if he's lost some weight, or starting to get irritable, or really tired all the time, catching sickness easily, headaches, etc.. then it's more likely it's type one. usually with type one the symptoms are really obvious, but you should go see the doc before anything gets worse.I suggest going to get an a1c done, the average blood sugar of three months. That'll probably give you what you need to see if it's really diabetes.Good luck to you and your son",
