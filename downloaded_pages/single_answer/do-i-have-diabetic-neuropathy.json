            "answer": "What you don't mention is how long you have been diabetic and how well controlled your blood sugar is. Complications such as neuropathy are caused by long periods of time spent at high blood sugars. The most important thing you can do to minimize complications is to lower your blood sugars. I know lack of insurance is a problem, but you should test and alter your intake of carbs as necessary to lower blood sugars as well as lose weight if you are overweight.No, I wouldn't get married just to use your girlfriend's insurance. Marriage is something you do after much thought because you want to be married to that person.\u00a0\u00a0If you continue to have problems or if you are unable to control blood sugar and need a change of meds or insulin, I would go to the free clinic.",
