            "answer": "Hi,The symptoms of hypothyroidism are unfortunately sometimes difficult to differentiate from normal pregnancy(or normal life!)--the most common are fatigue, swelling/water retention, weight gain, mood swings/depression and constipation. It is very important to have it adequately treated during your pregnancy because your baby and course of pregnancy can be seriously affected--if you are not already seeing an Endocrinologist, I strongly suggest that you seek out a specialist in your area to see you atleast during your pregnancy.There are variable effects on insulin intake because it is also linked to your weight gain, so you will need to keep checking your glucoses several times a day, especially as your thyroid hormone dose is adjusted.Good luck and take care.",
