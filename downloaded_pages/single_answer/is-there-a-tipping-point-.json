    "question": "I have diabetes type 2 and have been over weight all my life. I have been diagnosed now as being Morbidly Obese and there are all sorts of new problems associated with it. The most worrying ones are my inability to breathe and the heart disputations and distress when\u00a0\u00a0I undertake the simplest of tasks around the house. I have always been big and strong but after turning 61 these symptoms have all just appeared within a period of one month after our mother died and the resulting stress and depression of the event have taken it's tole. MY general question is can this change in my health go from\u00a0\u00a0being strong and able to do things around the house etc. to not being able to even walk to the front door without great stress be anything else other than the Morbidly obese diagnosis can this \"tipping point\" in my weight and age happen so quickly, within one month? and obviously if I can loose weight will it reverse the problem? Thank you. Yours truly Stephen\u00a0\u00a0 aka BadhabitsOz",
