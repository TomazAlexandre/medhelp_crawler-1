            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.I am not really sure what you mean by the term scar; similar to scarring that occurs in other areas of the body when there is injury, scarring can occur in the brain and is termed gliosis. It would theoretically occur in response to any type of insult.In general, there are multiple causes for so called plaques in the brain, with \"small strokes\" maybe being one of them depending on what you mean. Most often, these plaques are due to what is called \"chronic small vessel disease\", literally meaning diseased small vessels that supply blood flow to the brain. This is not an uncommon process in the brain and increases with age. This is not a disease in and of itself but rather is a reflection of unhealthy blood vessels, damaged by years of plaque build-up. This is most often due to a combination of several factors including the following: high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol. If these factors are well controlled, the damage to the brain can be stabilized and further damage prevented.MRI scans are better at providing detailed information about the brain (with the exception of blood and a few other things, which appear better on CT scan). An MRI is better than CT at detecting small strokes and chronic small vessel disease.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
