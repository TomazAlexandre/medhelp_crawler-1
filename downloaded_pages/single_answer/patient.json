            "answer": "Hello,In retrograde ejaculation, the semen goes into the bladder instead of out through the penis. Common cause of such symptoms are ejaculatory duct obstruction, diabetes, medications for treating high blood pressure, prostate enlargement and mood disorders, retrograde ejaculation, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or seminal vesicle obstruction.Sometimes procedures like prostatectomy, transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP), transurethral microwave therapy (TUMT), transurethral needle ablation (TUNA), laser therapy of prostate\u00a0\u00a0and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) may also cause such symptoms. I suggest you to consult a urologist and get it evaluated as the treatment depends on the cause.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
