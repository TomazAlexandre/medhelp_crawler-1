            "answer": "Your parents are too busy to take you to the doctor when you are sick??? Find someone else who can take you. You need to be seen by a doctor, not someone on a website. Yes, you may have diabetes, or it may be something else. Make an appointment right away. If you start vomiting again like that you need to go to an ER. If you are diabetic and you vomit like that or feel like you have the flu it means you are experiencing something called DKA due to high blood sugars and it can be fatal. I'm not saying that to scare you, but to let you know how serious it is. Please call the doctor and explain your symptoms and ask to be seen right away. Let me know you've done that. I don't know you but I don't want anything to happen to you.",
