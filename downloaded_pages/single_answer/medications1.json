            "answer": "Hi!You can ask your doctor to prescribe the generic versions of these drugs which are much cheaper and equally effective because they contain the same salts and compounds and in the same strength as the original drug. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
