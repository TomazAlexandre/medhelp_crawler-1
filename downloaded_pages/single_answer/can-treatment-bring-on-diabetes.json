    "question": "My wife was found to have ovarian cancer in Sept 2002. After the usual debulking, she had 8 treatments of taxotere and carboplatin. On her 8th treatment, she had a severe reaction to the carbonplatin. Her doctor then started her on topotecan. She gets a treatment every Friday. Last Friday was her 5th or 6th (I can't remember) treatment. Her blood test prior to her treatment showed that her glucose level was 436, which was very high. They had to give her two units of insulin to try to bring her glucose level down. There is not any history of diabetes in her family. My question is, could the chemo treatments affect the production of insulin and raise her glucose levels. Also could the chemo cause permanent damage to her organs?",
