            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include infections, hormonal/ endocrine imbalances, low blood pressure, low blood sugar, micronutrient deficiencies, autoimmune conditions etc. It would be best to get this evaluated by a primary care physician/ internist initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I have been experiencing dizziness, shaking and tiredness now for about 7 months, and have had hot and cold flushes and sickness for about 2 months now. I have been to the doctors, who took blood tests for diabetes, anaemia etc, and all came back clear. They now refuse to do any more tests, so I am switching doctors. Has anyone else had similar to this or have any advice on what I can do?",
