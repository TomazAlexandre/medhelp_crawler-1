    "question": "I just today had a doctor prescribe hydrochlorothiazide to me. I filled the prescription and then came home and phoned my oldest friend in the world, a 59 yr old Internal Medicine specialist to talk to him about it.\u00a0\u00a0His initial reaction was, and I quote, \"I wouldn't take that stuff!\".\u00a0\u00a0He told me that I should tell the first doctor that, after researching the hydrochlorothiazide, I am fearful of taking what he prescribed and that what I would like is for him to prescribe an ace inhibitor.\u00a0\u00a0I have NEVER liked taking pills and am not sure what to do.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts?\u00a0\u00a0I will be 59 yrs old in 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0btw, the first doctor also prescribed 81mg aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor friend back east told me that the most recent studies have shown that an aspirin regimen has little to no effect on someone until AFTER they have had a heart attack or other... Any thoughts and or comments would be greatly appreciated. I realize you cannot diagnose or direct me.\u00a0\u00a0I am just looking for another opinion regarding these different classes of drugs.\u00a0\u00a0I am not interested in getting gout, diabetes, kidney or liver issues, etc... Thank you.",
