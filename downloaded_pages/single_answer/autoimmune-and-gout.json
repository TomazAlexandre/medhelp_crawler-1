            "answer": "Hi!Gout can develop in individuals who either have high uric acid production or have difficulty eliminating uric acid from the body. Individuals on steroids have high risk of obesity, diabetes and kidney problems. All these can precipitate gouty arthritis and if uncontrolled diabetes and kidney problems can cause delirium. Also, liver problems could be the cause of delirium and gout like condition. Please discuss this with your husband\u2019s treating doctor and get investigations done to rule out these possibilities.

    "question": "My husband had MRSA last year and had BKA along with a defibrilator removed, eye surgery, a girdlestone procedure on leg not amputated. He became delirious last summer and after several trips back in the hospital was diagnosed with type 2 hyperthyroidism due to use of Amiodarone and was placed on prednisone. At that point his delirium went away and he was back to normal. After 3 months the doctors wanted to reduce the mg. of his prednisone, which they did. As soon as he got down to 17.5 mgs he became delirious again (he was being cut back by 2.5 mg every 2 weeks), not putting 2 and 2 together everyone of his doctors blamed \"institutional delirium\" \"pain killer drug delirium\" and a few other diagnosis. All were explained in detail to me and made sense. After he had 3 outbreaks of gout (which he had never had, and each time after aspiration only 1 gout crystal was found) I noticed that everytime they upped his prednisone he became normal. He is currently on 20 mgs. of prednisone, but I am not sure how long he will be kept on that amount. The doctors say it might be an autoimmune disease, but I am wondering if he never had gout and it was whatever is wrong with him now? Or are the two related? Thanks",
