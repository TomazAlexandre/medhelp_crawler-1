            "answer": "hello,It is very hard to give you an accurate answer to the question without getting additional details and reviewing your medical history in person, but I can give you some helpful information.Although you are still young, heart disease may be encountered in males of your age. You do mention that you are not a smoker but the decision to pursue additonal cardiac testing is based on presence of multiple risk factors like hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, family history besides smoking.The description of your chest pain is not very typical of a heart disease per se but I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and discuss if you need additional testing. You should talk to your doctor about stress testing and if you need one. This could help settle the nature of your pain with reasonable certainty.Hope that helps.CCFHeartMD19",

For about a month now I have had this sporadic, localized pain on the left side of my chest.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I feel it in the center of my chest and on the right side of my chest too.\u00a0\u00a0It comes and goes throughout the day, I could be sitting, walking, or standing when it comes on.\u00a0\u00a0When it hurts in a certain spot it never last longer then seconds but it could hurt in one spot and then move to another spot of the chest within minutes to hours later.\u00a0\u00a0I have no other symptoms,\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned about my heart?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so very much for your response Doctor.",
