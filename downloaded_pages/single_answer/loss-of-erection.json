    "question": "I am a 22 year old male, and a few nights ago I noticed I completely lost my ability to get an errection. I havnt recieved an errection since then. I also get some drips urine discharge frequently. I did some online research to see possible causes, and nothing seems to be matching my problem. I dont have the systems for diabetes, test cancer, cancer of the penis. I am getting more concerned about it. Does anyone have an advice on what possibly causing the problem?",
