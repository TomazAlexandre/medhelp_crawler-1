    "question": "Our son was born on 22 July, 2008, at 41 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0His birth weight was 12 lbs 12 ozs, at 21 in long.He was submitted to the NICU for respiratory issues, which have been resolved.Because of his birth weight, the neonatal physician suspected that the mother had gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He submitted the baby for a chest ultrasound and found a dilated heart.\u00a0\u00a0The NICU also regularly monitored his blood-sugar levels for four days, which all reported normal.During pregnancy, the mother was tested for gestational diabetes three times, once during the second trimester and twice during the third.\u00a0\u00a0All tests were negative.\u00a0\u00a0The mother also tracked her blood sugar with a blood glucose meter and consistantly had two-hour blood sugars below 115 and fasting blood sugars below 90.\u00a0\u00a0Sleeping fasting blood sugars were consistantly at 110 (These were the only levels that reported high).Other than gestational diabetes, what other causes would there be for his dilated heart?",
