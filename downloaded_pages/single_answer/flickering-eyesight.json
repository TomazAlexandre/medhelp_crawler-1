    "question": "Hello,In December of 2002 I had developed a very bad strep throat to the extent that I could barely converse because my voice was nearly inaudible.\u00a0\u00a0One night I had an extremely bad headache, worst headache in my life, forced myself to fall asleep, and immediately upon waking that morning I felt like I was in an awful nightmare because of the fact that my vision was way off.\u00a0\u00a0Everything seems to flicker, constantly, and there seems to be an excessive amount of lighting around me.\u00a0\u00a0I have also noticed throughout the 8 years of having this problem, one of my pupils is closer to my nose than the other, even though I never had that problem prior to this incident from happening.\u00a0\u00a0It is truly debilitating as I have been put on anti-depressive and anti-anxiety meds which have obviously not address the underlining problem.\u00a0\u00a0I have had an MRI, blood tests, eye exam, full physicals, everything comes up fine.\u00a0\u00a0I have done some research on the net and a lot of my problems are very similar to derealization, depersonalization, although that usually happens to folks who use recreational drugs; I have never used drugs, smoked, or drank alcohol so I am still bewildered by this.\u00a0\u00a0I am still convinced that it may indeed be an undetected stroke.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 30 years old, male living in Florida.\u00a0\u00a0Any insight to this matter would obviously be much appreciated.",
