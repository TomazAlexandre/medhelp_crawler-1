            "answer": "Hello,The various causes of excessive sweating(hyperhydrosis) are stress and anxiety, adrenal disorders(like Addison's disease, Conn's syndrome, Cushings syndrome, hypoadrenalism or pheochromocytoma), diabetes mellitus, menopause, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) and Turners syndrome, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus,hypercalcaemic nephropathy,metabolic syndrome ,multiple endocrine neoplasia II (MEN II) - also called Sipple's syndrome,renal tubular acidosis (RTA),hyperparathyroidism and sleep apnea.You can gain more information from the following website: http://www.hyperhydrosis-treatment.com/hyperhydrosis-causes.htmlI feel that you should consult an endocrinologist as most of these causes are hormones related and need thorough investigations to reach a confirmatory diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I sweat much too much.\u00a0\u00a0I think my doctors have given up on finding a cause.\u00a0\u00a0My son is angry at the doctors.\u00a0\u00a0I turn red and start sweating for no apparent reason.\u00a0\u00a0It happens in my sleep and wakes me up.\u00a0\u00a0If I tilt my head forward the sweat drains off my nose (coming from the head and forehead) and runs off the tip of my nose in a steady stream.\u00a0\u00a0This can happen a dozen times a day or more.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 54.\u00a0\u00a0When I was 25, I was diagnosed with SLE. I also have fibromyalgia. My teeth and bones are deteriorating. I have steel rods and screws in my lower back and have had two rotator cuff surgeries, but what bothers me the most is the sweating. I'm currently having lazor treatments to get rid of all of the spider veins on my face, neck and chest. I take 10mg of prednisone (steroid dependent), 25mg metropolol twice a day for a rapid heartrate. I was diagnosed with atrial fib at one time and then told I do not have it.\u00a0\u00a0Also, MVP, and then told I don't have it. I have a very small leak in a valve was the last word on my heart. I sweat just about everywhere except my hands and feet. However, I can't stand to wear shoes because they will make me sweat everywhere else except my feet and hands. Sometimes I get lightheaded or a weak feeling.\u00a0\u00a0My bowel are unpredicatable. Either constipated or violent diarhea. I just want to stop sweating. I'm trying to continue working, but it's not easy. I freeze everyone out of my office.No one can stand the cold temperatures I keep my home or office. I just tell them it keeps the place germ free.\u00a0\u00a0I was treated for thairoiditus shortly after this all started.\u00a0\u00a0I took cypro for about eight months. Although they said the tyroiditis went away, the sweating never did. Thyroid disease runs in my family. Hashimoto disease and something else. My doctors have ruled this out over the years. I haven't dated in about eight years because of it. I've had a tough time losing weight over these years. I think prednisone may be the cause of this, but I never had trouble maintaining a thin weight before all this sweating\u00a0\u00a0began, prednisone or not. I eat very little just to try to keep the weight down.\u00a0\u00a0I'm about 150 lbs now. It's gotten up into the 170's before which is way too much for someone who was always very thin, until all this sweating began.\u00a0\u00a0This began after being put back on prednisone. I also began getting these boil-like sores around the same time. I get them on my head (all over), under my eyebrows and sometimes on the vagina. Seven doctors told me they were not herpes. I finally gave up trying to find out what they were.\u00a0\u00a0I had three biopsies and got three different opinions. I keep my medication to a minimum because I have reactions to so many pills.\u00a0\u00a0NSAIDS make me itch. Valium makes me itch and swell at the neck. Plaquinil gives me bullseye dots all over. Topamax is the worst. It makes me itch, feels like bugs are crawing all under my skin and makes my tongue fell like it's swelling. One doctor suggested it could be the fillers not the drugs. I've had morphine where it didn't give me any reaction and then morphine when they had to hit me with some benedryl real fast.\u00a0\u00a0Somehow I've managed to start my own firm and keep very busy taking care of other family members who can't take care of themselve. This keeps me okay mentally. Can my current medications be causing any of this (allergies or side effects).\u00a0\u00a0If you could give me some sugguestions it would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.Ms Fay",
