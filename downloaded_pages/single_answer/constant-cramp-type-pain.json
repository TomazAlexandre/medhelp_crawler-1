    "question": "I have searched the internet in vain.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having widespread charley horse type pain (the best way I can describe it). It feel like the beginning or the end of a charley horse in my feet, legs, hips, hands and arms on a nearly constant basis. It worsens if I have been on my feet quite some time or using my arms (holding grandbabies). I do have Diabetes but it is managed by Metformin and diet. I take Lyrica, low dose, for pain in my toes and feet. Whenever i cannot tolerate the discomfort any longer I take 800mg Ibuprofen. I often use Blue Stuff or Biofreeze. None of this really works well enough to alleviate the constant pain. I am a nurse and have attempted to find jobs where I don't have to stand for long periods or walk long distances. I try potassium, magnesium, calcium, water regimes which don't help. Can anyone suggest help or know what this can be?",
