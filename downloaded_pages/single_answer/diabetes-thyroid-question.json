            "answer": "Hi,The thyroid tests you quoted do not seem to be consistent with an over active state. The TSH may at times be on the higher side and more consistent with a slightly underactive thyroid, but this is best discussed with your doctor. The current TSH test used in laboratories is quite good(not perfect but very good), and it would be unusual for someone to have many symptoms while the TSH is still quite normal and be thought of as having a thyroid disease according to guidelines in current medical thinking right now. Trends in your tests are also important i.e in what direction are the thyroid tests moving, compared to your initial test results.I suggest your doctor also check your oral glucose tolerance test as this gives more information than a fasting only.If you have premature menopause, some of your symptoms may be secondary to those hormonal shifts. Other things to consider include adrenal disfunction and panic/anxiety disporders. A pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that can produce some of the symptoms you mentioned. Please also discuss these with your doctor who knows you best.take care.",

    "question": "I am currently being investigated for a metabolic disorder. My symptoms for the past 9 months have been episodes of tachycardia, tenseness, hot and cold flushes, a sort of inner trembling/electric feeling, with shaky hands,\u00a0\u00a0ending in anxiety & panic. I'm also mostly cold all the time in between. My GP thought it may be Diabetes but my blood glucose is normal. He has also thought I may be hyperthyroid at the beginning but my TSH was 2 then and T4 was 16. Since then my TSH has been 3 and 3.3 with a T4 of 15. Here in the UK the normal range is 0.5 to 6.0, but I gather in the USA it's 0.5 to 3.0. And this week my TSH is 4.6 and T4 is 15. I have also been suffering from a premature menopause at 41 yrs old. My mother and 3 sisters are all hypothyroid, but my mum fluctuated between overactive and underactive for a year before it stayed underactive. Please can you advise me does this sound like Diabetes or a Thyroid disorder, I feel so fed up. I've heard you can have a thyroid problem but it can take a long time to show up in the blood. Is this true?",
