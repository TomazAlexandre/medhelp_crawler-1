    "question": "My wife Cheryl is 40 and has been scheduled to see a electropysiologist.\u00a0\u00a0She was referred by her internist because at the suggestion of her GP, she wore an event monitor based on palipatations she has had for over 20, perhaps thirty years. The results were cause for concern according to the GP, and now the Internist.\u00a0\u00a0She has extensively been evaluated with Holter monitors,stress testing and etc.\u00a0\u00a0She says that she had some problems with her first pregnacy and had some syncopal spells and palipatations.\u00a0\u00a0More recently she had a negative stress echocardiogram in 1994.\u00a0\u00a0In 1995 a Holter monitor only showed PVC's.\u00a0\u00a0In the past two months the she wore the event monitor that showed a lot of sinus arrhythmia, some sinus tachycardia, and some PVC's , all of which were isolated. What is new however is that she has had more significant palipitations, more of a flip flop with some sharp pain for several seconds,then some pressure for about 10 to 15 minutes which spontaniously resolves with resting.\u00a0\u00a0She has no exertional component,pressure,shortness of breath, or dyspnea. She has palipitations daily.\u00a0\u00a0She is otherwise healthy and quite fit.\u00a0\u00a0Interestingly enough, during the recent episodes of the flip flops,chest pain and pressure, she had two three beat runs of Ventricular Tachycardia. One was at 100 bpm, and the another at 166 bpm. She also had a 4 beat run at just over 100 bpm.\u00a0\u00a0She was instructed to call the oncall physician to document it. She had one spell where she felt lightheaded and dizzy but it dissipated quickly upon lying flat.\u00a0\u00a0 She is a nonsmoker, drinks 2-3 cups of coffee a day. Diabetes in father and paternal greandmother. There is hypertension in both parents.\u00a0\u00a0Her BP is typically 100/60 and resting pulse 66-72.\u00a0\u00a0My question is what kind of things do we need to ask the cardiologist, in order to help alleviate this condition?\u00a0\u00a0What can we do to assist? How serious is this?",
