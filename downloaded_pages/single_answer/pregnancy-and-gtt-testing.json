            "answer": "Hi,I think that if your 1-hour test is abnormal, you will be watched more closely and definitely be asked to monitor your glucoses as well as possibly start treatment so that your glucoses do not continue to run high during the rest of your pregnancy. This, as you know, is very important.\u00a0\u00a0It also is important in regard to risk for future diabetes and your health. I agree that the test somewhat seems artificial due to the high glucose load, but we do know that the results have important implications, even a test for just a 1-hour post. Not ideal, but we can still use it.Good luck and congratulations on your pregnancy. Take care.",

    "question": "Dear Forum,I am a forty year old, pregnant for the 4th time and a hypoglycemic. Never had problems with gestational diabetes before. On the one occasion of doing a gestational GTT became very sick due to the amount of glucose I never include in my diet. For the third pregnancy I was allowed to eat a normmal meal and do a glucose one hour post. I'm told I will have to have an actual 50g GTT with a draw one hour post due to my age, no exceptions. My question is, if only a one hour post is being done, what good does this teat due as isn't the evidence of a porblem seen farther out?Thank you!",
