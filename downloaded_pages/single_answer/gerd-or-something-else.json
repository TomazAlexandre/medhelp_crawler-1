            "answer": "Hi BG-MN,The symptoms appear like GERD only. Pepcid and TUMs can offer relief. But there are better drugs available. Consult your physician regarding changing the medication. He will also decide on performing endoscopy and other tests if symptoms\u00a0\u00a0do not improve - to confirm the diagnosis.About stress related reflux, stress as such do not cause reflux, but may worsen the symptoms of reflux. The best solution for relieving stress is doing yoga and meditation.Since your husband is in his late 40s and his cholesterol is high and\u00a0\u00a0he is also gaining weight, a periodic check up of his heart status is essential. Diabetes also should be ruled out.Meet your physician to discuss all these issues.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The information provided is for patients\u2019 education only and is not a medical advice.

    "question": "I have been worried about my husband.\u00a0\u00a0He's in his late 40s and has been having almost constant indigestion for the past two months.\u00a0\u00a0He belches frequently and has been using a lot of Pepcid and Tums, which seem to help him a little.\u00a0\u00a0He does have high cholesterol and takes Lipitor to control the problem (that's his only medication); to refill that prescription, he does have to see a doctor every year, but beyond that, it's nearly impossible to get him to see a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Also, he has gained about 40 lbs. in the past two years, and he has been under a lot of stress, particularly in the past few months.\u00a0\u00a0He is assuming he has stress-related acid reflux.\u00a0\u00a0What do you think?\u00a0\u00a0Should I worry that he could have something more serious (like a heart problem)?",
