            "answer": "What type of B12 are you taking, how much and is it tablet form or drops?B12 neurological (methylocobalmin) does not show in the standard MMA testsIt only shows in a CSF Homocysteine test.Oral magnesium has a dismal rate of efficiency. Like 3-5 % at best!Doctors test serum magnesium levels-waste of time and resources to my opinion because 98.50%-99% of magnesium is in the tissues!You may want to consider Transdermal magnesium Oil treatments.Just do a search for thisHow is your Hashimoto's regulated and do you ever get tested for thyroid function (Free T3, Free T4 and Reverse T3)?Did you have any recent anti-TPO testing?Please read-on, specially if you consume gluten.Look into Gliadin test (urine), by Cyrex labs. They test 12 forms-not just the alpha ordered by most doctors- of gliadins regarding gluten intolerance (not necessarily digestive).Now they can also test which part of the body is affected.Most hypothyroid/Hashimoto's sufferers have gluten intolerance and don't even know it!The gluten molecules-mainly from gmo grains- resemble the TPO(Thyroid Peroxidase - an enzyme necessary for the signalling Thyroid hormone production) molecules and thus the immune system in its response against gluten, attacks the TPO in the Thyroid also!Also you should be aware of cross-reactive foods to gluten. 1/2 of all people sensitive to gluten are also sensitive to dairy b/c of cross-reactivity.I gave you a lot of things to look into. If you have any questions, let me know.Cheers,Niko",

    "question": "I have Type 1 autoimmune diabetes and I also have Hashimoto's disease. In addition, I am almost 15 years post gastric bypass surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I have been experiencing muscle spasms for the past two years.\u00a0\u00a0They are in my lower extremities (feet, toes, calves, thighs), arms (forearms) & hands (including fingers or whole hands), but never upper extremities or torso.\u00a0\u00a0The spasms can last for several minutes & can occur in more than one place.\u00a0\u00a0They are usually triggered by vigorous exercise such as dancing, but also occur in the absence of such activities & do not occur while I am active, only after I finish.These spasms are debilitating and excruciatingly painful.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday they were so severe that I had to call 911 and was taken the emergency room in an ambulance!My doctor has prescribed Gabapentin, but I have to take up to 5 capsules for any relief and it is usually only after 2 hours of suffering.\u00a0\u00a0I take B12, iron, and magnesium daily and all of my lab work is normal.I would appreciate any directions you can suggest; my internist is pretty much out of ideas and the pain is unbearable.Thank you.",
