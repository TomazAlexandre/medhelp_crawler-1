    "question": "I have been suffering from migraines since I was about12, and am 23 now. They have progressively gotten worse, as symptoms arose each time from JUST aura, to numbness in my hand, to numness along the side of my face and my tongue . After Cat scans and an MRI that were inconclusive over the years I feel no hope in answers, other than the neurologist having me quit smoking and taking me off Microgestin(birth control pill) for fear I will have a stroke.Now, for 3 days I have been experiencing weakness, heaviness and internal ticklish feeling in my right foot running up my leg, as well as weakness, heaviness and disorientation of my right hand... I am most comfortable not moving them at all. The doctor put in blood tests for B12 deficiency and glucose test for diabetes. Just wondering if ANYONE has heard of this before or know what could be causing this. Thank you so much.",
