            "answer": "I was told with me having didi twins, gestational and extra fluid that I would not go past 38 weeks and this week I am 37. My doctor will plan on inducing or c-section based on babies position tomorrow after ultrasound. Keeping fingers crossed that they are now both head down and looking forward to dr scheduling induction for next week. But I have heard of women having vaginal after c-section so I do not see why induction would be a problem. Good luck.",
