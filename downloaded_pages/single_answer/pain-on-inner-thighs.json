            "answer": "I would think you may be having a chemical reaction. The throbbing could come from some type of strain or it could be the chemical has absorbed through the skin and is reacting on the skin, causing it to hurt. Here is a list of things you could try:a) get a clothes detergent that is perfume free and dye free (All makes a clear and free detergent, also get clear dryer sheets--no perfumes--dyes/ no bleach/ I don't think they make a free & clear liquid softnerb) use white cotton underwear/ be sure all new clothes are washed before worn. Pants that are bought treated with dye and chemicals can absorb through underwear from body heat.c) use a soap that has no perfumes or dye (sensitive skin)d) get a bottle of Betadine D--ch, to mix your self, saves money instead of premix. Soak the area a much as possible. Do not wash off. Let dry. The get Monistat tube cream and rub in skin until absorbed as much as possible. When dry use cornstarch to dust area to help keep dry. DO NOT USE BABY POWDER, HOLDS WETNESSe) Very important to get as much air to the area as possible. Helps to dry and heal.f) keep notes of what you do, especially putting anything in your lap. Don't use any lotions or creams, the Monistat is a great cream to use and safe for the area.This should cover bacterial and fungal infection. Betadine works great for bacterial infections.If you are swimming in clorine water, stop for a week and see if it helps to clear up. Never set in a wet bathing suit. If you don't get results in a week, it would be best to go to a dermatologist.\u00a0\u00a0 Sure hope this works for you.\u00a0\u00a0RJ",

    "question": "I have pain on my inner thighs. They do not itch and there is no rash. The skin is sticky, even after showering. When laying in bed I have to separate my legs with a sheet or they will become uncomfortable. The stinging feels like sunburn sometimes and throbs. No lotion does anything. The skin is not dry and will not absorb any lotion. When I sweat the feeling goes away. When it feels bad I can also make it feel better by hitting the area.I got tested for diabetes and other possible causes. Scratching does not cause rash or relieve symptoms.",
