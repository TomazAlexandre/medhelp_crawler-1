            "answer": "Hi Parents911,Welcome to MedHelps' Pain Mangement Forum. I am glad you have found us but sorry to hear about your father's painful symptoms.Does he have diabetes? This can effect the circulation in his extremities. Has the physician mentioned PAD (Peripheral Artery disease ) or PVD (Peripheral Vascular disease)? These are painful circulatory disease/conditions that require treatment and attention. You may want to see a physician that treats and specializes in vascular disease.\u00a0\u00a0I am not suggesting that this this is his diagnosis. I am just speculating and encouraging you to help him uncover the cause.There seems to me that there should be an explanation for the pain he is experiencing in his lower extremities. I am glad that they are attempting to treat his discomfort but the real issue should be what is causing it.Don't be afraid to take him to another physician to get to the bottom of all this. An Internal Medicine Physician or if he is 55 or older a gerontologist may be a good place to begin. You are right to be concerned and demand answers and solutions.Your father is fortunate to have a caring, concerned and supportive daughter. Help him find the right physician. Please keep in touch and let us know how he is doing. I will watch for your updates.Take Care,Tuck",
