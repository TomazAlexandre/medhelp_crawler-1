            "answer": "As far as I know from what I've gleaned from the internet and from my visits with my endocrine doctor, fatty liver is due to fat infiltration in the liver from of many things diabetes that is poorly controled, obesity and high glucose levels and high cholesterol within the bloodstream.Fatty Liver caused by viral infections I would suppose must be treated with medications to kill off the virus [antiviral meds] and immunoglobulin treatments.It is true that once the liver develops fibrosis that it stays with you and causes your liver to be more suseptable to the effects of medications and other otc medications.One must weigh the risk/benefit of consuming pain relievers such as Tylenol, Motrin, Ibuprophen etc. before taking these meds for pain relief.Overweight Type 2 Diabetics are almost always given the Dx of fatty liver. 80% of all T2 diabetics have fatty liver.If type 3a is referring to hep c then antiviral meds are used until the virus has been destroyed I would hope and if the hep c has to run its course then once the virus has cleared up the residual damage may be due to fibrosing of the liver tissues. Careful attention to diet, exercise, proper rest, and relaxation techniques should be used.If you look on the web for the American Diabetes Association's ''Month of Meals'' books or the American Heart Association's guides to diet and exercise you can find a plethora of useful tips on how to get into shape, lose weight, and\u00a0\u00a0eat a well balanced, healthy diet that will help in controlling blood glucose aid in weight loss and resolve fatty liver due to obesity.I hope this is helpful to you, Sandi.

    "question": "Many have asked me where i got my information on type 3a's having a greater risk of fatty liver, which causes faster progression of liver damage, and also causes progression of liver damage even after sucessful srv.tx. The study is posted at: www.docguide.com. You may need to search a bit or try it with\u00a0\u00a0/news/content.nsf/search results. i have written out part of the study resultS below here at \"FRIDAY FIGHT SONG 02-28-03.\"This is very important, because it means if we have \"fatty liver\" no matter what the cause (drinking, being fat, or having 3a) the progression of liver damage can still continue even after tx SVR. unless the fatty liver goes away with the virus,as in the case of the non-fat 3a's. This is not my opinion but that of my GI as well. a side note to this is that drinking may not be good even if you are a SVR if you have fibrosis.QUESTION:I want to ask a question to all type 3a's. how many of you have been told that you have fatty liver? i'm trying to get an idea of how much of my fatty liver is from 3A and how much is due to being overwieght. YOUR HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.Also for OTHER TYPES who are Overwieght, have you been told that you have \"fatty liver\"? i'm curious if wieght is a big cause of fatty liver. how many overwieght people have been told that they have fatty liver as well?\u00a0\u00a0THANK YOU SO MUCH.
