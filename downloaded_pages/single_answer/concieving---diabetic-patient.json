            "answer": "Here is from another website on the topic of having the injection.___________________________________________Who needs to take Rh immunoglobulin?RhIg is given to all Rh-negative women whose fetuses might be Rh-positive. The fetus may be Rh-positive if its father is Rh-positive.When is Rh immunoglobulin given?RhIg is given at times during the pregnancy when there is some likelihood of Rh-positive fetal blood getting into the mother's bloodstream. This includes* Amniocentesis* Miscarriage* Elective termination of pregnancy* Around 26 weeks of pregnancy (which protects through late pregnancy)* After deliveryThe baby's blood type is checked at birth, using blood obtained from the umbilical cord. If the baby turns out to be Rh-negative as well, the dose of RhIG usually given at delivery is not necessary.What happens when an Rh-negative mother becomes sensitized and develops antibodies against Rh-positive cells?Fortunately, it is now quite rare for an Rh-negative woman to get sensitized. If a woman does develop antibodies against Rh-positive cells, it will be detected in routine pregnancy blood-work.Rh sensitization usually doesn't hurt the baby in the first pregnancy, because the mom can't make enough antibodies to cause severe problems. But the next pregnancy, and any that follow, can become very complicated if that fetus is Rh positive. If possible, women who become Rh sensitized should get their prenatal care from a high-risk perinatologist.___________________________________Why was she not given the injection after the miscarriage?\u00a0\u00a0Was the embryo also Rh negative?\u00a0\u00a0If you know this to be true of the embryo, that should explain why she was not given the injection.The injection is not compulsory, but it should certainly be given if the baby was Rh positive, or it is not known whether it was positive or negative.As for your other questions, I do not know if she could be given the injection now, or if it would be considered too late.\u00a0\u00a0This is certainly something to ask your doctor!Finally, for your 4th question, yes, she might have problems if she conceives since she is diabetic and 37, but she might not.\u00a0\u00a0It will all depend on her control of the diabetes and her medical care.I would go talk to the doctor about the immune globulin shot, to see why it was not given to her when she miscarried.\u00a0\u00a0If they have no reason, see if it is too late for her to get it now. ( It might not be, but I don't know the answer to that question.\u00a0\u00a0Her ob-gyn will certainly know whether it is too late.)\u00a0\u00a0If it is too late, the article mentions blood tests that can be given to see if her system has been sensitized to attack Rh positive cells.\u00a0\u00a0If so, you have some deciding to do about the risks and benefits of trying another pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor will be able to provide advice about how risky it might be.",
