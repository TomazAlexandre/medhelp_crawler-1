            "answer": "You wife may have these symptoms due to the severe coronary artery disease and with a reasonably good left ventricle these symptoms should improve with medical management.The fact that she did not have heart damage with the closure of the circumflex may mean that there are microscopic collaterals that are keeping this part of the heart alive.\u00a0\u00a0They may to small to be seen with the angiogram.\u00a0\u00a0The best way to ensure both the vein grafts and the internal mammary is medical management with control of the diabetes and\u00a0\u00a0aggressive statin therapy.",

    "question": "My wife is 44, juvenile diabetic for 38 yrs and within 3 years has had multiple stents, then CABG x4 and since then her LcX totally closed down.\u00a0\u00a0The RCA closed down too including the vein graft she had during bypass.\u00a0\u00a0She still has the mammary artery to her LAD and sequential vein grafts to the diagonal and 1st marginal.\u00a0\u00a0Even with the LcX closed she had no collaterals but her heart suffered no further damage.\u00a0\u00a0Her EF is 50.\u00a0\u00a0My questions are 1) she is totally exhausted since the lxc closure. Is this normal?\u00a0\u00a02) how can it be that with no collaterals she has suffered no further damage to the heart muscle, 3) do we need to worry about the vein grafts and 4) how do you ensure the mammary artery stays in good shape?\u00a0\u00a0She can't have a CTA b/c of arm problems and can't get them over her head and a stress test is no good because she has a very bad knee injury.\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks for your help.",
