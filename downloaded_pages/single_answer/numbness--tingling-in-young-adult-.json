    "question": "I'm a 27 yr old female and am very concerned with symptoms I've been having. Beginning in January, my head would feel tingly and numb for about 30 seconds at a time. It would happen once a week. Over the past few months, it's been increasing in duration and intensity. For the past week, my head (frontal area) has been tingly and numb almost continuously. Fortunately, I have had no nausea, vomiting, vision, hearing, or memory problems. I haven't seen a doctor yet. Should I be worried?",
