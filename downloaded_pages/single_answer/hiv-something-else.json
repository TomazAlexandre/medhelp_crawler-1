            "answer": "Does any one have any thoughts? I now just today started with a sore throat . I never had the HIV rash that I can recall and don't have fever. I keep checking . As soon as I wake up with the sweats and check. Highest has been 98.7 once. I very freaked out. Would there be swollen glands in other places. Last chance of infection would be 5 years ago. Thanks",
