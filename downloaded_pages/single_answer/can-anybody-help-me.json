            "answer": "Hi! There is a huge possibility that you have a sleep disorder (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.) such that you do not wake up refreshed. You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Extreme fatigue/tiredness/dizziness/aches and pains could also be due to hormonal imbalance of PCOD, anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit B12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 Postviral fatigue syndrome is another possibility. Persisting EBV infection or mono can also be the cause. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
