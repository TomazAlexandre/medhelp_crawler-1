            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The itchiness could be due to contact dermatitis, that is exposure to an irritant like a chemical or metal or anything you are allergic to, it can cause rash and itchiness. It could also be due to iron deficiency anemia, liver and kidney disorders, thyroid disorders, polycythemia and diabetes. It could also be due to certain medications and food. If the steroid based ointment is not providing relief, consult your doctor for more potent steroid creams and antihistamines, they could help with the itchiness.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
