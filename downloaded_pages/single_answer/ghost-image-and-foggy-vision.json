    "question": "I woke up in the middle of the night with stinging pain in my right eye, along with redness, tearing, ghost image, and fogginess. I wear contacts and had felt some mild irritation and some redness in both my eyes, and I figured my lenses were getting old and I needed to start wearing a fresh pair. I do not sleep with my lenses in, I did fall asleep for approximately 1/2 hr with them in. When I woke up with these symptoms, I rinsed my eye with saline solution, and applied a cold compress. The tearing and stinging stopped, but the rest of the symptoms still persist. Did I unknowingly injure my eye? I was recently diagnosed with being in the early stages of Diabetes Type II, is this a factor?",
