            "answer": "I don't think that I have diabetes, but I had blood sugar problems when taking PEG/riba/telaprevir.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting sugars were elevated and variable, but not excessively high.\u00a0\u00a0After I finished treatment, the levels slowly returned to more normal range.I am two weeks into sovaldi/olysio/riba and have started noticing the same thing again (I now test several times a week). I haven't seen this listed anywhere as possible side effects of any of these drugs, but I believe that the blood sugar levels are a side effect of the treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Whether this is ribavirin or one of the other drugs, I can't tell.",
