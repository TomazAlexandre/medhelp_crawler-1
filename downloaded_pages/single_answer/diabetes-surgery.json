            "answer": "\"I just heard about Diabetes Surgery\"Please name your source - a friend, a newspaper article, a DVD, doctor. Sometimes people say hear when they actually meant read.Is it possible the diabetes surgery you \"heard\" about is \"bariatric surgery\" or commonly known as stomach bypass surgery which is used on obese persons for weight control but now being touted as a diabetic control?In a DVD by Dr. Michael Roizen (http://www.realage.com/company_info/roizen_bio.aspx) he announces bariatric \"bypass\" surgery as removing diabetes in patients but goes no further. He does state that the surgery is risky, something you should investigate on your own.Best help you can give your aunt is to control her diet with low carbs, no sugar, and moderate exercise to help control her diabetes, that is , if she is hyperglycemic.",

    "question": "I dear aunt of mine has diabetes and I would like very much to help her as much as I can but I am a little confused. There are so many options to cope with diabetes out there. I just heard about Diabetes Surgery and it seems pretty exciting but I just simply do not have enough knowledge to figure out anything.I found this website www.worldcongressdiabetessurgery.org and it seems the leaders in the field will be talking about it in depth. I would like to convince her doctor to attend but I am not sure how to go about it or even if Diabetes Surgery is as good as it seems.Could some one give me some advise please? Thank you in advance.",
