            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms of lower right abdominal pain, also felt in the back can be due to appendicitis. The pain, can at times come and go and not give the classic picture. Crohn\u2019s disease, diverticulitis, infection in kidney, kidney stones, constipation, ovary involvement in women, ectopic pregnancy in women, and mesentry (a thin tissue that carries the blood, nerves and lymphatics for the intestine) involvement can all cause lower right abdomen pain. Constipation in itself can cause these symptoms. Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber and also due to dehydration. Diabetes and hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc can all cause constipation. A proper investigation is required preferably by a gastroenterologist (a doctor who looks after the digestive system) and a physician to know what is the cause. The treatment will follow correct diagnosis. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Take care!",
