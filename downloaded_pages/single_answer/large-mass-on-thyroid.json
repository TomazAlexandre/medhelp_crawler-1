    "question": "Hello!I am a 43 year old female, recent blood work showed abnormal TSH levels and my doctor put me on synthroid. An ultrasound confirmed the presence of a large almost perfectly circular mass on the right side of my thyroid. My initial doctor visit was due to extreme fatigue, which I had initially thought was related to Type 1 diabetes. Mass is visable. Is surgery the only option?",
