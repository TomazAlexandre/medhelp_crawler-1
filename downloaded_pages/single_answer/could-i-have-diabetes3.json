    "question": "I've been having a lot of trouble lately. I'm always thirsty and all the water that I drink makes me have to use the washroom a lot. Even if I haven't had water for a while I have to use the washroom frequently. Another thing is that I'm having a bunch of foot problems. For example, I have a small bruise and a cut on the top of my foot and I didn't notice it until I examined my feet. Also, I notice that I'll be walking around and then suddenly my entire foot will just start burning with pain and it gives out on me. Also, I can sometimes be very cranky for no reason and I'm pretty tired a lot of the time.I've also got another question, I checked my blood 4 times and this is what I got, 111.6, 117.6, 123.1, 161.8. What does this mean? I checked these 5 or 6 hours after I ate in case that helps.",
