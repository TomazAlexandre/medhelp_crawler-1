            "answer": "I have a neighbor who is about to, or might have already had, a baby. She is diabetic. Pregnancy is a lot harder for a diabetic, but it is possible. I am not sure if she had juvenile diabetes or any of the details. I just know that I see her walk by my house, round and happy. Your best bet is to get together with your doctor. Schedule an appointment and tell them you want to try to conceive and just bring all of your concerns. Write them down if you have to.Steel Magnolias was made in the 80s and I know that science has come a long way. There might something out there a lot more helpful to you than what Julia Roberts had. Ha ha!",
