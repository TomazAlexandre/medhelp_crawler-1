            "answer": "Hello,Frequent urination in adults can be due to many causes. The primary cause which needs to be excluded is diabetes. Diabetes not only causes frequent urination but also numbness and tingling sensations. I would advise you to get a fasting blood sugar and Hb A1 C test done.If diabetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are prostatitis(inflammation of the prostate gland),interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome, stroke and other neurological diseases, urinary incontinence, bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction .Please consult a urologist in that case. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "hi. ive had this urgency to urinate at least every 20 to 30 mins, all day, and i get up at least 2 times at night to urinate. i told a doctor about this, cause he saw me wearing urine shields during a testing. i cant seem to get any doctor to talk with me about this problem. why? also, i used to be able to drink alcoholic drinks ( beer especially) fine, but lately i cant even drink 2 without it causing massive pain in my lower stomach later. i cant urinate hardly at all after drinking. what is causing this?",
