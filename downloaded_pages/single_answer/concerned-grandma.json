            "answer": "Hello there!Let's sort out some of this info first.\u00a0\u00a0When was your pulmonary embolism?\u00a0\u00a0The reason I ask is, unless you just got out of the hospital for that, and are a bit weak, you should not have any activity restrictions.\u00a0\u00a0Inactivity is actually one of the leading causes of a PE.\u00a0\u00a0That leads to blood not circulating optimally, which leads to a DVT, or blood clot\u00a0\u00a0(usually in the leg) which can travel to the lung, or a PE.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly follow your doc's advice, but there is no reason you can't be up and about.\u00a0\u00a0Even a daily leisurely walk is good.At the luncheons and dinners, what kinds of foods are you ordering/eating?\u00a0\u00a0If you have a weight problem, you could try to order more lighter fare, salads, fish, grilled chicken, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Stay away from fried foods as much as you can, and limit dessert eating to only here and there.The most important thing with a diet is balance.\u00a0\u00a0You need foods from all the food groups.\u00a0\u00a0You don't want to overdo it on carbs or sweets, or fatty foods.\u00a0\u00a0If you are overweight, it would greatly benefit you to try to lose some of those extra pounds.\u00a0\u00a0You don't have to be getting into skinny jeans (lol), but getting your weight to a more manageable level will help to control your glucose levels, and most importantly, keep the diabetes from progressing.There are lots of frozen, prepared foods that are healthier these days.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the \"Lean Cusine\" dinners are pretty good, and not too bad for you,.\u00a0\u00a0You just have to watch the sodium content.\u00a0\u00a0Can you prepare salads and sandwiches at home? If you are really struggling, you can always ask your doc to refer you to a dietician.\u00a0\u00a0There are tons of excellent books out there, cookbooks as well.Good luck to you, let us know how you're doing!",
