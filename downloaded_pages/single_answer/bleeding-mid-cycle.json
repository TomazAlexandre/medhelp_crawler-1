            "answer": "You are not likley to be pregnant but I would suggest that you see your doctor to check for the reason for bleeding. It may indeed be midcycle spotting due to ovulation which may cause a slight estrogen decline which causes spotting but it is best to see your doctor to be sure. Indeed miscarriages are common, and if you have had only 1 miscarriage, most doctors do not recommend any workup or tests. If you have 2 miscarriages then some doctors would do some blood test and workup and if you have had 3 all doctors would agree to do a workup and blood test.In your case because of the bleeding symptoms, some basic workup could be done like a pelvic exam, an ultrasound of the pelvis looking at the uterus and ovaries, some hormones like TSH and a blood pregnancy test.If you then have 2 or more miscarriage the following is some general information from my website:Recurrent pregnancy loss can be attributed to many different causes. These causes include: genetic factors (e.g. abnormal fetal chromosomes, abnormal parental chromosomes); anatomic factors (e.g. structural abnormalities of the uterus such as scar tissue in the uterus, or congenital abnormalities of the uterus such as septate uterus); metabolic factors (e.g. diabetes); endocrine factors (e.g. abnormal thyroid, PCOS, diminished ovarian reserve); infectious factors (e.g. chlamydia, mycoplasma, ureaplasma); thrombotic factors (e.g. inherited thrombophilias); immunologic factors (e.g. anticardiolipin antibodies, autoimmune disorders, increased natural killer cell activity); male factors (e.g. sperm DNA fragmentation); and environmental factors (e.g. exposure to environmental toxins).",

    "question": "Hi,I am 36 and am trying to get pregnant. I have never been on birth control pills but I did smoke up until last summer. I had an early miscarriage in august of 2007 and had it natural (i.e. no d&c) and bleed for a month after, then the next month skipped my period, then went back to my normal cycle. My doctor did not do a follow up scan or any testing and this has always worried me as I have heard of women having problems conceiving due to products of conception.So to my question: My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant again for the past 2 months. My last period was on December 20th. I am usually on a 31 day cycle. According to the OV test I ovulated yesterday (1/8) and today as the OV test showed positive for LH.\u00a0\u00a0My concern is I am now bleeding- light red with clots, this does not seem like spotting as I am def. bleeding and need a pad- but it is too early for my period.I have read on the internet that some women spot when they ovulate, however this has never happened to me before. Could this be spotting?\u00a0\u00a0And why now when never before? Could I have been pregnant and had another early miscarriage?Also b/c of my age, I am concerned with this abnormal bleeding (if that is what it is) and the miscarriage I have already had. My doctor says miscarriages like mine are common, but what tests can I ask her to run to be sure everything is all set.Thank you in advance for your advice!",
