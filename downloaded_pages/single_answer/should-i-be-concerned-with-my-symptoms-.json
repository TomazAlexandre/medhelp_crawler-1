            "answer": "Hi, msample21.You need to be thorough, YOURSELF!Do not ever rely 100% on the medical system.Being proactive and on top of things willput you at a lower risk for iatrogenic-relatedmedical issues.Iatrogenic: relating to illness caused by medical examination or treatment.Having said this, you have to be absolutely sure that your thyroid function is not under-regulated or over-regulated.It happens to more thyroid patients than not!What are you taking for that and how much and when?Did you know that your basal temperature is a good indicator of your thyroid function, regardless of Labs?Most standard thyroid tests are flawed!Do you perhaps have any recent test results?And in regards to your family history of Diabetes, what are you doing about it?Have you optimized your diet, nutrition and meals around\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes prevention?You also need to explore other \"viable\" possibilities, such as Candida (yeast overgrowth), Hormonal issues(besides Thyroid) and deficiencies, such as methylocobalmin B12 and methylfolate (MMA test),Magnesium (RBC Mg test), Vitamin D, Iron panel etc.If you want further details on anything, please post again here.Best wishes,Niko",
