    "question": "I suffered a whiplash in a freak accident about 4 years ago, and have unresolved neck pain. It is often aggravated by certain activities. MRI shows some mild disc bulging and a significant amount of arthritis. Soon after the accident I noticed a mild tingling in my left arm. In the past 6 months, I have developed parenthesis in my left leg and left arm, which has spread, at times, to my right side as well. The bottoms of my feet sometimes turn bright purple. I can usually jump around or shake my foot and get the color to go back to pink. Also, particularly when I am cold, my fingers get numb and turn white. Today, just the tip of the middle finger on my left hand was numb and pale. I have had injections in my neck; they did not help. I went to PT 3x a week for 6 months; my pain has not resolved. I am wondering if my arm and leg symptoms could be related to my neck injury. I have seen a neurosurgeon. He says since the problem is not surgical (which I am relieved to hear), there is really nothing to do but try to cope. He seemed to find the parenthesis unremarkable. Oh, and my primary care physician did a complete work-up before sending me to Neuro - we did blood tests to rule out vitamin-b deficiency, auto-immune, or diabetes. I had periphial artery ultra-sound to rule out circulation probelms or blood -clot (I assume). I had an EMG. Primary care Dr. said all tests came back fine, so we still don't know what the problem is. The pins and needles interferes with my sleep. I have to wake up in the middle of the night to shake my hands because they are \"asleep\" and it is uncomfortable. I guess I am just trying to figure out if this is just something I need to learn to live with, or if I need to continue searching for an answer. My dr.'s seem to think I must be fine, because all of the tests say that I am. I am a 38 year-old mother of three. I am thin and have never had any health problems prior to this. I am really unhappy, though, because I always feel bad.",
