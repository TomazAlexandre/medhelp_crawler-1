            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Two conditions in particular come to my mind when I read the description of your symptoms of discomfort in your thigh.The first is a condition called meralgia parasthetica. The symptoms of this condition include tingling, numbness and burning pain in the outer part of the thigh. The cause of is compression of the nerve that supplies sensation to the lateral part (outer part) of the thigh. This condition has many causes including being overweight, certain surgeries and the positioning that occurred during surgery, pregnancy, very tight clothes, diabetes, trauma. Also, in patients who are bed-ridden for prolonged periods of time in a particular position, this condition may occur.A diagnosis can be made with a test called a nerve conduction study in which conduction along the nerve is measured. Treatment is available to help relieve the symptoms, but this condition may improve on its own.The other possibility that comes to mind is what is called a radiculopathy, when there is compression of a nerve as it comes out of the spine. The compression could be due to arthritis of the spine or due to a herniated disc. A radiculopathy (what is sometimes referred to as a pinched nerve) often causes shooting pains. The treatment depends on the cause. The evaluation may include an MRI of the lower spine.If your symptoms are only precipitated by exertion and relieved with rest, a vascular cause (narrowing of the arteries to the legs such that they don't receive enough blood during exertion, what is termed claudication) would need to be ruled out.I recommend you discuss your symptoms with your primary care physician. Need for referral to a neurologist can be determined after he/she examines you and obtains a history.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
