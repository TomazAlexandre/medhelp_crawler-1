            "answer": "sex pushes the bacteria into the vagina.you are not the cause and neither is your wife.bacteria is the cause.my advice would be that before you have sex both of you should clean your genitals first.also increasing your immune sytsems would help.you both should not drink alchohol and get enough vitamins and exercise and reduce stress.and if either of you smoke anything or use any tobacco stop.if you think you are becoming a diabetic stop eating fast,fatty foods,and any soda pop or candy and start walking or exercising for an hour a day.you can help youself and even prevent diabetes by taking care of yourself.also you and your wife should do this together and start taking care of eachother.if you feel sicker go to a doctor.sex with another man is not going to help.but you allowing it proves your love for your wife.her denying it proves her love for you.work this out together.it can be done.",

    "question": "Ok, I've got a B.S. in biology and took first year medical school classes at UC Irvine.\u00a0\u00a0I also did 20 years of medical and scientific research so the following issue has been long standing and perplexing.My wife and I have been together since 1985 and we've ALWAYS had problems with her getting yeast infections following intercourse with me.\u00a0\u00a0Early on, we both were treated by the MD/PhD (Ob/Gyn) that we worked for.\u00a0\u00a0Some early test results showed chlamydia while others were inconclusive (we treated anyway).\u00a0\u00a0We continued to have yeast infections.Ok, 20 years have passed ... we're still together and monogamous, but she still gets yeast infections from me.\u00a0\u00a0As frustrated as we both are at having a poor sex life because of this, I've even told her she could sex with another man to see if she'd get a yeast infection with him (she declined).IMPORTANT:\u00a0\u00a0I believe I'm a type II diabetic as I have many symptoms (thirst, frequent urination), but I DO HAVE A KNOWN KIDNEY MALFORMATION (a horseshoe shaped kidney).Has ANY female had recurrent yeast infections that she believed were caused by the male?\u00a0\u00a0Did these yeast infections recur despite treatment of both partners?\u00a0\u00a0What were the treatements?\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone here been told they had a \"horseshoe\" shaped kidney and, if so, did you experience any issues related to it.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.I firmly believe I am the harbor of the yeast even though I've not come across research showing men as the carrier.I hope to hear from anyone with credible information.Thanks,Bill",
