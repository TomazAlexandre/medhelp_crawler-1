            "answer": "Hi!Knee surgeries post op complications do include blood clots. Hence if the patient has a history of blood clots, then extra care needs to be taken. This includes a complete screening panel to rule out risk factors for blood clot and treat them\u2014such as high BP, heart disease, hyperviscosity syndromes, diabetes, thyroid disorders, high cholesterols and other dyslipidemias. Bleeding time clotting time and INR\u00a0\u00a0(comparative prothrombin time) needs to be checked before surgery. Post surgery blood thinners may be given with INR under strict control. Early ambulation and physical exercise is started to avoid clots. Patient to be monitored more frequently, taught about warning signs of clots. This is all I can think of as of now. Thanks.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",
