            "answer": "Hi there. You need to consult a neurologist to evaluate you for deficiencies like vitamin B complex, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, injury to a nerve in neck injury or a low back injury, pressure on the nerves of the spine, from herniated disc, pressure on peripheral nerves from enlarged blood vessels, tumors or scar tissue, shingles, lack of blood supply from atherosclerosis or frost bite, diabetes, migraines, multiple sclerosis, stroke, TIA, and raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Check the levels of calcium, potassium, and sodium, for any deficiency. The doctor will need to find the cause in you and treat that. Apart from treatment of the cause, protect your affected hand and feet, against any accidental injury due to numbness. Hope this helps. Take care.",
