            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Yes, \u2018vitamin deficiency, sjogrens syndrome and fungal infection\u2019 is a good way to start with. Many medications too cause these symptoms. Hypertension, diabetes, strokes and transient ischemic attacks, anemia, smoking all cause dry mouth or tongue with a feeling of swelling. Nerve damage due to some trauma or surgery can be another cause. Your problems started with pain in jaw\u2014hence nerve damage could be a possibility.GERD or reflux disease too can cause similar symptoms. A generalized dehydration too can cause these problems.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I've seen posts all over the internet with people asking these same questions and no one has an answer. For six months now I have been dealing a swelling sensation in my tongue and connective tissue under my tongue, but no swelling actually seen. I did however, have significant swelling in my nasopharynx which affects my breathing. Severe symptoms lasted about a month. Now I have the following symptoms which wax and wane day to day.Extremely dry tonguePain in jaw and connective tissue under tongue (still no actual swelling)High IgE level (thought to be food allergy, but no correlation to particular food, numbers down slightly at last dr. appt)Been tested for: IgE, THS/T3/T4, complete blood counts and C1/C4 inhibitors. Everything is completely normal except for an extremely high IgE. I'm so tired of the doctors saying\u00a0\u00a0wait and see, wait and see, and at each appointment I just keep getting told to wait and see. Its been six months of pain and discomfort and I don't enjoy doing things anymore because I'm so uncomfortable all of the time. The pain occassionally affects my speaking because my mouth gets so tired and I also notice a tired feeling when smiling. Does anyone else have this unfortunate experience? Or any other options? I have started looking into: vitamin deficiency, sjogrens syndrome and fungal infection. Allergy testing is not an option due to insurance coverage.",
