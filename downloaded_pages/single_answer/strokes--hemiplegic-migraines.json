            "answer": "Hithere seems to be a thin line between migraines and cerebrovascular events.In your case, a transient ischemc attack has to be ruled out.This is necessary if risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes are present. A baseline CT scan will be able to help. This may not be something which requires urgent intervention however, this is necessary to rule out cerebrovascular events.Although migraine is still a primary differential given your history, other conditions have to be ruled out first. Some migraines may present with auras but with no headaches.Do not hesistate to bring your self to the nearest medical center for assessment when the symptoms recur.",
