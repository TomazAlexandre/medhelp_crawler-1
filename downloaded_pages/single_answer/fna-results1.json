            "answer": "These are small nodules that were FNA'd only b/c of possible radiation exposure.If you were <20yo at the time, then there may be increased risk.Both FNAs are sub-optimal.If the repeat FNA is still sub-optimal then given the size of <1cm (assuming no overtly suspicious ultrasound findings or abnormal lymph nodes), observation may be preferred over surgery and if the nodules grow re-consider repeat FNA or surgery.",

    "question": "i recently had fna biopsies done on two nodules on my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0they are doing another one in 4 weeks because the results were inconclusive.right homogenous nodule, 7mm, lower inferior:rare thyroid follicle cells with hurthle cell features, blood, scant colloid.comment:\u00a0\u00a0hypocellularity precludes definitive classification.\u00a0\u00a0nonetheless, the presence of thyroid follicle cells with Hurthle cell change raises the possibility of a hurthle cell neoplasm.\u00a0\u00a0a repeat fna is suggested to further characterize this nodule.left nodule, 8mm, with calcification, mid medial:negative for malignant cells -- no definitive thyroid follicle cells present.comment:\u00a0\u00a0this specimen consists of blood predominatly.\u00a0\u00a0some possible colloid is noted.\u00a0\u00a0 hypocellularity precludes classifcation.\u00a0\u00a0if clinically indicated, the recommendation is a repeat fna.NOTES:\u00a0\u00a0i lived near three mile island nuclear plant at the time of the accident in 1979.\u00a0\u00a0my mom has graves disease and was treated with radiation a few years after that accident.i am currently on synthroid (.25).i also have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome type 3, diabetes type 2, high cholesterol & high triglycerides (responding to Lipitor, just changed to Pravastatin), Sarcoidosis (multi-system involvement), adenomyosis/endometriosis on uterine and being followed by a urologist after surgical intervention of a 15 lb tumor wrapped around my ureter.my endo warns that he may still send me to a surgeon after the 2nd fna, depending on the results.\u00a0\u00a0with the TMI history, he wants to be \"aggressive\" in treatment.\u00a0\u00a0any suggestions? further tests needed?",
