    "question": "My uncle has been admitted to hospital (pallative care) due to a terminal cancer. He has suffered from type 2 diabetes for many years but is controlled with diet, exercise and tablets. Since being admitted to hospital 10 days ago, he has not been given his diabetes pills. He has asked them to check his levels as he felt they were high and on Tuesday his levels were over 20mmol/l. Since then he has been given insulin injections but his levels today were 31mmol/l. Is this a seriously high level? what symptoms can we expect? can anything else be given?",
