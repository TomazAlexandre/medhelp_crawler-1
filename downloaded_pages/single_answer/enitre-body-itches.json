            "answer": "Hello,Dry skin is the commonest cause of entire body itching without any rash. It can be due to skin conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis,lice,scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps ,cosmetics etc.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.If the symptoms persist then get an evaluation done from a dermatologist. I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hello,My entire body has been itching for quite some time, a few months. Sometimes it gets better (goes away) but usually it itches. Worse at night. No red spots, rashes, etc. I have not changed detergents, etc, either since this started so I don't think that is the issue. Any ideas?Also, should I first see a dermatologist, or should I see a GP first instead?Thank you!Mitch",
