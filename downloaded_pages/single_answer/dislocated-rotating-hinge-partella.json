            "answer": "Hi!Well, if there has been recurrent failure of knee implant in one knee and infection, then it is advisable to re-think the strategy on the right knee.\u00a0\u00a0Please discus with your doctor if knee braces, patella taping or knee fusion surgeries will help you? Also, please check your diabetes status, because high blood sugar increases the risk of infection.Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
