            "answer": "Check T3 - can be isolated T3 toxicosis - otherwise, may need to consider non-thyroid causes of your symptoms (even though they sound like hyperthyroid).\u00a0\u00a0The nodule needs an FNA - doubt it is \"hot\" on I-123 scan as the TSH is normal -- with a normal TSH, the next step in the evaluation of the nodule is FNA.\u00a0\u00a0If endo insists on scan first, only defer the FNA if the nodule is distinctly hot (ie, if cold or warm --- do FNA).Beta-blockers (ie, propanolol) may help symptoms - also rule-out pheochromocytoma (adrenaline producing tumor), carcinoid (serotonin producing tumor, diabetes or side effect from other meds as cause of symtpoms.Good luck.",
