            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis).Other conditions cause itchy skin as well. Skin conditions like psoriasis, dermatitis and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin. You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch. Lastly, Phototherapy can also be tried.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",

    "question": "I took my 8 year old son to the er and his pediatrician about his itchy skin. They don't know exactly what it is because he didn't have any bumbs. They told me to use hydorcortisone cream and the benedryl wasn't working any more so they prescribed Atarax as needed that has helped with his itching a lil but I'm scared that once I run out he will start itching uncontrolably again. Do you suggest me making appointment with a dermatologist? The itching has also spread to his arms a little",
