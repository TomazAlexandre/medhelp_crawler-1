            "answer": "Hi,There are a number of things that can cause excessive hair loss.This may include stress, hormonal problems, certain medicines, infections or from an underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. If this is stress related, it may be a temporary occurrence. However, it would be best to have this evaluated by your doctor for proper management. Treatment usually depends on the underlying cause. It is good that you are having the blood tests done. Take care and keep us posted with the results.",
