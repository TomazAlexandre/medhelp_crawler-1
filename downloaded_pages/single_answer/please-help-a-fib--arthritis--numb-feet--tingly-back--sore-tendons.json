    "question": "Please, any help would be very, very appreciated.History:30 years ago I had urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis - diagnosed as Reiter\u2019s (Reactive Arthritis). Symptoms went away for 10 years. Gradually I\u2019ve been getting more and more seemingly random symptoms, and don\u2019t know what I have or how to treat them. Neuro exam/tests show nothing definitive. Each specialty doctor for each symptom has no answer or treatment (other than taking anti-inflammatories)Recent Symptoms:Numb feet, tingly back, muscles twitch all over my body, legs jerk when I go to sleep, atrial fibrillation, joint pain that moves from one joint to another. Sore tendons, shingles, tenderness in chest associated with headache and mild pain in lungs when I breath - like on a smoggy day (pleurisy?).Test Results:CRP\u00a0\u00a02.0homocysteine\u00a0\u00a012.9thyroid is normal - 1.58Hematology sed rate is low \u2013 4Neurologist ruled out diabetes, MS, and all other common causesHIV negativeThank you!Jim",
