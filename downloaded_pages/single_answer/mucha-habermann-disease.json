            "answer": "HI,The acute for m of Pityriasis lichenoides, PLEVA(pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta ) or Mucha Habermann Disease,\u00a0\u00a0may be caused by any of the following: an inflammatory reaction triggered by infectious agents, a benign form of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder or an immune-complex-mediated hypersensitivity vasculitis. Thrombocytopenia or low platelet counts is more associated with autoimmune diseases, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, which may lead to destruction of platelets due to a malfunctioning immune system. There is not enough studies linking pleva to direct thrombocytemia.\u00a0\u00a0Certain medications such as heparin, quinidine, quinine, sulfa-containing antibiotics, some oral diabetes drugs, gold salts and rifampin may also cause lowering of the platelets.
