            "answer": "It is very difficult to detect heart problems in patients without symptoms, as happens often in patients with diabetes mellitus. These patients often present very late and their heart problems are often misdiagnosed because the symptoms are absent or very atypical. What can one do? Well, one can have a high index of suspicion for these issues in patients with high risk for heart disease such as those with prior history of heart problems or heart attack survivors. There are presently no blood tests to predict impending heart attacks, but only labs that detect heart damage once it has occurred.",
