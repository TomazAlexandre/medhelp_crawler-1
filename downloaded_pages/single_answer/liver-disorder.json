            "answer": "Hello,You seem to have mildly elevated hepatic enzymes .What are your other liver function tests like? Many conditions can cause high SGPT like liver inflammation, fatty liver, injury to the muscles, myocardial infarction, and acute kidney failure. Fatty liver is the common cause of elevated SGPT. Fatty liver due to alcoholism is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. Only if fatty liver disease advances a person can develop cirrhosis .The process can stop and, in some cases, reverse on its own without specific therapy. Lifestyle changes may be helpful. Refrain from alcohol..See a physician and get evaluated for determining the exact cause of your symptoms. Keep me posted with more queries.Best luck and regards!",
