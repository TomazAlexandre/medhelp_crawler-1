            "answer": "Hello,Metformin is basically used in diabetes but is often prescribed in PCOS in which cycles are anovulatory and irregular. It is a problem in which a woman\u2019s hormones are out of balance.So ovaries develop more follicles than normal every month. Diagnostic tests are 2 hr GTT, serum androgen and testosterone levels, LH-FSH ratio, prolactin levels, TSH levels,17-hydroxyprogesterone levels\u00a0\u00a0and 3D ultrasound done.I hope it helps. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
