            "answer": "If you had orange juice just 3 hours prior to the blood test, I'd say your blood sugar level (115) is pretty normal.Fasting glucose levels should be under 100; 2-3 hrs post meal, it should be under 140, which yours was.You could always ask for an A1c test which averages blood sugar levels over the previous 2-3 months.\u00a0\u00a0When the A1c is used to diagnose diabetes, a result greater than 6.5% would diagnose diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0An A1c of 5.7 to 6.4 would warrant a diagnosis of pre-diabetes.Have you ever had your thyroid levels tested?\u00a0\u00a0You should ask for Free T3, Free T4 and TSH.",

    "question": "I am an 18 year old male, weighing 145 pounds and 5' 7\", fairly active and athletic. Although for years i have struggled with fatigue (since I was about 9) and when the fatigue first onset, I had several years where I experienced very frequent thirst and urination and mild symptoms of acidosis such as acetone-like breath. On the other hand, I have had several fasting glucose tests over these years which have all been within normal range.This leads me to yesterday. I went to see my neurologist because I have had chronic headache, vision changes,and loss of appetite and weight loss for several weeks that seems to be getting worse. He ordered several tests including a metabolic panel on which my glucose was 115 mg/dL. I know this level would not be that bad considering I wasn't completely fasted, but all I had to eat/drink that day was a cup of yogurt about 8 hours prior and a small glass of orange juice about 3 hours prior to the test.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure if it's relevant, but in addition to the elevated glucose I also had slightly elevated CO2 and slightly low BUN levels.I'm still waiting to hear from my doctor regarding the results, and I trust him but I just wanted to inquire about this somewhere",
