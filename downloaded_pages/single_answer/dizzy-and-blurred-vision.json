            "answer": "HI,I am afraid a number of things could be causing your symptoms, including high stress which you mentioned. A year ago is a long time so I think you should be evaluated by your doctor soon. Endocrine-related causes to include would be rechecking your thyroid levels, screen for diabetes and an EKG. If these are normal your doctor may want to do other things including imaging or referral to other specialists(neurologist or cardiologist). In the meantime try to rest as much as possible and avoid caffeine. Speak to your doctor soon to get your evaluation started.Take care.",

    "question": "I am a 36 year old professional who works a lot of hours in a high stress environment. I do not drink or smoke. I am overweight, but otherwise healthy. For the past few months, I have experienced frequent dizzy spells and blurred vision. The spells have become more frequent and I am starting to wonder if I have an underlying problem causing the symptoms. I had a full work up last year and everything looked good.The only medication I take is synthroid for hypothyroidism, but I have taken it for a long time and it has never caused me any problems. Any ideas what might be causing my dizziness and blurred vision episodes?",
