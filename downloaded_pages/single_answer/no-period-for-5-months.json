            "answer": "Im pretty sure if you lost the weight that you had gained, then your periods will come back to normal every month seeing that you were normal before. Has your doctor checked you for diabetes to make you dont have it as it does run in your family? Also even if you don't have diabetes maybe suggest to your doctor to prescribe you Metformin (sp?) which helps your sugar levels and may help to lose weight. My gyn put me on that after thing I had a problem with my sugar, but I didn't (my sugar levels are normal, however I do have PCOS) but that pill just made me get bad headaches.Good luck",

    "question": "My husband and I are trying to have a baby but it is very hard to conceive when I have not had my period for months. I was regular until about 2 years ago right after my husband, fiance then, joined the military. I went through a lot of stress in the mean time and gained a lot of weight and had irregular periods.\u00a0\u00a0After I became sexually active, my period became worst skipping 2-3 months at a time. At first I thought I was pregnant, but the tests were negative. I skipped my period for 5 more months before I moved to where my husband was stationed. I was so happy and I had my period for Jan and Feb. Since then I have not had it at all and it has been another 5 months until who knows when. I tested for PCOS but the results were negative, no cysts. So now, 40lbs later, currently at 170lbs, 4'11, stressed, no period, and prehypertension, I don't know what else to do. Diabetes also run in my family, so right now I'm trying to lose weight to see if that will help any. I just want my period back so maybe I'll get pregnant.",
