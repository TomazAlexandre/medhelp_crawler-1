            "answer": "Hi,Thyroid disease is quite common, especially in women.\u00a0\u00a0It is even more common in people with Type 1 Diabetes, but not necessarily increased in those with Type 2.\u00a0\u00a0So if you have Type 1, then the chances of your developing thyroid disease were quite high.
