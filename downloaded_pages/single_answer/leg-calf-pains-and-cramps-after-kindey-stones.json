    "question": "I am a 49 yr old healthy male. I had a 2 day bout with 2 stones last weekend (7 days ago) . I was in the ER 3 times and was loaded up with Toradol and Dilaudid for basically 48 hours straight.After passing the stones my kidney, uteter pains etc were mostly gone in 48 hours but i started getting bad leg cramps in the calfs. This has been ongoing for 5 days now and I feel like i just hiked up a mountain!My doctor told me to drink lots of Gatorade and V8 juice but that is not helping.Could this be a problem that i need to go back for blood work? clots? or is this severe cramping due to the straining and spasms i went thru from the pains? Or are my muscles still full of drugs that have not worked out?Suggestions?Chuck",
