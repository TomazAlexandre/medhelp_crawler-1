            "answer": "Hi!I can understand your concern. Finger and toe pain can be due to peripheral neuropathies of Lyme's lupus, apart from that due to diabetes, and hypothyroidism that must have been tested. Rheumatoid arthritis, vitamin D deficiency, anemia, and calcium deficiency are other causes. It can also be due to multiple sclerosis.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your daughter's pediatrician to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
