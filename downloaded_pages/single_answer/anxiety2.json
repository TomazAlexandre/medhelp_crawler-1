            "answer": "Hi i read your post and Merry Christmas to you and your family.. First off the great news is that your tests all came out fine....the second is that it sounds like you have a great doctor that is very proactive with your treatment plan....third is that from everything you've posted the doc has no doubt hit it on the head.\u00a0\u00a0I am unsure if you are aware of it but Medhelp has a wonderful Anxiety site and in reading a couple of the posts i see where more than a few members of that community are going thru the same thing as you are ...you may want to re post on that site to try to join in on that support group because its super active....good luck to you and happy holidays.",
