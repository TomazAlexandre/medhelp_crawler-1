            "answer": "Hi,Sudden severe stress can raise blood sugars, but levels that require treatment occur mainly in people who are predisposed to diabetes in the first place. A blood sugar of 600 certainly requires treatment and makes me think your husband has had some early pre-diabetes prior to this time. It is also important to consider any medications he was given during this time as certain ones can also raise blood sugars.I cannot say if there are any other surprises headed your way; the best thing to do ofcourse is ensure your husband gets his diabetes treated , starts on a healthy diet and exercise plan, and stay in close contact with his doctors so nothing is missed. Take care.",

    "question": "My husband was recently diagnosed as being diabetic. But we are very confused on how his condition evolved because we are being told that \u201cnormally\u201d you don\u2019t become diabetic overnight. Is there a way to become diabetic? Are there some unknown rules someone forgot to include us on?As far as family medical history goes, my husband\u2019s mother had been diabetic most of her adult life, but she was very obese and did not take care of herself. His grandmother also had diabetes, but she did not develop diabetes until she was somewhere in her late 50s we think and we also do not think she was insulin dependant. No one else in his family had or has diabetes. My husband is in good health, but he was about 15 lbs. over weight and the doctor was keeping a close eye on his blood sugars because of the family history.On August 17, my husband went into his doctor\u2019s office for an appointment and the doctor did some routine blood work then. My husband\u2019s blood sugar was completely normal, but we wouldn\u2019t know that for a week or two later. On his way home, my husband was rear-ended by a delivery truck and he was rushed to the emergency room in extreme pain. He had head and knee pain for several months after that and even had to have a surgery later on for his knee because of the accident. But here is the strange thing. In addition to his head and knee pain, he started being thirsty ALL the time. Because of all the other new symptoms he was having and not feeling well we didn\u2019t notice the new symptoms immediately although they occurred pretty fast after the accident. In October his symptoms had gotten so bad he was again rushed to the emergency room where they discovered his blood sugar levels were over 600.Could the car accident have triggered his diabetic condition? What role does stress play on the body and especially a person\u2019s body that is susceptible to diabetes? Are we in for any other shocks?",
