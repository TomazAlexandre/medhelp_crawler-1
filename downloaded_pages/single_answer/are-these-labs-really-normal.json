            "answer": "Hi KK....Your (TPO) Ab is positive which probably means Hashimoto's ....which is a thyroid autoimmune disease. This would explain why you feel hypo....if your tsh is over a 1.0 with Hashi's you can be symptomatic. Hashimoto's is a funny thing....you can feel hypo symptoms long before the numbers truly show a thyroid problem. Even though your TSH is in the normal range, you are hypo. You should call around and find an endo that specializes in thyroid and not diabetes like a lot of them. I feel bad for you that you went to a doctor who completely missed the diagnosis, and didn't see this. Don't give up and keep looking for a good dr. who understands how to treat hashimoto's and thyroid disorders.:) :)",

    "question": "Hi,I saw my PCP about some symptoms that were bothering me. He wanted my to see my GYN to be evaluated for PCOS. The GYN did some blood work and said that I do not have PCOS but that he feels that I may be hypothyroid and should see an Endo. I saw the Endo who did the following bloodwork that he says is normal. He said I only need to lose weight to feel better.From what I have read online some of these values do not seem normal. Should I look for another doctor or just let it go.TSH 4.30 ref scale .350 - 4.500Thyroxine (T4) 8.9 ref scale 4.5 - 12.0T4, Free (Direct) 1.02 ref scale .061 -1.76Thyroglobulin, Quantitative 1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ref Range .5 - 55.0Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglob\u00a0\u00a098\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ref Range 0 \u2013 129Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a098\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Ref Range\u00a0\u00a00 - 34Thanks,KK",
