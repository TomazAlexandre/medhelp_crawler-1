            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your son kind of has one of the symptoms of diabetes, but kind of not.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking a lot is one of the symptoms, but it's usually accompanied by a hunger.\u00a0\u00a0With undiagnosed diabetes, the body doesn't think it's getting enough nutrients, since the glucose in the blood stream isn't being delivered to the cells that need it to operate, so it tells the stomach it's still hungry.\u00a0\u00a0You don't mention that he has that symptom.\u00a0\u00a0You also haven't mentioned that he's lost any weight, which is another typical response, as well as being very tired.So it's possible that he has diabetes, but I don't think it's likely.\u00a0\u00a0It's good to address your concerns by getting him checked, but if it turns out negative, then it's just a behavior problem that can be solved by not having that pop or juice in the house.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
