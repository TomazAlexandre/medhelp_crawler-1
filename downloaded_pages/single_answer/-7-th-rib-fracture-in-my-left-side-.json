This period of healing can be prolonged in case of\u00a0\u00a0use of steroid medications, diabetes, old age, immuno-compromised situations etc.What is your age?

You should quit the exercise in case you experience pain and breathing difficulty.Yes, you can have a normal sexual life after 6 weeks of injury.Take care.",
