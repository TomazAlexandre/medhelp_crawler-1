            "answer": "There is no proof that this consumption of jelly beans will \"give\" your husband diabetes. However, that amount of sugar is terrible for the body and can be a contributing factor in many health problems and even influence mood. In addition it will lead to weight gain which in itself is a predictor for a number of very serious health problems. Sugar IS addictive physiologically and there may be some emotional factors going on as well for your husband in this excessive consumption. If he doesn't see it as a problem, though, you may not be able to influence his behavior.",

    "question": "My husband has NEVER had any signs of diabetes...blood sugar always normal..just tested in March. But..to settle a disagreement between the 2 of us....can anyone answer this...For some ODD reason..within the last month...my husband has formed a true \"addiction\" to Jelly Belly Jelly beans!!! How odd! He buys them probably 2 lbs at a time...and within a week (or less) they are gone! Sometimes he will eat a lb in a day!Im not a big candy lover...so...I dont really understand this addiction..... can there be any repercussions from this sudden addiction? Theres no fat in them, but they sure are loaded with sugar!",
