            "answer": "Hello and good you are doing well.It's unlikely that the hernia is causing your symptoms of breathlessness. The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Breathlessness on exertion could be due to the decreased lung function. Again in cardiac disorders the heart is unable to pump the blood adequately, more so when subjected to stress like exercise. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. So please consult your primary care physician who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test to rule out a cardiac cause for the pain. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest. Lung function tests could further help in evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am 8 months postpartum with twins and have been diagnosed with ventral hernia. I am very tiny and had big babies. A surgeon said I don't necessarily need surgery right away however I have been suffering from shortness of breath and can't help but wonder if the hernia is causing this. I can't do much cardio as I get completely out of breath and can't catch a \"good\" deep breath. It is so bothersome that even an inhaler won't help. Thoughts?",
