            "answer": "Hi Ellysue,How old are you?Since when are you having cardiac problem? How long have you been taking cardiac medicines?When was the last time you got evaluated for cardiac disorder?I was concerned about swelling which you are noticing and also the pitting character.Usually pitting oedema suggests either it is due to venous obstruction, e.g. deep vein thrombosis or congestive heart failure or due to varicose veins.The nerve to supply to great toe and ball of foot is through L4-S1, which originates from lower back.Any pathology involving your lower back can cause such pathology.Have you been evaluated for Diabetes?Keep me informed.Bye.",
