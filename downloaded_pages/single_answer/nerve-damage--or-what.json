I have been going numb in my toes, thumb, fingers, and tounge. The numbness comes and goes. I was also diagnosed with Achalasia( LES closed, possible nerve damage). I now eat through a feeding tube because of the Achalasia(3unsucessful surgeries) I do not know if these are all related or not. I aso have low blood pressure which causes my arms and legs to fall asleep at night and I become faintwhen standing up quickly.",
