            "answer": "Hello Dear,A carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure which re-tunnels the narrowed or blocked lumen (space within the blood vessel) of the carotid artery. Risk factors include smoking, high levels of blood cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, saturated animal fats and hypertension. The major causes of mortality and morbidity for carotid endarterectomy surgery are myocardial infarction, stroke, neurological deficit (transient and permanent), temporary loss of certain cranial nerve function (resulting in notable paralysis to muscles in the mouth, throat, neck and shoulders), permanent vocal cord paralysis and neck haematoma. As the surgery is performed under a general anaesthetic, patients will show usual post-operative side effects and undergo risks associated with that form of anaesthesia.Refer http://www.bhj.org/journal/2002_4403_jul/case_441.htmBest",
