            "answer": "Thank you very much for your question; although it is quite hard for me to give you a precise opinion here without being able to examine you, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern. From your description of symptoms, it seems that it could be a nerve irritation of neck, shoulder or could be any neurological disorder due to any lack of control upon underlying diabetes. People who work for long periods of sitting or standing jobs, do a lot of traveling or do heavy labor work are at a greater risk for nerve impingement problems. By the reason of that nerves from the spinal cord can be irritated causing pain and numbness, tingling, or weakness in the arm. Another possibility could be an underlying disorder like diabetes or alcohol abuse that may result in neuropathy (nerve pain like numbness and tingling at affected areas and sometimes blurred vision due to retinopathy). If you suffer continuous numbness and notice reduced strength of muscle bulk in arm, please arrange an appointment with a neurologist right away who may be able to differentiate in both the possibilities. If there is any indication of impingement of nerve then an early treatment is essential to prevent permanent damage. Further referral to a physiotherapist for exercises could be beneficial and may produce relief of symptoms. Hope this help. Take Care & Stay Healthy!!!",

    "question": "about 2 months ago i had a constant pain in my mid arm to my shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0each day it seemed the pain would move around from the elbow to the midarm, then up to my shoulder blade.\u00a0\u00a0a friend told me i had a pinched nerve, most likely.\u00a0\u00a0i almost always slept on my left side with my left arm at a upward angle.\u00a0\u00a0not sure why, but maybe i was left handed.\u00a0\u00a0 most of the pain has subsided,\u00a0\u00a0but now for the last week to 10 days i have a numbness in my arm every 30 seconds to 2-3 minutes (left arm and hand).\u00a0\u00a0 i am a diabetic and have been for about 1 1/2 years.\u00a0\u00a0i am on metformin and glimepiride,\u00a0\u00a0but i don't think that is the problem.\u00a0\u00a0hopefully it is just a pinched nerve.\u00a0\u00a0it has lasted for 2-3 months with, as i said before arm pain, which has gone away, but now the numbness is constant.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks for your time and hopefully you can give me some insight.",
