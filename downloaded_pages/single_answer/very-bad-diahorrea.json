    "question": "I am 66 years old and suffer from type 1 Diabetes. Over a year ago infrequently and more lately very frequently I get very bad diarohea, so bad that I often do not get to the toilet before this very runny stool is everywhere.My doctor originally gave me Lopelomide which made my stool hard to go, but it was only stopping it once that was passed again it rushed out.Since then I have been given Fibrogel, but no good. I cannot go out for a meal anymore without suffering this awful and embarrasing complaint.Can someone please advise.",
