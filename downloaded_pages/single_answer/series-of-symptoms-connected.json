            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Some of your symptoms are difficult to explain with a neurologic disorder, such as GERD or gall bladder problems or abdominal pain.Your tongue symptoms are nonspecific, but there is one disorder known as burning mouth syndrome which leads to burning tongue as well as burning on the insides of the cheeks and the roof of the mouth. The cause for this syndrome is not clear but it has been associated with diabetes and a few other disorders. It is sometimes treatable with medications used for neuropathic pain such as neurontin or amitryptiline (an antidepressant used for nerve pain). Sometimes it improves over time, and may not require treatment, but evaluation for diabetes (or insulin intolerance, where you are not quite diabetic but your body does not respond well to insulin) is indicated.Sjogren's syndrome, in a minority of patients, can be associated with normal blood testing, and in cases where it is strongly suspected based on objectively dry eyes (as demonstrated by a specific test by an eye doctor) and dry mouth, biopsy of the inner lip can be done.Your other symptoms of muscle aches, fatigue, and joint pain are nonspecific meaning that they could result from a variety of causes. Rheumatologic disorders are on the list of possibilities, as is a disorder known as fibromyalgia, a true medical condition that leads to whole body pains, and is best treated with medications such as lyrica and neurontin, exercise, and physical therapy. Vitamin B12 deficiency, anemia, and several other disorders can lead to fatigue and joint aches and muscle fatigue, and these could be tested for as deemed appropriate by your physicians.Sometimes depression rather than causing sad feelings leads to physical symptoms and this should always be a consideration if you have unexplained symptoms; treatment of the underlying depression could improve how you feel both physically and mentally.Continued discussion of your symptoms with your primary doctor is recommended with referral to a rheumatologist or neurologist or other specialists as deemed indicated by him/herThank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I'm at a loss & since some of my symptoms could be neurological in nature, I hope you can help.In 2003 I was diagnosed with GERD, I've been taking Protonix, & also had my gall bladder removed. In 2006, with no warning, I began to experience a sore tongue for no reason. It felt as though I had burned it on something hot, only I hadn't. I saw 2 different ENT's with no success. Over time I just learned to deal with it. It flares up from time to time but it's usually always there but tolerable. I also experience dry eye & dry skin. My doctor tested for Sjogren's Syndrome but I was told it came back negative. From time to time I experience the following symptoms: fatigue, mucles aches, joint pain, tingling on one side of my face and/or around my mouth, tingling in my fingers, neck pain, and a sudden feeling of dizziness (like when you are drunk - room is spinning type of effect) that will go away quickly. Each of these can happen at any time but sometimes I go months without experiencing them. Most recently, I began to have upper abdominal pain. Blood work & an ultra sound came back ok. The pain doesn't seem to get worse with eating, etc. However, I noticed it does hurt more when I use the muscles in that area. Laying down flat seems to help. The pain is mainly on the left side, just under the rib cage but does travel to the right.I'm posting my blood test results. In my search online, I've found everything from nerve issue, B12 deficiency, autoimmune disease, etc.White Blood Cell Count - 7.6Red Blood Cell Count - 4.29Hemoglobin - 12.3Hematocrit - 34.7 (noted as slightly low on the report)MCV - 81.0MCH - 28.6MCHC - 35.3RDW - 13.7Platelet Count - 362Absolute Neutrophils - 5533Absolute Lymphocytes - 1444Absolute Monocytes - 532Absolute Eosinophils - 61Absolute Basophils - 30Neutrophils\u00a0\u00a0- 72.8Lymphocytes - 19.0Monocytes - 7.0Eosinophils - 0.8Basophils - 0.4",
