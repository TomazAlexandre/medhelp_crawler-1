            "answer": "With the diabetes, there is a chance of not healing from a bypass surgery.\u00a0\u00a0We had a friend that died after a bypass surgery where his heart swelled out of his chest and did not go down. He was removed from life support after three days.\u00a0\u00a0Angioplasty is less invasive and with coated stents there is less of a chance of infection.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, the person is kept in the hospital overnight after the procedure and the medication is adjusted.\u00a0\u00a0If the patient is not having problems with medication, they can be released from the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0It is good for the hospital to monitor the patient to make sure that they do not have any adverse reactions to the medicine.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, the patient is placed on Plavix for at least 6 months to a year.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes doctors want the patient to continue with Plavix for the rest of their life.\u00a0\u00a0Plavix helps with the blood clots and works like aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0The LAD at 99% definitely needs to be stented and the LCX at 80% should also be stented.\u00a0\u00a0The RCA at 60% could be stented as long as the procedure is being done.\u00a0\u00a0It would be the doctors call.\u00a0\u00a0Part of the reason that people get blockage in their arteries is due to inflammation in the arteries.\u00a0\u00a0Aspirin helps reduce the inflammation and can help reduce the chances of further buildup in the arteries.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes, smoker and obese puts him at higher risk for bypass surgery CABG.\u00a0\u00a0I know many people who have been helped by stents.",
