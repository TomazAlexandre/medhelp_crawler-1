    "question": "For maybe a year, I've noticed, usually when I'm in bed, that I have a sensation of 'flakiness' between my toes when I rub them together, like the skin there is dry, wrinkled, even 'crinkly'. Yet, when examining the skin, I find it is normal--soft and not dry at all. Possibly because of this odd sensation, I involuntarily wiggle my toes much of the time, and sometimes notice somewhat of a loss of feeling; at times there is real discomfort there. I have metatarsalgia and mild plantar fasciitis. I am a 70-year-old female. Any idea what could be going on?",
