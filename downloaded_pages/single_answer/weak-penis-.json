            "answer": "Hi there!Erectile dysfunction can develop due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors with your partner. You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, or you have difficulty controlling anxiety; I would suggest seeing your primary care physician for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 31 year old boy. I am addict of rubbing my penis to bed to masturbate for last 17 years. Now I dont get frequent erections as I used to get 5 years before. Also I feel that my penis is not that hard\u00a0\u00a0because of this masturbation. I get erection but not that strong. I have not done intercourse with my girlfriend but had tried all other things. I felt that while doing doggy style, my penis does not have the required strength and I had to hold my penis from one hand to keep it straight. My foreskin does not slip back and while urinating the pressure of urine is very low. That is why I feel shy of peeing in the public because my pee does not go far. It drips some times after excessive masturbation and I feel weaker in the lower portion. I want to leave this bad habit and have told my girlfriend about this. I am very worried about my future life. Please tell me how to cure my penis?",
