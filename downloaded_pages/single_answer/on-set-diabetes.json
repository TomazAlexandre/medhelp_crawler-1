    "question": "hi there,So for the past few days I had been on a diet and cut out all sweets and sugars, but still eating a healthy amount. All of a sudden I was sitting at my desk and felt nauseous and hot, so I felt like I had to leave. I went into the cubicle and immediately felt like I was about to pass out (cold sweats/flu like symptoms/weakness). The thing that was the worst was the dizziness, I tried to make it out of the cubicle and whacked my head against the wall. I thought I needed to eat something sweet for some reason (I wasn't hungry before as it was only around 10am). My vision was extremely blurred and I managed to stumble a few feet out of the bathroom to the kitchen and grab a packet of gummy bears. As soon as I ate just one (my mouth felt very dry) I immediately felt better. After I got back to my desk I had a runny nose and it stung a little bit which I thought was very strange.I'm wondering if this could be diabetes? It seems very extreme from what other stories I've heard of people who have just realised they have diabetes.Please let me know if you have any advice/suggestions",
