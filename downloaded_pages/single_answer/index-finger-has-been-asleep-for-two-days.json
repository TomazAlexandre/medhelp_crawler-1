            "answer": "Hi,Hope you are feeling better.There can be many causes of your symptoms like nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes and B12 deficiency and peripheral vascular diseases.Your symptoms can be due to compression of median nerve which supplies the thumb and index finger. Carpal tunnel syndrome is one such condition where compression of median nerve occurs.If you are a smoker the possibility of peripheral vascular diseases cannot be ruled out. I would suggest you get yourself screened for diabetes and B12 deficiency also.Please consult your PCP as soon as possible.",
