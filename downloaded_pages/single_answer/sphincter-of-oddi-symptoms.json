    "question": "My Mom had her gallbladder out several years ago and continues to have recurring pain.\u00a0\u00a0She has had several tests and several hospital stays. Always told they cannot find anything wrong and often attributes it to stomach flu.\u00a0\u00a0She never really vomits but does feel nauseous and uncomfortable for long periods of time, sometimes days or weeks. She has been diagnosed with a narrowing of her bile duct and something was done to \"stretch\" it but she is not sure what exactly was done. However, dhe did feel better for a few months after that procedure.I am concerned that she may indeed be suffering from SOD.\u00a0\u00a0I am also wondering if the effects of this disease are more common in diabetic patients and or if there are additional complications with the sphincterectomy among diabetics. Does her diabetes increase the risk of a pancreatic attack more than if she did not have this condition.Thanks.",
