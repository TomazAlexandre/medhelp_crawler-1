            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Numbness can occur in a wide number of disease conditions like hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, spinal stenosis, TIA\u2019s, peripheral neuropathy, neuralgia\u2019s, cervical spondylosis, peripheral vascular disease etc. Do you have any accompanying symptoms like dizziness, nausea, vomiting, loss of bladder or bowel control etc? Most common cause could be diabetes.The other common cause could be TIA\u2019s. I would suggest that you get a estimation of blood sugar, lipid profile and a CT scan brain done to confirm with the diagnosis.It is difficult to say what it is without physical examination and investigations.Visit your GP and ask him to refer you to a podiatrist or neurologist for a full sensory tests and in depth lifestyle and history consultation for confirmation of diagnosis and further treatment.Best.",

However over the last two weeks now I have numbness in the left side of my left foot which appears to be mostly constant.I am 46 years old, 12 stone in weight, play squash, golf and reasonably healthy diet.Any suggestions?",
