            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Since the symptoms begin while you get into bed and start in your feet and and legs, in all probability you suffer from \u2018restless leg syndrome\u2019(RLS) or restless arm syndrome. The pain of RLS typically eases with movement of the limbs and becomes more evident at rest or while you are asleep. Usually cause of RLS is not known but few medications such as lithium, antidepressants and beta-blockers (such as bisoprolol) can trigger the symptoms. Other reasons of RLS could be rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, diabetes or any underlying heart disorder. In addition restless syndrome has been found to be associated with stress, fatigue, magnesium deficiency, vitamin B-12 deficiency, anemia and other systemic diseases. Though there is no permanent cure of RLS, regular & sound sleep helps get relief from symptoms. Supplements of iron/vitamin also help some. Sometimes medications such as levodopa, bromocriptine, oxycodone may be tried to provide some relief from the symptoms. Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may partly relieve your symptoms. Other useful measures are stretching, alternate hot and cold packs or baths, massage and applying vibrators on the feet and legs or on arms and hands before bedtime. Relaxation and meditation can also help. Please discuss with your neurologist.
