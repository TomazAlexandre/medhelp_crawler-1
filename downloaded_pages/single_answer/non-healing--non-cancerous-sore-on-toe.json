            "answer": "Hello,Since the sore has been present for such a long time without any diagnosis, I suggest you to get it biopsied to confirm the diagnosis. My sincere advice would be to consult a dermatologist to get the diagnosis confirmed. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
