    "question": "About a year and half to two years ago I started having some numbness in my hip. For a while, it would go away as long as I got up and stretched or walked around for a bit. It stayed like this for about 2 months.\u00a0\u00a0At that point it was more of an annoyance than anything else. However as time progressed the numbness became more painful, and began to travel into my knee and down eventually into my toes. Now after having been to several doctors - No one seems to be able to figure out what is up with me. I can not sit for long periods of time , I have trouble sleeping throughout the night because of it.In the morning when I wake up, I can not walk straight - or correctly for that matter. It feels as though my hip and the head of the femur are not aligned.Anyways, Since neither My General Practitioner or the specialist or the physical therapist could figure it out-\u00a0\u00a0I talked to a friend of mine who is a nurse - She said that leg pain is often an early sign of untreated diabetes. Ive been researching it on the internet and in several medical text books but havent really come up with much other than more confusion.So I pose this question- Is leg pain like that symptomatic of diabetes?",
