            "answer": "Dear krissy79209,Although you have not mentioned the values with which your diagnosis of Diabetes was made, still find below the recently changed values used for diagnosis:Fasting: >92 mg%1 hour after glucose drink: >180 mg%2 hour after glucose drink: >153 mg%Such a Diabetes which appears for the first time during pregnancy is called Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM).General precautions after diagnosis are as follows:- First try to control sugar with diet planning, keeping fasting <90 mg% and post meal <120 mg%. Do not attempt to lose weight during pregnancy, even if you are overweight/ obese. Instead take 500 calories over and above your usual requirement.You will need to ask your doctor about your diet plan to keep the sugar in check. In case diabetes is not controlled with diet alone, you will need Insulin. Human Insulin shall be the preferred choice.Regarding other tests, none other than repeated blood glucose test is required.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Thank you for using MedHelp's \"Ask an Expert\" Service, where we feature some of world's renowned medical experts in their fields.
