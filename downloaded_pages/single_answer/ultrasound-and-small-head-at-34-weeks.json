            "answer": "i wouldn't be too worried yet. late measurements can be off.My poor friend went through a terrible time. At 37 weeks she was told her baby's limbs measured way too short. She was basically told that her baby was most likely a dwarf and would most likely have other serious complications as well. She was absolutely devistated and had to go through the last few weeks of her pregnancy knowing that something was wrong with the baby. I can't even imagine... anyways, they delivered via c-section with specialists on hand... and the baby was born perfectly normal. she's kinda petite, but perfectly healthy.",
