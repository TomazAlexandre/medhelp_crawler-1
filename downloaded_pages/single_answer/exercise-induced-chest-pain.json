            "answer": "HiIt is difficult to answer your question without seeing you and examining all data in person but I can give you some general pointers which might help.Although you are still very young to develop obstructive blockages in coronary arteries, but your symptoms merit evaluation. The chest discomfort that you describe seems to be related to exercise, which may suggest heart related ailment. That being said, it is very likely that your chest discomfort may be related to lungs, food pipe, diaphragm or anxiety.I would certainly advise a visit to a cardiologist and discuss if a stress test would be indicated in your case.Although I don't know the timing of the echocardiogram after your pregnancy, those results are certainly reassuring.I hope that helpsCCFHeartMD",

    "question": "hi there,for the last little while I have been experiencing chest pain while walking with a stroller.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is generally in the center of my chest and sometimes spreads to my lower neck and is also felt in the left shoulder blade.\u00a0\u00a0It does not happen each time I walk, only sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0It starts about halfway through the walk and increasing the intensity of the walk (ie, going from level to uphill) doesn't make it worse, either.I am 33, female, non-smoker.\u00a0\u00a04m post-partum and 40-50lbs overweight.\u00a0\u00a0Blood pressure 105/70 (always lower), no diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Had recent echo done (routine) that showed mildly elevated pulmonary pressures but was otherwise normal.\u00a0\u00a0I suffer from health anxiety.When I have the pains they gradually diminish then go away.\u00a0\u00a0When I have them, I feel like I want to massage my chest and shoulder blade, the pain is dull and achy.\u00a0\u00a0I am a known upper chest breather but am working to relearn proper breathing with my diaphragm.Should I be concerned?",
