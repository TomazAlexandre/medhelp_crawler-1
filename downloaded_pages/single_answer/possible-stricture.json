            "answer": "Hi,The usual cause of stricture would be injury to the urethra, which would be the tube running along the shaft of the penis where the urine and ejaculate come out. One common cause is instrumentation, so unless your early teen sexual behaviors included items that are inserted into the urethra, the odds of a stricture are unlike.Try to find out how much fluid and other drinks especially coffee, tea, alcohol you consume, as there may be some alterations in the frequency and volume you are passing when the amounts are large and variable. It is normal, not to get out of bed at night to pee.",

    "question": "hello doctor. Im a 19 year old male who has been having urinary problems for about a year. I have been to the doctor several times over the past few months. He did a urine culture which came back clean, and also a prostate exam. He told me my prostate felt normal and that i possibly had a case of prostatitis. I was put on doxy for a few weeks which didnt help to much. I was refered to a urologist who pretty much blew me off. I was in his office for about 5 minutes and he told me to get checked for diabetes. I had bloodwork done and it came back fine...no trace of diabetes. From my research i am suspecting i may have a urethral stricture. I used to masterbate VERY frequently back in my early teen years and i had an instance where i felt an almost tearing pain on the inside of my penis. The pain was a dull pain that lasted a few days then went away. This was like 2 years ago and my symptoms only recently started getting to the point where i notice them. My symptoms include retaining urine, urinary frequency, and dribbling after i urinate. I have some anxiety issues and i tend to worry about things alot. I am wondering if this is a large contributer to the problem due to the fact that at night i do not need to get up and urinate. Any insight to my issues would be very appreciated. Thank you",
