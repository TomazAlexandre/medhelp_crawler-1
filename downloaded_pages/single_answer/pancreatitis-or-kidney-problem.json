            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!Yes, it could be a kidney problem. However it could also be that she does not take ample fluids. Diabetes too causes these kinds of problems. A serum creatinine and creatinine clearance test should be done to rule out kidney involvement and a blood sugar for diabetes. However it could also be recurrent pancreatitis and pain of colitis too that has become dull aching type.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
