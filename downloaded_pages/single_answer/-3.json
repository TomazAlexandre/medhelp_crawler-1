You might want to do a search to read those discussions.My personal opinion is that marijuana has no direct impact on diabetes. However my concerns would be getting the munchies and eating things you shouldn't or haven't bolused for. Also, Type 1 diabetes takes a lot of time and attention and if you are high you may not remember to do what you need to and also may not be able to differentiate hypoglycemia. I think it makes a difference if you are an occasional or a regular smoker.",
