    "question": "My nutritionist has recommended to my gastrointerologist that I have a hydrogen breath test for Fructose intolerance/malabsorbtion. My doctor does not know which hospitals in New York City offer this test. I would like to know this information. In addition, I would like to know about any support groups, or online resources with information regarding Dietary Fructose Intolerance. It is difficult to choose a menu/diet as there is not a large body of information on the topic. Thank you.",
