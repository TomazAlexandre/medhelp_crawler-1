            "answer": "Certainly a full senior blood panel can and should be done for him! That will help to know how his organs are working generally, and his white blood count, liver enzymes, etc etc. I can't see what the problem is about having this blood test done!I'm sorry because I know very little about diabetes and its management.But the blood panel is a good idea. If you are not satisfied with the way your vet is handling him, then please do go for a second opinion to another vet. Remember -we are paying them, therefore they are there to serve us and our pets.",

    "question": "We have a 7 year old Yellow Lab who was diagnosed with diabetes about 1 year ago.\u00a0\u00a0Since that time we have been giving him twice daily insulin doses and his blood sugars have been all over the place.\u00a0\u00a0Earlier this year he lost most of his sight to cateracts but still tends to get around the house quite well.\u00a0\u00a0We do not put him in unfamiliar surroundings any longer such as taking him to the pet store or to Grama and Grampa's house or anything like that due to the cateracts.\u00a0\u00a0He tends to get a bit anxious -which is to be expected.His blood sugar has been all over the place at initial diagnosis it was 600something and more recently it has been at 367.\u00a0\u00a0At the present time we are monitoring blood sugar at the vet on a weekly basis and his levels are still up.\u00a0\u00a0We had considered doing a curve but the cost is too much at our vet.My question is what is this uncontrolled diabetes doing to his insides?\u00a0\u00a0his heart? kidneys? pancreas?\u00a0\u00a0The doc says he has a strong heart but I'm wondering how she can really tell that.\u00a0\u00a0We had asked if there was any blood test that we could do to determine if there was anything else wrong with him and they stated that if we did know that we wouldn't know the cause so it wasn't necessary to do that.Also, i understand that a curve is important however doesn't that just show how his blood sugars fluctuate for that time frame?\u00a0\u00a0Is there some sort of A1c test that can be done on canines similar to humans that can tell us more about his sugars over a longer period of time?",
