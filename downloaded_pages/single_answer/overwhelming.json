            "answer": "Many of your symptoms sound sinus/allergy-related with dizziness being the most prominent one. Actifed in itself can cause dizziness and sedation due to its antihistamine properties, especially if taken several times during the day.\u00a0\u00a0Given the feelings of vertigo, spine stiffness, tremors and headache - consider a formal neurological exam to look for objective signs of problems with the nervous system. An ENT consult may help also. They will be able to directly visualize your sinuses and decide what the appropriate course of management would be if there's an abnormality. Doesn't sound like parkinson's disease at this time. If everything else comes back ok, you may consider going to a dizzy clinic.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Oas here at the Cleveland Clinic is an ENT-neurologist who specializes in patients with dizziness and vertigo. Good luck.",

    "question": "After two back to back surguries in 1990 (2 attempts at spinal anesthia then under general) and 1992 (spinal/c-section) I began experiencing strange symptoms. After 10 years I still have symptoms but have learned to cope with vitamin therapy, exercise and avoidance. I need to solve this problem. GPs have not helped. I appreciate your direction.I have no allergies according to allergists but I still have a reaction to food, molds, and others. Certain foods made me shake so badly, my pulse and heart rates increase. No diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My nose is always numb and inflamed, my sinuses seemed to be filled especially the frontal. My head feels like its going to explode. I have thick mucos and post nasal drip. I become off balanced as in vertigo. No MS.My neck is always achy/notty and feels inflamed along the sides under the ears and head.\u00a0\u00a0I must take an Actifed 2-4 times a day to keep the inflammation down otherwise I get dizzy, nauseous and sick. One MRI several years ago mentioned evidence of change.My spine is very stiff. I gave up 20+ years of skiing because it was becoming harder to navigate. I must hold on going down stairs. It's like I can't feel the steps. Often feel dizzy. Reading comprehension much slower.I cannot drive a vehicle on highways as I cannot cope with the movement.\u00a0\u00a0My body breaks down in to tremors. Even as a passenger - sometimes my mind-to-body cannot not cope with increased speed. The same with emergency response. I start shaking all over. I certainly feel a delayed response time. This is overwhelming. My dad has Parkinsons. Thanks.",
