    "question": "My father was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis shortly after WWII. He developed it shortly after being shipped back from England in a coma with a very high temperature. He had the usual symptoms of RA but it was not symetrical. It affected different joints on either side of the body. He died in 1965. About a year before he died, he developed unusual symptoms- loss of taste, areas of de-pigmentation etc. It then worsened to include high fevers (106F), seizures, comas,severe inflamation of the arteries, edemas of the brain and other organs. Most of his muscles atrophied to complete immobility. He developed complete amnesia. Does anybody have a clue as to what this could have been? I have talked to a few of my doctors and they said it did not sound like typical RA. My brother, sister and I have various autoimmune disorders- Autoimune hepatitis, RA, Hashiomoto's thyroiditis, types 1 and 2 diabetes and so on. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!",
