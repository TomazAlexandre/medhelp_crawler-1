            "answer": "Presence of LBBB however needs a work up to rule out underlying heart disease. An echocardiography is one of the tests, which your mother must undergo. It will reveal any weakness of the heart muscle. A 24 hours ECG monitoring (Holter monitoring) to look for any intermittent abnormality of heart beat like a very slow rate or fast rate is also a relevant test. Besides this blood biochemistry to diagnose any diabetes, kidney function tests and evaluation of cholesterol and triglycerides is desirable. Based upon this evaluation, more detailed tests, if necessary can be done.There is no particular medicine to treat LBBB. The treatment is directed against any underlying problem. If everything turns out as normal then only an annual ECG is advised",

    "question": "Hello again, I have another question....almost 4 yrs ago my mother was diagnosed with Left Bundle Branch Block(LBBB). The doctor told her this is something she can live with without any problems. While during some research I read she could be a risk of heart failure and other heart problems...is this true? Also read she may need a pacemaker. What are some risk and what can she do to control this? Thanks so much.",
