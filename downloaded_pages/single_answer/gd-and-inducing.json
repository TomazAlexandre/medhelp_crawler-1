    "question": "So I am 37 weeks\u00a0\u00a0tomorrow and my little man is measuing not so little at 7lbs 12oz\u00a0\u00a0as of Monday already. I was diagnosed several weeks ago with gestational diabetes and there is a high likelihood that I will need to be induced due to risk factors. FTM here and want to know what other GD moms have experienced and when you were induced or did your little one come early to avoid induction?",
