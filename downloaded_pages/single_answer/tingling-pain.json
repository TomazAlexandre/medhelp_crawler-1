            "answer": "The fact that your MRIs have been negative helps to exclude structural lesions, vascular anomalies, and masses within the central nervous system. Did you receive contrast with your scans? This helps to exclude inflammatory disorders. Lastly, did you have a spinal fluid analysis to look for inflammation within the spine? If all the testing has been negative, icluding tests for lupus, lyme, diabetes, sarcoid, and generic screens for inflammation then a course of treatment with Neurontin is reasonable. Another thought is shingles. This commonly affects the elderly, but can happen in younger patients. This is a reactivation of the chicken pox virus. If the symptoms continue to change then re-evaluation should be considered sooner rather then later.",

    "question": "I am a 46 yo healthy female, hgt/wgt proportionate....approx 3 mos ago I woke up with numbness in my bottom lip..lasted approx 2 days then disappeared. Approx. a week later started getting following sx: tingling/prickling sensation at right abd quad just below rib cage area so intense at times that it almost feels like a vibration , it's not painful but very uncomfortable,\u00a0\u00a0also associated with pain in right flank area sometimes reaching pain level of \"10\" 1/10. Sx are intermitten...but I have them many times on and off thru out the day. Unable to relate any triggers to bringing sx on. NEVER have Sx when lying down...only when sitting or standing. Have had MRI brain, CXR, Xry C-Spine, MRI T-Spine, US abd and Pelvis, basic labs (slightly anemic prob r/t heavy menses) All tests have basically been neg. Slight arthritis in spine. MD has started me on neurontin...with poss DX of neuralgia. Just started medication working way up to 300mg tid....at this point too early to tell with med....no improvement thus far. Have had no recent surgeries or illnesses, no ETOH and nonsmoker. Also I occassionally get a slight tingling sensation in the tip of my tongue...first occurence was approx 6 years ago and has occured several times since on rare occassions....very subtle tingling that only lasts a few seconds then disappears. Sx in abd and flank area of greatest concern at this point as it affects my life on daily basis. Any thoughts greatly appreciated! Thank you! :)",
