            "answer": "You might be experiencing problems with low blood sugar which might or might not be related to diabetes. I wouldn't advise eating sugar (sweets) on a regular basis, especially with diabetes in your family. Some other carbohydrates or fruit can serve the same purpose. If it's been a year, it might be time to tell your doctor about these symptoms and re-check. Thyroid problems can create anxiety and all sorts of other symptoms so check that as well.",
