            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Well oral thrush can occur with one being immune-compromised. It can happen if you have diabetes. It can also happen in case you have a vaginal fungal infection. Poor oral hygiene too can cause this.Yeast infection is at times very difficult to treat. You may need to take oral antifungal pills twice a week for 3-4 weeks along with local application of antifungal cream. At times both partners need to be treated. Discuss this with your gynecologist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a healthy 24 year old female. In August, I went to my doctor with a case of oral thrush. She was shocked that I got that since typically individuals with a compromised immune system get it. To be safe, she had me get blood work done to check my immune system. Everything came back fine.It is now November, and I have gotten 2 more mild cases of thrush (with just a light white coating on my tongue - no white bumps on my tongue or in my mouth). My doctor is not sure why I am getting it since none of my tests say that there is anything wrong with me. I even just got over a bad case of the flu and I fought that off perfectly fine.After all three cases of thrush, it was right after being intimate with my long-time boyfriend. He tried changing his diet, thinking that maybe he was doing something to cause it. However, it does not happen every time we are together and it only just started happening a few months ago and we have been together for years. My doctor suggested that I see and ENT. Is it possible that this could be an allergic reaction to something? I do have skin allergies and break out in hives a lot, so perhaps it could be an allergy of some sort. Any ideas?",
