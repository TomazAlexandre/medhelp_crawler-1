            "answer": "Hi!To treat leg pains you have to find the cause. The various causes of leg pain are atherosclerosis, deep vein thrombosis - leg pain on walking (A blood clot in a deep vein), Leriche syndrome (block in abdominal aorta and/or main leg artery), limb ischaemia (low oxygen to limbs), sciatica or spinal nerve compression in the lumbo-sacral region, spondylitis of lower vertebrae and peripheral vascular disease (arteries of limbs are involved). A color Doppler test will rule out the possibility of involvement of an artery or vein and its blockage by a clot. Paresthesias or abnormal sensations due to peripheral neuropathies secondary to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme's or lupus should also be ruled out.Pain due to pinched nerves can also be relieved by traction, manual therapy, physiotherapy, dry needling to release the trigger points and also by hydrotherapy such as swimming. You can also take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as Tylenol, Aleve or Mobic. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
