            "answer": "Hello! Well, I had mirena for 5 years. i gained so much weight, I had Gastric Bypass last year!! My side effects were the worst! I had really bad acne, very bad mood swings, fatigue, and the worst of all......hair loss. I had such beautiful hair until that evil little device.I had also lost the want for sex with my husband, never ever even thought about it. When I did think about it, it made me sick to even fathom the thought.I just had it removed 03/03/10, and I have been feeling great, more attracted to my hubs. The acne went away a long time ago, but the mood swings even stopped. I just thought I was being a beotch.We are now ttc. I have read aso many horror stories about Mirena, I'm afraid I wont get preggers. I even feel like I may be, but I'm afraid to go find out. My cycle is not due until next week, so I will just play the waiting game, patiently.As far as the weight loss, well I told you what I had to do. I developed High blood pressure from the excessive weight, sleep apnea, borderline diabetes, you name it, I had it.I pray that things work out for you after your removal.Change your diet. No sugar, no pastas, white rice, or white flour. It all breaks down into sugars. Drink plenty of water. Dilute juices with water. Bake, broil, grill, and fresh weggies. Be careful with the fruits, some of them also have their own natural sugars too!Good Luck!",
