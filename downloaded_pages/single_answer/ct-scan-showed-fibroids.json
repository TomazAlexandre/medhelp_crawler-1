    "question": "I am 31yrs old and I was seen in the hospital for pain in my right side. The Dr. there thought it could have been kidney stones so he ordered a ct be done. It wasn't any stones but he said he saw four fibroids on my uterus. When I went to my ob/gyn he said I will be fine and he thought he told me that my uterus was enlarged and I told him that he didn't. He referred me to a pcp because my test results showed an elevation in my blood sugar and he wanted me tested for diabetes. i went and took the test and that dr. said i'm border line to watch my diet and lose a little weight. My main concern is the fibroids I don't want to wait until the last minute and things get worse. Lately when I have sex it is painful does the fibroids have\u00a0\u00a0anything to do with it?",
