            "answer": "Hello,These ticks or tingling sensations that you are having are parasthesias.Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol? Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also occur in peripheral artery disease, Peripheral nerve trauma, Peripheral nerve compression or in head injury patients.Firstly, I\u2019ll request you to get your blood sugar/HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) tested to rule out Diabetes mellitus. You may also need tests like Nerve Conduction Velocity etc.My opinion is to get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.Take care and do keep us posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "In 2000 I was involved in a major automobile accidne that resulted in a severe concussion that took several months to recover from.\u00a0\u00a0I suffered a second concussion 4 years later as a result of another automobile accident. I also have problems with stenosis, calcifications, etc of vertebrae from c3-t2 with chronic neck and pain down into my shoulders (cervical degenerative disk and joint disease).Over the last few years I have developed a tick where I compulsively scratch my head.\u00a0\u00a0I seem to do it unconsciously when my head an neck are bothering me. I have read online articles that seem to indicate that head scratching can sometimes be a method to induce pain relief following brain/head/neck injuries.Does this happen on occasion with people with a history of head injuries?My wife has noticed this tick I have developed and also a couple of my colleagues at work.I have no history of mental illness. I do take lipitor and tricor because of familial hyperlipidemia.I need to approach my family practitioner about this at my next appt.\u00a0\u00a0I could use some background information and medical study resources if available.Thanks folks",
