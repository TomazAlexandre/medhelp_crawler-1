    "question": "My 3 yr old son has gotten tall, but very thin, so I brought it up at his 3 yr old well child check up yesterday. He is always hungry, drinks something constantly...and has gotten skinnier and skinnier . He has not been otherwise ill, and is very energetic. He is on no meds. 3 months ago he weighed 34 pounds. Yesterday he weighed 29.6 pounds.She tested him for diabetes, which was actually my fear, however, his A1C was 5.1 (normal), and he was actually hypoglycemic. His blood glucose was 68.Also, his\u00a0\u00a0neutrophils were low\u00a0\u00a0(29.8) and his lymphocytes were high (59.1). His Absolute lymphocyte count was also high: 4.6.The doc wants to see him again tomorrow.Of course, everything you read on Dr Google is terrifying: lymphoma, some sort of leukemia, some sort of autoimmune disease. Makes type 1 diabetes sound like a cake walk!Any ideas? What should I expect (or demand) for follow up?Thanks in advance!",
