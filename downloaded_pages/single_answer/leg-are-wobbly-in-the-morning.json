    "question": "Hi there. My mom has diabetes but does not require insulin injections. She is 72 and in good health. This morning she could not get out of bed because her legs were wobbly. She did not feel dizzy, just could not control her body. I got her to the sofa, gave her some juice and after sitting up a while, she started feeling better. This is the first time this has ever happened and she just got a clean bill if health. Is this common or somethinh I should worry about? She had numbness in her hands all night. She experiences numbness in her feel due to the Diabetes, but not normally not in her hands. Also, she was very tired yesterday and took 2 iron pills before bed. Does anyone know if that would make her so off balance. I appreciate any suggestion. THX",
