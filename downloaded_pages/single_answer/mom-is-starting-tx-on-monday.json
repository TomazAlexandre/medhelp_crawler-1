            "answer": "Hi,Your question would be best answers by the doctor/s providing the treatment. I am assuming that she would have stage 3 disease. The 5 year survival estimates would be less than 10% for such cases. These estimates however, would be affected by individual patient factors, which would include how much the cancer is already affecting her daily living, the presence of other problems like hypertension, diabetes, other lung diseases like emphysema. For patients undergoing chemoradiation, one of the problems encountered would be swelling of the lung so she may have some coughing fits and some shortness of breath. Take it a day at a time. Stay positive.",
