            "answer": "Hi there, none of the tests or symptoms you've mentioned are really associated with MS, Sjogden is one of the MS mimics as is Lupus which is commonly associated with ANA. Your complete blood count (CBC) being high can indicate infection, anemia and a host of other disorders, some medications can even affect the results but blood results in general have no connection with MS apart from being commonly run to rule out alternative conditions.Have you had any diabetes, nerve conductor tests, brain or spinal MRI's done?Hope that helps.......JJ",

    "question": "I have had major pain in my feet since May 2016 and it has just gotten worse.\u00a0\u00a0Started out on the bottom of my feet and is now on the bottom and top if my feet. Walking has become difficult with out limping a lot.I also have had issues with dry mouth, eyes, and the glads in the left side of my neck just under my ear. Blood work is not back yet for this test.\u00a0\u00a0They also did something called \"ANA\" it is not back yet either.\u00a0\u00a0They did CBC with Differential also and some of the result from that test have come back at High Levels.\u00a0\u00a0When I google the results it looks like it has something to do with platelets.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone heard of this Sjogden testing and what it might be for???\u00a0\u00a0Does this have anything to do with the MS?Thank you for any suggestions I am just about at my wits end with this.",
