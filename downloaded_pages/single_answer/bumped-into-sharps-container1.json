    "question": "My work which, is not a hospital, had a sharps container in the bathroom. After urinating I turned around and my elbow ran into the container. It wasn't the typical rectangular one it was more milk jug shaped with a wide open mouth you could look into. Like this:https://www.newmedsupplies.com/mobile/Sharps-Disposal-By-Mail-System_p_17598.htmlI wanted to check if there was anything to worry about. I examined my elbow and didn't notice or feel any stick. I do have rough elbows and I had a bug bite which started bleeding after I washed it.\u00a0\u00a0Like i said I didn't see any open wound, but later in the day I was picking at my elbow and it did bleed slightly possible scab..\u00a0\u00a0 Looking in the box I didn't see any needles. There were razor blades and some small what I assume we're diabetes lancets.Should I be worried at all. Was it a bad idea to look in the container with out touching. I didn't see any blood I am just worried sick.\u00a0\u00a0This is like an 8 on my things I would want to avoid :(I don't know much about hepatitis, is there tests I can take? What is the window period. Is it bad brushing up on this box",
