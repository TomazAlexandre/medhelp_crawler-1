I am thirsty 24-7, i drink about 4 litres of water a day,I pass urine alot.I just constanly feel like i am lacking something, just soooo run down. I eat healthy, despite craving junk food all the time. I also get thrush alot and mouth sores. Im just sick of feeling like this. Someone told me it sounds like diabetes, so i went and got tested. im currently waiting for my test results but thought i would ask if anyone happens to know what else these symptoms could be due to. and please dont say stress,i have a great partner,awesome job, that isno stress at all, good income,nice car.. so i know its not stress.Does anyone have any ideas??",
