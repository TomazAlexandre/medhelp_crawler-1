            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Hunger can be controlled if it is related to what you eat. Keep a diary of what you eat. Some food stuffs make you hungry earlier where as others do not. Remove all high calorie and high glycemic index food items from your house. Keep healthy nutritious food, plenty of fiber rich food and plenty of fruits and vegetables.Also the other possibility is diabetes. Especially if you have a family history or you are over weight, this has to be ruled out as a cause of hunger. Well, worms in gut is definitely a possibility-like tape worm, round worm. You may miss the worms. It happens. So do get a stool test done too. Rarely insulin secreting tumors of pancreas are the cause of unexplained hunger after food. It can also be due to severe acidity. Hence avoid spicy and oily food, smoking, alcohol, fuzzy drinks and see if it helps. You may also need to take some medication for it.Hope these tips help. If symptoms persist consult your PCP. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
