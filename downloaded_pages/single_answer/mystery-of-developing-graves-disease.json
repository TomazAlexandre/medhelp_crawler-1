            "answer": "I highly doubt it. Once you are predisposed to something, it is just a matter of time before it rears itself. It may be brought on by a trigger but it was bound to happen. Racking your brain will get you nowhere and feeling drained. BTDT!! When my 3yro was dx'd with type 1 diabetes I wondered if it was caused by a blood transfusion he received at birth, or an allergic reaction he got from a plant 6 mo before diagnosis. Bottom line is he was already predisposed. My moms side has a history of auto-immune disease, I was ''officially'' dx'd with graves this yr, but suspect I've had it for at least 16 yrs...a very mild case. I didn't even know my great GM had graves until I was dx'd. My grandmother has 2 Auto diseases etc, etc. It wasn't until a few months ago that i finally came to the conclusion, that nothing caused my sons diabetes, nothing caused my graves, we already have auto-immune diseases in our bloodline, and it was just waiting on a ''trigger''.",

    "question": "A little over a year ago I was suddenly diagnosed with a severe case of Graves Disease. I have no known family history of the disease, it just kind of happened. Recently in a psychology class we have been reading about anti-depressants and anit-anxiety medications and I read about Celexa, the anti-depressant I was on prior to being diagnosed with Grave's. I know that anxiety and depression are a major side affect with this disease. Before being diagnosed I had horrible anxiety and depression thought to have all the sudden been brought on my a long term break up. ANYWAY to the question: I read that Celexa can have a long term affect on your thyroid and cause major problems. Trying to research it hurts my head because I have learned so much about the disease over the year but never ran into anything in regards to Celexa until now. Too much big words I do not understand. So can someone please tell me in easy terms, Could this medication be a reason for my development of Grave's Disease?",
