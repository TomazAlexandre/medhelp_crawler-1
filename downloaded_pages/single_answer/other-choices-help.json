            "answer": "Hi,Yes, you should definitely let your doctor know about all supplements that you take, just incase one of them may interact with another medication you are taking/about to take.\u00a0\u00a0I know that many people think of supplements as \"natural\" and not as medicines, BUT THEY ARE. They can cause side effects just like everything else.I have no problem with \"natural\" remedies for diabetes as long as they do not harm you(first thing) and they decrease your blood sugars as well as a prescription medication. The problem with many supplements is that there are no great studies to back them up, so even though prescriptions medications are not without their drawbacks, doctors will usually side with those instead.Talk to your doctor about your supplements etc. You may be pleasantly surprised.Take care.",

I take a probiotic at lunch and 1 cinnamon 500 and 500 mcgs of chrominum at dinner. I was wondering if I start taking Diamaxol one a day, and it works, can this be my chosen way to treat my Diabetes naturally?

I just don't know til Monday how this new Dr. will be with this natural choice. I guess I will find out. I should tell him what I am taking right?",
