    "question": "I am in my mid-20s and have T2 diabetes (had it for 4 years). Yesterday, I was sitting at the computer at work under a lot of pressure to get a document out. I started seeing a spot in my right eye. It looks as if I stared at a light too long. When I blink, it looks grey and kind of flashes. However, it isn't moving or going away. It has now been about 12 hours since I noticed it. I looked at an amsler grid and I can't tell if boxes are missing. The lines look straight and I can see all four corners, but in the top right of the very center of my vision, it looks like 2 or 3 boxes MIGHT be missing where that spot is. It's hard to explain. I can't tell if they actually are missing. I'm really worried. I plan to see an ophthalmologist, but any reassuring words or ideas would help.",
