    "question": "My brother had a liver transplant on 10/2/98.\u00a0\u00a0The operation went smoothly, and he was sent home after only 6 days. ( He also has diabetes, which I understand will now be more difficult to control.)\u00a0\u00a0Prior to the transplant, he suffered sporadically\u00a0\u00a0from\u00a0\u00a0'liver flaps'.\u00a0\u00a0Immediately after surgery, he showed what still looked like minor liver flaps, but we were told it was the effects of the cyclosporine, (this medicine I understand will cause minor trembling or tremors).\u00a0\u00a0His tremors have become so bad that he was readmitted into the hospital -- he cannot feed himself or walk without his body trembling out of control.\u00a0\u00a0He also has muscle weakness in his right arm (possible from all the IV\"S), and the tremors are severely evident when he puts any pressure on his muscles, such as lifting a cup of coffee or a fork or when trying to lift himself out of bed or just holding his arm or leg out straight.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors do not seem to know what it is (we;ve had many different diagnoses, such as it's all in his head to they have no idea what is causing it).\u00a0\u00a0Neurology has reviewed all bloodwork and they find nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Also, his blood sugars range from the 60's to as high as 455, even with an Insulin drip in place.\u00a0\u00a0Could this actually be an effect of the cyclosporine or steroids?\u00a0\u00a0Or could his diabetes have anything to do with it?\u00a0\u00a0One doctor even mentioned that his symptoms mirror those of multiple sclerosis.Any input would be greatly appreciated.",
