    "question": "My grandmother has Type II diabetes and has had shingles for a few months. It has caused her to lose weight due to lack of appetite and the inability to keep food down (due to meds). Her glucose was flucuated from normal to high when she was not eating. She has gotten an appetite back for almost two weeks. Her glucose was very low dispite her eating more regularly. Now it is very high.\u00a0\u00a0This morning it was 46, this evening it was 204. Is this normal or what can be done to help stablize her glucose? Does stress play a major role as far as glucose?",
