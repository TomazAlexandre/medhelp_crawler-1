            "answer": "Do you think that maybe you are just still suffering from the panic attacks? I was recently diagnosed with them & those are the same symptoms that I have, along with shortness of breath at times. As long as the cardiologist did a complete work up & has a good reputation you should feel satisfied with what he found. If not get a second opinion. Also with my last pg I had palpatations in the begining & I had formed a murmur due to the increased blood flow. It ended up being fine & I didn't have to go to a cardiologist, thank goodness, but my recent palpatations are due to the panic attacks. I too had my gallbladder removed 5 months ago when my baby was only 4 months old. Just keep up what you're doing with your diet & such to keep the diabetes under control & look into a second opinion if it will make you feel better. Also maybe you need a new ob/gyn or tell yours to have a little more compassion. You don't need him to scare you more if it's not warranted. I have to run, but if you want to vent anymore I'm always around. Good luck to you.",

    "question": "I am a new mother, of a 7 month old.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I hadn't planned on having another child for at least a couple of years, but now I'm pregnant again.During the time I was previously\u00a0\u00a0pregnant with my son I suffered relatively no MAJOR problems.\u00a0\u00a0I was sick at my stomach for most of the 9 months, and I had what I would call \"palpatations,\" panic attacks, and felt dizzy and faint-like most of the time. I never really fainted.Also, I had my gallbladder removed 4 mos ago.Even postpartum, the \"faintness\" has continued. I had my heart checked out by a cardiologist who did a stress/echo etc...test, and told me he could find no abnormalities and my arteries looked relatively clear.I've been a type II diabetic for about 5 years now, and never got it under\u00a0\u00a0control until I became pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I've never had to use insulin, and have lost about 100lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I now weigh about 165.I was terrified by my ob who told me in my previous pregnancy, \"oh, you're pregnant and diabetic, you're a GREAT candidate for a heart attack!\"Ever since then, I've been terrified of pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I love the end result, but everytime I become faint, or my heart beats hard I think this IS IT!\u00a0\u00a0I hate what that ob did, because now pregnancy is torturous, not wonderful.My question is:\u00a0\u00a0How often (I live in the U.S. and am white) do women really die from maternity and childbirth, or complications thereof?\u00a0\u00a0How often do cardiovascular, or other major problems occur during this period? Is there ANYTHING I can do to prevent major problems?\u00a0\u00a0What signs SHOULD I look for to help me stop worrying?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
