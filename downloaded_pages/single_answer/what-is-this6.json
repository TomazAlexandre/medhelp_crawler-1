            "answer": "Hi,How are you?The exact cause can be identified only by MRI or CT scan of the lower back. Your symptoms are very likely due to nerve compression.I would suggest you to get a blood sugar test done also to rule out diabetes. In the meantime you can take B complex supplements.Do let us know the results of your MRI. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi to you all.\u00a0\u00a0My pain is now a bit more manageable with all the tabs im on.\u00a0\u00a0It raidiates down my right leg to the toes.\u00a0\u00a0although it is by no means as severe as it was last week its still there all the time and it is impossible for me to be comfy.\u00a0\u00a0Sitting standing or lying.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like my leg muscles are being stretched beyond their means even when im not using them. I have booked to see a chiropractor next month and am still waiting for a back specialist app who will hopefully send me for an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I have had on going problems in my pelvic back legs for last 10 years and I would value your oppinions as to what it might be.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I cant seem to get my legs to move when I want them to it takes a while to get message to them.\u00a0\u00a0And other times it feels like someone is pulling my pelvic apart.\u00a0\u00a0I can never tell what kind of day I will have and it does affect my life and what I can do.\u00a0\u00a0Im 30yrs old with 4 lovely kids and a partner that cant understand as he cant physically see the problem. I have had numerous bad backs but nothing compares to this!!\u00a0\u00a0Doc keeps telling me it sciatica but ive had that many times before and to be honest it doesnt realy feel the same. Hoping some one can help.",
