    "question": "Hi there, I'm a 28 year old white female.\u00a0\u00a0During my physical this year I mentioned to my doctor the symptoms i've been having over the last time I saw her the year before.\u00a0\u00a0I'm always thirsty, have a hard time falling asleep..but sleeping through the night isn't a problem.. I have developed a fine tremor in my hands, I dropped 30 lbs the year before, but now have gained it back, my body is exhausted, I have hot flashes almost every day and several times a day at that, my blood presure has been fairly low with an average of 90/60, but my heart rate at resting is between 85-100.\u00a0\u00a0My physician ran some labs, ruled out diabetes, but did find my TSH was <0.03, more labs followed with a Triiodthyronine at 3.7, and Free Thyroxine at 1.4.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroglobulin showed 22.1, TPO 2.7, Thyroglobulin Antibody <20.0.\u00a0\u00a0I was refered to an endo with the dx of hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I had an I123 uptake and scan test done, with a result of 42% uptake.\u00a0\u00a0The images are still being deciphered.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if my TSH seems to be the only thing that is really wrong, is there a need for treatment?\u00a0\u00a0My heart rate seems to be slowing at night as I am taking Ativan to slow it down as opposed to a Beta Blocker (I insisted on not taking a beta blocker due to my already low blood pressure).\u00a0\u00a0I've done research, and these numbers are not consistant with a lot of dx of thyroid issues I have looked up.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your advice!",
