    "question": "I am a 17-year-old, African-American male. I have a history of having, sometimes very strong, headaches. Recently, I've been getting them about 2 to 3 times a week and it always happens when I wake up in the morning. Also, everyday, I hear a ringing in my ears. Sometimes it is very noticeable, and sometimes it can be discrete. I don't know if ear ringing is a normal thing or if it is something neurological. I also experience dizziness, and sometimes see spots whenever I stand up and sometimes experience prickly and/or stiff hands, feet, arms, and legs. I don't know if something is genuinely wrong, or if I am making a mountain out of a mole hill; but these are the symptoms that I've been experiencing for a while now and I'd like to know if there is something that I need to get checked out.",
