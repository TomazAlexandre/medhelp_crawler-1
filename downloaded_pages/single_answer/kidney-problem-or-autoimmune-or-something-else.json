            "answer": "There are many causes for urinary frequency. One of the more common ones is diabetes mellitus. This can change with your daily food intake/blood sugar level. Your thirst may be another symptom.\u00a0\u00a0The back tenderness is not part of this and may well not have a renal cause. Your best bet is to see a primary care physician and let that person work you up.Good luck!S.A. Liroff, M.D.",

    "question": "I have had an undiagnosed problem for a few years, and am wondering if it's my kidneys.I have had 10+ times a day urinations and frequent thirst with the urgency to urinate in the middle of the sleep. I had past urinary track infections that resolved on it's own, and I may have chronic, or reoccurring infections because the symptoms comes and goes every few months.What really concerns me is if I press down on my flanks and lower back, I can feel a sore pain.\u00a0\u00a0The area is under the rear rib cage, and on the sides.\u00a0\u00a0This soreness only presents itself when my sickness occurs.I have also gained weight significantly over the past few days... I don't feel very swollen just a little swollen face and numb hands in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0Also my blood pressure has risen occasionally, especially the diastolic figures - to the point I feel my head is very stuffy sometimes.I have had several physical blood tests, urine tests, and they all came in border line high or low... For example RBC was 4.7, borderline low. WBC was 10.3, borderline high . Should I ask for GFR or Hemoglobin tests?What I should do (or can do) in the mean time? I have cut down food intake, exercised more and cut down salt intakes.Please Advise! Thanks!",
