            "answer": "Wow hun, thats ALOT. You are definately NOT pregnant, right, If i am reading this correct? I think you need to get a second opinion, your doc doesn't seem to be very on the ball...Also, if you have diabetes, he could be right about loosing weight and your periods being back to normal. Honestly, 2nd hell, even 3rd opinion. Never flip out and trust just one doc, because what if you went through all of this, to find out you never had to?Just a thought. Best of luck to you",

    "question": "I had posted a few weeks ago mentioning that I was 8wks and 6days late on my period. We have taken hpts and blood tests and all were NO!!! I went to get an ultrasound done just to ease my mind if I was pregnant. Well as I was watching the screen all I could see was that there was a size difference in 1 on my ovaries (left). But the right one was ok. Then she went to the uterus and I didn't see anything which made me start crying. I had asked for the films and the report from the radiolist , the next day I get a dvd of my ultrasound and also the report from the radiologis. I called my Dr to ask him a few Q's about the repot because it stayed that I had a follicle in my L overy and also in the report it didn't state that I had fluid on the bottom of my uterus and he couldn't answer what it was. My mother in law used to be a nurse and she thinks that it could very well be fluid in the placenta.when I asked him why I just stopped having my\u00a0\u00a0period and he told me that I need to lose weight and then maybe my periods will come back. He also stated that I would either need to go back on BC or some kind of med that is traditionally used for diabetics because it contains something in it that induces ovulation. So I'm at a total loss right now with things. We were even talking about maybe donate my eggs in return of an ivf. The question I had is can you still ovulate when your not having your periods? Please HELP!! Anyone with this type of situation",
