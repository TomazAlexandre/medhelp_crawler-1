    "question": "I am not sure if my son has Diabetes, but it does run in my side of the family. My mother was diagnosed with Diabetes when she was in her 50's, and I have a brother who was diagnosed with it at about the age of 18. My son is15 years old, has been overweight since about the age of 10, has strong urine, overeats, and his body odor is\u00a0\u00a0morethan the normal active teen-age boy. He is active in sports, but if the sports season is over- he is not active. Hedoesn't eat a lot of sugars(as far as we know), but he does eat too much. He can eat a full course meal, and withinthe next hour or two, he is eating again. He eats a lot of breads, and (what I call junk meats- hot dogs, kielbasa,bacon and sausage). When we try to talk to him about this issue he gets mad, and clams up, and then he will stillcontinue to sneak and eat. Also- just about 1 year ago, he finally quit wetting the bed at night. I have been told thatall of these signs could be symptoms of Diabetes, and since it does run in my family, I am a little concerned. Onemore thing, my husband does have a sister who is borderline diabetic, and she is also overweight. I would appreciateit if you could give me more information on this condition other than what I am able to find on the Internet, and fromtalking to others about this issue.Thank You- Laura",
