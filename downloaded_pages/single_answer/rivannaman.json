    "question": "I am a 59 year old man in relatively good health except for high blood pressure which is under control with medication. I have to urinate frequently during the day and often at night. I have just had a prostate exam and my psa was normal and the prostate size was also normal. At night when I am lying on my back I find that just as I am going to sleep I have this urge to urinate. After I urinate I am fully awake again.If I lay on my side I don't have the urge to urinate as often but still several times a night anyway. Also my erections during sex isn't very good but the doctor seems to think that is because of the blood pressure medication. What do you think is wrong?",
