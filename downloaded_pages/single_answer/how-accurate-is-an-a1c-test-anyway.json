            "answer": "Hi!Well, you are partially right. The HbA1c can be normal if you have too many blood sugar fluctuations from very high to very low. This can result in an average blood sugar which is normal.Also, the variations in its value can cause a change in status from pre to diabetes. Hence, variations of 0.5 this side and that are not really considered clinically relevant and usually doctor work around a range of values and also see the variation in HbA1c in the same individual.The best way to monitor blood sugar is to randomly check you fasting, PP, pre lunch, pre dinner, post lunch and post dinner. You can check any one value over a period of 10-15 days to know how your blood sugar is behaving.Hope this helps! Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I was doing research on the A1c test and read how it's become standardized over the past few years.\u00a0\u00a0I also read that the margin of error is + or - .5.\u00a0\u00a0With A1c, that's a big deal since a .5 variation can be the difference between a normal, prediabetes and diabetes diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0My A1c bounces back and forth between normal and prediabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting glucose is usually in the mid 90's, fasting insulin around 4, not overweight, but diabetes is in my family.\u00a0\u00a0Based on my first A1c in prediabetes territory, I changed my diet and cut out simple carbs, but my A1c still goes up and down within the margin of error from normal to prediabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't know what to believe.\u00a0\u00a0So, why do doctors put so much credence into an A1c test since the margin of error is so high?",
