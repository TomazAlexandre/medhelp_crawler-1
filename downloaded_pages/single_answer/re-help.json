    "question": "Posted By Sarah Jones on August 08, 1999 at 23:30:58My cousin whom is 18 years old recently started having troubles.Her eyes dialate and her blood pressure goes high and then low and she has slurred speech and can fall asleep within seconds.She says her body feels like it weighs 1000 lbs. We have taken her to several doctors to no avail. We live in a small town and I am very worried about her,. They say that she is causing it all herself and that we need to put her on prozac. Can depression cause you to have all these syptoms? She jsu sorta goes out of it ? I am very worried, They have run mri's and a heart monitor over night and several other test ,, to no avail.It worries me because I am afraid she will go to sleep while driving .. Please help if yo can. Thanks again. Sarah Jones",
