            "answer": "Hi,I am sorry that you are having this kind of stressful experience when you should be happily anticipating your new baby. There is risk for birth defects associated with gestational diabetes, BUT this is usually when glucoses are not well controlled. Ideally you should have been able to obtain a good ultrasound prior to this time so it is quite unfortunate that this has not happened. Overall the odds are in your favor that all will\u00a0\u00a0be okay. It is unlikely that the technicians and your doctors suspect something serious but would not say anything.Be sure to keep all of your appointments as you are doing, ensure that your wife's glucoses are staying within goal range and she is in good care regarding her diabetes. Both of you, take good care of yourselves.",

    "question": "Hi,My wife is 26, about 30 weeks pregnant, and has gestational diabetes. We went for the anatomy sonogram at about 20 weeks and they couldnt get clear images of the baby, so they sent us again a few weeks later. The sonographer cancelled and rescheduled, and by the time we had it, we she was already 26 weeks. They said that they could not get clear images of the baby's heart, and told us to come back two weeks later and the same thing happened. They told us to come back two weeks after that to have a prenatal echocardiogram, which my wife did today.The sonagrapher right away complained that at 30 weeks, it is difficult to get a good image. They baby was stubborn and they could only see it's spine. They finally got some, but unsatisfactory images, and said that they could still not see clearly, and would not try again, but instead will do it on the baby immediately after birth.Does anyone have any experience with this? Do they see something wrong but cant be sure so they arent saying anything? I am very confused. What are the risks now? This is a first pregnancy, and we are very very worried.Thanks.",
