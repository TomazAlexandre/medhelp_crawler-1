            "answer": "Hello.Chances are, this is probably coming from further upstream -like from the kidneys. Different kidney ailments can cause them to be \"leaky\" and a bit of blood can escape into the urinary tract. Also a possibility is high blood pressure, diabetes, or even urine retention causing a backup of urine (and the full bladder sensation). There are many causes other than cancer for this condition. A CAT scan will show many things, and they may want to do contrast dye to see if she empties her urine properly. Have her kidney functions tested BEFORE the CAT scan if this is a possibility. The dye can be very hard on the kidneys and can cause renal failure if they are already having problems. I hope this helps! ~MM",
