    "question": "I've recently been diagnosed with vdd (16) by my gyn. She prescribed 50,000 IU once a week until I go to my primary care Dr on the 22nd. Plus I take a multi-vitamin. My symptoms are really bad and had no idea they could be from something like this.So after reading on line about things caused by vdd it freaked me out. Like I said I haven't seen my Dr yet so I'm new to all of this. I'm just wondering if vdd can really cause things like ms and diabetes?",
