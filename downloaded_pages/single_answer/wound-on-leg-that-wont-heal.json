            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for writing in this forum.It looks like this wound is infected or cellulitis. Cellulitis is an infection of the deep subcutaneous tissue of the skin. It is characterized by redness, swelling, warmth, and pain or tenderness.Diagnosed by clinical examination and blood cultures.Treatment consists of resting the affected limb or area, cleaning the wound site if present (with debridement of dead tissue if necessary) and treatment with oral antibiotics, except in severe cases, which may require admission and intravenous (IV) therapy.I sincerely advise you to get a blood culture and wound swab culture done to confirm the infective agent and then start with a course of antibiotics after consulting a physician.Also recurrent wound infections are more in diabetes,obesity,malnutrition, taking corticosteroid medications prescribed for another disorder or condition, a weakened immune system and in heavy smokers.Pls check these out and get yourself evaluated for diabetes as it leads to delayed wound healing.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.Warm regards.",
