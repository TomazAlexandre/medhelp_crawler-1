            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Looks like the HGC diet plan has not been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), which is the controlling authority for all medications. If you see all the OTC's and some herbal medications will not have their approval. This is important because, it means that no scientific studies have been conducted for these medications hence interaction with other medications or their side effects would not have been studied. So, its difficult to comment on the outcome of using this medication.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
