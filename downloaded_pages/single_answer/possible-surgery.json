            "answer": "Here is a website at one of the best hospitals in Minnesota http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/aortic-valve-stenosis/DS00418/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugsFor aortic valve stenosis there is a procedure that is done which involves a catheter in the neck with a balloon to open up the aortic valve.\u00a0\u00a0It is easier than having to have open heart surgery and a valve repaired or replaced.\u00a0\u00a0With your diabetes, you should talk to your doctors about if you are a candidate for this procedure.Do not stop taking your heart medication.\u00a0\u00a0This is so important and the medication will help keep you out of the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0If you stop taking your medication, you may end up in the hospital and that will be of more an expense for you than buying the medication.\u00a0\u00a0The heart medication is so important and will help you to live a longer healthier life.\u00a0\u00a0If you stop the medication, the pressure will build up in your heart, lungs and possibly the kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0Enough of this pressure can cause heart failure with water retention.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes puts you are a higher risk for heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0If the Zocor is not helping with the triglyercides ask your doctor if adding Zetia would help or switching to Vytorin.\u00a0\u00a0Another options could be Lipitor.\u00a0\u00a0The trigycerides are extremely important to keep them 150 or below.\u00a0\u00a0If you eat red meat, limited the amount you eat or eliminate it from your diet.\u00a0\u00a0Eliminating red meat definitely drops the triglyercides and LDL levels.Keep taking your medications as prescribed by your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0If for some reason you cannot get the money for the medications, talk to your doctor about samples, talk to your church (if you are a member or attend), sell possessions, or talk to family and friends.\u00a0\u00a0People are willing to help and more people together can think of solutions and ways to get the money for the medications that are so needed.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

    "question": "I've been diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis and am having an echocardiagram this week as a follow up to one I had last year.\u00a0\u00a0I've had a heart murmur since birth [I am know 61] and apparently my valve is getting more 'floppy' with age and I experience heart palpitations and slight pressure frequently.\u00a0\u00a0I had an angioplasty and stent inserted into my main artery about four years ago and was put on Zocor although my trigs are always high.\u00a0\u00a0I am also taking a channel blocker [have COPD so was switched from a beta blocker] and two hypertension meds plus baby aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0Oh yes I have Diabetes II also and am taking two meds for that!\u00a0\u00a0Feel quite overwhelmed and falling apart.\u00a0\u00a0My question is this:\u00a0\u00a0I will be losing my medical insurance in a month and have applied for state help and even SSD but all the paperwork takes months.\u00a0\u00a0Are their dire consequences if I cannot take any meds?\u00a0\u00a0Am thinking of ditching them all and taking supplements instead, like CQ100 and others.\u00a0\u00a0Do any members here have such problems with health insurance coverage?\u00a0\u00a0And what about pending heart valve surgery?\u00a0\u00a0Do I delay that too?",
