            "answer": "Hi Jennie and Welcome to the Pain Management Forum.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry to hear about your breast pain. I know how much pain that can be and how frightening it can be.Please know that you are always welcome here but you may want to post this same question in our Woman 's Health Forum.If you have breast density do you have Fibro-Cystic Breasts? It's a condition usually seen in younger women but not always. Caffeine products can greatly aggravate the pain. Often by avoiding caffeine you can control the pain. I know this because I have the condition and have had it for many years. In the past the pain has become to extreme that I could not lay on the effected side/breast... or if I rolled onto it during the night it would wake me.Physician's tell me that once you reach menopause the symptoms of Fibro-cystic breasts should greatly decrease. I have found that this is not true in all cases.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously I don't know if you have this condition but please bring it up to your physician for discussion. There is a lot of information on the internet.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to search and see if your symptoms fit.I hope this has been helpful. Good luck to you and please let us know what you discover.Peace,~Tuck",
