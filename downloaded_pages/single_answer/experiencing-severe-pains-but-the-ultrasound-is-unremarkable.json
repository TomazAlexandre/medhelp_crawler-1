            "answer": "Hi!Unexplained aches and pains coming on and off could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In women it can be due to hormonal disturbances related to PCOD/menopause and in men it can be due to low testosterone. Severe anemia, and parathyroid gland disorders can also be the cause. Autoimmune disorders, multiple sclerosis and peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme or lupus too should be investigated for. Since there was ankle swelling Crohn\u2019s and rheumatoid arthritis should be ruled out first. This needs a comprehensive investigation. Consult a doctor please. Take care!",
