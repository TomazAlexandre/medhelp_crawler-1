            "answer": "Hi,there is lots of online information available.I think the main thing will be to focus on eating healthy and very nutritious diet.\u00a0\u00a0They do recommend that women who are heavier try to maintain their weight rather than gain weight during pregnancy.The other thing is that you may be at high risk for gestational diabetes, so I'd think they should test for that early.I also think they should do a thyroid screen immediately.\u00a0\u00a0This should be TSH, FT3 and FT4.Hope all goes well for you.Best wishes",

    "question": "I just found out a week ago that I'm pregnant with my 4th child. I think that I'm still in shock, however, I'm looking now at the fact that I'm 39 and overweight (265lbs.) and starting to get concerned. I was overweight with my last pregnancy and other than sciatica, it was ok. The concern now is that it's almost 10 years later and I'm starting to have pains already. Would it be best for me to get all the extra tests for older women or am I being paranoid?",
