    "question": "I am 29 years old, and about 6 months ago I noticed that my armpits looked bruised. I shrugged it off, but it hasn't gone away. Over the past few weeks, I have noticed a yellow-ish discoloration extending down my sides. I haven't noticed any pain, tenderness, or swelling, but am concerned because it seems to be more than just armpit discoloration. Would love to know if I should MAKE a doctor's appointment about this, bring it up at the next appointment, or just shrug it off (again)? I have NO idea what other information might be relevant...I've had 2 kidney infections (both more than 5 years ago), I don't drink/smoke/etc., I have frequent headaches and take OTC meds to cope with those (but stay within the dosage guidelines), ummm...I had gestational diabetes with all three of my full-term pregnancies (also had 4 miscarriages) and diabetes runs in the family. Again, sorry if this is too much information...just don't know what might be relevant. Thank you!",
