    "question": "Dr. Lupo,ChitChatNine suggested that I contact your expert forum.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't know, you might know someone who does.\u00a0\u00a0Either way I thank you for your time and consideration.\u00a0\u00a0My question is a copy of a post I left in the thyroid community.Does anyone know anything about this?I am a biologist, not a physician.\u00a0\u00a0But, I am one of the Grave's patients that has periodically experienced weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Both my primary physician and my endo told me no one knows the cause, it just happens to a few folk.\u00a0\u00a0But, it kept niggling away at me.\u00a0\u00a0I mean all the symptoms and physical problems caused by the disease, and by whichever medication you're taking, AND I GET TO BE FAT ON TOP OF IT ALL?\u00a0\u00a0NOT FAIR.\u00a0\u00a0 I thought back to my year of anat and phys, looked in my old textbooks, and the only trigger I could find that tells the body to store carbs as fat was insulin.\u00a0\u00a0So, I had my doctors add a measurement of insulin to my standard blood work.\u00a0\u00a0Turned out that when I was in a phase of Grave's that characterized by fairly excessive and rapid weight gain, my insulin was always elevated.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure that is what caused the excessive fatigue that I also experienced at these times; my body was pulling a lot of my molecular energy out of circulation and socking it away for a rainy day.\u00a0\u00a0My insulin levels are fine at all other times.\u00a0\u00a0I no longer have access to university data bases, so my resources are limited.\u00a0\u00a0But, I haven't been able to find any research on this correlation online, and my endo didn't know anything about work in this area.\u00a0\u00a0He was a little amazed that the correlation was there, and there every time, and that I thought of having him look for it in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0But, I didn't know any better, and the simplest explanation is often right.\u00a0\u00a0If any one in the community, physician or researcher or sufferer has any information on this subject, please post it.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks a million,Coley",
