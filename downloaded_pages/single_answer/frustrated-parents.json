            "answer": "Hi Pacecar,Your child is having recurrent abdominal pain. In most of the cases, it is just functional and you dont find any cause. But functional pain does not cause weight loss. But since your child is having weight loss, it cant be a functional pain.The problems you have mentioned are quite diverse. So I am not able to give any direct answer for this.But still you can consider -1. Inflammatory bowel disease2. Celiac disease3. Infectious causeDiscuss with your gastro regarding these.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The information provided is for patients\u2019 education only and is not a medical advice.

    "question": "My\u00a0\u00a08 yoS as been having mod. to sev. pain located at the periumbilical area.\u00a0\u00a01st mention of the pain appros. 1 yr ago.\u00a0\u00a0At T-giving it became worse.\u00a0\u00a0We've seen a Ped. Gastro, had endoscopy w/biopsies, contrast. CT, Ultrasound, Xrays and bloodwork.\u00a0\u00a0 Nothing showed up except C-diff and some minor swelling of his messiatic lymphnodes.\u00a0\u00a0 We were put on Nexium (am), Zantac (pm), Bentyl, and Anilan.\u00a0\u00a0We've had a HIDA Scan that showed 0% function of the g'bladder but no pain during test.\u00a0\u00a0Ped. Surgeon didn't think it was G-bladder because Bentyl can give false posit.\u00a0\u00a0Finally they gave us Demerol to control pain but we are not crazy about cont' use of this.\u00a0\u00a0Dr said possible food allergy.Past few days pain has slowed to only after meals & every night when\u00a0\u00a0he lays down.\u00a0\u00a0 The pain is intense & last approx 1 - 4 hours after onset. Other things that might be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0 Our son has alway had some Gastro probs since birth.\u00a0\u00a0He had refulx at an early age & outgrew it, always been easy to constipate. He has a bi-cuspid aorta - never caused a problem & only noticed as a murmur or if he is very sick or taking lots of meds he will get the blueing around the lips.\u00a0\u00a0 We have seen this blueing lately. In August we began taking Strattera for ADHD and he's adj. well.\u00a0\u00a0We consid. the Strattera as a culprit but the pain began before taking it. Few symptoms we've seen over the past year that we passed off as nothing & now started re-thinking them.\u00a0\u00a0 Headaches, joint pain w/knees & ankles.\u00a0\u00a0Numbness & tingling in the feet & legs.\u00a0\u00a0 Pain between the shoulders.\u00a0\u00a0 Always seems to\u00a0\u00a0be thirsty & seems to get hungry really quickly after eating.\u00a0\u00a0 We asked to check. for diabetes & our primary dr said that has always been w/in normal range.\u00a0\u00a0 He doesn't have a very good appetite & he has lost about 3 lbs since T-giving.So ANY insite would be wonderful.There are prob. other things we could test for but we just don't know what to ask.\u00a0\u00a0 Txs So much!",
