            "answer": "Many preschool-age children (particularly boys) do not like to be interrupted when engaged in an interesting activity, so when the bladder calls, they try to ignore it until sometimes an accident happens.\u00a0\u00a0It is best to not make toileting a power struggle, so limit prompting to one or two times and use unemotional, nonthreatening tone of voice.\u00a0\u00a0If accident occurs, have child clean himself up in firm, but nonemotional way, like, \"Oops, looks like you had an accident.\u00a0\u00a0You'll need to wash yourself off and change your clothes.\u00a0\u00a0Here, I'll get you the wipes and a change of clothes.\u00a0\u00a0Now, clean yourself up.\"\u00a0\u00a0If you're consistent and patient, this too shall pass.",

    "question": "Our four year old son is a sweet, mild mannered young boy who potty trained easily as soon as he turned three.\u00a0\u00a0He has a lot of energy, and ends up drinking a lot of water during the day while he is running around.\u00a0\u00a0As a result of this (and also the fact that he probably has a small bladder), he needs to urinate about every hour.\u00a0\u00a0However, he hates to stop whatever it is that he is doing (playing) in order to take a potty break.\u00a0\u00a0He'll dance around and hop from one foot to the other for 15-20 minutes, and then it's a mad dash to the potty to relieve himself.All of this is a bit annoying, but fine.\u00a0\u00a0However, for about the past six months he has started to act out aggressively when he needs to use the potty.\u00a0\u00a0Throwing toys, throwing tantrums, yelling....he is obviously uncomfortable, but is still unwilling to run to the potty until forced to do so.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I have tried everything.... begging, using rewards... nothing has worked!\u00a0\u00a0We have had him tested for bladder problems (no infection, diabetes, pain with urination), and have repeatedly asked him why he is so resistant about going to the bathroom (he doesn't know).This is becoming a problem at preschool.\u00a0\u00a0We feel that he is being labeled as a \"problem child\" because of the behavior that he exhibits when he needs to use the potty.\u00a0\u00a0After he uses the potty, he is back to being his sweet, loving self -- so we know that this is the root of all of his problems.\u00a0\u00a0Please help!\u00a0\u00a0Is there any way that we can help him to learn to respond to his need to go to the bathroom as soon as he feels the need to go???",
