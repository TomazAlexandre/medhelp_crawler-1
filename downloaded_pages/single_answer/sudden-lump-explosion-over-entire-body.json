            "answer": "Hello,These sudden lumps all over the body should be examined and any benign skin growths like lipomas ruled out. You should get it checked by a dermatologist and get a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cyrtology) done. FNAC is aspiration of the material of the glands which is done by a fine gauge needle (22 or 25 gauge) and a syringe.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing",
