    "question": "Hi everyone (I posted this on the diabetes forum as well)I have been having horrible daily headaches, nausea, and extreme muscle pain for about 3 months. In preparation for a abdomen/ pelvic CT scan with contrast, I had to have a Creatinine blood test done. I was informed that I could not get the IV contrast because my Creatinine was high at 1.5mg (Normal for female is 1.0mg). My fasting blood glucose was also high at 169 (normal is 70-99). I had these tests done a few months ago and both were normal. Do you think diabetes is causing this? I have not been officially diagnosed. I also get sweats, hypoglycemic episodes, nausea, muscle cramps, etc. I am a 28 year old female with low blood pressue and am 5'6'' 127lbs. What could be causing this? Please help. I am also contstantly tired. I slept from 4pm yesterday to 6am this morning and am still drowsy.ThanksRhonda",
