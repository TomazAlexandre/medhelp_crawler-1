            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you have a lump on the pinna of the ear then you need to get this investigated. It could be causing sensory nerve damage or pressure on nerves and hence numbness. Lump on era cab ne infection, exzema, dermatitis or even cancer. Ear numbness can also be due to pinched cervical spinal nerves, TMJ, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, ear infection, cold and in Bell\u2019s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia where a spasm may cause numbness, or due to acoustic neuroma which is a benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve. It can also be atypical migraine. Please consult a neurologist, skin specialist (if need be) and an ENT specialist as it is difficult to diagnose on net.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
