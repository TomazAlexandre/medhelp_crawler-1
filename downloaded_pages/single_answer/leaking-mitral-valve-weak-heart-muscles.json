            "answer": "My mom has Emphysema, CHF, MVP..\u00a0\u00a0She had an angiogram performed that determined that she had to have surgery if she wanted to survive.\u00a0\u00a0Her mitral valve wasn't leaking per se; it wasn't working properly.\u00a0\u00a0They thought they would have to replace it with a mechanical, but instead were able to repair it.\u00a0\u00a0The thing your mom needs to consider is the Mitral Valve can affect many things.\u00a0\u00a0With the restrictive lung disease, breathing is difficult, but combined with the mitral valve leaking, I'm amazed she gets any oxygen at all.\u00a0\u00a0After my moms' surgery, it was very shakey in the beginning - she had double pneumonia (which the drs. missed) when they performed the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0So, her's is not your standard touch-and-go case.\u00a0\u00a0She had remained on oxygen for about 2 1/2 mo. until her lungs could get accustomed to working again - again, she had double pneumonia & pleuracy.\u00a0\u00a0Evenstill, she is MUCH better now.\u00a0\u00a0It's the first time in years that she's been able to walk more than 1/2 block without collapsing for air.\u00a0\u00a0Sugery was 11/06 and she feels and looks 100% better for it.\u00a0\u00a0Her Oxygen sats were in the 70s (w/out oxygen) prior to surgery; they stay around 94-97 now (w/out oxygen).\u00a0\u00a0It may be a blessing for your mom, but, she really needs to be comfortable with whatever decision she makes.\u00a0\u00a0If her MV has to be replaced, she'll likely have to be placed on Coumadin for the rest of her life.\u00a0\u00a0If that's the case, read up on it!\u00a0\u00a0There are alot of serious things that ppl don't realize w/ Coumadin - do's & dont's.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck; hope this helped a little.",

    "question": "My mom has a number of different health problems, including: Diabetes, Congestive Heart Failure, Restrictive Lung Disease, she has had 4 heart attacks and has just found out the mitral valve is leaking (I don't know the severity)and her heart muscles are very weak. She has suffered the symptoms of trouble breathing, feeling weak, fatigue, and many others.I am worried about what will happen next. I need to know what kind of options there are with all of the other problems that she has. Is a surgery to risky for her based on everything that is going on with her? If she were to have the surgery, what problems could arise out of it? Are there other options that can help her other than surgery? She says she is constantly in pain because of everything going on and I am looking for a way to help, even if it is only by having information she may not have.Thank you in advance for your response.",
