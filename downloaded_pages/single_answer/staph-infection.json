            "answer": "Hi there,Diabetes mellitus, recurrent infections, worm infestations and hyperactive thyroid gland are few common causes of significant weight loss. It is best that you control the various infections you have been suffering from. Eat lots of fruits, dark green leafy vegetables, fruits and consume less of potato, sweetened and processed foods. Drink lots of water every day. Drinking water helps you feel full and also flushes out fluid from your kidneys, which may reduce bloating. Get a diet chart made from a nutritionist. If you are still unable to gain weight then it is best to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope it helps.Good luck and take care!",
