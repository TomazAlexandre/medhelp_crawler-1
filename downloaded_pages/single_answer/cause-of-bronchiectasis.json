            "answer": "Hi!It is difficult to predict when exactly bronchiectasis started. The symptoms in the beginning are almost unrecognizable. They progress with recurrent or persisting infection or COPD. Hence, you may be feeling the symptoms more now.Also, since you have recurrent lung infection, it is important to find out whether you have diabetes and low immunoglobulins. Both can make you susceptible to recurrent infection. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hello,I am 24 year old active female. In 2010 I was diagnosed with bronchial asthma (after two weeks of having severe bronchitis) and just a month ago, after 2 pneumonias I had this year, doctor sent to a CAT scan. It turned out I have bronchiectasis (right middle lobe, 5 segemt). Until May 2012 I felt perfectly fine: I had never had pneumonia, didn't cough and so on. Then in May 2012 I started coughing in the evenings \u2013 green mucus, and my cough progressed... I started feeling very unwell, especially in the evenings, lost energy, I felt like i had fever everyday. Spirometry, Xray scan showed nothing \u2013 my lungs was fine, antibiothics didn't help... I decided to find another doctor (in December 2012), I had bronchoscopy that only showed mild inflammation of my bronches, no bronchiectasis, they also found haemophilius influenzae bacteria, so I tooks amoxiclav, but it didn't help though the bacteria was sensitive to that medication... In January 2013 I had very severe pneumonia, I was hospitalized for 10 days. But the pain never really went. The caugh didn't stop, just my mucus had lighter coulour... Then in the end of June 2013 I had pneumonia again. I had a CAT scan then. Is that possible that my bronchiectasis developed only in 2012, because doctors didn't recognize I had HI bacteria and didn't treated it? Is that possible that bronchiectasis was \"silent\" for 2 years and only a year ago it started \"showing up\"? Thank you.",
