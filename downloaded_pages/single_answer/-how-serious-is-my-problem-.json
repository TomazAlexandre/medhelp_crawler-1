            "answer": "Hi!Usually the multiple T2 FLAIR hyperintensities on MRI are suggestive of widened perivascular spaces, brain aging, migraine, vasculitis, ischaemic or hypoxic-ischaemic changes, haemorrhagic foci, inflammatory changes, multiple sclerosis, central pontine and extrapontine myelinolysis, cancer metastases, radio-and chemotherapy related changes, neurometabolic diseases, and CNS degenerative diseases. Since there are hypointense lesions as well hemorrhages and gliosis should also be ruled out.In your case these changes may be age related or due to hypertension/diabetes or other metabolic disorders. Headaches and migraines can also present similar pictures.This needs to be correlated clinically in discussion with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I recently got MRI done because I was having bad headaches, memory losses and dizziness. The MRI findings are as follow:Brain: No acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. There ismild patchy and a couple of punctate foci of periventricular anddeep white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. There is a punctatefocus of GRE hypointensity in the right occipital lobe. No othersignificant signal abnormality. There are a couple of enlargedperivascular spaces in the bilateral basal ganglia. Nosignificant mass effect or midline shift. No extra-axialfluid-collections.\u00a0\u00a0The ventricles, sulci, and basal cisterns arewithin normal limitsWhat does these all mean?",
