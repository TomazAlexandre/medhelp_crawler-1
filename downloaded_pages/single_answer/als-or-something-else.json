            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. It is difficult to diagnose this on net, but perhaps the following conditions should be looked into: fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, spinal nerve compression high up in the cervical spine, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D or B12, electrolyte disturbance, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or Lyme\u2019s or lupus.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hello, I am a 20 year old male. Recently I've been experiencing some very strange symptomsFor the past 3 weeks I've been experiencing some of the following symptoms, some are persistent and others come and go. I've currently experienced the following the last several days:Nerve pain and tingling all over bodyDeep chest pain/shortness of breath/feels like pain in lungsScratchy throatDry tongue/mouthPelvic/groin/prostate painHeavy fatigue (Getting gradually better than I was a few days ago.)Body achesBlurred visionNo appetiteDiarrhea.The last doctor I've seen only said that I may have some type of unspecified 'Viral Infection'. And all blood and urine tests have came out normal, I've also had a CT scan of my head and chest which were also normal.I've also been diagnosed with hypochondria/anxiety by the ER SEVERAL times because they couldn't find anything extraordinarily wrong, they are swearing to me that it is anxiety and I'm not dying. I'm not believing that though. Could this all be anxiety related for absolutely no reason at all? Could this be HIV or some other autoimmune disease?I really feel like I'm being misdiagnosed here, has anyone experienced something similar? Could anyone give me suggestions as to what I should do? Please help! Serious replies only please!",
