            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are allergic to oils, then you should try oil from a different source than the one you are using\u2014like mustard, coconut, olive, almond etc. Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of hair loss. Iron deficiency can be due to poor intake or poor absorption or due to hidden loss from bleeding as is seen in UTI and gut problems like IBS.Hair loss can also be due to dandruff, dermatitis, shampoos, soaps, dust and dirt etc. Thyroid disorders and diabetes too could be a cause. Insomnia, stress and anxiety along with poor diet and excess of caffeine too can be the cause.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
