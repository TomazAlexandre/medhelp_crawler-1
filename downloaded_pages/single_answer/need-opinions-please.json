            "answer": "Hi, your symptoms of dizziness, and lightheadedness, if they are relieved by eating something, indicate that you might be having episodes of hypoglycemia. Inadequate sleep can also cause tiredness, fatigue and dizziness. Diabetes Mellitus and Hypothyroidism could cause the symptoms described by you. A simple blood test could help detect diabetes and hypothyroidism. Consult your primary care physician for these tests. Regards.",

    "question": "Hi, so I have been ill since December 2013 and I feel like I am getting worse, I first started of with a bad throat, I had globus pharyngis and a feeling like I could not breath. Over the last few months these symptom are still present. I also developed stomach pains. I am extremely tired, weak and dizzy constantly and is interfering with everyday life and my study's. I have an head pressure most of the time and eye strain at the back of my eyes. Also about an hour ago prior to me writing this I was sat at my computer feeling extremely tired to the point that I was daydreaming in a trance, I laid on my bed, literally all the muscles in my body ache and have a warm burning sensation which Is discomforting, my muscles feel all tensed up! I tried to rest and close me eyes and I developed a sort of shakiness. What could this be? So far through my campaign to solve this horrible life mystery of mine, I have had an endoscopy which was more or less normal, it's I said duodenitis, the entrogasteroligist\u00a0\u00a0said I needed to be checked for Wilson disease which came back negative, he also referred me for an ultrasound of my liver\u00a0\u00a0which I am currently waiting for as the amylase levels have been abnormal for the last 3/4 months. All standard blood tests have been done and fine apart from the amylase, I had a h.pylori test which was negative, allergy test that came back that i am allergic to dust mites and pollen which I already knew without the test. X ray of chest clear., the question is, could this be Evan related to the abdomen, what could it be? Any ideas, are there any rare things it could be? What other tests could I have?",
