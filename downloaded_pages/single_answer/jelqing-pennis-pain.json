            "answer": "Hello,From your symptoms it does not look like any medical cause. Jelqing may often cause injury to the penis or nerve compression which may cause such symptoms and hence is not advocated. If you are having normal erection while lying down and less erection, then also it does not seem to e related to any medical problem. It can be due to stress and anxiety, unrealistic sexual expectations ,negative feelings about non performance, smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and very rarely medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions and poor circulation. Do not take undue stress, stop jelqing and eat a healthy nutritious diet. If the symptoms persist then I would suggest you to get it evaluated from your urologist.Hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
