However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Tongue sensory changes can be due to many different causes. For example, and to name a few, it may be caused by trauma (from teeth, dentures, etc), systemic disease/illness (e.g., iron, B12, zinc deficiency, diabetes, thyroid disease, connective tissue disorder), or it can be psychogenic.If it doesn't improve, I would suggest you discuss it with your primary care physician.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
