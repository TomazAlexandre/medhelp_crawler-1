    "question": "I am 61 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I have type II diabetes which is under control with 500 mg of metformin daily.\u00a0\u00a0I have an astigmatism and wear bifocals.\u00a0\u00a0My current glasses seem to be working fine, but they are falling apart, so it is time for me to replace them.\u00a0\u00a0And it's also time for me to have another exam with my eyes dilated.\u00a0\u00a0I have found that optometrists for some reason seem to do a better job of prescribing glasses that work for me.\u00a0\u00a0I know that they too can do a dilated eye exam.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if there is any reason it would be preferable to see an opthamologist rather than an optometrist for my eye exam.Thanks so much.",
