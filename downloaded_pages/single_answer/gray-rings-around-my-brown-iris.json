            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This could be a ciliary flush as seen in conditions like glaucoma, corneal inflammation, iridocyclitis or inflammation around the iris. It can also be due to stagnation of blood flow as seen in peripheral artery disease, common in people with high blood pressure and diabetes. Please consult an eye specialist regarding this.
