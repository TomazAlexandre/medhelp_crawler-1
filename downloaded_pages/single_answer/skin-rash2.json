            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.This could be due to the cosmetic products you are using. Avoid using any such products.Fungal infections are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",
