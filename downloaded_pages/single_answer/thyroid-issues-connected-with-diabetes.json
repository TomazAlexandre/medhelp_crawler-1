    "question": "My last round of thyroid bloodwork showed that I was hypoglycemic. I had eaten 2 hours prior to giving the blood and my glucose was very low.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I've been having so many other issues and when I look up the symptoms they all point to diabetes. Can you have diabetes and hypoglocemia at the same time?\u00a0\u00a0And could this all be related to the thyroid cancer?",
