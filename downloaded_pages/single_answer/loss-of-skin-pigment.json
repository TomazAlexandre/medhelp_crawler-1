    "question": "My son was diagnosed with Type 1. diabetes when he was 10 years old. He is now 13 and I have noticed small areas on his neck that are very pale...Didn't see until he went swimming and was exposed to the sun. I have also noticed that his eyelashes ( both eyes ) are completely white over a small area. Almost looks like he had lint in his eyelashes until I looked very closely. Does this sound like vitiligo ? He has an appointment with his endocrinologist but perhaps he needs to see a dermatologist instead. Any information would be appreciated very much !",
