    "question": "Hi, I've had a dry throat right at the back behind my tongue, kind of on the roof of my gum and around the adams apple part. My voice has been fine but it seems that when I wake up and after strenuous exercise it is at its worst in that i almost (although never actually have gagged) but whilst i'm outside or throughout the day when I'm out of the house I am absolutely fine. I don't know if it is an allergy or something more serious, I visited the nurse about it at my institution and she said it looked inflamed like maybe a throat infection. I am a healthy weight and fit and do not have any history of diabetes in the family so I am unsure what I should do or what you people think it is, It seems to be better than from a few days ago ?",
