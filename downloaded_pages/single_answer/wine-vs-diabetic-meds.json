    "question": "I was diagnosed as being \"borderline diabetic\".\u00a0\u00a0My endocrinologist has put me on the following medications: Metformin, Ramipril, and Simvastatin.\u00a0\u00a0I am also on some medications for cholesterol (my bad cholesterol is under control, my good cholesterol (HDL) is too low) and my cardiologist is trying to get the HDL numbers up.\u00a0\u00a0My cardiologist tells me it's okay to have a glass of wine each day with my evening meal while on cholesterol meds, however, I keep forgetting to ask my Endocrinologist if it's okay to drink a glass of wine with the diabetic medication.\u00a0\u00a0Is it okay?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!~Heinzl",
