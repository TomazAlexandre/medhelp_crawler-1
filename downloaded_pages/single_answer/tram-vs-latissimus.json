            "answer": "I'm 4'10\" and slightly overwieght also (still trying to get off the last 15 pounds of baby weight).\u00a0\u00a0I had a TRAM (as you've seen from previous threads).Benefit of tram versus Latissimus is the tummy tuck.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know anything about the latissimus other than they use the muscle from the back of the shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0One thing to consider, even though the tram is quite painful (but you do get over it), all of your incisions are on one side (ie the front) of the body versus one on the front and back...although then again, they may do the lat flap where they only cut once.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry don't know much about the technical part of that surgery.Things to consider.... what do you do for employment, do you have young kids, how soon do you want to be up and about, how do you think each of the surgeries will impact your life .... and other than that....what area do you want fixed?\u00a0\u00a0I like having had the \"tummy tuck\" part of the reconstruction because I had that extra post-pregnancy skin and fat hanging out the front.\u00a0\u00a0Go ahead, laugh.... some things just have to be said.:)Oh, and what is the specialty of your plastic surgeon.\u00a0\u00a0My doc did TRAM pretty much exclusively and was very good doing that.\u00a0\u00a0Hence, he does not offer things like DIEP.\u00a0\u00a0It's just what he does and does well.\u00a0\u00a0Are you a candidate for DIEP?\u00a0\u00a0I've heard, but don't know first hand that this type of \"tram\" takes only the skin, fat, and connective tissue, but not the muscle from the abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0It's a much easier surgery than tram, but I don't know whether or not it has a higher failure rate or if there are any other negatives than tram.Best of luck, I hope whatever surgery you end up having that it goes very well for you!",

    "question": "I am trying to decide between TRAM vs Latissimus reconstruction.\u00a0\u00a0Both Plastic Surgeons I have seen say I am a candidate for both, but both recommend Latissimus.\u00a0\u00a0But I could never really tell why...other than it is easier recovery.\u00a0\u00a0I don't smoke, drink or have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am petite in height (under 5 feet), but average to mild overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I am early 40's and do light to modereate exercise on a regular basis.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?",
