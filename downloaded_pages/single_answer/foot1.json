            "answer": "Hi!Foot vibrations can be due to generally due to peripheral neuropathies or vascular pathologies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. Nerve conduction studies should be done. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into. There are many other causes of nerve disorder causing including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Back strain, spondylotic changes in lumbar vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Multiple sclerosis is another possibility.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
