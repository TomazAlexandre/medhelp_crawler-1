    "question": "I have had HCV for 35 years. Three years ago I had an ultrasound followed by a liver biopsy and then unsuccessful rebavarin/interferin treatment for seven months. Yesterday I underwent a second ultrasound and biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0A Gallstone was clearly evident in the most recent ultrasound where-as there was no indication of one three years ago. I enjoy a healthy, low fat diet, exercise regularly and as far as I know do not suffer from Diabetes. I read here that rebavarin is possibly related to Gallstones. Would you please explain than or provide a link where I can get further info ? Thanks.",
