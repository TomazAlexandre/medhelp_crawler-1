    "question": "I've had localized pain in various spots on my leg for the past few months. They can be sharp, burning, aching. I had an aching pain on my outer left thigh earlier today. When I pressed on the area, the aching got worse and seemed to slowly pulse. Could this be some type of nerve pain. I have very small bulging disc between L4-L5 and L5-S1 that supposedly aren't pressing on any nerves. Or does this sound more like a blood clot? That was my initial concern when the pain began. However, I had an ultrasound of my leg done that came back fine. But the tech ran the wand along my inner leg. Would that show veins on my outer leg?",
