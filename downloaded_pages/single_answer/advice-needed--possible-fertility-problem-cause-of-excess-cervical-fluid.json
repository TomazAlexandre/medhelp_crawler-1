            "answer": "Hello,The increased discharge could be due to physiological reasons like rise of hormone level (oestrogen) which is seen- during puberty, menstrual cycle, sexual excitement, pregnancy etc. It could be also seen in poor personal hygiene, non-infective cervical lesions, uterine prolapse, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, use of contraceptive pills, onset of vaginal infection or sexually transmitted disease etc. You should consult a gynecologist for internal examination and investigation to know the exact cause of it.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "hi, im 23 years old and have been having this issue for over 7 months. i have a HUGE excess of creamy cervical fluid, which mostly comes out while having a bowel movement.by excess i mean approx 2 whole tablespoons will drop out and actually SINK to the bottom of the toilet.It is white, creamy, and exactly like a picture i saw which described it as \"infertile creamy cervical mucus\"It is while, has no smell,and reminds me of sorbolene cream in both look and texture.i am schedules for an investigation under anasthesia to see if the docs can figure out whats going on,,, as all tests for stds, bacteria, pap smear, cervical biopsy, ultrasound,allergies, diabetes etc have been negative repeatedly.I did howeer, recently have a 2 month long battle with candida GLABRATA. but swabs are now showing negative.I am awaiting new hormone panel results, a previous one i had showed estrogen was on the low side, but i had just recently come off the pill to see if that helped, and as far as im aware, low oestrogen should in fact cause the opposite effect of being dry. also tried mirena which did not help.previous history, irregular periods on the pill (never seemed to bleed at right times, no control), i am a smoker, and on antidepressants and have been for many years, have had two 6 month courses of roaacutane between 18 and 23yrs, had cervical leep procedure 2010 due to precancerous changes of cervix, never been pregnant, dont exercise, diet could be better but am not overweight.any ideas regarding possible fertility/hormonal issues would be greatly appreciated.i have attached the picture i was speaking off....just imagine that amount 10 fold..please help..getting very very desperate.",
