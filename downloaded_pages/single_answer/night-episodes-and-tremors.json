    "question": "My husband was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease 6 months ago. We have been put on Synemet and were also on Amantadine. He also is on 3 medicines for High Blood pressure as well as cholesterol medicine along with Celexa and Abilify for depression. He also takes potassium and baclofen for the dystonia from the parkinsons. He has had an episode during the night since last September. He wakes up chomping his teeth and then breaks out in an awful sweat and also has amnesia for about 2 hours afterwards. We thought it was the Amantadine but we have discontinued that the past week. We had another episode last night. All of these episodes take place at night. He had an EEG done and it did show some abnormality but it was medicine related. His tremors have never gotten under control since his diagnosis. I guess we are at our wits end as to what to do next. We are asking if you have any ideas to what we could maybe bring up to the doctor as far as changes. We are just really frustrated.",
