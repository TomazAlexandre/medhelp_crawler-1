I have seen them in their 1000sLevels of TPO Ab's can also be found in\u00a0\u00a0women with no thyroid problems.TPO Abs will rise if you've had vaccines or are being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as eating gluten when you have gluten sensitivity.TPO Antibodies\u00a0\u00a0may occur in organ-specific autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia, Addison's disease, type I diabetes mellitus , polyglandular endocrine failure syndromes etc.Pernicious anemia, addison's disease, diabetes mellitusSj\u00f6gren syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and pernicious anemia are sometimes positive for TPOAb.Therefore levels are the dominating factor for autoimmune/antibodies.",
