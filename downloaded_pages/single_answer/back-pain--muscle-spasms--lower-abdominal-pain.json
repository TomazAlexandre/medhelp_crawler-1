            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for writing.How are you?Without examination,confirming a diagnosis is tough but the various possibilities for your symptoms are injury or overuse of muscles, ligaments leading to strain or sprain,pressure on the nerve roots in the spinal cord , ankolysing spondylitis(arthritis of spine),fibromyalgia , polymyositis and polymyalgia rheumatica(an inflammatory disorder that causes widespread muscle aching and stiffness, primarily in your neck, shoulders, upper arms, thighs and hips).Muscle spasms may be due to alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low calcium, sodium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism,peripheral vascular disease,nerve compression, and multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury.I sincerely advise you to consult a neurologist/orthopedician because confirmatory diagnosis can only be made only after a detailed examination and CT/MRI spine and other investigations.Hope this helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
