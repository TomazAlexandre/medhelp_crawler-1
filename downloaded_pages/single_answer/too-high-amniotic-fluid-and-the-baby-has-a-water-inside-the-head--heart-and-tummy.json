            "answer": "Hi!Generally polyhydroamnios or increased amniotic fluid is due to diabetes in mother causing high glucose in fetal blood and thus more fetal urine formation and more amniotic fluid. It can also be due to maternal heart or kidney condition. Down syndrome and Edward syndrome in fetus too can cause this. It can also be due to fetal-fetal transfusion syndrome in twin pregnancy where the twins share a single placenta\u2014find out if this is the cause. Dietary salt restriction and maternal blood glucose checking should be done first. Then other tests to rule out the other mentioned conditions need to be done. Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please discuss these possibilities with your friend\u2019s gynecologist once. Hope this helps. Take care!",
