            "answer": "Hello,Feeling of pins and needles can be due to paresthesia skin and cervical spondolysis can be responsible for such symptoms. Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.These can also be due to the side effect of the medicine but are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a physician.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
