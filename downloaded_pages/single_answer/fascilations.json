    "question": "I just turned 40 years old/male and for the past 3 months I have had fascilations all over my body but primarily in my legs/feet. About this same time, I had a globus (lump in throat) sensation however I have not had any problems swallowing.\u00a0\u00a0I went to an ENT who scoped my throat and diagnosed my with Layrpharngeal Reflux Disease (LRPD) which I am taking meds for however I still have the globus sensation.The fascilations have caused me\u00a0\u00a0a tremendous amount of anxiety due to fears of ALS. I have not noticed any weakness or atrophy. The fascilations seem to go away when I move but quickly return upon rest. Some days are better than others. I have been to numerous web sites and will be seeing my doctor again soon. I am also a type 1 diabetic. I recently learned about BFS which seems to match my symptoms more than ALS but I am still scared. I have heard that in ALS fascilations take place only after noticed weakness? Do you think my symptoms are that of BFS and do you think that I should have an EMG?",
