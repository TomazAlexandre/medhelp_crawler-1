            "answer": "Hello,This feeling of pin ***** sensations that your friend is having are called Paresthesia. Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.Is he a diabetic or does he take alcohol?Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get his blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated.He can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing paraesthesias are rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",
