    "question": "The Question is what can cause me to go from vision that is fine to needing glasses in 2 weeks, here are the particulars I have been going to different doctors for the last 6 months with no diagnosis. Started with fluid in the ears=antibiotics, bouts of extreme fatigue, then during these days vision would be blurry, then months of sinus problems, have been tested for every kind of anemia, HIV, Mono, complete Hepatitus panel A,B, and C, Sickle cell, urinalysis, CAT Scan and several other tests. then about 2 weeks ago I woke up with a pulsing headache on the right side of my forehead right around the hairline, very location specific, no pain between pulses which are about 4-5 seconds apart,and blurred vision, thats when I had the CAT scan, no problems found. Persisted for about a week, still have it. I went to the Doc, no problems found or considered other than stress, sent to eye doc, he said, vision loss, dry eyes, astygmatism, and drastic reduced ability to focus. his answer was I probably always had eye problems but compensated with focus ability and now its gone. I am suspect that there is something else going on, have Been to GI and ENT nothing found, Vision also seems grainy like looking ata tv that you can still see snow beneath the picture, noticed more floaters than normal and sometimes microscopic dots that seems to swim around very fast. any help or directions would be greatly appreciated.",
