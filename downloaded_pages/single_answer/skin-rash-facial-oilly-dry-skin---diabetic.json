            "answer": "Hi there!You could use a cold cream commercially available in the market over the dry areas. Try taking plenty of water even when you are not thirsty. Control of diabetes is also essential since this could also be the cause of your symptoms. If things do not tend to improve with these measures, you may like to consult a primary care physician to look for secondary causes such as hormonal/ endocrine/ metabolic/ autoimmune issues.Hope this helps.Take care!",
