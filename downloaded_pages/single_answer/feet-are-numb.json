    "question": "About two months ago I was waking up with my hands asleep. They went away when I moved positions. One day a tight feeling lasted in both hands. A week later my feet (both) started to get numb on top and tingle. It came and went until a moth ago. Now my feet are always numb-ish and tingling. No pain though, bathroom is good, no sex issues.\u00a0\u00a0I had blood work done and all normal. B12 is around 250 (normal range), saw 2 neurologists, EMG said feet were numb, MRI and ct of brain which they said no MS, MRI of neck that showed herniated disc c4/5 and bulging disc in lumbar L3,4,5s1 (dr says they doubt that's it), foot doctor has no clue, no Lyme, no diabetes, no injuries. I'm 36, 5'11\", 269lbs. Please help!Report",
