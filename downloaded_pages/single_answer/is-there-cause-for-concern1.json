            "answer": "Dear Julie,Without evaluating your son, I cannot say exactly what is happening with him.\u00a0\u00a0However, chest pain and dizziness in a young child suggests that he should probably be seen by a pediatric cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0One of the things that may be happening is that he is having an arrhythmia, which can cause both chest discomfort as well as dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0Or, his dizziness may be that he isn't drinking enough fluid and the chest pain is benign chest wall pain, although this is less likely in a young child.\u00a0\u00a0There are other things that this could be as well, so a pediatric cardiology evaluation makes the most sense at this time.",
