    "question": "My sister is type 1, has had it since she was 10 (she is 28 now). She has recently broken out in hives that come and go sporadically, on her face, neck, back and arms. She experienced this 2 years ago for 6 months, and the doctor could not come up w/any reason. She was not allergic to anything. However she said that it 'could' maybe, be the diabetes, as she had seen patients with hives that had other autoimmune diseases. Has anyone here ever had hives, that are a diabetic?? any tips or info welcome, thank you.",
