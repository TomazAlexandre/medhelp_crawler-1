    "question": "I am having\u00a0\u00a0about a 1 inch (2.5 cm) size tumor just at the right side of my neck since about 4 or 5 years. I can easily feel it with my finger tips.It is one sixth inch high. Consulted with a general surgeon(FRCS)3-4 years back and he told its nothing serious. He did not advice any sort of pathologial investigation.At that time there was no complain with it (no pain etc). For the last 6 months it gives sudden burning sensation once or twice a day and last for a few minutes. Generally it does not pain but while given pressure with finger tips, a little pain is felt on the tumor as well as the nearest surrounding tissues.what is the problem and what should I do with it?I have no other body problems (no more tumor, no hypertension, no diabetes, no asthma.... I am non-alcohilic non-smoker 51 year's young man and look much younger than my age). I eat a lot of spicy Bangladeshi food, esp., beef, prawn, and rice/fried rice, and bread. Vegetables are rare in my menu. I cant make time to do exercise.....",
