            "answer": "Ann Marie,Psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety may co-exist with medical illnesses such as hypothyroidism. I am not aware of any literature that supports the development of depression in people whose mothers took amphetamines during pregnancy. I will defer to your physician/endocrinologist with regards to the development of hypothyroidism in children of pregnant mothers who take amphetamines.",

    "question": "Dear Dr.I am a 36 year old and have been on synthroid for 10 years for hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's). I also have a hystory of chronic depression/anxiety and have been on and off Paxil for. I eat healthy and exercise daily and maintain a healthy lifestyle.My\u00a0\u00a0mother has told me that she took methamphetamines so she wouldn't gain a lot a weight while pregnant with me (at the advice of her doctor) My question is: could the methamphetamines in any way have played a part of my hypothyroidism or depression? I have 4 other siblings who do not exhibit any of the problems I have, nor do they have diabetes (common in Hypothyroid families) and neither do my parents. Usually there is a pattern in the family with both of these conditions. Thank you for your response.Ann Marie",
