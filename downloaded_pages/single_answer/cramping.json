            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine your mother and obtain a detailed history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of her symptoms is or how to treat them. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Muscle cramps is a frequent symptom that many\u00a0\u00a0patients experience.\u00a0\u00a0Muscle cramps are painful, involuntary contractions of skeletal muscle.\u00a0\u00a0Nocturnal leg cramps is a condition that is frequently reported and can have multiple causes. They can be seen in patients with no clear underlying cause. Also they could be present in patients with deformities that predispose to leg cramps. Prolonged sitting, standing or inappropriate leg position can be associated with cramps. Sometimes it can be a familial problem and other family members experience the symptoms. Neurologic conditions can be associated with leg cramps. These conditions like Parkinson, muscular or nerve disorders, will present with leg cramps associated with other manifestations. Medications can also produce cramps. More commonly metabolic problems can be associated with cramps, and these metabolic problems include electrolyte abnormalities, diabetes, thyroid disorders, metabolic myopathies, alcoholism among others.\u00a0\u00a0Liver disease has been associated with a higher incidence of leg cramps as well.A variety of hypotheses have been generated to explain the cause of muscle cramping, yet none has been able to support a consistent\u00a0\u00a0mechanism. They occur frequently in individuals with cirrhosis, regardless of the cause of the cirrhosis, and are thought to be a symptom of cirrhotic-stage liver disease. The mechanism as I said, remains elusive; hence, a specific therapy has not been identified. Many therapeutic approaches have been offered, yet their efficacy, safety and mechanism of action remain poorly defined. There are medications that can be tried, but I think you should discuss this with her physician, in order to start a medication that do not interact with her other medications neither with her liver disease.As I said, without being able to obtain a detailed history, physical and neurologic exam, I cannot tell you what the cause of her symptoms is. I think she should discuss this symptom with her physician, and consider a treatment option appropriate for her.I hope this information is useful.",

    "question": "My mother has cirrhosis of the liver from drinking almost her whole life. She has diabetes and\u00a0\u00a0pancreastis. Lately she has been getting craps in her hands. Where her hand will just cramp up and close up. Then at night her legs get cramps also. My question is does the cirrhosis and the cramp fit together? What can she do to limit the cramping? Mind you she does take alot fo medications and vitamins because she has came very close to dieing.",
