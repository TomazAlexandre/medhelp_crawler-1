    "question": "If any of you are considering taking Metformin for weight loss, then you might be interested in a VERY undesirable side effect. No, not a medical symptom, but if you ever need to buy private health insurance, you will probably be denied coverage. This just happened to my wife today. She talked her doctor into prescribing Metformin to help her lose weight three months ago. Last month our Cobra coverage was expiring and we had to find health insurance. The application form asked what medications she was taking; the underwriters saw Metformin; and treated her like she had leprosy. Their response is that the only FDA approved use for this drug is treatment of diabetes, which is technically correct. Her doctor sent a letter stating that she did not have diabetes, but she was still rejected. She has applied to the state risk pool and if accepted will have to pay $70 per month higher premium for coverage that is 3 times higher deductible and 6 times more out of pocket than the normal coverage.",
