There's several illnesses that can cause sudden blindness\u00a0\u00a0(hyper tension, diabetes, feline herpes, to name a few) and it would help if you can point me in the right direction.I will say that cats adjust to blindness MUCH better than humans. If she seems otherwise healthy, it could be just an adjustment period. Let me know what happens, or get back to me with the info I asked about.Sorry your kitty is having troubles.",

    "question": "My 1 year old cat seemed find Wed Aug 6th. By the time I got home from work the next day she looked sick. She went 2 days without eating or drinking and slept all the time. I took her to the clinic on the 9th. She had a fever of 105 and was dehydrated. The vet gave her fluids and a shot of pennicillin. He also gave me antibiotics to give her twice a day and 2 cans of liquid food. It took her an entire week before she'd eat on her own. Now she eats any thing I give her and drinks milk and water and seems to have gained her weight back but something's horribly wrong. Her pupils are dialated all the time. I know she can see somewhat because she'll follow me when I walk. Whether it's only shadows or blurr she sees I don't know but she bumps into things or steps on her bowl etc so I know she can't see very well. And she doesn't always use her litter box either. Today she urinated on the kitchen floor and then sat on it as though she was unaware that she was sitting in wet. Some times she'll wonder around. I don't have the money to take her to a specialty clinic so I made her an appt at her regular clinic in 2 days. It's tearing me apart not knowing what's wrong and not being able to get her emergency help. What could possibly be causeing this problem with her eye sight and would it possibly be reversible?",
