            "answer": "Hi poppy121.You have enough conditions to\u00a0\u00a0be concerned with.And you definitely can do without the MS dx, whose suspicion is\u00a0\u00a0probably not warranted. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy symptoms and Spondilitis being a systemic disease- meaning it can affect the entire body- can indirectly affect the\u00a0\u00a0brain and your neurology. Do not view these conditions as\u00a0\u00a0just a metabolic/sugar issue and\u00a0\u00a0just a joint and bone issue, respectively.The imbalances that lead to many conditions and\u00a0\u00a0symptoms, not only perpetuate their presence, they\u00a0\u00a0may also lead to further worsening and new symptoms arising, in view of\u00a0\u00a0the effects of maintenance medications (and other factors) that do very little in CORRECTING imbalances, yet may be contributing to them.The problem is that the conventional system is designed this way and you will never be able to make any direct links due to gradual\u00a0\u00a0negative effects over a very long time.Keep active, eat religiously an anti-arthritic diabetic diet and look intonatural alternatives for inflammation.There are non-medical things you can do to improve.Let me know if you're interested in this and I'll offer you some suggestions.Note that this is not a substitute for medical advice.Best wishes.Niko",
