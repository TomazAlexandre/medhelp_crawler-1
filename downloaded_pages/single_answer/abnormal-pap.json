            "answer": "This is a great question and I'm sorry that this is worrying you. Endometrial cells are the cells lining your uterus, and these are generally noted on pap smears in women who are post-menopausal or over 40 years old in order to help identify those patients to be worked up for endometrial cancer.In your case, it sounds like you have not yet gone through menopause as you had recently completed your period at the time of the pap. The presence of normal endometrial cells on your pap smear likely indicates normal endometrial shedding. The decision to pursue an endometrial biopsy at this time should be a discussion with your physician and include considerations of any symptoms of abnormal bleeding or any additional risk factors you may have for endometrial cancer. Risk factors include obesity, type II diabetes, hormone replacement therapy, or a family history of breast/ovarian/uterine cancer.I encourage you to make an appointment with your doctor to discuss your personal risk factors and the risks and benefits of an endometrial biopsy prior to undergoing the procedure.",
