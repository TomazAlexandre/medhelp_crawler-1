            "answer": "Hi, I'm sorry we missed your questions yesterday; I hope you're still checking in to look for a response...If you have results for T4 and T3, please post them, along their reference ranges.\u00a0\u00a0If you have the lab report, those will be listed as either T3 and T4, Total T3 and Total T4 or Free T3 and Free T4.You said your diabetes number is 6.4 - is that the A1c result?\u00a0\u00a0If so, that's really bordering on diabetes and you need to get things under control immediately or you'll be classified as diabetic... please confirm that's the A1c result - it should say on your lab report.The lump on your jaw could be related to the broken molar, whether the tooth hurts or not.\u00a0\u00a0Why were you referred to an ENT?\u00a0\u00a0 It sounds like you need a dentist.You're probably going to need an endocrinologist, so if you need referrals, you might want to get one, as it can take anywhere from several weeks to several months to get in to see a good endo.As long as you have the appointment with the ENT next week, I'd keep it; my ENT has been one of my best thyroid advocates.",
