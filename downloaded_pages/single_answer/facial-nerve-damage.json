            "answer": "Hello,These symptoms can be due to nerve damage which can be checked by nerve conduction velocity tests. Even parasthesia should be ruled out. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then get it evaluated from a doctor.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Two years ago, I underwent a Lifestyle Lift facelift procedure, and I am still experiencing the same symptoms as I experienced shortly after the procedure: numbness in the areas where the incisions were made (under the chin, and above and in back of the ears. I also continue to experience the tingling sensations, periodic pin-prick-like feelings, and a pulling sensation whenever I raise my head or turn it to the left or right. There is a constant pressure in both ear areas.Is there any way that these symptoms can be relieved through surgery or drugs?Thank you,",
