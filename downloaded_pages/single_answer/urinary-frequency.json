            "answer": "Hi,Have you been assessed by a physician before?You have mentioned that tests have suggested prostatitis and testicular involvement. What were these tests and when were they taken?Increase in urinary frequency may suggest an underlying urinary tract infection, a prostatitis, urinary incontinence and other underlying disease conditions like diabetes. However, you mentioned that your blood sugar levels were considered normal.Was a urine culture and urinalysis done? Were cultures of prostatic secretion done?If there is persistence of the urinary frequency despite normal laboratory results, your physician may opt to visualize the structures. An abdominal CT scan may be able to help. A repeat urinalysis may also be able to rule out the presence of\u00a0\u00a0a new onset UTI.Keep us posted with regards to your progress. Discuss also with your physician Interstitial Cystitis (IC).This may be a differential at this point. However, let us take this one step at a time. Interstitial cystitis is usually given as a diagnosis when other underlying conditions have been ruled out.",

    "question": "hi,Please I need help. for a very long time now, I have been having urinary problems. I have been urinating frequently/ mostly at nights. Sometime up to 10 times at night. I also do have pains in the lower back. I have gone to some tests here, nothing have been found. No high blood sugar. But I feel dont take high carbonhydrate food because it seems to aid the problem. Some tests sugest prostatists, siminitis, testictitis, but further tests reversed that. However, I am only 32.What do I do?Eze",
