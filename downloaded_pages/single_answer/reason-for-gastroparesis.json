    "question": "3 days after my routine colonoscopy, I felt horrible.\u00a0\u00a0Everything I ate made me sick to my stomach.\u00a0\u00a0I never felt anything like that before.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor's office told me to eat lots of yogurt to replenish the bacteria that was stripped during the prep. for the procedure.\u00a0\u00a0These symtoms lasted about two months and finally went away.\u00a0\u00a0Almost a year went by and I had a really bad stomach virus.\u00a0\u00a0After that stomach virus was over, I started to feel the same way I did right after my colonoscopy.\u00a0\u00a0To make a long story short, I ended up seeing a GI doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I had a bunch of tests, one of which was a gastric emptying scan.\u00a0\u00a0The scan confirmed that I had gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, \"could the colonoscopy have caused this?\"\u00a0\u00a0I know the vagus nerve runs through your body.\u00a0\u00a0Could that have been damaged during the procedure?I have had the gastroparesis since last summer and have lost about 30 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I am living in the doctor's office.\u00a0\u00a0Last month I had another endoscopy and had my piloric muscle dilated and injected with botox, which didn't do a thing.\u00a0\u00a0Any other suggestions?Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions.",
