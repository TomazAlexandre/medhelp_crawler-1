    "question": "I have a pea sized patch on my right middle finger. The skin when wet is spongy and much thicker than the surrounding skin. If it were just a callous it wouldn't be a problem. It reaches all the way down into the dermis and will crack and sometimes bleed. It follows the exact pattern of the finger print. Imagine a thick shag rug next to a berber carpet. It pushes normal fingerprint grain out of the way. I have tried pulling a strip of it off (yes it hurts) and it is well attached. It isn't oozing, ulcerated, red or painful for the most part. If I press on it hard It hurts a little more than normal. I don't feel any material in my finger. It's just a weird chunk of fingertip that growing thicker than normalI think I may have jabbed a drywall screw in that location and I wasn't able to keep it clean due to my job. I have been tested for diabetes and liver function recently and I'm fine. I take verapamil, hctz and lisinopril.As I said before each line in the fingerprint is a split in the skin that goes down into the dermis. When the skin is dry it appears to be a normal callous with a wider grain. It seems like it is forgot how dense to grow. The skin is more water permeable than the surrounding area. It has been like this for 5 months with little change.",
