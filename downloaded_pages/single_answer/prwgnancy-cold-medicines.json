            "answer": "Dear Esmeeralda:If you are pregnant, it is best to avoid any medications unless the benefits outweighs the risks for you and your baby.Being 31 weeks pregnant:1. If you have fever and pain, you can take acetaminophen (Tylenol or generic versions). Please follow the direction accurately. If you take more than the recommended daily dose, you can cause harm to you and your baby.Avoid aspirin, ibuprofen and any other NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) until after delivery of the baby and approved by your provider and OBGYN.2. For \"worst cough ever\", I'd refer you to your primary care provider since we may need to rule out bacterial infection.For dry cough, you can try cough drops but they may contain high amount of sugars. Not sure if you have gestational diabetes or not. Drinking honey and lemon warm water can also help sooth the throat irritation.For wet cough, you can use guaifenesin (Mucinex), an expectorant to help you thin the mucus so it's easier to cough up. Make sure you drink plenty of water, at least 6 - 8 glasses (8 oz) per day for it to work well.Please note: guaifenesin is assigned in the Pregnancy Category C by the FDA. There are no controlled data in human pregnancy. Guaifenesin is only recommend for use during pregnancy when benefit outweighs risk.Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant in the Pregnancy Category C. It is usually found in combination with other products, such as guaifenesin in Robitussin DM and others. Please consult your OBGYN if there are other options for your cough.Most importantly, when one is not feeling well and pregnant or not, is for you to get plenty of rest and sleep. Eating healthy is also important to get better, especially if you are eating for two.Take care!For more information on how to manage cold and cough during pregnancy, please go to:1.
