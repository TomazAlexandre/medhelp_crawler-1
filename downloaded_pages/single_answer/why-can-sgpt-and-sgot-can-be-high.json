            "answer": "There are many causes for elevated liver enzymes. Almost any medication can cause an elevation of liver enzymes. ALT=SGPT and AST=SGOT. Alcohol can also raise liver enzymes, although typically the AST is greater than the ALT. Heredita hemochromatosis (HHC) is a common genetic disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Screening should begin with a serum iron and total iron binding capacity (TIBC).\u00a0\u00a0An iron saturation of greater than 45 percent and serum ferritin concentration of greater than 300 ng/mL in women supports the diagnosis of HHC. Hepatic steatosis and an associated condition, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may present solely with mild elevations of the serum aminotransferases, which are usually less than fourfold elevated. NASH is a condition more common in women and associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Ebstein Barr virus (EBV) can cause hepatitis and thus increase liver enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0Tests for this virus includes antibody testing from the blood.\u00a0\u00a0A liver biopsy would be the definitive test to find the exact cause of the elevated liver enzymes, however this should be discussed with your personal physician.Take care,Bob :)",

    "question": "Hi,I had recently done a full check up and found my SGPT to be 82.20 U/L (where as the normal should be 0.01 to 41.0 U/L) and my SGOT was 44.40 U/L (where as the normal should be 0.01 to 38.0 U/L). I had consulted a hepatologist here. He suggested I do a Fibroscan which revealed that my liver stiffness is 4.3 Kpa. I have been tested negative for any hepatitis viruses but he then suggested I should do an ultrasonography of my liver. I had done the test again day before yesterday and found my SGPT to be 141 U/L which is strange as I had nothing that could cause this.Could there be any other reason for this to happen?JRC",
