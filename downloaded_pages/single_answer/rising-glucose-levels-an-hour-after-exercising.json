    "question": "My father has Type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagonosed as pre-diabetic a year ago and while I've tested under 100 for two doctor visits, and am not longer considered pre-diabetic, in monitoring myself, I find lately I'm over 100 a couple times a week.\u00a0\u00a0My diet is excellent--I'm very careful..\u00a0\u00a0Two things.\u00a0\u00a0This morning I woke up with a 110 reading and wonder if the D-Mannnose and Cranberry tablets I'm taking for urinary tract discomfort has affected that reading. Secondly, when I returned from an intensive 2-hour hike an hour ago my reading was 102.\u00a0\u00a0Now it's 116. ( I ate a high fiber cereal and cherries for breakfast before the hike.)\u00a0\u00a0Shouldn't my levels be heading lower an hour after this hike--not higher?Cinney",
