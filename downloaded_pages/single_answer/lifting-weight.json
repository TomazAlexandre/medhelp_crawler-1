    "question": "I am 34 and this is my 5th pregnancy but 4th child, first was miscarraige. I am a cashier in a liquor store and lift heavy boxes all the time and am on my feet 8 hours a day the floors are concrete. I had gestational diabetes with last pregnancy and havent taken test yet for this one (only 9 weeks along) could there be risks with lifting? My high risks are graves disease, prior miscarriage, and most likely gestational diabetes and maybe my age since i am 34. Could it be harmful lifting all those boxes and also being on my feet on concrete floors 40 hours per week",
