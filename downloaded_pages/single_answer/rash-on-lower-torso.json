    "question": "Ok, so I get a red rash sort of looking thing whenever I take a shower. Even when I am still in the shower, my stomach area gets really red and I break out with bumps all across the lower torso. They look kind of like bug bites or something, however they are not. I went to my doctor and she said that it was just a problem with using too hot or too cold of water temperature. That is not the case, because I have tested to see if different water temperatures change the rash, but it does not make any difference. I do not take any medication so I do not know what could be causing the rash. Also it goes away after about an hour after the shower. The red disappears and so do almost all of the bumps. So if someone could please help me figure out what I am having a reaction to, it would be much appreciated.Thank You.",
