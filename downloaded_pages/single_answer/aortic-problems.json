            "answer": "Hi!The normal aortic valve has 3 cusps or is tricuspid. Calcification is the commonest ageing process that can cause stenosis of the aortic valve. Presence of diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, uremia and hyperlipoproteinemia (high levels of lipoprotein cholesterol) can result in earlier calcification of these valves. Treatment is usually through valvuloplasty or through valve replacement. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!",
