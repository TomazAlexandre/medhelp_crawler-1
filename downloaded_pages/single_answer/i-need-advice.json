    "question": "I have a ct calcium score of 2.I am a 46yr female I weigh 275lbs. I was trying to get a surgery clearance for bariatric surgery , because I have uncontrolled diabetes, I also have high blood pressure that is well controlled with meds. My kidneys are leaking some protein.my Dr said I need an angiogram and possible stent.I was shocked and refused, because I had a bad reaction to the contrast dye. So I acquired the test results Apparently I also had angiography. Before the test I took the 50 mg of metotopol 2hr prior to my appt.They could not get an IV in me for 2hrs. They tried for a deep vein but finally went with a superficial one. The dye gave me the worst headache and I started to swell but I was so sore and bruised that was my main focus. The results were compromised because my heart rate was 84. I was shocked to learn that I have a 90%blockage in the left coronary artery and 50 to 70% stenosis in my right.WHY would my dr not reveal this to me at my appt? Now I am scared, I have been on online for days seeking and info about how to treat this.I read change in diet and exercise help. I also saw that niacin, vit.c and a few others can flush your arteries. Is this true? A angiogram scares the hell of me! I have a bad feeling in my gut about it that is hard to ignore.I was taking prescribed fish oil but dr refused to give me anymore. I am confused, tired and scared please HELP any info would be very much appreciated....Thank you",
