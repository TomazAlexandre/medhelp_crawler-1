Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.I would recommend you follow up at an academic medical center. Many of your symptoms may ultimately be related to your hepatitis C treatment and the consequences of the treatment \u2013 which could have eventually caused some of your other symptoms (but not all).Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "Back in 94 I was diagnosed with chronic Heptatis C.\u00a0\u00a0They said I had had it for more that twenty years I was about 39 at the time.\u00a0\u00a0I had two turns of alpha A interferon and that took care of it pretty much.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet their were some passengers--Sjogens Syn.,Hashimotos Syn., Cryoglobulinemia. Perhaps more that I don't remember.\u00a0\u00a0This year I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea.\u00a0\u00a0I had double jaw surgery.\u00a0\u00a0The surgeon said I have Ischemia.\u00a0\u00a0Now between 1997 I was put on Betasaron for MS.\u00a0\u00a0I have Myelin on the Hypocampus of my Brain and it interfers with me making short term memories.\u00a0\u00a0Last year, I saw a hand surgeon,\u00a0\u00a0he said I had\u00a0\u00a0carpal tunnel. on my left hand.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0visited a foot doctor and he said I had nerve irritations in my toes.\u00a0\u00a0My endocrinologist said that I have metabolic disorder (pre diabetes)\u00a0\u00a0I think is the Cryoglobulinemia.\u00a0\u00a0What kind of doctor, where would I find one who would be looking for the single problem rather than dissecting me.\u00a0\u00a0I live in S. New Jersey and usually go to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.\u00a0\u00a0But they do not seem to have anyone interested.",
