Diabetes can also cause burning sensation in skin, skin diseases like eczema and psoriaisis, drug reactions to some medications that you might be taking, over exposure to sun and allergic reactions to the cosmetics chemicals are a few possibilities. Consult a physician for evaluation and appropriate management. Wishing you all the best.",
