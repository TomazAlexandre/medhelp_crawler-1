            "answer": "The answer to your questions is maybe.\u00a0\u00a0Nodules in the thyroid can be associated with both hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) and hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).\u00a0\u00a0From the symptoms you described it sounds like you might be hypo but I can't be sure (generally when you are hyper it's easy to lose weight).\u00a0\u00a0If you are already underactive then removing the one side of your thyroid may or may not affect your hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0In some people who have part of their thyroid removed the other half that remains steps up to the plate & is able to make enough hormone to compensate.\u00a0\u00a0In others, they need to go on synthroid to replace the hormone that's not being made.\u00a0\u00a0If you are already hypo it may be due to an autoimmune disease like Hashimoto's (your immune system is overactive & attacks your body and in this case the thyroid) so the level of thyroid hormone in your body could be related to the disease and not necessarily the nodule itself.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't have an endocrinologist I would suggest getting one and making sure that they are very knowledgable about thyroids - many endos focus mainly on diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0What your levels will do and what treatment you will need afterwards will depend on whether you are hypo or hyper and what the remaining part of your thyroid does in terms of thyroid hormone production.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps you some.Rayne",
