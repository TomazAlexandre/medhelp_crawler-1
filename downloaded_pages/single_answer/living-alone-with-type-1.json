            "answer": "You might want to do research on CGMS, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems which do have alarms as well as show trends ahead of time. Since you have been managing diabetes so long, you might also have lost some of your sensitivity to lows, which happens if you have frequent episodes. This makes the occurance of a severe low more likely. You can actually regain your sensitivity by going for a period of time without lows. The way to do that is to watch your numbers closely and treat even marginal lows promptly. If you have tight enough control you can keep yourself at the high end of normal for awhile which helps you avoid lows as well. Also be careful not to overtreat lows because then you end up on a yo-yo which makes it worse. Testing frequently, of course, and not stacking your bolus doses is a way to anticipate and prevent lows before they happen. Many long term Type 1's also report greatly improved control when they go on the pump.",
