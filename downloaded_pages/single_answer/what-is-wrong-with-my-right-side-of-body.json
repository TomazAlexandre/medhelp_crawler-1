            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Since you have had this problem for a long time, I am sure you must have got it investigated. Multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, aneurysm in the brain, demyelinating nerve disorders, Lyme\u2019s disease etc have to be looked into. MRI of brain and upper cervical cord is definitely required. You may also need to test for hypothyroidism and diabetes. I am not sure what MYLEAS stands for.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
