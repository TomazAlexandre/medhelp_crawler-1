            "answer": "As it so happens i have an amputation stemming from a car accident caused by diabetes, i had lost my ability to feel low blood sugars and was acting with lights on but nobody home. i had checked my blood sugar before starting my car which i don't remember and it was down to 34. After the third operation to put the leg back together i got an infection and they thried to stop it with antibiotics and soon it came down to amputate or it would kill me.But there is very little time involved with getting an infection and having it progress to the point where an amputation in necessary. But from what i've seen with most other diabetics with amputations they aren't as initially as severe as mine and usually start with maybe losing a toe or even a foor instead of a below the knee amputation like me.But any exercising that should be done to prepare for it is the routine exercises recommended to all diabetics, Walking or jogging. But i can see where there isn't usually much time between getting an infection and having get severe enough to require amputation, another reason to always monitor your feet looking for changes. i recently started to develop blisters on the bottom of my foot and immediately went in to my doctor for advice and since my shoes are custom made to fit my foot they ordered another pair of shoes and i'm still being checked by my doctor and my wife every night to make sure the new shoes are doing what they are supposed to. That is diabetics can't let even little things get out of hand. good luck, bret",

    "question": "I have three related questions dealing with amputations stemming from diabetic complications.What is the amount of time a patient has between knowing that an amputation is absolutely necessary and the actual surgery date?If there is a significant waiting period, what is the mobility of the patient awaiting the amputation?Would there be any benefit in proactively training/preparing, before undergoing the surgery, to expedite/assist in the rehabilitation process.ThanksChris",
