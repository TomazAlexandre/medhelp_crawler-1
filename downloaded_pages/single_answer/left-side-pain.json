            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum.You could be suffering from gout, which also results in joint pains and swelling. This is due to high uric acid in the body that gets accumulated in the joints. \u201cGout usually attacks the big toe (approximately 75 percent of first attacks); however, it also can affect other joints such as the ankle, heel, instep, knee, wrist, elbow, fingers, and spine.\u201d\u201cClinically, gout can be hard to distinguish from several other conditions, including chondrocalcinosis. Chondrocalcinosis is a very similar disease, caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate rather than uric acid.\u201d Refer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoutIt could also be due to rheumatoid arthritis. If you are a diabetic or have a family history of diabetes, this should be checked as diabetes can cause stiff joints. . Tendonitis or bursitis of the joint too produces similar symptoms. In the shoulder joint an injury to rotator cuff to can be the culprit. If you have had a fall or accident or injury in the recent past, then this injury is the reason for. Vitamin D deficiency should also be looked into.I have enumerated the possibilities that come to my mind right now. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm a 19 year old woman, and I've been having joint pain for a few days now, maybe 3 or 4. It's mainly on my left side. It seems to be migrating, in that sometimes my fingers/hand/wrist will hurt and then my shoulder will. Sometimes I've noticed small, very brief pain in my left foot/leg too. It's not unmanageable pain, just discomfort. I really can't tell if it is made worse by daily activity, but it does seem to come more often at the end of the day. It's never really constant pain either. I also woke up this morning with both my shoulders sore, although my left one seems worse. What could this be? I know it's kind of vague, but it's a little hard to describe. thanks.",
