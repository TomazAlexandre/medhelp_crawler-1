            "answer": "Without being able to review your entire history it will not be possible to give you an exact answer, but generally speaking the probability of a chest pain to be related to the heart depends on the characteristics of the pain and the risks factors of the patient (age, gender, smoking, cocaine use, family history of heart attack at young age), diabetes or high blood sugar, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Medicine is not an exact science so is very hard to give absolute answers, but if you are young (especially female), and has no risk factors, the probability of your pain to be related to an obstruction of the heart's arteries (that could cause a heart attack) is very low. There are other possible explanations for chest pain, like spasms of the esophagus or pain from the chest wall as an example.Good luck",
