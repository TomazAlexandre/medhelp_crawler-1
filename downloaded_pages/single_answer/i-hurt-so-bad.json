            "answer": "Hi!Unexplained aches and pains coming on and off could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In women it can be due to hormonal disturbances related to PCOD/menopause.Considering your age\u2014menopause or premenopause should be investigated for. Since your abdomen swells Crohn\u2019s and H pylori should be ruled out. Since you have diabetes and pain worsens when this flares up, you could be having diabetic neuropathy. This needs a comprehensive investigation. Consult a doctor please. Take care!",
