    "question": "Hi, I am 21 years old and my husband and I are talking about trying to have a baby in the near future. Over the last 2 years or so my normal doctor and my obgyn have talked about the possibility of my having PCOS. Last month I was officially diagnosed. That day I was put on Metformin. I take that twice a die, even though I am not diabetic yet, she explained to me that I am very likely to become a diabetic soon due to my strong family history on both my mother's and father's side. I started weight watchers a few days after my visit and have been exercising regularly. As most women with this condition I have EXTREMELY irregular periods. I always have. I typically never have cramping and if I do it is nothing that I can tolerate. This morning I woke up with excessively heavy bleeding and severe cramps. I called my OBGYN where I was informed their office is closed on Fridays and so I called my General doctor to see what I should do.\u00a0\u00a0They asked me to come in where I then went through a series of test to make sure I wasn't having a miscarriage and to cheap my hemoglobin levels. All of that checked out fine and then I was then put on Norethindrone. This is supposed to stop the bleeding or at least make it normal. With all of this being said, I want to know more information about PCOS. There is no family history of this in my family and I don't know anyone else with it. I ask questions when I am at the doctors office but they don't seem to know much about it either. What are some ways to reduce the side effects. I have hormone imbalance, excess hair growth, difficulty with weight loss along with most of the other common symptoms. I don't have any cysts which at first caused me to believe that I didn't actually have the disease. From what I have read and learned you don't have to have cysts to have the disease so the name can be misleading, is this correct? I am basically just looking for any information that you have to offer.",
