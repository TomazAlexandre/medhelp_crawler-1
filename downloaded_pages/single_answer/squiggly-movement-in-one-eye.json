    "question": "I'm 62, wear glasses for farsightedness and astigmatism, have diabetes and hypertension. I get movement in my vision that lasts for a couple seconds right after I blink, it's not floaters or white spots, but just a small spot of squiggly movement that I can still see through. It recently started and it's only in my right eye. I don't always see and/or notice it but it continues to happen. Does anyone know what this might be, or has anyone else experienced this? Thank you in advance for your helpful comments.",
