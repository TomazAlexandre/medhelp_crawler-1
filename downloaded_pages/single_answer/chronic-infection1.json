            "answer": "You may suffer from pharyngitis at the most, as Beta-hemolytic sterptococci sometimes may cause the disease. The possibility of you having a chronic infection is not proven by any of the tests, so you do not need to worry. The micro-organism which was found might have found its way to your tonsil via aerial transmission or any other possible way as you may know it from the course of microbiology.What I would recommend is that you start taking Vitamins, start physical exercise and observe yourself. If you will feel excessive fatigue, hyperthermia or any other unusual symptom then you need to contact your doctor urgently and corresponding treatment will be given. However in the case which you have described it is highly uncommon.Best wishes, John.",

    "question": "so, i recently had a \"pimple\" on my leg that i popped and it blew up into a full-lown cellullitis. very painful and huge, had to be drained and packed. took 10 days to heal. was initially given IV Rocefin for 3 days, then Augmentin for 14 days. since then a couple of things have come up that have we concerned of a possible chronic infection.it's now about a month since that happened.first, some old pimples that had dried out and scarred suddenly have come alive again. no pain, just a small induration and red. is this normal for a spot that previously looked like it was healed?also, im a college student and in my microbiology course we did a tonsil swab and plated it on blood agar. after it incubated my sample showed beta-hemolytic cocci. my professor mentioned off-cuff that it should be checked out, since most of us don't carry beta-hemolytic cocci in our bodies. is this true?my doctor ordered a fasting glucose test after my cellulitis infection, suggesting im might have early stage diabetes, preventing my body from healing infections. it came back OK, but he suggested being tested once a year. all my blood cell counts were normal too. im male, 34, 195lb, and 5'9\". BP and HR were all normal.i guess my question is about whether i might be harboring a chronic infection, and if that should be of concern. is there any treatment necessary for this?thanks for any help...",
