            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Gastroparesis is defined by delayed emptying of a standard test meal. The most common etiology of gastroparesis is diabetes. However, there are others such as post-surgery, ischemia, obstruction, or idiopathic. Regarding obstructive gastroparesis, it can be from a mass, chronic inflammation (such as from chronic peptic ulcer), etc.Nortriptyline and other similar meds are typically used to treat symptoms associated with gastroparesis. A common side effect is constipation.I suggest that you follow up with a gastroenterologist. You may benefit from having a formal gastric emptying study.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "In 2003 I suffered injury to two of the nerves on the left side of my pelvis during a pelvic surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on 125mg Nortriptyline qhs for 9 years which enables me to sit at work until ~ 2:30 with tolerable burning pain.\u00a0\u00a0I recently had an upper endoscopy as I have had GERD for ~15 years.\u00a0\u00a0Food from 21 hours earlier was still in my stomach and I was diagnosed with gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0I have had sinus tachycardia which I regarded as simply a side-effect of the Nortriptyline since 2003.\u00a0\u00a0I have been doing alot of research regarding gastroparesis which led me to research autonomic neuropathy and am wondering if the Nortriptyline has caused damage to my vagus nerve and possibly other nerves which control autonomic function.\u00a0\u00a0I am NOT diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0My other maladies, i.e. asthma and osteoarthritis do not appear to be related.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid that if I do not wean off of the Nortriptline I will ultimately suffer damage to my heart, the rest of my GI tract, autonomic control of my bladder, liver, kidneys...but have tried Gabapentin in the past and could not tolerate it at high enough doses to control the pelvic pain.",
