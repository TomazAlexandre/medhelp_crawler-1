            "answer": "Hello,A clinical examination is important to confirm the exact cause of your problem. Penile nerve damage symptoms may differ from man to man. Few most common symptoms experienced by men are pain, burning, tingling, numbness, loss of sensitivity etc. The treatment to repair damaged penis nerves depends on the cause of damage. If you are obese reduce weight. Control cardiovascular disease and diabetes if present. Taking Omega-3 and 6 may be helpful for healthy nerve function .Consult a doctor for more queries and assistance. Keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",
