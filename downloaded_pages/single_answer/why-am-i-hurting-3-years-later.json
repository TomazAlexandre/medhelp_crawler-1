            "answer": "Hello.Did you have a head injury also? I am concerned about the slow speech. The lumbar and cervical disc bulging should not hamper your speech.The other symptoms can be explained on the basis of the bulging of the discs. The protrusion may have increased and ma be pressing upon the nerve roots. The muscle spasm makes it even more difficult for you to move.Was an MRI of the brain done? Do you get any headaches? Can you also mention if you have any other illnesses such as hypertension or diabetes?Regards",
