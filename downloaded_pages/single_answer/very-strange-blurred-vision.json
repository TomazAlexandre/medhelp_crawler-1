    "question": "Noticed vision was off so got new glasses. New glasses didnt seem to help so I went to multiple opthamologists. They cant seem to find anything wrong with the eye itself. They did mention very early signs of cateracs and possible diabetes and blood pressure issues. Symptoms are blurred vision in one eye. When it first started, it seemed to fluctuate (blurry for a few minutes then clear up). It has gotten progerssively worse. Now Right eye is blurry all the time except at very close range 1 foot. Also sometimes I can look at words or numbers on the telvision and they may appear clear to some degree but only for a moment and not all the time. I did have a double retina tear in the same eye but the problem started before the tear. I seem to have double vision on certain things like letters or numbers but usually not images, and not all the time. Had an MRI that came back ok. Also had extensive blood work for artery blockages that were negative too. Blood pressure was running around 150 over 95 and is being treated now. Diabetes is negative right now. Tried bifocals and another prescription change with zero results. Any suggestions for next steps?Thanks!",
