You're certainly not as high as I was when I was diagnosed (17 mmol/L when tested at home, I never did find out the results of my fasting test.)If it turns out that you are Diabetic/pre-Diabetic, it's okay.\u00a0\u00a0You've caught it really early and chances are good that you'll be able to do something about it - either meds or diet and exercise can help.How did your glucose test go?",

    "question": "I recently had my blood tested and my glucose level came back at 171 mg/dL.\u00a0\u00a0I had eaten half a hamburger and a few fries 2 hours prior to the blood test, and I'm wondering how much of an effect this food would have had on my glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0I'm getting a fasting glucose test tomorrow, but I'm kind of stressed out that I might have diabetes or pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any ideas of just how abnormal my glucose level is?Thanks...",
