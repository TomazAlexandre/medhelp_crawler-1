            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include infections affecting the neuro-muscular system, micronutrient deficiencies, vasculitis, high/ low blood pressure, respiratory system/ GI related causes, inflammation, neuropathies, myopathies, low blood sugar, heavy metal poisoning etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an internist initially and depending on the cause(s) diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist(s) care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
