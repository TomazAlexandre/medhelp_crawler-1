            "answer": "Hi LMilten, I think this trackerhttp://www.medhelp.org/land/diabetes-trackershould help you with following your carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0Rather than focus on the number of carbohydrates (and limit yourself too much in the process), it's worth considering to just make some smaller, reasonable changes that will be easier to sustain in the longer run. Good luck to you!",

    "question": "I don't know if this question should be posted here, but I couldn't find any place else to ask this:I am tracking my food (just started) and my weight and my diabetes. I can't find the actual chart that show how many carbs I have eaten (I mean the chart like the blood glucose and weight chart where you see the graph.) Maybe there isn't one for carbohydrates?Also, I am trying to stay under 40 carbs in a day. I have lost weight on Adkins many times in my life. I am on another round. I am almost the heaviest I have ever been. I have moved my addictions from drinking and smoking to eating. Hopefully I am on the right track, again!",
