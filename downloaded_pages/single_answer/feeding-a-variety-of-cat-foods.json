    "question": "Will feeding a variety (brands and flavors) of high-quality cat food be harmful for my cat, eg leading to development of colitis? There is no evidence of diarrhea or lack of appetite from any of the food I have been feeding my cat, but I have been told by someone (who was told by their vet) that is is unhealthy to feed a variety and cats should be fed only one type of food due to sensitive digestive systems. I was under the impression that if the cat has not developed an allergy to a particular type of protein, variety will give a more balanced diet.Can you advise which is the truth, if it is that simple?",
