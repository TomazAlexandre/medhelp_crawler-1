    "question": "A few days ago my 4-yr-old son began feeling a sense of urgency to pee again after just having peed.\u00a0\u00a0It happens a few times a day, and overnight.\u00a0\u00a0He'll go potty, then he goes right back within a few minutes, then back again a few minutes after that.\u00a0\u00a0When he goes back, he says nothing else comes out... but he still feels like something needs to come out.\u00a0\u00a0He also says that his underpants feel wet and cold like he wet them, but when we feel them they are totally dry.\u00a0\u00a0What might give him that cold sensation?\u00a0\u00a0He is uncircumcised and recently we were given a steroid cream to apply to the opening of his foreskin because it was beginning to close so much that the opening was becoming very tiny.\u00a0\u00a0Could the steroid cream cause the cold feeling (he has the feeling even when it's nowhere near the time we applied the cream)?\u00a0\u00a0And could the frequent feeling of needing to pee be Voiding Dysfunction?\u00a0\u00a0He definitely holds his pee for way too long during the day because he doesn't want to stop playing to do it, and we read that can cause some problems with the muscles and create Voiding Dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0My big fear is something like Diabetes... but he has lots of energy, his weight hasn't changed at all nor his appetite or thirst, and otherwise seems to feel great.\u00a0\u00a0What can this be??",
