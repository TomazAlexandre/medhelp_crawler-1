            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. Bed wetting that starts in adulthood should be evaluated as it could be the only sign of some serious causes like neurological diseases, diabetes, UTI, urinary tract stones, prostrate enlargement, bladder cancer, obstructive sleep apnea etc.Alcohol consumption cannot be directly related to bed wetting, but severe alcoholism leads to neuropathy, so this could also be a cause. Emotional disturbances and anxiety can also cause bed wetting.Consult a specialist for further assistance.Best.",

    "question": "I started drinking everyday when I was 17, I am now 22. For the past 2 years I have been wetting the bed almost every night. It is very frustrating, for obvious reasons. I have no insurance so seeing a doctor would be very expensive. Is my drinking the cause, or have I caused permanent damage to my bladder?",
