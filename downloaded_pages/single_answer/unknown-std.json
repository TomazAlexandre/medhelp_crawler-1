            "answer": "Hi,Itching is usually associated with allergy.Since both you and your wife are experiencing the same thing it could be due to a common cause.It could be dust-mites or any change in bedlinen-anything new?For itching you could try OTC anti-histamines.Apart from this if burning sensation is more then it could be peripheral neuritis-it is the inflammation of outlying nerves. It affects nerves and muscles in the arms and legs.Itis usually a \"pins and needles\" type pain. This condition can occur at any age, but is most common in men between ages 30 and 50.Causes of peripheral neuritis include:* alcoholism,* long term chemical poisoning,* infectious diseases,* gout,* chronic diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, lupus,* B-12 deficiency, and* poor nutrition.You cpould take VitBcomplex supplements and see if your condition improves.If you still believe it is due to STD/AIDS you will have to keep taking tests to confirm your suspicion.",

    "question": "I have been having itching and burning sensation all over my body especially my legs. This started about nine years ago. I was sure then that I had caught HIV from a\u00a0\u00a0one night encounter with a girl. I have done numerous HIV test since then and they all have been negative. I still however think it is sexually transmitted as the two persons I have had sex with since then is having basically the same symtoms. Is there some new virus or sexually transmitted desease that no docter knows about. When the temperature gets high it is even more unbearable. It affects my wife worst at night as her skin itches her and prevent her from sleeping. The girl that I suspect I caught this thing from also have the same symtomsThis discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/242382\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/242382</a>.",
