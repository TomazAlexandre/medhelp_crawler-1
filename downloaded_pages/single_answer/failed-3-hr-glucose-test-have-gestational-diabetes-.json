            "answer": "I did with my daughter (now 6). I had no risk factors, no history in the family, I'm not overweight... It just happened. I was disappointed too and felt like I had done something wrong. During pregnancy it's amazing to know your body is doing all these miraculous things for you and your baby, so its devastating when the opposite happens and it doesn't work properly. You should be able to manage by sticking to the doctor's food plan, and if not, they will help you with medication. By monitoring yourself so often, you will know exactly what's going on with your blood sugar all the time. You were diagnosed early, so you can manage this, I promise!! Good luck! :-)",

    "question": "I am so bummed out. I really am. They made me take the test early at 15 weeks because both of my parents have diabetes. I literally had my annual physical weeks before I conceived and confirmed for another year in a row that I was not diabetic prior to conceiving. But i failed 3 out of the four tests. So now I have to be on a strict diet regiment (I already ate healthy I just have to spread out my meals more and eat often, smaller meals) and I have to test my blood 4 times a day. I'm happy it was found so early so hopefully with these changes my baby won't be huge and I can continue on to have the vaginal birth I want. However I'm just upset. I know it's nothing I did wrong and it's my body struggling to produce enough insulin for me, my increased blood flow, the baby, and the placenta. I am going to do what it takes for a healthy baby but I've been just upset since I found out last night. Have any of you had GD before in prior pregnancies?",
