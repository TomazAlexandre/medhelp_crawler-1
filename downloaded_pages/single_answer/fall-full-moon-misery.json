    "question": "45 y/o w/f.\u00a0\u00a0Starting about 3 yrs. ago, I began having trouble breathing in the fall months.\u00a0\u00a0I blamed it on fall allergies at first and, at first, had some success in treating it with OTC meds (Clor-Trimeton, 30mg. Sudafed, Advil).\u00a0\u00a0Now here's what's tricky about this.\u00a0\u00a0It ONLY happens in the fall and primarily during the week leading up to the full moon.\u00a0\u00a0It is worse (much worse) when rain/storm events move in.Symptoms: night sweats, racing/erratic pulse, dyspnea upon standing or bending over (not necessarily aggravated by further exertion), a smothering feeling when I life in one position for too long and a dull diffuse discomfort (like a balloon in my right side where my gallbladder used to be).when I rise from a seated position, I seem to have lymph congestion and retain fluid.I'm overweight, don't smoke, don't drink, family history: PCOS (self), hypertension & sarcoidosis (father), MS (brother), diabetes (paternal grandma), atrial fib (father, p. grandmother, p. grandfather).I feel fine otherwise and I'm one of those people who is rarely ever sick or complains about health issues, but this is driving me NUTS!\u00a0\u00a0During this one week a month during Sept., Oct., Nov. and early Dec. I feel like I'm going to die and then it just goes away until the next year!\u00a0\u00a0I don't go to doctors because of bad past experiences and NO HELP, so I'm hoping someone might have experienced similar and can share anything they might have found out.",
