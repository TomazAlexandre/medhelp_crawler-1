You both need to talk more about your experience with the abortion. It's possible that he's got some unresolved negative feelings about it--and you may too. Once you clear the air and accept that you did the best under the circumstances, you both will be able to move on. If not, he'll definitely benefit from talking to a counselor. Good luck. Dr. J",

    "question": "Hi Dr.,Me and my boyfriend are both 21 and have been dating for a little over a year. We're very serious and and in love and have always had a great sex life.Well, a few months ago I had an abortion and it was the most devastating thing we have been through together because we both wanted to keep the baby but knew that now wasn't the time. The first time we had sex afterwards he couldn't keep his erection and we never had that problem before. Ever since it has been an issue, either he can't keep the erection or he can't last longer than 2 minutes. I made it a point to never put pressure on him or let him know that it was an issue because I knew that would only make it worse. We openly talk about it with each other and he insists there's nothing in the back of his mind that has been bothering him. I know that diabetes can also cause ED and his father was diagnosed a few years back with it but he has been checked as recently as this past summer with a blood test due to serious sinus problems and the doctor said everything checked out okay. He still masturbates regularly and has no problem waking up with an erection either, and he insists it's not me.He has been talking about going to see a therapist but hasn't made the move because his health insurance won't cover it, and I don't want to pressure him to seek help either but I just don't know what to do. Other than that our relationship is strong as ever. Any suggestions??",
