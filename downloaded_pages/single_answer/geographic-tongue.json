            "answer": "Here is from another website:\"Geographic tongue is thought to be an oral manifestation of psoriasis, a dermatological condition which causes dry, flaky, itchy skin in patches on sites outside of the mouth.\u00a0\u00a0No one knows the exact cause, however it seems to be linked to stress, and appears to be genetically related (runs in families).\u00a0\u00a0It is more common in persons with eczema, asthma and numerous allergies, and is also about four times more common in persons with diabetes, although the presence of geographic tongue is not noted as a warning sign of diabetes.\"It manifests by the loss of the filliform papillae on the top surface of the tongue, in irregular patches that may appear in a few hours, but heal over time and then reappear in different spots.\u00a0\u00a0The technical name for this condition is benign migratory glossitis, the term \"migratory\" denoting the apparent movement of the denuded spots from one place on the tongue to another.\"The condition is considered benign (not dangerous), and is rarely treated, although the appearance of the tongue during outbreaks may alarm the patient. The sense of taste is not affected by geographic tongue, however it does temporarily reduce the sense of touch in affected areas.\u00a0\u00a0Geographic tongue is more common in persons who are sensitive to environmental allergens and persons with asthma.\u00a0\u00a0It is four times more common in persons with diabetes than in the population at large, although it is not known as an early warning sign of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, young women taking birth control pills are more likely to experience an outbreak on day 17 of the cycle, suggesting that there is a hormonal component to the condition.\"",
