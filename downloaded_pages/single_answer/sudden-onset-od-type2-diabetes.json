    "question": "MY DOCTOR TOLD ME I HAVE SUDDEN ONSET OF TYPE 2 DIABETES BECAUSE MY BLOOD SUGAR WAS IN THE HIGH 400\"S AND MY A1C TEST CAME BACK AT 5. IN MY DIABETES CLASS THEY TOLD US TYPE 2 DIABETES COMES ON SLOWLY OVER YEARS AND THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SUDDEN ONSET. I AM NOT REAL UNHAPPY WITH MY DOCTOR AT THIS TIME. MY BLOOD TEST ASLO CAME BACK WITH A TSH OF 10.78, SO HE GAVE ME LEVOXYL, WHICH MADE MY SUGAR GO WAY UP AGAIN. IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME READING THE PAPER FROM THE MEDS I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT THE LEVOXYL AND DIABETES NEED DOCTORS ATTENTION.IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF DIABETES COULD BE CAUSED BY SOMETHING ELSE?",
