            "answer": "It's likely that the recurrence of your brother's encopresis is related to the emotional stress you describe. In any case, Adam requires professional help via therapy. If you are able to exert some influence with your mom or your dad to encourage one of them to seek therapy for Adam, you would be giving him a big assist. When parents are experiencing the sort of marital discord you describe, they often aren't sufficiently aware of the damage this can cause for their children. You have a sound perspective for someone so young and, even so, you might find it helpful also to have someone with whom you can speak about the strains the whole family is experiencing.",
