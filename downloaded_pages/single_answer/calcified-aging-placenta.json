            "answer": "If your obstetrician is on vacation, I suggest that you ask for a referral to a perinatologist (an obstetrician with specialized training in high risk pregnancies).\u00a0\u00a0They can review your history and ultrasound and give you an informed opinion about the significance of the placental calcifications.The good news is that your baby is likely to do well since you're at 34 weeks and the baby is growing normally.\u00a0\u00a0Even if your doctors decide on an earlier delivery than your due date, babys that are past 34 weeks of gestational age generally do extremely well.",

    "question": "I was asked to do an ultrasound at 31 weeks to check for a dilated kidney.\u00a0\u00a0(thankfully the kidney is fine) I was asked to come back at 34 weeks where the doctor told me that my placenta was aging faster than the baby. At 31 weeks, my placenta had calcification deposits that resembled a placenta that was 35-36 weeks old. Fortunately the baby is still growing normally (he's 5.5lbs) and the blood flow is normal.My OB/GYN is currently on vacation and I have many concerns about this...once calcification starts, can it slow down or stop? What type of precautions, if any, should I take? Will I most likely be induced? If so, what week? I'm very concerned...is it necessary? My husband thinks I'm just being hormonal!I know that this can occur in women who smoke, have diabetes and/or hypertension. I have none of these things and I'm actually very healthy. Why would this happen?",
