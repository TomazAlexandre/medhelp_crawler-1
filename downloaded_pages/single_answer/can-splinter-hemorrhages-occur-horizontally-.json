            "answer": "Hello,These horizontal lines can be splinter hemorrhages or Beau\u2019s lines(they are horizontal lines of darkened cells and depression). Beau lines are horizontal and going across the nail. It may be caused by an infection or problem in the nail fold, trauma, coronary occlusion, hypocalcaemia, skin disease, and may be a sign of systemic disease.It may also be caused by an illness of the body, such as diabetes, psoriasis or certain medicines. I would like you to consult a dermatologist and get investigated for all these causes.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "A few days ago my boyfriend showed me a very thin black line that extends horizontally approximately half way across the nail starting on the side and ending in the middle of the nail bed. He said that it had been slowly extending and continues to grow larger across the nail.I am a nursing student and just read about splinter hemorrhages last night while studying and then of coarse began to worry about what that little line could be. It goes in the same direction as a beau's line, however it looks like a very thin splinter hemorrhage.Is it something to worry about???",
