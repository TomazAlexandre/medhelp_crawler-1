            "answer": "Gdc, fat in the feces and indicate a problem with fat malabsorption. Although there are sever things that can cause it, two of the most common are a problem with gallbladder function (or perhaps pancreatic issues), or celiac problems.An ultrasound will only show you just 'so much.' It will nto indicate if the gallbladder is functioning properly - which is measured by ejection fraction. For the GB, an ultrasound will only show you whether the walls are distended, or if there are stones or polyps - not much more.If you believe you have fat malabsorption, ask your doc to check the condition and if it proves to be positive, start looking into the cause of the problem. It cannot be changed with a colon cleanse.",

The pain has not gotton worse as a matter a fact it is a less now than a year ago. I am 46 w/no family history of colon cancer. I do have a lipid problem w/diabetes 2(insulan resistance) w/A-1C of 6 225lbs 5-11\". This could be a acid problem but after reading some of your forums I think it could also be a fat problem. My feces float which indicates a high fat content. I do try to watch what I eat and take suppliments - 6grams vitamin c- 4 grams fish oil( to reduce high triglycerides)- fiber . Please tell me more about fat in Feces.Should I do a colon clense do I have a absorbtion problem? I did pick up something about the lymphatic system being blocked? what does that mean.
