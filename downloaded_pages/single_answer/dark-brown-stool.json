            "answer": "Sometimes mine are very dark too. I think it depends on what you have eaten within the past few days. I ate some red velvet cake a while back and my stool the next day was a dark red color, so I was assuming this was from the cake I ate. Just make sure the color doesn't stay the dark color you are describing for over 2 weeks, if it does then you need to bring this to a doctors attention.",
