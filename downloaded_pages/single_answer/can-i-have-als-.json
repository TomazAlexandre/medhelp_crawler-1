            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Yes, since there is a family history, ALS should be ruled out. Shakiness with memory problems can also be due to drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, hyper and hypothyroidism, lupus, and Lyme\u2019s. Multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonism, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, low vitamin B12 or low vitamin D, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. and certain epilepsies too could be the cause. It can be benign fasciculation syndrome if all causes are ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have always had a bad memory, and shakiness, mostly due to high social anxiety. But lately both have gotten worse.\u00a0\u00a0My dad died at 69 from ALS, and two of my Aunts had MS and MD respectively. I'm only 39. Can I have ALS? Something else? I haven't had any tests done, what should I get to find out if I have anything?",
