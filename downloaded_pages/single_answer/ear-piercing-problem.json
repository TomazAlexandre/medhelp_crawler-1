            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You probably have developed infection again. This could be due to some underlying infection left from previous piercing, allergy to the material being used for piercing or allergy to the earrings you are using. The other possibility is that you have a high blood sugar as in diabetes that is resulting is repeated infection and scarring at the piercing site. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examination.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I had gotten my ears pierced a long time ago and a lot of scar tissue grew and they closed up. A month or two ago I re pierced them myself and today I noticed one of them started hurting. So I struggled to get the back of the earring off and I noticed that the front of the ear is a little blue/black but my biggest concern is that there was black around the back and the hole is huge on the back, much bigger than the piercing itself. What is this? And do I need medical care right away?",
