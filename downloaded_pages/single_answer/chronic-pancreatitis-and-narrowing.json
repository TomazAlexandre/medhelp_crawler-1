    "question": "My mom was recently diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0She is in the process of follow up tests including an MRCP.\u00a0\u00a0They say that they are 90% sure that the narrowing she has is from the pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0She is diabetic and a smoker.\u00a0\u00a0They seem to think this will confirm her diagnosis but I cam still really scared (obviously of cancer)\u00a0\u00a0They will be looking for any blockages through the MRCP andher MRI looked fine other than the narrowing.\u00a0\u00a0My question is has anyone else here been through this.\u00a0\u00a0The whole testing process has been going\u00a0\u00a0on for about 4 months now.My question is for people who have been diagnosed with Chronic Pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0How long was your testing process?\u00a0\u00a0I would have thought they would find comething by now, good or bad.\u00a0\u00a0We are in Boston and they doctors have been great and thorough I suppose but this whole process is taking a toll on her mental well-being.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much.",
