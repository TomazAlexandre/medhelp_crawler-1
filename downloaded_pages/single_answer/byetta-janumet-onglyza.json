    "question": "I am currently on Janumet 50/1000 and Byetta 10mg\u00a0\u00a0twice a\u00a0\u00a0day.\u00a0\u00a0It's been controlling my diabetes well.\u00a0\u00a0However, I would like to try Onglyza as a substitute for one (preferably Byetta because of convenience when dining out & carrying the pen & needle) or both.What would be the efficacy of going to Onglyza alone or Onglyza & Janumet\u00a0\u00a0over my current regimen?What other regimen\u00a0\u00a0would work?\u00a0\u00a0Onglyza & Metaformin 1000?Thanks, Larry",
