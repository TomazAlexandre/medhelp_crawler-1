    "question": "In 2005 I had to be hospitalized because an aneurysm burst in the subarachnoid area of my head.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said it was 6mm in size and one of the biggest he's seen. Doctor Taylor mentioned that I was in the lucky 3% to survive something that big.\u00a0\u00a0Well now 3 years later i don't feel so lucky. My temper and interests have changed dramatically. I wonder if it is due to the incident. Are there any groups in my home town that i can attend to help me out? NEED HELP DESPERATELY!!!",
