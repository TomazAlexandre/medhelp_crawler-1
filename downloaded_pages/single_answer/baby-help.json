            "answer": "Hi!A viral infection can change the stool color to dark bottle green color. If this is not the cause, then the stool is passing out of the large intestine at a very rapid rate so the bile does not break down. This can happen if you have malabsoroption syndromes. Another reason is diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It can also be due to milk intolerance. If the green stool persists do discuss this with your baby's doctor and get his stool examined. Take care!",
