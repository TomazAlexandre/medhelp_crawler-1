            "answer": "Preserved systolic function means that the ejection fraction is equal to or greater than 50%. Normal is 55% to 70%.What you need to do is to keep your lipid profile normal. That is to say get rid of the excess bad cholesterol ( the low density lipids ) by taking 150 mg Aspirin + statins like Rosuvastatin or Atorvastatin or some other which your doctor will prescribe for you. This will prevent the Aortic Sclerosis from worsening to Aortic Stenosis.It is also important that you check for diabetes or insulin resistance syndrome as high blood glucose levels can play havoc with the heart and kidneys.Please also look up ---http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/aortic-valve-calcification/HQ00245http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/left-ventricular-hypertrophy/DS00680http://my.clevelandclinic.org/heart/disorders/heartfailure/ejectionfraction.aspx",
