            "answer": "Sweetie, if you had contracted HIV 17 years ago, you'd most likely be dead now as there were no treatments for it then. The threat of HIV is still out there and makes all of us a bit irrational..........don't be hard on yourself. Discuss this with your doctor whom I'm sure will say you're just fine and don't need to test.",

    "question": "Hi,I find this whole thing a little uncomfortable but I feel that this is a good place to get some advice. I have an Asperger\u2019s diagnosis and I tend to get obsessed with certain things and feel very anxious about certain things too, this being one of them. This makes it difficult for me to see the big picture or to see things rationally sometimes.Here\u2019s my issues. I recently had a blood test (testing for diabetes, liver/kidney, thyroid) and everything was fine except my neutrophil count was on the low side (1.7). The doctor said not to worry as this was on the low side of average but still within the normal range.I\u2019ve had worries about HIV all my life and when I was a child I used to worry about touching things and getting infected. This was the late 80s/early 90s and there were a lot of adverts on the TV at the time about HIV. This may have contributed to my obsession.Anyway, about 16-17 years ago I had unprotected sex with a white female (stranger met on a night out), aged between 19-23, in the north of England. I\u2019m concerned that I may have gotten HIV from this encounter. I don\u2019t know much about the prevalence of HIV in that region at that time but the low neutrophil count is making me think that I could have caught it from her. I do remember having a sore on my penis (I am uncircumcised) a day or two after the encounter, though I can\u2019t be sure; this was a long time ago. It could be an artificial memory. I don\u2019t know if this would have increased my risk?I recognise that I should get tested but I\u2019m freaking out and suffering anxiety attacks. However, I am going to get tested this week, asap. Basically, I\u2019m worried that I am a long term nonprogressor that is starting to be affected. Am I being irrational here?Thank you,Steven.",
