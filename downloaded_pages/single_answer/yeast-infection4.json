            "answer": "Hi,You have not stated it specifically, but are you referring to a vaginal yeast infection? If so, then this is a very common infection seen in women, not necessarily associated with sexual intercourse.It is estimated that between 20%-50% of healthy women normally carry yeast in the vaginal area. Vaginal yeast infection, which is the most common form of vaginitis(inflammation of the vagina), is often referred to as vaginal Candidiasis.The use of douches or perfumed vaginal hygiene sprays, medications like steroids and antibiotics, diabetes mellitus may increase a woman's risk of developing a vaginal yeast infection. It presents as burning, soreness, sometimes associated with a discharge.The discharge has no smell, is whitish and thick in appearance and texture.Treatment is with antifungal medications that are applied topically in and around the vagina like clotrimazole (Lotrimin) or miconazole (Monistat).However, for best results it is recommended that these same medications be used as vaginal tablets or suppositories.ref:http://www.medicinenet.com/yeast_vaginitis/page4.htmIt is best for you to get it examined to confirm the diagnosis before you start any medications.",
