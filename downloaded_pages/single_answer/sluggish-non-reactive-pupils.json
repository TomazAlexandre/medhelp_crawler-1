            "answer": "Hello Bettyboop: the three things that would most likely account for sluggish (meaning slow acting) pupils are:\u00a0\u00a01. your previous cataract surgery-often the pupil has to be stretched to make it bigger and the cataract operation easier and safer to do. This often leaves them sluggish and 2. your diabetes. Diabetic pupils are often sluggish and don't react well. It may be a form of diabetic neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a03. Finally as a rule as we get older especially 70+ years old the pupils get sluggish like other parts of the body.Keep in touch with your ophthalmologist. Anyone with diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma and previous cataract surgery needs to see their eye physician (ophthalmologist = Eye MD) 2 or 3 times/year.\u00a0\u00a0 If money for medications is a problem ask your EyeMD about the new selective laster trabeculopasty for glaucoma. It might reduce or eliminate the need to take drops.JCH MD Eye Physician & Surgeon\u00a0\u00a0(Ophthalmologist = Eye MD)",
