    "question": "Hi,I was trying to masturbate and Ejaculate after a hard erection and instead of semen i felt that blood gushed through the veins of my penis and I started to feel my heart beat on my penis. This was about 2 months from now.I got married few weeks ago and realized that I am unable to maintain hard erections anymore. However, I can get it for a few seconds but then its lost. This wasn't the case previously. Even a single thought would have created a hard erection to me.There is no pain as such but the erections are not hard.Please Help!!!",
