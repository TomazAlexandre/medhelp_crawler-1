            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include hypertension autonomic neuropathy (secondary to diabetes), hypertension secondary to renal disease, cardiac/ heart related causes, renal complications etc, though this does not typically sound like a renal artery stenosis, the possibility may still need to be considered. I would suggest considering a detailed evaluation by an internist and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
