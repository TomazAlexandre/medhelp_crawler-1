            "answer": "Welcome to the Forum.\u00a0\u00a0Your terminology has me confused.\u00a0\u00a0Thrush is a yeast infection.\u00a0\u00a0Are you using the term to describe an oral yeast infection?A few comments which may be helpful to you.\u00a0\u00a0for starters, the onset of your genital symptoms occurred far too soon to be anything other than a local, chemical irrigation.\u00a0\u00a0Possible causes could be the N-9, the latex, or other creams/lubricants you may have come into contact with.\u00a0\u00a0The N-9 however is the most likely cause.It is not clear when your \"yeast infection started (BTW, what is the \"spit test\" but I cannot help but wonder if this is not a late manifestation of your allergic reaction.\u00a0\u00a0If it was yeast infection, it sounds as though it has improved with therapy.\u00a0\u00a0That your \"thrush' (again, not sure what you mean by this) did not improve when your genital infection did suggests that you may have two different problems going on.In answer to your specific questions:1.\u00a0\u00a0See comments.\u00a0\u00a0Thrush is a yeast infection.\u00a0\u00a0men do get yeast infections, both genitally and orally.2.\u00a0\u00a0When people get yeast infections related to HIV, it is because they have HIV for years, not days.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, while yeast infections are more common in persons with HIV, most yeast infections occur in people who do not have HIV.\u00a0\u00a0Other factors like diabetes, taking antibiotics or skin irritation make yeast infections more likely.3.\u00a0\u00a0No, this is not something due to HIV.4.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend a routine HIV antibody test.\u00a0\u00a0there are many types.\u00a0\u00a0At 4 weeks the test will detect over 90% of HIV infections, at 8 weeks over 99%.\u00a0\u00a0Your risk of HIV form a single exposure is very low.5.\u00a0\u00a0Fluconazole.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0EWH",

    "question": "Doc,I recently made the biggest mistake of my life.\u00a0\u00a0Long story short, I slept with a prostitute 3 weeks ago when in Dubai. I did use protection.\u00a0\u00a0During intercourse I immediately felt a burning sensation on the tip of my penis. The latex condom had N-9 spermicide and she definitely used some type of lubrication, although I'm not sure what it was. The next day my testicles were fire red and the tip of my penis felt like it was chaffed.\u00a0\u00a0It did not burn when urinating.\u00a0\u00a0It was all I could think about while flying back home. Then the stress really hit me hard for the next week before I did more research on the web and saw that some people have allergic reactions to N-9.\u00a0\u00a0I did the spit test at home and it definitely showed signs of a positive yeast infection.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore I used monistat and it helped but did not cure altogether.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the dr and was tested for the usual STD's and they all came back negative. However, I have since developed thrush and it won't go away. The dr perscribed me 2 doses of fluconazole and 5 days of nystatin. They have provided great relief in my genital area however the thrush is still here.\u00a0\u00a0I am now extremely worried about hiv since everywhere I look online it says that thrush is an early sign of hiv. As you can imagine, I have been stressing hardcore for the last 3 weeks.I have a couple of questions:1) Have you seen yeast infections in males that turn into thrush? If so, does this sound similar?2) If thrush does not go away after a couple rounds of meds is that a sure-tell sign of hiv? Or can it be from other causes, such as stress?3) Would hiv hit so fast that I would develop a yeast infection and thrush within less than a week?4) When and what type of hiv test should I get?5) What is typical treatment for thrush?",
