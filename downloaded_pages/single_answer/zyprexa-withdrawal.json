    "question": "I can relate to alot of the forums I have been reading, I am 23 right now and have been taking medcine since I was about 16-17. I had a drug problem and did not admit to it at time and was put on Anti-Depressants,the SSRIs made me manic and was put on Zyprexa. After years of jail and hospitals and finally getting clean(now almost 6 motnhs) I realized my problem is drugs...not bipolar. I say this because it is hard to diagnose a teen with BiPolar when they are on cocaine,so anyway I am off EVERYTHING now. I have been on a variety of antidepressants,but always stuck with Zyprexa for almost 7 YEARS! I was going up and down on 15-10 mg. I am on my 3rd week of withdrawal,the Zyprexa withdrawal is HORRIBLE. For a few days I felt alright,but today it came back. I cant sleep,I constantly vomit,feel so much anxiety. I refuse to go back on meds...because if I was bipolar I would be either depressed or manic by now. After reading through 10s of different Zyprexa withdrawal forums I am going to stick to staying off it. I just want to hear from people who got through it without going back on any meds. DOes the anxiety and emtional numbness go away? I just talk to people and have faith that my brain will go back to its normal state before I started drugs and medications. My advice to anyone,unless you are hearing voices or seeing things...stay away from Zyprexa,its a temporary relief that will cause major long term problems when trying to get off. Luckily I did not get TD or diabetes(not history of it in my family). This sounds corny,but lets all just pray for each other...I am typing bad because of the anxiety. I read somewhere that certain chemicals in the brain get lost with the medicines and it takes a while for them to come back..but the hope is that they do come back. Weather 1 month or 6 months or a year....like I said I refuse to be another victim of the pharm. companies. I have\u00a0\u00a0been to a few STATE hospitals and some people take these meds for 15-20 years and are stuck in zombie land. Sorry for the rambling, we all need to just keep posting and give hope to someone else,because doctors arent going to do anything but give another drug,time will heal itself.",
