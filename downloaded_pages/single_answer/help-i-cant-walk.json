    "question": "Hi,i (used) to work out regularly, but in the last week i have been having muscle spasms, muscle twitching and 'pins and needles' all over my body, along with extreme fatigue...i also started having balance issues (falling )and weakness in some of my limbs, i can barely move my right leg-it's hard to explain, but, it just doesn't seem to work very well and i am shuffling around like 'Festus' on Gunsmoke.i was involved in a car accident a couple of years ago and have a very bad neck with bone spurs and some herniated disks in my back...do you think i irritated the nerves during exercise? is this why i can't walk very well and feel 'clumsy'? i am having sharp neck pain and right hip pain as well.i have visited the chiropractor,but haven't noticed improvement. Things got so bad that i have been having trouble going to work or even driving...i went to the ER in my town and they ran a CAT scan and performed some blood tests...They told me my head CAT scan looked OK and i didn't have diabetes or low thyroid or a brain tumor or MS...they also told me i was dehydrated and had orthostatic hypotension....",
