            "answer": "Hello,It is true that you are having erectile dysfunction. It can be due to medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal and neurologic causes. The testicular pain can be due to poor circulation but it is important to rule out other conditions like\u00a0\u00a0injury, infection (Epididymitis or Orchitis) or inflammation, excessive bicycle riding, hernia, varicocele or kidney or ureteric stones.Lab investigations like complete blood examination, urine examination, ultrasound lower abdomen and sometimes a urethral swab will help in diagnosis. Treatment will be started thereafter.My advise would be to consult a urologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi I am 59 married , good health but suffer from Erectile Dysfunction.By this, I mean, I am not firm if aroused. I have an undeveloped teste (right).When I was 48, I lifted a heavy weight, and felt something painful down in the scrotum area.I lost my erectile ability after this. Mentally I would get aroused but nothing happened down below ,as it always did previously. The pain was slight so I ignored it, but my ability to get erect was severely curtailed in spite of arousal.The doc just said \"viagra\" after examining my teste. Viagra did help, as did other erectile pills, however these days my good teste aches at night, and I don't have sex in any form at all. Is it possible the teste cord is being squashed or choked , because this is what I imagine to be wrong?",
