I removed my nail polish to see if it the nail was dark but it is normal. I'm a diabetic and do experience neroapathy and\u00a0\u00a0taking meds. but this new pain is different and need to know if this is related to diabetes. I'm very concerned and will make an appointment, but would like to know if anyone is experiencing this problem.Thanks,Rhina-rene",

    "question": "I wasn't sure what topic to put this under, so I have put it on two or three commuities hoping that someone could help me. This is my problem.\u00a0\u00a0I am a racewalker and have always had some pain in my toes.\u00a0\u00a0I found if I taped the two toes next to the small toe that would work.\u00a0\u00a0In fact it worked for 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0In the last few months, the pain has increased intensely.\u00a0\u00a0I made an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon to see what could be the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I had self-diagnosed myself with Morton's Neuroma.\u00a0\u00a0He never suggested that it was Morton's.\u00a0\u00a0I told him that I taped my toes and he suggested I keep doing that and gave me a cortisone shot in the joint of one of my toes.\u00a0\u00a0That was absolutely no help and a waste of money.I have tried metatarsal pads and toe wraps, but nothing recently has helped.\u00a0\u00a0One odd thing is that somedays the toes do not hurt at all or they will shift from toes on the left foot to the right foot, though the right foot is the most affected foothe pain starts in the toe and seems to run into my foot. (Nerve?)\u00a0\u00a0I am at my wits end.\u00a0\u00a0I love racewalking and I was walking 5 to 6 miles a day and racing a 5K on Saturdays.\u00a0\u00a0I am unable to walk that far on most days now.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is just too excruciating.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes if I have a ways to walk to get back to where I started when the pain gets too bad, I can bend the toes of that foot under in my shoe and it will feel better for awhile if I walk like that.I have already had an MRI which showed nothing wrong.\u00a0\u00a0I also go to a chriopractor to help with sciatica problems.\u00a0\u00a0This problem has all but gone away with his help.",
