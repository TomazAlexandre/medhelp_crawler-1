            "answer": "\"Is there any place on here or anyone who can makes suggestions?\"MedHelp has two Nutrition Forums - patient and doctor - along with a patient Celiac forum.\"she eats what she wants and doesn't really take good care of herself to begin with..\"?If she wants to get healthier your mother must change her lifestyle.\"How is she suppose to manage all 3 diets at once?\"* Celiac - Avoid gluten products. Many health food stores, like Whole Foods, carry gluten free products. Spinach pasta comes to mind.* Cholesterol - Cut back on read meats, fatty food consumption [sausages, bacon, cheeses, eggs, etc], any and all products high in saturated and trans fat. I'm not saying to stop eating them entirely but too cut way way down. ie; Don't make them the main item at meal time.* Diabetes - Avoid refined sugar, foods &\u00a0\u00a0liquids containing sugary substances, foods with high carbs [as carbs turns into sugar once digested], and she must do some sort of physical exercise daily.\"They all conflict with each other\" No they don't, it's only in your mind that they do. For example;Eat more lean chicken and fish along with lots of vegetables. Eat fruit with other foods to lessen the absorption of fructose [fruit sugar] entering the blood stream. No conflict here. In fact a Google Search for \"gluten free low cholesterol low diabetes recipes\" returned 263,000 hits. http://tinyurl.com/nwho8n",

    "question": "My mother has type 2 diabetes with high cholesterol and was born with celiac disease.\u00a0\u00a0How is she suppose to manage all 3 diets at once? They all conflict with each other. What you can have for one, you can't have for the other and vice-versa. So how does one mange this dilemma? As of right now, she eats what she wants and doesn't really take good care of herself to begin with but I think that she is just frustrated and confused hence the reason to not do anything about this problem. None of her doctors say that they can do anything about anything and she has saw a dietitian in the past. She has a few other medical problems as well but she has meds for these. She does take pills for her diabetes but hardly ever tests her blood even though she has owned probably 6 or more machines. Is there any place on here or anyone who can makes suggestions?",
