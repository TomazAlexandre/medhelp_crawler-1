            "answer": "Hello,You seem to be having honeymoon cystitis.It is actually a form of urethritis.Abstain from intercourse for a few days,take plenty of fluids and take some OTC analgesics like ibuprofen or diclofenac.Also take pyridium for 2-3 days(it stains the urine orange) and sit in warm non soapy water.Also consult a doctor for antibiotics prescription if the symptoms persist.In future also,urinate immediately after intercourse to flush out the bacteria and ask your partner to indulge in plenty of foreplay or use lubricant jellies.The other possibility is of urinary tract infection. If the symptoms persist then diabetes needs to be ruled out.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and all the best.",

    "question": "I'm not sure what my problem is or truly sure if this is the right section but I'll try anyway. For quite a while now I seem to keep getting very urgent needs to use the toilet however when I rush in and actually sit down not always does anything come out, sometimes it will even just be a very small amount. I've noticed it mainly seems to happen after having sex with my boyfriend however we've been together 10 months and this wasn't happening from the start. When I do get these episodes they tend to last for around a week to two weeks, It's to be honest very hard to say cause it never truly stops. It's rather embarrassing to face cause sometimes the urge to go is too much and it feels like an accident is going to happen. I've been to the doctors about it once and was told I had a water infection and was given antibiotics, however it didn't really seem to help and I've not had my results back from the sample I gave.Is anyone else facing this or can anyone please shed some light on the subject for me? I'm finding it very hard to cope and to be honest It's very very embarrassing. Please help!",
