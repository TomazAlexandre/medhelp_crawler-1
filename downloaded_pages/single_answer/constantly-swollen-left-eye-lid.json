            "answer": "Hello,As the swelling of the eyelid is minimal so it is unlikely that it is due to an allergic reaction or contact dermatitis. Eczema can give rise to such symptoms but I would like to rule out the possibility of parasthesia as well. Dr skin can also cause these symptoms.Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Dear Doctor,I'm aged 23. Last year I suffered a contact dermatitis on the left side of my face, going from my left temple to the upper left part on my forehead and even onto my left eyebrow and eyelid. It eventually went away but always felt like the skin close and around my left eye was always more sensitive especially after a hot shower or when it was really humid out, doing sports, sweating, etc. I felt like there was ''movement''.Now and since about mid-April I've been having problems with my left eye again. I can feel my left eye lid (or more like the part right under the eyebrow) being ''heavier'' and again this sort of ''swelling movement'' on it. It's not particularly red and in my opinion only slightly swollen, it wouldn't be visible to anyone not looking at it, but this feeling of heaviness and swelling on my eyelid is now slowly driving me crazy after two months. and when I touch both eye lids at the same time, I can definitely feel a difference.I suffer from eczema on my hands occasionally and mostly only during winter...could it now be some kind of eczema on my face as well? stress reaction? permanent damage to my skin from the contact dermatitis? overuse of cream?Getting an appointment with a dermatologist here takes a few months, so that is why I am asking here. I am getting desperate.Thank you for your help.",
