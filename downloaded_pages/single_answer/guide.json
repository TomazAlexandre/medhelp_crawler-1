            "answer": "Dear KKCAL:There has been much hype about Garcinia cambogia, especially with Dr. Oz's show. (Reference:CBS Chicago News, Nov. 25, 2013, http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/11/25/experts-weigh-the-latest-diet-pill-fad-garcinia-cambogia/)However, please be very careful about taking dietary supplement with your current medical conditions: diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol, etc. Garcinia is NOT recommended for people with diabetes nor patients who are taking cholesterol medications like statins.Please consult your healthcare provider and pharmacist about this product, in addition to your medical conditions, and what kind of side-effects you are experiencing.Since dietary supplement is under the \"umbrella\" of foods, it is not regulated nor approved by the FDA, or Food and Drug Administration. Also, be award that not all Garcinia cambogia products are manufactured under the same quality standards. It is important to find a reputable manufacturing company.From the medical journal article by MH Pittler and E Ernst:\"Garcinia cambogiaHydroxycitric acid is obtained from extracts of G. cambogia and has been shown to inhibit citrate cleavage enzyme, suppress de novo fatty acid synthesis and food intake, and decrease body weight gain (20). We identified a double-blind RCT, which tested the effects of 3 g G. cambogia extract/d, which contained 50% hydroxycitric acid, in patients with an average BMI of 32 (20). The results suggest the absence of a significantly greater weight loss in the treatment group than in the placebo group. Two further double-blind RCTs report effects in favor of treatment with G. cambogia compared with placebo (Ramos et al, unpublished observations; cited in 20, 21). This is supported by a trial testing the effects of hydroxycitric acid (22). Other double-blind RCTs, however, that tested G. cambogia extract\u2013or hydroxycitric acid\u2013containing combination preparations with or without dietary alterations (Kaats et al, unpublished observations; cited in 20, 23\u201325) report conflicting results.Overall, the evidence for G. cambogia is not compelling. Adverse events are reported in the reviewed trials and are listed in Table 1.\"There are no magic bullets for weight loss.
