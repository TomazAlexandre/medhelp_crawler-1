            "answer": "Hello and welcome to the forum. Your father-in-law has quite significant blockages in the coronary arteries. What will be the best treatment for him can be decided only by the treating cardiologist. There are many percutaneous coronary interventions, CABG, stents available to relieve bloackage.Usually if patient is feeling normal and tissue is showing only a small amount of ischemia then conservative treatment is tried. But with chronic total occlusions, calcified bifurcate lesions usually percutaneous interventions are not successful. It all depends on which vessels are restricted, which location in the vessels and the percentage of the restrictions, age of patient and any associated medical illness like diabetes mellitus or any other major medical illness. It is really difficult to predict what will be best for him. Discuss with your cardiologist. Wish him a speedy recovery. Take care!",
