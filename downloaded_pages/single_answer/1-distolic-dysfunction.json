            "answer": "Diastolic dysfunction is a problem of myocardial relaxation due to stiffness of the ventricle from say long-standing hypertension or other conditions that cause decreased compliance such as a restrictive cardiomyopathy or constrictive disease (such as pericardial disease). Although 1% is rather low -- the best way of further progression is to treat the underlying etiology. If yours is a result of years of high blood pressure, then keeping your BP at goal with medications, exercise, and dietary compliance (low salt, etc) is the best treatment.",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with 1% diastolic dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0I have not met with the internist who received the report but he did phone.\u00a0\u00a0He said to continue monitoring my BP with a home cuff and taking the prescribed BP medications as needed, as the readings have been in the normal ranges for several days.\u00a0\u00a0Would you recommend going to see the cardiologist who read the report for an aggressive plan of action.\u00a0\u00a0I do have an apt. with the internist but it is not for 3 weeks and I am apprehensive.\u00a0\u00a0I also wonder if there are any articles as to arresting the 1% reading for longer periods of time.\u00a0\u00a0It seems as though there is not much in the way of positive in anything I have read.\u00a0\u00a0I do have very well controlled HBP and Diabetes and excellent blood work results.\u00a0\u00a0I would also like to know if there are any well ranked clinics in the Salt Lake City area.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you",
