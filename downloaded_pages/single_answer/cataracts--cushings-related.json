    "question": "I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CUSHINGS DISEASE CAUSED BY A PITUITARY ADENOMA (AFTER YEARS OF SICKNESS) I UNDERWENT BRAIN SURGERY TO REMOVE IT. AT THAT TIME I WAS ALSO DIAGNOSED WITH ANOTHER (NON CANCEROUS) TUMOR LOCATED IN THE OCCIPITAL LOBE OF MY BRAIN. AFTER SURGERY I HAD LOST ALL PERIPHERAL VISION IN BOTH EYES. IT NEVER RETURNED AND I WAS TOLD THERE IS NO SURGERY TO FIX IT. I HAVE CUSHINGS DISEASE RELATED DIABETES SO I HAVE REGULAR VISION CHECK UPS (SO FAR SO. GOOD) BUT WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF MY LATEST CHECKUP I BEGAIN TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MY VISION, AND HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH CATARACTS IN BOTH EYES, NOW 2 MONTHS LATER I AM ALMOST COMPLETELY BLIND. THESE CATARACTS ARE STEROID RELATED AND ARE\u00a0\u00a0AGGRESSIVE.. IS LASIC SURGERY AN OPTION FOR ME OR ANY OTHER SURGERY. (I AM WITHOUT ANY INSURANCE)",
