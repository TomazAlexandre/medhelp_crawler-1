            "answer": "I am 79. Since last 5 years my feet have tight sensation/ feeling as if tight socks are worn. This feeing remains 24 hours. Appertain medical causes are ruled out. There is mild swelling on feet. one of the doctor named this as parasthesia saying that pathology is not known so we cannot do anything for this. I have done many alternative therapies as well. Now i have decided to learn to live with it.In fact i have accepted deafness, Low vision because of macular degeneration, tinnitus( ringing in the ears)Since last three monthse I am feeling mild pain in the lower right quadrant of abdomen and right side of testis. Anti inflammatory\u00a0\u00a0drugs have not helped so far. we have to rule out other complication. otherwise i think i will have to add this symptom to my permanent problem.",
