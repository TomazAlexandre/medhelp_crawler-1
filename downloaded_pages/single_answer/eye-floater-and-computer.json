    "question": "I have type II diabetes so I visit my ophthalmologist frequently.Last year I started to see \"floaters\" and \"lighting strikes\" from the sides of my right eye. I was fortunate enough not to have retinal detachment and in time it went away except for one floater that is long and sometimes gets right in front of my eye. My problem is the computer and sometimes reading. The floater makes it difficult to focus. I have asked my eye doctor about this he said to just limit my computer use. Any ideas.thanks",
