    "question": "We adopted Doc Holliday on January 14.\u00a0\u00a0He is a Dalmation about 2-12 years old, and weighs 63 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0He looks like he's at an ideal weight for him as he is on the larger end of Dal size.\u00a0\u00a0All we know about his past is that he ended up in the county shelter for about 10 days, and was taken in by a Dal rescue organization from whom we adopted him.\u00a0\u00a0The rescue group had him for one week.Every 4 to 5 days, Doc gets sick.\u00a0\u00a0He vomits (usually in the middle of the night) and this follows with a day of diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0And the gas is horrific!!\u00a0\u00a0:-)\u00a0\u00a0 I know his diet has been changed over and over again in the past several weeks, so I put these symptoms down to food changes.\u00a0\u00a0A week ago I changed both dogs to Royal Canin Special 25 for dogs with sensitive tummies.\u00a0\u00a0Both dogs eat love it, but Doc has vomited the last 2 nights and now has diarrhea again.\u00a0\u00a0He drinks a whole lot of water, and eats 3 times as much as our other dog of the same size, but never gains weight.\u00a0\u00a0Our vet checked his blood sugar levels and it was perfectly normal, so diabetes doesn't seem to be a problem.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas of what else we should investigate?\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible he's still just having problems adjusting to the new diet and nothing more to worry about?",
