            "answer": "Diarrhea with sulphur belching may appear in1. giardia (intestinal parasite acquired by food or water poisoning). Dx is with stool test for ova and parasites.2. small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) that may appear in diabetes. Dx is with a breath test with lactulose or xylose...3. Helycobacter pylori infection of the stomach usually doesn't cause diarrhea, chills or body aches. But it may cause sulphur burps. Dx is with urea breath test.4. Other small intestinal disorders like lactose intolerance or celiac disease would may present with sulphur burps...I'd recommend you having tests one by one, starting with ova and parasites test.In meantime you can avoid eating sulphur containing foods that may eliminate sulphur smell but will not treat your condition as a whole.
