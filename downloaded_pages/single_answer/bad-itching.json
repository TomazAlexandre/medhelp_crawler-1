            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dry skin is the commonest cause of generalized itching. Applying a moisturizer and using only soaps that are gentle on the skin is helpful in this case.\u00a0\u00a0Vitamin A deficiency and diabetes too can cause dry skin. Hence these should be ruled out.Drink plenty of fluids and water. Keep a trough of water or use a humidifier at home in your rooms. You can apply petroleum jelly and glycerine on your skin at bed time. When choosing a moisturizer, look for oil-based creams and ointments. Fresh juice of tomato, cucumber and orange can be applied.If you have blisters at tip of fingers and dry skin then you need to rule out certain conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition.Generalized itching can be due to allergy. Common allergens are pollen, mold, dust, pet dander, synthetic fiber, food, cosmetics (powders, soaps, shampoos\u2014see if anything was recently changed) or drugs. You must get an allergy test done, either a skin test or RAST, to know what you are allergic to. Fungal infections like tinea corporis and tinea cruris too cause whole body itching along with genital itching. Liver problems too can cause generalized itching.If the itch is only in the exposed part, it can also be due to sun allergy. Pubic and body lice can be another cause. Worms are another cause of both anal and body itch and hence get a stool test.Low estrogens are also supposed to be the cause. Try a diet rich in estrogens. Hormone replacement therapy can also help a few. PCOD and hormone imbalance too can be a cause.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "Steph, I too had itching really bad. This is my 3rd year having it. First time I went to the doctor 2 times. They couldn't find out what was wrong. A doctor gave me a prescription of Metronidazol.\u00a0\u00a0It did finally go away.\u00a0\u00a0I did look into soaps, detergents or new foods I may have eaten, but to no avail, nothing was found. 2nd year I got it, went to dotor again, was given a different prescription, finally went away.\u00a0\u00a0These two times it wasn't yeast infection or anything else that a doctor may look for, like STD's or crabs. This 3rd time I got it (3rd yr. in a row)\u00a0\u00a0again, went to the doctor,she said I probably had a yeast infection. I told her I honestly didn't think iot was a yeast infection, I even tried monistat twice & taht didn't even help. Lo and bhold I got my results back from a Pap smear, and it came out negative. Nothing was wrong with me.After giving me two prescriptions of one pill, which didn't help,\u00a0\u00a0I asked her for the same prescrip. the first doctor had given me two years ago, and it did help again. I couldn't stand it, the itching was so bad that I couldn't even touch myself, I would get this sensation that went throughout my body that felt good, but yet made it worse to rub or scratch. I coulcn't sleep, or go to work. Well, like I said that prescrip. did help, but now that I finished it, it's back again.\u00a0\u00a0I think I may be allergic to something but have now idea of what it could be. If anyone out there knows anything please let me know.This discussion is related to/posts/show/240056.",
