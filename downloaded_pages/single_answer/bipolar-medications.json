            "answer": "Seroquel (and all other atypical antipsychotics) have the potential to cause diabetes so this is something you should speak over with your doctor as they would tell you what specific signs you would need to discuss with them as to how to monitor your blood sugar level in regards to that. I do take at least one medication which causes excess sweating and can cause extreme reactions to the heat and cold. The sweating is not a concern. The reaction to the heat and cold is but that much I can tell myself but the signs of blood sugar drop are complex. Perhaps you have an endocrinologist who could explain what the difference might be.",

    "question": "I am on Seroquel and Trileptal. I understand that both medications can cause sweats. Is there anything that I can do to help prevent them and what precautions should I take this summer being out in the sun. I am also diabetic and when my blood sugar drops I have a tendency to get sweats. How can I tell the difference between sweats that are caused by blood sugar drop and medication side effect.",
