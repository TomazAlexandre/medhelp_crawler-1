    "question": "I have a 38 month old female toddler. We are on the third try for potty training. She knows how to use the potty, but has to go so frequently, she gives up after about a week. She urinates about every 15 to 20 minutes, but I recently noticed that when she has fruit juice, the urination increases to every 5 to 10 minutes for about an hour after she drinks the juice. When she drinks milk, she urinates every 15 to 30 minutes. We discussed this with our pedicatrician and she said she should be urinating every 1 1/2 to 2 hours. We switched from giving her 6-8 ounces of fluid with each meal and snack to giving her 4 ounces every hour to hour and a half. The pediatrician ordered several blood tests (all normal), a kidney and bladder ultrasound, which was normal, and a urinalysis (normal). We do not give her any high glycemic foods and she gets no fruit or juice after lunch as she has severe behavioral changes if she does. She eats well (3 meals and 3 snacks), is average weight and is very tall for her age. Should she be tested for Type 1 diabetes? Should she see an endocrinologist or a urologist?This discussion is related to/posts/show/363302.",
