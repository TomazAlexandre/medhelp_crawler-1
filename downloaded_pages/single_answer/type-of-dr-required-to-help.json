            "answer": "HiHow are you doing? Usually sharp pain down inner part of thighs can be due to a lot of causes like a disc herniation, stroke, hemorrhage, tumor, arteriovenous malformation, effect of some medication, peripheral neuropathy, hypothyroidism, cervical spine disorder, injury, diabetes, arthritis, lyme disease, etc.Since orthopedic problem has been ruled out in your case, there is a possibility that the condition is due to some peripheral neuropathy. Signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy may include pain, numbness and tingling in the area affected by the nerve damage. It may also cause muscle weakness or loss of muscle control. Sometimes even longstanding hypothyroidism may cause peripheral neuropathy.You should visit a consultant neurologist for further evaluation and to rule out causes of such lesions including the presence of different vascular risk factors. Do write in about your neurologist\u2019s opinion on these lesions.Regards",
