    "question": "This may have been asked before but are there any essentials that people took with them for the hospital stay after surgery? Also how important was it after hospital stay, for you to have someone be with you at home? The only person I have that can stay with me, is my mother. Problem is, she has hypertension, diabetes, and a hernia. Often times she spends at least half a day barely functioning so I'm not sure how much help she would be. What kinds of help did you need at home?",
