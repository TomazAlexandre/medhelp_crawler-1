    "question": "For the past year and a half I have had frequent instances of nausea and vomiting and gas. More recently since school let out it has gotten even worse. The nausea has gone away except for early in the morning, but now the gas is horrible and makes me very crampy and painful to go to the bathroom. I'm not sure what to eat because everything irritates me. I get bad abdominal cramps whenever I eat and go to the bathroom. It seems like I am constipated but then my stool is very soft. I also noticed that whenever I have a bowel movement a clear sticky discharge comes from my vagina. This happens even when I'm not ovulating. There is no smell or itch or odd clumps. It looks like egg whites mostly. I also get diarrhea during my period sometimes. I'm not sure if this is related. I get headaches often too. I have gone in for many tests. Everything looked fine. I didn't have any parasites or blood in the stool or celiac's disease or diabetes. So they are going to test for fructose malabsorption but I am doubting that this is the case. If it is not this then they are assuming it's irritable bowel syndrome. I do not believe this either because the occurrence of my symptoms are pretty constant. It seems like irritable bowel syndrome is more random.",
