Other than that, I'd have her going to a neurologist and/or cardiologist to rule out more major causes, especially since she didn't have warning signs before fainting.Hopefully it is something really easy, like low blood pressure from the standing. It isn't uncommon in children, but you'll feel much better to have her checked out first.",

    "question": "My 7 year old daughter blacked out at school yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0We also believed this had happened about 6 months ago, as well, but could not confirm it since there were no witnesses in the first occurrence.She is a normal, healthy, active child.\u00a0\u00a0She cannot recall feeling dizzy or strange in any way.\u00a0\u00a0The last thing she remembers is standing in line, and then she woke up on the carpet with a scratched and swollen face.\u00a0\u00a0It appears that the blackout lasted only a few seconds, as she came to immediately after landing on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently she did not attempt to break her fall, so the belief is that she was unconscious before hitting the ground.The initial diagnosis was atonic seizure.\u00a0\u00a0However, she had an EEG yesterday and it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any direction on other possible diagnoses.Thanks in advance.",
