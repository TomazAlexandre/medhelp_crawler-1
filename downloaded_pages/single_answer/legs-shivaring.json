            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If your legs are shivering then this could be due to extreme weakness, cold feet (peripheral neuropathy like in diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, Reynaud\u2019s phenomenon and very cold external temperatures), Vit B12 deficiency, hypothermia or low body temperature, lower spinal nerve compression, anxiety and panic disorder or even due to electrolyte imbalance. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
