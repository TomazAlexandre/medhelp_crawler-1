            "answer": "Hi!It all depends on how old your baby is. Babies gain a lot of weight in the first few months of their life and then the weight gain is not that rapid. If the baby\u2019s weight is within the expected percentile of his age, then there is no cause of worry.If the baby is less than one year old, then you need to consult the pediatrician to rule out mal-absorption syndromes, liver problems, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc.If the baby is being breast fed, then at times the quantity of milk is not sufficient and top-up milk (canned or cow\u2019s) needs to be supplemented. Children on both breast milk and other feeds may not be eating enough and need to increase the calorie intake. However, this needs to be done under the expert guidance of a doctor. So, for a week, please log in what your baby eats\u2014quantity wise like one glass milk, or one cup porridge etc. Please take this log along with you and discuss with your doctor. Take care!",
