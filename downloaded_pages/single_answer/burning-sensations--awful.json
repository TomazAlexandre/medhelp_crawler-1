There could be various causes for the burning sensation in the arm, wrists, hands\u00a0\u00a0and feet including neuromuscular and inflammatory conditions, infections, and diseases affecting blood flow to the these parts. Diseases like diabetes, peripheral neuropathy associated with it can damage one or more nerves causing pain, numbness and burning sensation.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes can be traumatic injuries like to the hands, feet etc, nerves, burns, herniated discs, nerve entrapment like median nerve, sprains and strains, tendon rupture. Inflammatory cause like arthritis, gout, cellulitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. neuromuscular causes like carpal tunnel syndrome, raynaud\u2019s disease etc. this could be CRPS or complex regional pain syndrome following the back surgery.You need to consult a neurologist for the needful and the treatment will include blood tests, imaging and clinical assessment and therapy depending on diagnosis.
