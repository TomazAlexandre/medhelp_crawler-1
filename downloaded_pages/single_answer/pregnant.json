    "question": "I am currently 35 weeks pregnant and have had the following symptoms in order of appearance for the past 9 weeks: transient and intermittent numbness (perceived numbness as I can still feel scalp), tingling, or sharp pains mainly in left side of head; clicking noise in left ear and sizzling noise in neck mainly when laying down, seeing floaters or flashes of light, random buzzing, tingling, or pulsating sensations in limbs (mainly right foot), headache mainly in left temple area that resembles sinus headache with occassional pressure and sharp pains (headaches intermittent but seem to occur mainly at night and go away as soon as I get up in the morning-although lately they have occured randomly during the day.\u00a0\u00a0Often a spot on temple is sensitive to touch.); intermittently right arm and leg feel heavy and weak although I have same strength; random tingling sensations on other parts of body ie. tongue, nostril, etc.; occassional nausea, dizziness, or feel as if I'm being pulled to the right (I also have fluctuating blood sugar levels and many of the previously stated symptoms have reduced since attempting to regulate levels more); ringing in left ear, and now last night I noticed another sensitive to touch spot on scalp above ear that becomes sharp pain when pressing.\u00a0\u00a0I should note that my nose has been stuffy due to pregnancy (and likely allergies that I get this time of year) although the congestion really hasn't been too bad.\u00a0\u00a0I also have had fluid in both ears that went away with decongestants, but then returned.\u00a0\u00a0I decided not to continue decongestants due to pregnancy and deal with fluid.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for gestational diabetes but was negative.\u00a0\u00a0However as I mentioned I've been checking my blood sugar b/c I have feelings like I was going to pass out after meals and the levels are all over the place (ranging from 60's to 254).\u00a0\u00a0My OB says this can happen from hormones and isn't g. diabetes as I produce enough insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Due to symptoms my OB authorized an MRI about 5 weeks ago, which came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0This was obviously w/o contrast due to pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a EMG and EEG that were negative.\u00a0\u00a0I've had routine blood work that came back negative besides a slightly low BUN (ER doc said I should eat more protein) and OB says baby is doing great.\u00a0\u00a0What could this be and what can I do to figure this out?\u00a0\u00a0I'm terrified of a brain tumor......",
