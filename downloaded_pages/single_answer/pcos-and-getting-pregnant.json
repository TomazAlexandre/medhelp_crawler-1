            "answer": "Hi there,Women with PCOS may find it difficult to get pregnant. But it is still not impossible. Women with PCOs have higher chances of acquiring diabetes, hypertension, eclampsia and the incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight is common. Fertility problems experienced by women with PCOS are usually related to the elevated hormone, insulin, or glucose levels. These all interfere with implantation as well as development of the embryo. Ovulation inducing drugs like Clomid are used in such women. Treatment of other associated endocrine abnormalities is also very important. Exercise and weight reduction is also helpful. In case all these do not work assisted methods of reproduction like IVF may be tried. I sincerely hope it helps.Take care and kind regards!",

    "question": "My name is Nell and I have Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome(PCOS).\u00a0\u00a0I'm 20 years old and I found out about PCOS when I was 17. I have a boyfriend of 2 years and we live together. Having PCOS means that getting pregnant will be about 90% harder for me than the average woman. I don't want to have a baby now but in a few years I would like to and I need yo know if there is some way other than getting In Vetro Fertilization to get pregnant. I was told losing weight would help, but I already lost about 20 lbs and lets just say my boyfriend still doesn't need to use a condom. Someone please help me learn more about my condition and how to safely get pregnant.",
