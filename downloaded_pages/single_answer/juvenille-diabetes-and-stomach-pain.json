    "question": "My son has been complaining for the past three weeks about a sore tummy, left side toward the back area, he has had his urine checked and he doesn't have any slight fever what so ever which has kind of ruled out appendix. We are now trying to rule out lactose intolerance, but I really feel this hard to believe since he has had no symptoms what so ever before. I learned today that there may be a correlation to diabetes, how great are the chances and if i check his sugers what is normal sugar level? he do love to drink alot...and he has ben somewhat out of sorts lately but I don't know if that due to the discomfort of the sore tummy. Neither my husband or myself has diabetes, however, it is present on my side of the family. Should I get him checked right away, or wait until we rule out the lactose thing?",
