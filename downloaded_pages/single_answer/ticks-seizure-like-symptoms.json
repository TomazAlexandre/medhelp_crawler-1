    "question": "Yes, I have also experienced twitching AFTER the use of mephedrone. For about 2 months I was a very heavy mephedrone user using as much as 1 gram a day, and I never really noticed anything while I was buzzing from the meph other than shaking, which is understandable since I am abusing a stimulant. But after effects have been horrible, I have become a very anxious person and I have a lot of twitching going on, just muscle spasms or something. I am worried about it though and am probably seeing a neurologist soon.This discussion is related to/posts/show/1187726.",
