            "answer": "Hi!Pain and numbness at finger tips can be due to nerve compression as in carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis of the wrist and other hand joints, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, hypothyroidism, lupus etc or due to fibromyalgia. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
