            "answer": "Hi,Reynauds phenomenon is a disorder of blood vessels caused by excessive spasm of the blood vessels. The spasm of the blood vessel affects the blood flow to the extremities turning them pale and cold. This condition is believed to be due to overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and is often triggered by stress, cold etc.I would suggest you to get a clinical evaluation done by your GP to rule out other causes like peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or B12 deficiency.Take care!",
