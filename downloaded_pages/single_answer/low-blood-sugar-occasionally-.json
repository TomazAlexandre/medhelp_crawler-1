    "question": "I experience the following health issues:-Visual disturbances (dark spot in vision)-Cognitive disorders (brain fog)-fatigue-excessive thirst/ frequent urinationI was tested for the following:-CBC Blood test-Metabolic Panel-ANA-Sed Rate Test-A1C 3 month blood glucose-Cardiac stress test-Echo-EKGThe only things that came back abnormal were:-Elevated Hemoglobin-Elevated Hematocrit-Low Carbon Dioxide-Borderline High AM Cortisol-Low blood sugar occasionally (in the 50 range)My health issues have been going on for 3 years. I feel like my issues are related to food or hydration. I checked my blood sugar when I feel extremely weak and noticed my glucose levels are in the 50 range. I consume sugar and feel better, but I never feel 100 percent. My PCP ruled out diabetes mellitus based on my 3 month blood glucose test. She refuses to test for food allergies, but I did get tested for celiacs disease (negative). Why do you think my blood sugar drops low? I would also appreciate any suggestions that would help me figure out what is going on with me.Thanks in advance",
