            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Inadequate oxygenation can produce symptoms of breathlessness, as the body tries in an effort to compensate for the decreased oxygen supply. It can also cause paleness and sometimes fainting spells. Long term sleep deprivation can lead to impairment of cognitive functions (higher functions) in the brain.The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Breathlessness on exertion could be due to the decreased lung function. Again in cardiac disorders the heart is unable to pump the blood adequately, more so when subjected to stress like exercise. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. So please consult your primary care physician who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test to rule out a cardiac cause for the pain. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest. Lung function tests could further help in evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am a 55 year old female with type 2 diabetes and sleep apnea. Starting about 1 year ago I started getting a horse throat. It would happen a couple of times a month. Now, for the last 3 months, it has become chronic. I also developed a goiter in front of my thyroid (4.4cm) that has been diagnosed as being benign and not interfering with my thyroid.Along with the chronic horseness, I am having issues breathing. I can no longer sleep in my bed, even with the CPAP. I sleep in a chair.The doctor is not sure what the problem is and is suggesting I have acid reflux....Do you have any suggestions or advise?",
