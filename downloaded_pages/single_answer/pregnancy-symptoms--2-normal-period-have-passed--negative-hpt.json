            "answer": "Hi!If you had normal periods and your pregnancy test have been negative then in all probability you are not pregnant. Bloating and gas can be due to various causes. You could be suffering from IBS or spastic colon Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, diabetes, food intolerance, malabsorption syndromes, constipation, gallbladder and liver problems, pancreatic dysfunction, or taking a diet rich in sulfites juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, red wine, mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough). Cancers of the gut (intestines, stomach, colon, rectum) and in female ovarian cancer too could be a cause. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
