    "question": "i'm 22 years old and suffer from blood sugar levels that change rapidly. I suffer from all the symptoms of thirstyness , shakiness, very frequent uriantion, blurred vision,and confusion. i just started taking cell-tech a weight lifting supplement and have been trying to gain weight. Cell tech has a warning not to take if you diabetic.i guess its spikes ur insulin levels using dextrose. any ways is it bad to get to much insulin if ur a diabetic? I've been taking this for 2 weeks and my symptoms are getting worse. Ive wet the bed 4 nights in a row now. something i didnt do before taking this.Just wondering if this is normal..also is it smart to try and gain weight if ur diabetic?I also lift weights and im trying to get bigger. just wondering if i should stop and what your opinions are on this , thanks for you time, matt",
