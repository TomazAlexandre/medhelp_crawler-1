            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Burning pain can be a type of pain called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain (pain from injured nerves) can also have qualities of gnawing, aching, and shooting or lancinating qualities. There are two types of nerves in the body \u2013 large and small. The small nerves supply skin and sweat glands. The large fibers are associated with strength and your tendon reflexes.The causes of smaller fiber neuropathies include, to name a few, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune problems such as Sjogrens. Larger fibers have similar causes such as diabetes (which may need to be diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance test), but other causes include genetics (such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth, in which there is a family history of sensory neuropathy usually from an early age associated with other clinical features such as high-arched feet), autoimmune problems (such as lupus (SLE), Sjogren's, Churg-Strauss (in which asthma also occurs), polyarteritis nodosa, which affects blood vessels), and demyelinating diseases (such as CIDP). Vitamin B12 and B6 deficiency, as well as excess vitamin B6, can also cause neuropathy. Some toxins, such as lead, arsenic, and thalium can cause large fiber sensory neuropathy. Other causes include abnormalities of protein metabolism, as in a type called amyloidosis or monoclonal proteinemia. In many neuropathies, both the sensory and motor nerves (the nerves that supply the muscles) are involved, leading to sensory symptoms as well as weakness.\u00a0\u00a0This type of neuropathy can be diagnosed by EMG/NCS. In rare cases, a lumbar puncture and perhaps nerve biopsy may be necessary for diagnosis. A skin biopsy may be necessary in smaller fiber neuropathies. Lastly, compression of the nerve or prior physical injury can cause a localize burning senation.I would suggest you follow up with your primary physician to obtain a detailed history and physical. You may need additioanl workup depending on the evaluation.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
