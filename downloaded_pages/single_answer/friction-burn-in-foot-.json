    "question": "5 days with this injury and doesnt seem to be healing fast enough.\u00a0\u00a0I went out for a run and felt the burn but didnt stop... The burn is on the front of my foot (right at the level of my ankles) and is the size of my Toe. Im starting to worry now -- foot is swollen and some history of diabetes in the family. Going to Doctor tomorrow but any insight or advice will be apreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Would send photos if needed. Thanks!",
