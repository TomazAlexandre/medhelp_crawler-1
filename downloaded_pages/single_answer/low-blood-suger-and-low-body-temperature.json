            "answer": "Hello Starr -What a frightening experience you've all just been through.\u00a0\u00a0As you might know, we are volunteers here and not medical professionals, so you might need to press further with your son's doc on your question.From my experience with low blood sugar, it seems that my body begins to halt 'non-essential' functioning when starved for fuel (blood glucose).\u00a0\u00a0My low blood sugar symptoms include things like not being able to express myself well.\u00a0\u00a0Clearly, it's less important to be able speak or write well when my organs are crying out for glucose to keep my basic functions working.While I don't know if there's any medical research to support my thinking, I suppose that the reason we can survive very low blood sugars is that our bodies 'know' the things they must do (breathe, circulate blood to the heart & brain) and begin to stop doing things that are less critical.\u00a0\u00a0At such a low blood sugar as you reported, I can only imagine that many of our built-in regulatory functions are also impaired (temporarily) - just to use the glucose to fuel our brain & breathing.\u00a0\u00a0That's how I would -- as a lay person with no medical background -- interpret a low body temp.Maybe others will have additional ideas.",

    "question": "I have a 24 year old son who has had diabetes since the age of 11.\u00a0\u00a0Recently he was taken by ambulance to the emergency room for a severe insulin reaction.\u00a0\u00a0He was unconsious with a blood suger level of 21 and a body temperature of 32 degrees.\u00a0\u00a0While I have seen the low blood sugar levels several times I have never seen a body temperature this low.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor did not seem to be worried about the temperature issue and I did not get a satisfactory answer from him as to the cause of the low body temperature.\u00a0\u00a0Can you help?",
