            "answer": "Hi!Generalized feeling of a burning sensation can be due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Fibromyalgia is another possibility. In females above 40 years it can be a symptom of menopause or premenopause.This would need a comprehensive investigation. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!",
