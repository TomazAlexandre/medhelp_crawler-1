            "answer": "Hi,There is very good evidence that medications like Cozaar protect the kidneys from damage in people with diabetes. Your blood pressure is quite good, as is your glucose control. You did not mention what your last urine test showed in regard to protein leakage(urine microalbumin)--this would be a clear indication for the cozaar even if your blood pressure if good.\u00a0\u00a0A low dose of cozaar is not likely to do any harm(you will still need to be monitored during the first few months after starting to be sure) and may give some benefit, so I encourage you to discuss it further with your doctor. If your urine has no protein leakage there is no URGENT need at this time and the decision will be up to you. Take care.",
