    "question": "Posted By Anne on June 14, 1999 at 12:26:27My husband is 48 years old (uncircumsized) and I am 36. He has a rather short penis.\u00a0\u00a0We are first time newly weds of 2.5 years.\u00a0\u00a0Two years ago he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. We have been trying to conceive on and off since our marriage in 1997.\u00a0\u00a0Many times we give up out of frustration becasue he has so many sexual function problems.\u00a0\u00a0He was recently diagnosed (by his primary care physician)as having Peyronie's Disease and has an appointment with a specialist in a few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, he has trouble with a lack of sensitivity on his penis.\u00a0\u00a0Intercourse is not as easily satisfying for him as oral sex.\u00a0\u00a0We have sooooo many questions and concerns since we are really wanting to have children.\u00a0\u00a0Please help. There seems to be so much working against us.\u00a0\u00a0This has been very discouraging and very hard on our marriage.1)Does Peyronie's Disease or the length of the penis effect male fertility?2)Is surgery the best rememdy?3)How do we know how much, if any of this, is related to his diabetes?4) Is there anything we can do to heighten penis' sensitivity?5)Is Peyronie's Disease in any way related to scleroderma?\u00a0\u00a0I was recently diagnosed with localized scleroderma...contagious?Thank you very much for any help.",
