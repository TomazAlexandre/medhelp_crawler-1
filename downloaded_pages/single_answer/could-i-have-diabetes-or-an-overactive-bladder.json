    "question": "I'm a female, who just turned 40 yrs. old.\u00a0\u00a0I've been experiencing frequent urination for a few years now, but chalked it up to drinking excessive amounts of water per day.\u00a0\u00a0However, it has progressed this year to having leakage while I exercise, which is quite embarassing at the gym.\u00a0\u00a0Even if I urniate before I run or do kickboxing, I still leak.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the other week when I got up in the morning my lower back really ached (near my kidneys) and I felt like I was getting a urninary track infection, but I didn't get one.\u00a0\u00a0(Historically, I've had some really bad urinary track infections where I urinate almost all blood.)\u00a0\u00a0Also, a few days later, it felt like something fell inside my vaginal area (almost like a tampon \"sliping\" out of me) and I now have pressure in that area (no pain though).\u00a0\u00a0In addtion to all this, I'm having a hard time quenching my thirst, I'm stressed and I'm really fatigued.\u00a0\u00a0I am due for my period next week, so I wandering if the stress and fatigue are PMS related.Since my mom is diabetic (acquired as an adult) and it runs in her family, does the above symptoms seem to be diabetic or baldder related or both?Thank you.",
