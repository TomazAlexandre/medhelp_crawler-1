            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The swellings could be enlarged lymph nodes. The commonest cause being EBV or infectious mononucleosis. Even if the GTT was marginally increased, he should be followed up for diabetes. Please consult an endocrine specialist. The flaring of a lymphnode could be a signal of some infection, which may be causing ketoacidosis temporarily.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My partner (male) has had large swellings on the sides of his neck three times in the past year.\u00a0\u00a0They occur suddenly (on one occasion the swellings were very hard, on other occasions moderately firm) and last about three or four days.\u00a0\u00a0Most recently, I was with him and noticed that his breath at first smelled sweet, then a couple of hours later like acetone.\u00a0\u00a0The next day as the swelling subsided, the breath odor was only intermittant (briefly while making love).\u00a0\u00a0He has seen two different doctors, who may not have been able to observe the breath odor due to delay in getting an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0(He had no companion to notice the breath odor on\u00a0\u00a0those previous occasions.)\u00a0\u00a0He has had glucose tolerance tests in the past year which were slightly elevated, but did not require medication.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors seem stumped.\u00a0\u00a0Can anybody help?",
