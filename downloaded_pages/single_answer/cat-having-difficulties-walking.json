Both can cause weight loss and lead to eventual neurological issues.I hope kitty feels better, let us know if there's any news.",

    "question": "Yesterday, I found my female cat in our closet.\u00a0\u00a0When I got her to come to me, she walked as though she was dizzy, stumbled to the right and plopped down to her right.\u00a0\u00a0She's able to take a few steps (always stumbling to the right) & then sits or lies down.\u00a0\u00a0She lets me pet her, even her hips and doesn't seem to be in pain.\u00a0\u00a0There hasn't been any change in her appetite either.\u00a0\u00a0In the last year, she's lost an incredible amount of weight but has remained as active as a kitten...she's about 16 years old.\u00a0\u00a0This whole walking thing seems to have happened over night.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions on what this could be?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
