    "question": "Hello ,I read from the beginning of this forum to the end. I spoke to people and tried to get the real facts.\u00a0\u00a0I talked to people that I have seen the results of this before trying this myself. So last week I went for my first visit and I didn't believe it would work. I have a little higher sugar level than I should, so this is the real reason I need to get my weight down. I have a small daughter and I can't see myself having a medical condition as severe as diabetes at 25 years old. I am trying to live life for her. So I weighed in at 186.5-my highest weight ever. I decided I was going to pay for this and be serious. I weighed in today and I lost 11.4 lbs in 1 week. I ate right and followed the directions faithfully and excersiced. My goal easy reach goal would be 160 lbs, but I think I might try for 150 lbs. Good Luck to all those who are researching. I couldn't believe it but IT WORKS!!!",
