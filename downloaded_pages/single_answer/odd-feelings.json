            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Since he has symptoms worse in the extremities, it may be a process called neuropathy. There are 2 types of nerves that provide sensation to the extremities, large nerves and small nerves. A problem with either of these could lead to sensory changes. There are MANY causes to this group of disorders. They include but are not limited to most commonly diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune disorders such as lupus or a disease called Sjogren's, certain types of neoplasm, and certain toxins (such as lead). What tests need to be ordered depend on the history and physical examination of the patient.It is difficult to say what physician your friend should see at this point. It may be beneficial for him to follow up with his primary physician and dermatologist. If no dermatological cause can be found, perhaps seeing a neuromuscular neurologist would be of benefit.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "My boss (65+ male) does not have atrophy of the muscles, weakness or difficulty swallowing.\u00a0\u00a0What he has is the sensation of wetness all over except for the face and chest and stomach, some scaling of the skin on his legs and sometimes very sensitive hands.\u00a0\u00a0He has been to his physician and a dermatologist and has had an MRI of the brain which was negative.\u00a0\u00a0Another doctor told him these symptoms were caused by a lack of Vitamin E and prescribed Vitamin E but that sounds farfetched.\u00a0\u00a0Although it may be coincidental, during the time that he has had these symptoms, his blood pressure has gone from about 130/80 to more than 170/100.\u00a0\u00a0His cardiologist has prescribed blood pressure medicine but he does not know whether it is related or not.Do you have any suggestion as to what medical specialist he should be consulting?Again, thank you for taking the time to respond.",
