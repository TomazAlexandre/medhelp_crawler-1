    "question": "I am a 13 year old female. A couple weeks to a month ago I sat down and completely lost feeling and movement in one leg. My leg went stiff and motionless for close to 6 minutes. I was worried for a while but later thought nothing of it. In the past week I have been falling down without tripping, etc. constantly. I'm extremely fatigued, weak and very thirsty. I have slept 12-13 hours and still been unable to stay awake. I was at the doctor last week and I got tested for diabetes, anemia, lyme disease and mono. The mono test came back positive but I don't know exactly WHEN I had it. I also haven't heard of mono causing the loss of movement. Is this something I should be concerned about? Is there anything I should be worried about? Thank you.",
