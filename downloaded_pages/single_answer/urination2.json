            "answer": "The bump on the penis may be unrelated to the urge incontinence that you are describing, however it would not hurt to have it biopsied just in case.\u00a0\u00a0This kind of incontinence is difficult to cure.\u00a0\u00a0He can hold his urine until he knows he will soon have an outlet and it lets loose.\u00a0\u00a0A course of the medication called PPA (phenylpropanolamine) may help strenghen the urinary sphincter and allivate the problem, or it may take a course of anabolic steroids.\u00a0\u00a0If all else fails there are some very helpful Chinese herbs that you can try (under veterinary supervision), such as, Minor Bupleurum Combination (Xiao Chai Hu Tang), or Wei Ling Tang, and others.\u00a0\u00a0Several may have to be tried to find the one that is most effective.Lastly, always check to see if there is not another cause for incontinence, such as a urinary tract infection, diabetes, endocrine disorders, and others.",

    "question": "I have a 3 1/2 old neutered doberman. He is very large for his breed and weighs about 115lbs. He wasn't the easiest dog to house break but we did it finally but every once in a while he pees in the house. It's always when we are there and we may be hooking him on the leash about to go out. he paces around really fast and nervous when he is about to pee. I expect because he knows he's not supposed to pee in the house. And when he does pee he still runs around nervously so it makes it a joy to clean up. It's like he can't hold it but if we are not home he holds it for hours. and it's only pee he never poops in the house. I have noticed since he was a pup that he has some sort of bump maybe a cyst on his penis but no vet has ever said anything about it, perhaps this has something to do with it?",
