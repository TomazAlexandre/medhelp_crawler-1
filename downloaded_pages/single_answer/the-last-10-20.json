            "answer": "Hi!Since you have disproportionate fat distribution with more of \u2018belly fat\u2019, you need to rule out disorders such as adrenal gland problems (Cushing\u2019s disease), hypothyroidism and diabetes. If you have any of these, you need appropriate treatment for them. Apart from it, you need to eat frequently but in small portions. It is best to eat lots of fruits and non-starchy green veggies, go slow on fats, eat carbohydrates in moderation and increase your protein intake (lean cuts, whites of eggs etc). Drink plenty of water and non fattening fluids such as clear soups etc. Look for hidden calories in salads and soups and avoid them (eg: cheese, butter, dressings etc).Diet alone will not tone up the body. For this you need exercises specific to the area of the body that has maximum fat, along with general exercises which include aerobics, stretching and strengthening exercises. You need to either join a gym or consult a physical trainer. Please consult your family doctor to rule out the above mentioned diseases first. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have had a fluctuating weight ever since my son was born just about 10 years ago. I've gotten up to more than what I weighed when I gave birth to within 19 pounds (keeping in mind, I gained 75 pounds with him :(\u00a0\u00a0). I am now back down to 170, and really focusing on eating healthier and picking up my activity level. Mothers with the \"baby belly\", any pointers on how to shrink that belly?",
