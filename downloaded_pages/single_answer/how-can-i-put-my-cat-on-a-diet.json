            "answer": "Hi your vet is telling you truthful facts with respect to your cat developing diabetes secondary to being overweight.Have your cats thyroid levels checked-get a FREE T3 and a FREE T4 which will give you the active circulating levels of her thyroid hormone levels. Cats occasionally are low or hypothroid and respond well to Soloxine or other thyroid supplements. This will boost her thyroid levels if she is low then that will help to boost her metabolic rate and this will help her loose weight if thats the underlying problem.If she is not hypothyroid, daily exercise, at least 4 sessions ten minutes long, cat nip basted cat toys and meals fed 2-3 times daily are helpful. Avoid free feeding as that promotes cat becoming overweight as well.Best Wishes,Dr Carol Osborne, DVM",
