            "answer": "As of now, Commissioned Corps are considered uniformed military units, and are under the general prohibition against insulin use for people with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes with insulin use. However, it is sometimes possible to slip someone through the system, especially if they are already employed. Call 1-800-Diabetes for specific information.",

    "question": "I was wondering if Type 1 diabetics could be in the Commissioned Corps, I hear its like the Military and have no exact clue if T1D's are allowed to join sense they are not allowed into the Military. I've always wanted to be a Naval Corpsman, but being I am a T1D I don't think things are going to change anytime soon, I've looked into Civilian Jobs but still haven't found out anything on a sort of a thing like; \"Civilian Medic Jobs\". If anyone has any help/info, or any knowledge of stuff on this that can help, much apreciated.-- Thanks in advance.",
