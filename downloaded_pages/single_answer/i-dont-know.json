    "question": "I was recently researching why I get random bursts of energy sometimes after I eat, and I remember it talking about my body not being able to break down the food correctly, which could be caused by diabetes. It's a burst of energy so powerful that it doesn't feel good like a burst of energy should. It almost feels like I'd ingested some type of drug, and it only lasts about 30 minutes or so. A couple weeks later, I woke up and found that I had sweat a lot during the previous night (enough to make my shirt damp), and for some reason it smelled really sweet. It continues to be the same, and I read that it may also be a symptom of diabetes. Should I be worried?",
