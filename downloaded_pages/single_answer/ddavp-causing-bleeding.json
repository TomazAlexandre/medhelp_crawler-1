            "answer": "Hi,How are\u00a0\u00a0you? Desmopressin Acetate or DDAVP is\u00a0\u00a0used in diabetes insipidus as well as bedwetting in children. DDAVP tablets can cause side effects like depression, stomach upset, electrolyte imbalance, conjunctivitis, and\u00a0\u00a0abdominal pain. On the other hand, DDAVP nasal spray/drops can cause upper respiratory infections, nose bleeding, and lack of tears secretion, headache, mild to moderate nausea or vomiting and abdominal cramps. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects. However, if you observed severe nose bleeding to both of your children at that time, it is best that you inform your doctor or report these effects to FDA . Discuss this first with your doctor before discontinuing or stopping the medicine, Take care and regards.",
