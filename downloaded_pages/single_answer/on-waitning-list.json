    "question": "Hi,I've been reading this board for a couple of months. So, I thought I would join in. I'm 50 years old. Learned I had HCV 4 months ago after getting sick. I thought I had some food poisoning at the time, results showed up after blood test. I did drink some alcohol (i.e. a cocktail and wine with dinner). I dont drink now, of course. Doc says I've had HCV for at least 20 years. I just got my biopsy result yesterday. Stage 4 grade 2.\u00a0\u00a0My genome type is 2. I will get my PCR next week. I will go to TX for 24 weeks. I called S/P and got on the waiting list for Tx. I was told wait should be until the end of summer. I feel good now that I know what is going on and what to expect (so far). However, I wonder if anyone out there that also HCV with diabetes is having toulble balanceing the two diets. My diabetes seemed to show up with the HCV. It seems hard to control blood suger and still get the carbs you want for your liver. I've been trying to gain weight but it seems I'm stuck at the same weight. I was hoping to put on some weight to help me before I start Tx. Does everyone lose wait during Tx?",
