    "question": "The other day I woke up with an odd feeling in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0It was similar to the feeling of it being asleep, although not fully.\u00a0\u00a0Just a mild tingling sensation that didn't seem to go away (was stronger in my right foot).\u00a0\u00a0My feet also seemed to feel cold no matter how much I covered them up.\u00a0\u00a0Today I had a similar feeling although it seemed to be more focused on the toes.\u00a0\u00a0They just felt real cold all day with a mild tingling.\u00a0\u00a0They also seem to be a bit itchy, although that may be in part to layering multiple pairs of socks.Now I feel silly going to my doctor and saying \"my feet kind of feel like they are asleep all the time\" but I think I might have to.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 28 years old, overweight, but have a fairly normal blood pressure last time I checked.\u00a0\u00a0I do work a desk job, so I am sitting most of the day.\u00a0\u00a0However, I've been moving around a lot the past coupld days and can't really seem to shake it.My biggest fear would be diabetes although I haven't had any other signs (not overly thirsty, no bladder issues, blurry vision, or fatigue).\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if this is potentially normal and will go away in a few days or if it is something I should have looked at.\u00a0\u00a0I've been soaking in warm water once a day and trying to keep my feet as warm as possible.",
