            "answer": "Do you mean, your GFR? What is it at? A little lower than normal is usually not a concern, since we humans can survive on reduced renal function. Have you discussed this with your dr? You need to know whats causing this-could be meds-over the counter and prescription can be hard on the kidneys. Avoid ibuprofen, aleve, and any NSAIDS as these are filtered thru the kidneys and can damage them with abuse. Tylenol is ok, but use it in moderation. See what other meds you take that can effect kidney function. Drink lots of water and clear fluids. Alot of times, your GFR can go back up. If you have high blood pressure or diabetes, this is also bad. Good luck.",
