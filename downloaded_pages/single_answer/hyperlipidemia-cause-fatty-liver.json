            "answer": "hi! well, i would just like to point out my opinion that fatty liver is usually caused by lipids accumulating in the cells of the liver or hepatocytes, so i think it is possible. Mostly is fatty liver is associated with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, syndrome x. However, it is not the only cause, fatty liver has different contributing factors such as alcohlic intake. Just to make it short i could be an alcoholic fatty liver or a non alcoholic cause.\u00a0\u00a0If your lipids are really that high then i suggest you take action with regards to that.\u00a0\u00a0and regarding the platelets, yes, fatty liver especially if it is already chronic can affect platelets since the liver does produce thrombopoietin (stimulates production of platelets) which is a major hormone synthesized in the liver. Thus if the liver becomes affected, its function can be altered as well. On the other hand, your platelet becoming low could have other causes as well. Especially if this is the first time this has happened.",
