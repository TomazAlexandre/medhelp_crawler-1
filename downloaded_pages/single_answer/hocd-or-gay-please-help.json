            "answer": "First, just having obsessive thoughts isn't OCD -- it's more complicated than that.\u00a0\u00a0Second, you don't state your age, but this is a common reaction among men after breakups -- it's just the insecurity of believing there must be something wrong with you that made the relationship fail.\u00a0\u00a0I went through it many years ago when I was 17, and so do many young men.\u00a0\u00a0If you are gay, it's fine, you'll know it.\u00a0\u00a0If you're not, that's fine too, you'll know that as well.\u00a0\u00a0Just know it's from your loss and the obsessive thoughts will pass.",

    "question": "hello! I'm a new member of this medhelp community... And the reason why I joined is because I've been having anxiety about my sexual orientation! Before this all I ever doing was being with a girl and loving her and being with her!. My ex which I broke up with I loved her so much and while dating her and going through this she made me happy and whenever I saw her I felt happy! What's weird about this is that it has gotten off and on like for a week it would go off the obsession of me being gay. But I would still check if I would get aroused by gay thoughts. Today I saw a video of a guy that made a video about him realizing he was gay... And that's when I SPIKED HARD! I couldn't breathe cause I could have felt all the anxiety rushing on my spine!! I feel like this is just denial and OCD to be an excuse. I doubt myself that I'm straight and everyday I'm with this damn anxiety! It's torture & hell! I never did wanted to have a relationship with a guy. That to me sounds not like me! This is purely hell! Idk if it is OCD or not. But I do know that I have gotten obsessed over things like getting diabetes when I didn't because my grandma did, having testicular cancer which I don't, getting paralyzed because I hit my neck with a dumbell, and having maleria. Today at school, I went to a social worker and he said it was OCD! And I got relieved their but still the thoughts and fear of becoming gay is their can anyone help ?",
