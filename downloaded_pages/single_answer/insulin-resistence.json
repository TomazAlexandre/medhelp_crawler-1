            "answer": "Yes.\u00a0\u00a0 If your fasting blood sugar levels are between 100 and 125, you most likely have insulin resistance or \"pre-diabetes\".\u00a0\u00a0Once levels go over the 125 mark, you would be diagnosed with full blown diabetes.\"If you have type 2 diabetes your body does not use insulin properly. This is called insulin resistance. At first, your pancreas makes extra insulin to make up for it. But, over time it isn't able to keep up and can't make enough insulin to keep your blood glucose at normal levels.\"http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/type-2/",
