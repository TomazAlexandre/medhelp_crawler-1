    "question": "Last 8 - 9 months, i am seeing my foreskin becoming dried and skin becomes white. there are some small cracks similar to that of cracks in the lips. I have diabetis and this problem has started after I had a intercourse with my wife. At that time, there was a lot of wear and tear of the skin. Since then, the skin is becoming very dry and I am unable to retract the foreskin of my penis to clean my insides of the penis due to this scaling and cracks. The diameter of the opening of foreskin has also shrunk due to this reason. I feel that there is a kind of small inflation on the lower part of the foreskin of the penis.I get a lot of burn sensation while passing urine and am not able to open and clean the penis insides since last 8 months.Need help.",
