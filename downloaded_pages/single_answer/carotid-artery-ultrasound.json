            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The values could be for the carotid artery wall thickening. There is a progression of wall thickening. The wall thickening could occur due to atherosclerosis. Blood vessels are narrowed most commonly due to atherosclerosis, a disease where the 'fatty' material in the blood gets deposited in the walls of the blood vessels. Certain conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking and sedentary lifestyle promote this.Next a Doppler study may be needed to see for the flow in these arteries.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
