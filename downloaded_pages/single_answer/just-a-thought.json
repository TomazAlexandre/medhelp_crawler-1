            "answer": "Hi, I don't think we have met yet!First of all I don't really know anything about nerve biopsies, but I was wondering if your doctor is a neurologist? If so, have you had an LP? Sometimes they check for some viruses in the spinal fluid, but since it has been two\u00a0\u00a0years a virus probally wouln't\u00a0\u00a0show up in blood work or spinal fluid, unless it is still active now! I had a lot of blood work and it all came back netative, and so did my LP!\u00a0\u00a0I did learn one thing though, even if they do blood work and and LP, that doesn't necissarily mean they have checked you for every virus\u00a0\u00a0or condition!\u00a0\u00a0If the doctor doesn't order a certain test for each thing being checked for, then chances are you have not been checked for it!!Diabetes is usually checked by doing a fasting blood sugar test!\u00a0\u00a0This means not having anything to eat or drink after a certain time the night before the blood is drawn! I hope some of these answers help you some, and it is very nice to meet you!Take CareSantana",
