            "answer": "Hello,Numbness on the left side of the body means that there may be an abnormality in the right side of the brain. It can be a neurological pathology like motor neuron disease, TIA or stroke or autoimmune condition like multiple sclerosis in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination. It can be diagnosed by MRI brain and MRS of the brain.Other possibilities are vit B12 deficiency, diabetes (already ruled out in your case) , hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism or peripheral nerve trauma or compression.If numbness is there only on the left half of the body, it means a right side pathology of the brain. So I feel that clinical evaluation from a neurologist is necessary to rule it out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
