            "answer": "Hello,First I'd like to express my condolences for your losses.Your age and the two losses do put you at an increased risk of a subsequent loss.\u00a0\u00a0Without the benefit of understanding the underlying cause of your losses (although this might change after you receive the results of the clotting panel) giving aspirin and progesterone is an unproven therapy (however should not cause harm).It sounds like you are getting great care.\u00a0\u00a0Continue this conversation with your ob/gyn and best wishes.Sincerely,Dr. Downing",

    "question": "Dear Dr. Downing,I hope you can be of some help.\u00a0\u00a0My obgyn history has been very uncomplicated until now.\u00a0\u00a0I was married and had children with my first husband. Uncomplicated pregnancies except for some borderline gestational diabetes controlled by diet. All healthy babies.\u00a0\u00a0My second husband desperately want to have a child together. We are both 38 years old, he has children with his previous wife as well, healthy.\u00a0\u00a0We conceived on the first month after trying to have that pregnancy end in a missed abortion at 11 weeks, baby stopped growing at 11 weeks, no karyotype was done since it was my first loss ever.\u00a0\u00a0We were told to wait one cycle and try again as it was probably a chromosomal thing, we conceived on our first attempt again.\u00a0\u00a0This time I had a subchorionic hemmorhage and bled from 6-12 weeks when it stopped.\u00a0\u00a0All along monitered with serial ultrasounds this baby looked great.\u00a0\u00a0Nuchal translucency and anatomical screening were perfect. We went in for our 13 week us and the baby had died.\u00a0\u00a0Karyotype on this baby showed a normal baby girl with no abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0My OGBYN thinks it's just bad luck, we really want to try again but are very afraid. He has ordered the clotting panel and all of that bloodwork is pending, what are the chances that I could have something like this after delivering healthy children without a hitch?\u00a0\u00a0Do you think we have a chance at a normal pregnancy and is there anything that you would recommend?\u00a0\u00a0My OBGYN wants to put us on progesterone and aspirin once we conceive again, I just feel like there is something else we should do.\u00a0\u00a0I would hate to have our next pregnancy end up the same.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.Jennifer",
