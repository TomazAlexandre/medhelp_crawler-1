            "answer": "I'm not sure why you're considering diabetes as your symptoms don't necessarily suggest it; does it run in your family? It sounds like you should see your OB/GYN regarding the problem with your period as there may be some reason you are not getting it (assuming you are not pregnant of course!).If there is something else you are not mentioning that leads you to wonder about diabetes you can see if you know someone with a glucometer or if they test at a pharmacy. If not, and there is a reason to suspect diabetes you do want to see a doctor.",
