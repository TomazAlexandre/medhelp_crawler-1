            "answer": "Hi and welcome,You may not realise but only a couple of days ago in the diabetes community you actually describe the sensation and location a little different....\"Since yesterday I've been having a on and off itchy light burning on my middle finger or index fingers and also the same with my left foot with just my big toe.it's no numbness or anything like pin and needles but.it's a weird feeling\"but now your saying...\"for the past 3 days I've been getting a tingling in a couple of my toes and some of my fingers. There isn't any numbness there but just the tingling sensation with a little burning nothing major\"It's 'possible' you're overly thinking about minor-normal-temporary sensations and with the help of googling symptoms, it's leading you to unnecessarily worry about the more serious medical explanations your reading about whilst skipping over all the more likely and minor ones.The most common explanation for those specific fingers and big toe sensations is actually nerve compression ie middle and index finger sensations are associated with carpel tunnel syndrome and the most common cause of toe sensations is direct compression of the nerves of the foot from footwear.......you are an athletic basketball player, minor irritation of nerves, tendons, muscles etc in the hands and feet of basketball players due to impact and repetition is very common.You also said...\"My doctor said it was stress. He didn't say anxiety because it takes about takes about 6 months to diagnose. I do worry about stuff often and maybe that's what's causing it\"....i'm not sure where your getting the idea mental health conditions like anxiety takes around 6 months to dx, a mental health assessment with a psychiatrist or psychologist can definitely dx anxiety related conditions on your first appointment.IF you are aware you often worry, then there definitely would be the potential of your general anxiety becoming\u00a0\u00a0more specific and centred towards your health. I'd highly recommend a mental health assessment with a psychiatrist or psychologist, it would be well worth considering if your family dr is saying it's anxiety so you can learn all the tips, tricks and life skills to help change your tomorrows...hope that helps........JJ",

    "question": "Hi I'm a 19 year old basketball player, I'm pretty fit and never had health issues until about 2 months ago the start of summer. I was so stressed out it got to the point of having pains in my chest, heart palpitations.\u00a0\u00a0I finally went to the doctor and he told me it was anxiety, perfect ekg and all. The symptoms went away quick after About two weeks. I went about a month without symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The heart palpitations slowly for some reason came back. I didn't make a big deal about it because I knew what it wasWell for the past 3 days I've been getting a tingling in a couple of my toes and some of my fingers. There isn't any numbness there but just the tingling sensation with a little burning nothing major. Mom bought me a glucose meter to test blood levels everything was perfect. So now I'm back to square one....me searching up my symptoms it narrowed it down to anxiety or Ms. Nobody in my family has this and this is my first time hearing about ms. Im praying and hope this is anxiety just relapsing again. It seems like Ms would destroy my basketball career and I go back in a couple weeks. I must say the tingling is mostly in toes on my left foot and the tingling in fingers go away for a while. I have no numbness anywhere no diarrhea no blurry vision.\u00a0\u00a0The tingling isn't enough to keep me up at night but it's very alarming, help!!! Is this anxiety again",
