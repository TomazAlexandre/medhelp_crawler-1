            "answer": "Nausea can be attributed to a number of things including diabetes. Without seeing the results of an thorough medical evaluation it is difficult to determine the cause/s. If I read you question correctly, \"stage\" should be replaced by glucose [blood sugar] levels, how diabetes is \"measured\". One can test at home [purchase test meters at a drug store, Wal-Mart, etc], at a doctors office, or hospital lab.These are your measured test levels:Normal is 60/70 to 99 mg/dlPrediabetes is 100 to 125 mg/dlDiabetes is above 126 mg/dlIf you do fall into the diabetic levels, I suggest you read other forum threads to grasps the lifestyle changes needed in order to halt the progression of this disease, and, most\u00a0\u00a0important, how to take control and manage your diabetes. Good luck",
