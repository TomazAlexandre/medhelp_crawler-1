            "answer": "your thyroid levels are normal, so at this point there is not an indication for thyroid hormone treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Granted, the symptoms are suggestive of hypothyroidism but research studies show that only 30% of patients with classic symptoms actually have thyroid disease - so the symptoms are not specific to thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0To complete the thyroid testing, would look at thyroid antibodies (TPO and Tg) - if positive, then there may be an early thyroid problem, but it is probably not be the only explanation for the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Pre-diabetes causes similar symptoms - so if the weight gain is mostly abdominal and there is a family history of diabetes, this may be the more likely culprit.",

    "question": "Hello, I wondered if the doctor could help and advise me, I am a 35 year old female, who has for the last 12 years had some hypothyroid symptoms, I struggle with my weight and am currently about 200 pounds (I'm 5'6) although at my lightest after a two year struggle of starvation and exercise only managed to get to 168 pounds, I eat a healthy well balanced diet, and exercise regularly. My other symptoms are depression, dry skin and hair, fatigue, brittle and split nails, Allergies, low sex drive, bloating and puffiness/water retention, and I am constantly cold I regularly sit at home with the central heating on wearing a jumper and a blanket, whilst my husband wears only a T-shirt!. I do suffer from an ectopic heartbeat and palpitation's(this may not be related). Both my maternal grandmother and my mother have hypothyroidism and are medicated for this, I have had numerous bloot test and they are always 'normal' the latest being T4 level 13.5 and TSH 2.16, I really dont want to spend the rest of my life waiting until my levels are not 'normal' as I believe age can have an impact on test results, my doctor is reasonably sympathetic but just thinks I eat too much, I live in the UK where you can only get prescription medication from your doctor, please help what should I do.",
