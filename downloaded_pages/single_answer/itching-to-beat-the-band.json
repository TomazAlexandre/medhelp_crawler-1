            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Your symptoms of a severe itchy scalp could also be due to psoriasis. Psoriasis is an auto immune disorder that can cause a dry itchy scalp . Genetic and immunologic theories have been predicted as causes for psoriasis. Metabolic disorders like diabetes and hypothyroidism can aggravate the symptoms. Treatment is with cortisone based creams, which need to be very potent and of increased strength to heal the itchy scalp. Apply constantly plenty of good moisturizing creams and alternate with steroid creams. Use a humidifier in the rooms to avoid dryness. Phototherapy for psoriasis is advocated for lesions not responding to topical ointments.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
