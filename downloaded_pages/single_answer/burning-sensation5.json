    "question": "I have been with my boyfriend for about 7 months now and we regulary have intercourse. Recently I had a really bad case of thrush and took the canesten tablet to cure it. About 4 weeks later i got cystitis and treated that and now 6 weeks after the first dose of thrush i am experiencing a burning sensation around the vagina! I considered getting another treatment for thrush as i did before but a friend told me you should not take them more than twice a year?I have never suffered with these type of issues before. Any idea what it could be and what treatment to take? It isnt an std as we have both been checked!Thanks",
