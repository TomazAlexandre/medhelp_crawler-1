Besides heart disease, conditions like anemia, diabetes or thyroid disorders can cause the symptoms described by you. These can be diagnosed by a simple blood test. Also, inner ear disorders can cause symptoms of dizziness. Please consult your doctor at the earliest, he will work up to detect the cause for your symptoms for appropriate therapy. Good luck. Regards.",
