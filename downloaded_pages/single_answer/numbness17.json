            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Numbness at finger tips is generally due to nerve compression or a nerve disorder. Depending on which finger it is, it can be carpel tunnel syndrome, compression of ulnar nerve, compression of radial nerve. Diabetes or hypothyroidism too can be the cause. It could also be that you hit your finger somewhere causing temporary numbness. Very cold climate, peripheral vascular disease, panic disorder, leprosy, alcoholic neuropathy, compression of cervical spinal nerves, are the other causes. It is difficult to comment beyond this on net without examining you and a detailed history. Please consult your PCP to begin with and get a referral for a neurologist.Take care!",
