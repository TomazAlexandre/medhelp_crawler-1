    "question": "hello, i'm a 19 y.o. female, and for the past 3 months i have been experiencing frequent urination. i'm sexually active. it all started three months ago when my boyfriend (too much info, i know) went down on me. ever since that day i have been experiencing itching around my vagina. i have also experienced a burning sensation in my vagina whenever i shower or urinate. however, this only lasted about a week, and the burning sensation stopped. after it stopped, however, i have been going to the bathroom literally 3 times every hour every single day. i figured it was a UTI so i went to the doctors (4/18/14) and got checked for it. the doc prescribed me medicine and it worked wonderfully for two days, but (again i know, too much information) my boyfriend and i had oral sex while i'm on medication. a couple of hours later that day i experienced itching around my vagina again. and after that, i started to urinate frequently AGAIN, when it subsided yesterday/two days ago. the UTI medicine seem to have stopped working as well...so my question is, what could this be?? did i reactivate my UTI while on medication from having oral sex? :/or is this a symptom of diabetes?? i'm not experiencing frequent thirst..note: before i was prescribed UTI medication i urinated frequently but it was in small volume. now i have been passing urine w/ normal/large volume--i urinate about 3-4 times every hour..i have also noticed CLEAR (not brown) sand-like particles in my urine....",
