            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum, there can be possibility of drug allergy to lexapro but it is not common. Some patients have reported to have itching, rash and development of hives. This can be managed by anti histamines. The later symptoms can be due to delayed reaction and can be managed by corticosteroids and pain killers.Another possibility is it can be due to deficiency of vitamin B12. It is a type of neuropathy. The other possibilities are diabetes, alcoholism, mal absorption syndrome etc. This can be prevented by taking meat liver which is a rich source. Otherwise oral and injectable preparations are available. I suggest you to consult physician for further evaluation and treatment. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "first time I took Lexapro was two nights ago.within about an hour or soof my first dose,my left hand started itching really bad, my rt. hand was only a little. I got up, washed my hands,put on some lotion w/ zylocain in it, but it didnt help.later I took a benadryl, which helped so I could sleep. it has been two days, and my hands are stiff, swollen, and feel like I layed my fingers on a hot grill and feel like they\u00a0\u00a0are burned. I have very sensitive/fragile skin& allergies. since the only thing different in my week was te lexapro, I believe that is what caused the problem. Is this a common side effect of lexapro?",
