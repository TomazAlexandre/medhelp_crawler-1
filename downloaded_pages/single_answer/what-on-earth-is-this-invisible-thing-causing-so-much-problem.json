    "question": "I've had a itching in my scrotum for about 6 weeks now . Went the doctors on the 2nd week when the itching continued and he asked me to use OTC fungal cream and take antihistamines plus the jock itch\u00a0\u00a0cream ? Is it diabetes or some other illness related just this scrotum itching ? No other symptoms apart from itching in the scrotum No spots or marks just the random itch for 6 weeks now. When I put some OTC powder there is some relief . I clean down there, change my cotton boxers everyday and keep it clean . The itch is only in some areas and same area of scrotum.What else could it be apart from fungal and has my doctor diagnosed this right ? is it signs of testicular cancer or diabetes symptoms of\u00a0\u00a0itching. Should I go back to doctor who will observe again and say its nothing visible ? Please advise ?",
