Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I'm so grateful if someone actually had a good answer for me. It all started in September, I was in Costa Rica for one week and the last day I've had a shower by the beach cause we were already on our way to the airport. I started itching immediately in the car and it continued till I got back to L.A. I had a good scrub shower but the itchy, tingly feeling was still there. Like little things were under my skin. I saw my dermatologist and even though she's great, she could'n find any cause. I did demand on putting on some cream which gets ride of mites, well I thought I had itchy mites. I did acupuncture and they gave me some anti fungus treatment. Since then it comes and goes and I even had my dogs treated, the carpets steam cleaned and so on. Last week I went on a little retreat to Ojai and I've had zero itches, last night it stared again. Is it a allergy? Is it anxiety (I thought I was pretty relaxed last night and I'm aware). Do the toxins find maybe there way out trough the skin and nervous system? I'm going to detox, I already changed my diet to a very simple one to get ready.I want to be positive and not think about it, not even meditation helps.Anyone?Thanks so much!!!Yvonne",
