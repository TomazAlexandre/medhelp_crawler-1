            "answer": "Hello,Synthroid itself as a medication does not often cause erratic blood sugars , but the shift in thyroid hormone levels(that happen when you take any thyroid hormone medication) may do so. Weight changes may occur as well as changes in appetite, all of which also affect blood sugars. It should settle out soon, but keep a close eye on it in the interim.Take care.",
