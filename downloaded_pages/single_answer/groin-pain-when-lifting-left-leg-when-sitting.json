            "answer": "Hi!It is difficult to assess the cause of pain. Pain in the front portion of hip (groin), thigh and knee can be due superficial nerve compression (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve), that comes from the hip area and gets pinched. This condition is called meralgia paresthetica and is often due to weight gain or wearing tight clothes and belts. Losing some weight or wearing loose clothes and belts often helps relieve the pain/numbness/tingling. Also injection of lignocaine (anesthetic agent) at the site helps. In your case you can apply a pain reliever at the site. Keep a hot water bottle/heating pad while sleeping and apply a local analgesic cream. Other possibilities are vascular pathologies such as deep vein thrombosis and clots and will need a dopplar study. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme's and lupus are the other possibilities. It can also be spinal nerve compression in lower back.It can also be a joint pathology. Sharp groin and hip pain with limited and painful internal rotation of the thigh (as you would need to lift a leg on to the other) along with tingling can be due to several causes such as: osteoarthritis, tendonitis, muscle pull and strain, femoral neck stress fractures, sports hernia or hidden/occult hernia of oblique aponeurosis, or Obturator or ilioinguinal nerve entrapment. You would need all or any of the following for diagnosis: Clinical examination by an orthopedic specialist, X-rays, blood tests, MRI or ultrasonnography.You need to consult your general doctor and you may need to consult either an ortho specialist or a neurologist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
