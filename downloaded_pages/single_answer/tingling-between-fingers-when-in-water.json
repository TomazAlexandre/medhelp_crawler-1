    "question": "This is difficult to describe but here goes:\u00a0\u00a0For the past month or so, when I take a shower, or wash dishes, the inside of my fingers (between the fingers) feels like there are grains of sand between them.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like when someone has soaked their hands in water for a long time - and get wrinkly - but in my case, this sensation of sand between the fingers happens after 3-4 mins.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure if this is a concern or not but i knew that it wouldn't hurt to ask the question.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned or is this just some sensitivity issue that comes with age..?\u00a0\u00a0I'm 42.\u00a0\u00a0Any input would be great.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much :)",
