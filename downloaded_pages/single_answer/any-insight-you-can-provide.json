            "answer": "Sorry to hear about your symptoms. It is understandable that you are concerned about MS as you are a young woman with neurological symptoms. It should be however reassuring that the MRI in 96 was normal. One thing you could do would be to see a neurologist for a formal examination, just to make sure everything is ok and that nothing has changed since the prior MRI. They can then decide whether or not further imaging is warranted based on your clinical history and exam findings. Other simple things to consider are diabetes and thyroid problems, both of which can be evaluated with blood tests. Start with a neurologist and go from there. Good luck.",

    "question": "About 5 years ago, I developed sudden pins and needles in my left arm. The tingling eventually appeared in my right arm, fingertips, toes, face, and my head. It is not limited to one side and tends to wax and wane, appearing one day and lasting up to a week, then disappearing for weeks again. I went to see my doctor who referred my to a neurologist. I had an MRI in 1996 and the results were fine. I was very concerned about M.S., but felt reassured by the tests.I do occasionally have bouts of mild dizziness and light-headedness, though I would not regard it as a chronic problem. Sometimes I get a weakness or heaviness in both arms.I am 30 years old and do take the birth control pill, so I have some concerns about stroke, but my blood pressure is tested regulary and is normal. I also do not smoke.Last year, the tingling came on quite strong and seemed to be focused on my head. It would appear out of the blue-I went to see my doctor again, who ordered a battery of blood and urine tests. Everything was fine.I also occasionally get a burning sensation on my head...not hot to the touch, but a sensation of a patch of heat. It is not painful, just an odd sensation. Does this have any link with the other symptoms?I have generally accepted these symptoms as one of my bodies quirks, but I do still get a nagging fear that something is wrong and I could be doing something about it. I can't tell you how many times I've thought I was having a stroke because of the tingling.Any information you could offer would be so appreciated. Do you think I should be worried?",
