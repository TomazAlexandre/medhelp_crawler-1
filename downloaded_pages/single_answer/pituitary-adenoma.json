    "question": "Hi, I am a 54 year old woman who was diagnosed with a pituitary adenoma 11 years ago. I had gained about 15 lbs that I couldn 't lose, but after being put on dostinex, the weight came off. I have been between 115 and 125 my whole adult life. I have not been on dostinex for the last 3 years. My weight has climbed to 145 although my diet has not changed. I even joined a gym 6 months ago and do 30 minutes of cardio 5 days a week and weight training 4 days. I have not lost a pound. I tried the Atkins diet for a month and didn't even lose water weight. Recently, I had some blood work done. My prolactin was at 40 (it has never been higher than low 100's). TSH was .91 (range .4 - 4.5)\u00a0\u00a0 T3 237(range 230 -420) T4 2.5 (range .8 - 2.7). My doctor says these results are fine but they seem to be at the ends of the ranges and along with not being able to lose weight, I am profoundly consitpated(a colonoscopy showed I have almost no peristalsis, I have low energy and feel weak and my eyes have become puffy, my skin itchs\u00a0\u00a0and my hair is shedding. My fasting sugar was 97 with a range of 65-99. I had gestational diabetes in my 20's. It seems strange that my tsh and t3 are on the low end, yet t4 is towards the high end of the range. Does this make sense to you?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your help. Lynn",
