            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your daughter\u2019s medical problems. The symptoms could be due to fibromyalgia, electrolyte imbalance, hormonal imbalance, Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. A pinched nerve can also be the cause. Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility. Please discuss this with your daughter\u2019s specialist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

This happened twice. We took a brain scan and it came up clean. The following week she began experiencing\u00a0\u00a0shocks running through he body, as it she were being electrocuted. Today\u00a0\u00a0she suffered some kind of seizure, not an epileptic seizure, because\u00a0\u00a0she\u00a0\u00a0was fully aware if everything happening around her during the episode.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors seem not to be able to find out what is wrong with her.
