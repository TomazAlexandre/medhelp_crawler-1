            "answer": "Hello,I also answered you on the other post.Given that he is thin and losing weight rapidly, he could possibly have type 1 not type 2 diabetes, which needs to be treated with insulin.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors can test for this using antibody tests and also by check his c-pepide levels (this gives an indication of how much insulin his body is producing).It is possible for an adult to have type 1 and to develop this suddenly as an adult.\u00a0\u00a0 Please ask the Drs about this.\u00a0\u00a0If they will not consider type 1 and treat for it, would recommend looking for a third opinion.Are they treating him with insulin considering his blood sugars are still so high?",

    "question": "My husband is currently in hospital for about a week, because he have been diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic. We changed doctors because the first doctor could not get his HnA1C down from 25-26 in 4 days in hospital. The new doctor got it down to 17-21, but it is still going up and down alot. He is still in hospital but are starting to worry about his job, the financial impact this is going to have, and what if he does go up again, and so on. We live about 1hr away from the nearest doctor. Why are the struggling to get it down.",
