            "answer": "In my experience, most anti depressants/anxiety meds cause weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0I was on lexapro and gained 15 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Tried paxil then celexa-same thing.\u00a0\u00a0My whole life I have been naturally very thin but this med made me gain weight like crazy! Since i've been off them, i'm, for the most part, back to my normal weight.\u00a0\u00a0Docs will \"beat around the bush\" about the weight gain with pills.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of people need the meds, but in my case, I feel the side effects (and not only weight gain) cause more problems that what the pill is supposed to fix.\u00a0\u00a0Not to mention, I have a hard time takin most docs seriously as my friend's father is a dentist and gets many offers/perks from pill companies if he precribes their meds. Being an honest man, he doesn't just precribe a pill to a patient for a free vacation.\u00a0\u00a0Really think about what helps you the most-sometimes a certain combination of pills can cause even more side effects.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!!",

    "question": "hello,i have been on cymbalta for about 2 years now. I was previously on effexor for about 7 years and then tried lexapro . i have gained alot of weight about 30 lbs, and i was wondering if this is because of me being 27 or because of the cymbalta? my doc said that cymbalta causes weight gain and even leads to diabetes, but my shrink said she hasnt heard of that. i also currently take 1 mg of ativan a day, could this be contributing?thanks",
