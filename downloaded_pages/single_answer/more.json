    "question": "Hello,Thanks for your reply. Sorry it took me so long to reply back because I didn't recieve any notificaitons that this topic had been posted about. I don't receive any drugs or meds of any kinds for anything and have not lost any weight recently or tested for diabetes but I did use one of the at home ones and my blood sugar was fine and a blood test had showed there was no hypothyroidism. I am a 29 year old female and cannot take any drugs that will benefit with any of this.This discussion is related to/posts/Digestive-Disorders---Gastroenterology/abdominal-pain--bloting-etc/show/1592184.",
