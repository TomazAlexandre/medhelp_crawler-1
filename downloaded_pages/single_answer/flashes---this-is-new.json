    "question": "I'll do my best to keep this short and sweet.I had my normal yearly eye exam early this year (Marchish), in which they said my eyes are totally okay, no sign of any diseases, etc. A few days later I started seeing floaters for the first time ever. Since they were new to me, I went back and had another retinal exam to put off any worry about detachments or tears and they said that everything looked fine, and in people with severe myopia (as I have) floaters are pretty standard affair.Fast forward to this last week, I've started having fairly regular flashes in my field of vision. Nothing as strong as a camera flash, but if I go into a completely dark room and leave the lights off, I can usually identify a pinprick of light that comes and goes, and I have since begun to notice other random flashes every few minutes or so. Sometimes as a pinprick, other times as \"lightning\". It's been difficult identifying any sort of pattern to these, as they do not linger the way a camera flash or other bright light does in your vision. The only time I do not notice them is if I'm doing something that consumes the whole of my focus (such as playing a game or something).Presumably this is another normal thing with people with Myopia, but I feel like I should probably get my retinas looked at again. I have not had anything like a sudden dramatic increase in the number of floaters or the dreaded \"drawing curtain\" or any temporary vision loss. However, it bears noting that I have been having trouble with my brand-new contacts for awhile this year, where I have double vision while wearing them, though everything appears fine when I switch back to my years old glasses.As I said, I think I should probably go see an Opthamologist again and have another retinal examination to be sure. What I'm wondering at this point is if I should be rushing to get there ASAP or if scheduling an appointment whenever it's convenient is acceptable.I do have mild hypertension (130/75 on average BP, controlled with medication: Micardis), and I have been screened for Diabetes this year and have a damn-near perfect Fasting Blood Sugar.",
