            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. This looks like an episode of transient ischemic attack wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. Again this can be due to low oxygen supply to brain where the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off generally due to a spasm of the arteries, or a clot or high blood pressure causing micro leaks in the brain.The symptoms include temporary loss of sensation in any part of the body, black outs, vision loss, tingling, loss of function of a limb, pain etc. It is common in people with high blood pressure, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and high cholesterol. Hence all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc.Generally this can happen several times before an actual stroke happens. This is a warning sign for the body. If you have such episodes, then you must get them evaluated immediately.The other possibility is \u2018benign intracranial hypertension\u2019(BIH). This happens due to impaired CSF absorption. A generalized throbbing headache worst felt in the morning and last thing at night. This headache is generally relieved on standing (consistent with raised intracranial pressure). It is aggravated by straining, coughing or a change in position. This headache is accompanied by various neurological symptoms such as dizziness, numbness, loss of vision, loss of hearing etc, all of which are temporary.It can also be epilepsy, having a negative EEG does not rule out epilepsy. So, if you do not have TIA and BIH then epilepsy should be considered. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have been having quick blackouts that last 5-15 seconds, when they happen i loose my vision, coordination, balance, and my arms and legs loose feeling and feel like the pins and needles sensation. Most of the time i have no idea what im doing when they happen even though j have full memory of the event. Recently i had two episodes where my vision gradually but quickly goes white and a friend said my pupils were dilating and constricting very quickly. I have also had a stabbing pain behind my left eye and pressure headaches behind both. I have had 3 seizures before these symptoms and during the 3rd i fell and hit the right side of my head my head. A month after i hit my head i noticed that my vision goes doubled when i look to my right. I would just like to know if any of these symptoms are related and if so what do they mean. I had a ekg after my 1st seizure and was reported negative for epilepsy.",
