            "answer": "Hi Balu,Are there other signs or symptoms present? Diabetic neuropathies are a family of nerve disorders caused by diabetes. People with diabetes can, over time, develop nerve damage such as peripheral neuropathy, the most common type of diabetic neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0This presents with pain or loss of feeling in the toes, feet, legs, hands, and arms. Sometimes numbness or insensitivity to pain or temperature; tingling, burning, or prickling sensation; sharp pains or cramps; and\u00a0\u00a0loss of balance and coordination are also associated. The first treatment step is to bring blood glucose levels within the normal range to help prevent further nerve damage. Blood glucose monitoring, meal planning, physical activity, and diabetes medicines or insulin may help control blood glucose levels. It would be best to see your doctor for further evaluation and management. This link may be of help: http://www.diabetesmonitor.com/b96.htmTake care and keep us posted.",
