    "question": "Just thought I would share. I just got back from my nephrologist and my GFR went from 65 to 73! I am so excited. So in the space of a year and a few months, being on the kidney diet, it has gone from GFR 54 to GFR 73. So if your doctor gives you a diet to follow - listen to them! I will probably need to be on the diet my whole life otherwise my GFR will drop again, but compared to kidney failure a diet change is no biggy!",
