            "answer": "Hi,How are you? What other symptoms are present? Do you have history of diabetes? If there is no history of trauma or injury, the hot spot or burning sensation may be caused by neurological or vascular\u00a0\u00a0issues, as well as possible allergic reaction. Antihistamine medications may help provide relief if it is allergy in nature. If it persists, additional diagnostic tests may need to be done for proper evaluation. Direct clinical examination and your medical history are important considerations. Take care and do keep us posted.",
