            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Since you have a high blood pressure and take medication for it, there is a chance that your blood pressure falls suddenly in between causing dizziness. Cervical spine related problems have been looked into in your case. You also need to get your ear examined by a specialist as ear problems can also cause dizziness.Other causes of dizziness are anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes.Certain types of epilepsies and seizures too can cause similar symptoms. If you have an accompanying headache then you must also look at benign intracranial hypertension. Heart problems too should be ruled out in your case. If all other tests are normal, maybe an ECHO should be done to rule out mitral valve prolapse.It is difficult to comment without examination. I am just enumerating the possible causes. You can discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 24 years old and I am dealing with the same things. Headaches in the back of my head, some neck pain and dizziness. The dizziness is the feeling of being unbalanced and feeling like im going to fall over not really spinning. The doctors really cant find anything wrong with me. Ive had MRI and CT scan of my head, X rays for my chest pain, everything and everything comes out normal. I do have high blood pressure but thats about it. My girlfriend of 4 years left me because I was unable to work and drive. I am back living with my dad now. I am taking Varapamil, and trying different high blood pressure pills but nothing is really changing. I dont know what to do and all of this is making me depressed and stressed which probably isnt helping me any. It would be nice to be able to talk to people that have the same thing as I do and figure out what is wrong with me and get my life back to the way it was a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0I see other people have posted things on here and i will mention their suggestions to my doctor the next time i see them. I just really need some help and answers to see if anyone has gotten better and lives a normal life.",
