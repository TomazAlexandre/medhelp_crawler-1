            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The progression depends on the pathology in the liver. Certain conditions like cancers progress fast. The most probable cause for loss of sensation in feet is neuropathy, a disorder of the nerves. Most common cause is diabetes. To prevent this, he will have to take medications regularly and check his blood sugars to ensure it is in the normal range of 80-120mg/dl. Strict adherence to a diabetic diet and regular exercise will further help to reduce blood sugars.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
