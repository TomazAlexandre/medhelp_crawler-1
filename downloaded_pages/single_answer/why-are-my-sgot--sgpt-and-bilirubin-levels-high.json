            "answer": "Biribulin values are given in mg/dl and there are 2 differentones. One for direct or conjugated Biribulin and another one for Total Biribulin. We also need the lab ref. ranges, as they vary from lab to lab, including for the SGPT and SGOT,which seem to be slightly above range and high normalrespectively, according to most labs' ranges I have used.I suggest you optimize your diet (less carbs, more organic vegetables & fruit, more healthy oils, less pro-inflammatory oils, more quality protein including pastured/grass-fed/free-range meats and poultry, no or low mercury fish and somelegumes, seeds & nuts. Give a preference to fresh, organicand with the least processing possible!Continue your fitness program, lose some kgs, avoid stress(its toxic at a physical level as well, causing unwanted physical symptoms) and repeat your liver function tests in 3 months. You are welcome to post the findings, when you get the results then, as they can indicate a trend/patternor to see if your lifestyle changes have made a difference.Consider taking a liver support/tonic supplement.I personally take undenatured whey protein, which containsprecursors for Glutathione synthesis.Glutathione is the body's master anti-oxidant and detoxify-erwhich also helps keep the JNK gene\u00a0\u00a0dormant.An activated JNK gene eventually leads to the development and onset of serious diseases, like Cancer, Diabetes, Depression,Schizophrenia, Fibromyalgia....Looking forward to your reply.Please note that my comments are not intended as a substitute for medical advice.Best wishes,Niko",

    "question": "I am a 22 year old male who does not drink or smoke(have never done either). I am rather overweight(84kg weight, 1.73m height). My Bilirubin levels are 0.9(mg%), SGPT is 67U/L and SGOT is 38U/L. Other indicators like cholestrol, triglycerides, fasting blood sugar, HDL and LDL are well within range.I have not faced any other symptoms like abdominal pain. fatigue etc.I also have started engaging in lots of physical activity quite recently(from none earlier), including cycling daily for 5km, swimming for about 1 hour etc. I read somewhere that sudden increases in physical activity might also lead to raised SGPT/sGOT levels.Or Is this just because of fat deposition around the liver?",
