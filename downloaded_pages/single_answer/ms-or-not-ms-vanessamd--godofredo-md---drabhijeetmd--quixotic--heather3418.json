    "question": "Hi, as you all know I am a 25 year female from Southeastern Georgia..Next week makes an entire year of unanswered questions, pain & fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0At onset I felt a lot of numbness and tingling in my right leg that would persist for hours out of the day. Then it came a point when my leg stayed this way for weeks..Symptom after symptom would appear, not all at once..But each time it felt like I was going through a relapse the current symptoms would worsen and others would show their ugly face..I remember two different times (lasting a few days) where I would arise from bed hoping to go to work, but instead all I could do was sit on the sit of the bed crying..I found that I could barely walk, and that I had started burning, and the burning pain was unbearable.My current symptoms are:Burning pain (in muscles including chest), pins and needles feeling, numbness, decreased muscular control, stiffness, swelling, major fatigue (Mental & Physical), malaise, major depression, headaches (Migraines?), irritability & anxiousness, tingling sensations (entire body including head), shaky right hand, painful cramps & spasms, inability to feel when injury happens, Chronic Urinary Tract Infections from urinary retention?\u00a0\u00a0Bothered by noises and lights, back pain, muscle weakness, symptoms severity increased with heat, body can feel heat or burning without any apparent heat near body, constant state of tiredness, extra tension in arms and legs with usage, chronic indigestion, frustration, heaviness in the trunk of my back.My PCP noticed an inability to distinguish between sharp and dull sticks on my right side, after sticking me 30 times on both sides, as well as poor muscle control.\u00a0\u00a0At my last appointment he noticed an abnormal babinski reflex on my right side.\u00a0\u00a0He also stated that I had hyperreflexia, hyporeflexia, and hyper spasticity.\u00a0\u00a0At my last appointment with him, he noticed that while hitting my elbow with the mallet, my right hand did not move, and on my left side my thumb barely moved. After the reflex test, he preceeded to stick me with an object this time wanting me to tell him whether I felt it or not..In some areas I had no problem feeling, in some areas it was less noticeable, and in others I had no feeling.\u00a0\u00a0And he said that he was actually stabbing my skin.\u00a0\u00a0He says that my problems are definetly lateralized.. My Rheumy noted extreme thickening and tightening in my skin on the right side...Could all of the symptoms be associated?\u00a0\u00a0If Neurological, what would your main concerns be?\u00a0\u00a0What diagnostics tools would you use to make a diagnosis?\u00a0\u00a0I have accrued over $40,000 worth of medical bills and still have no clue on what may be causing my problems..I currently have this diagnoses: fibromyalgia, hypermobility syndrome, myoclonus, neuropathy, spinal stenosis, early mild disc degenerative disease, early mild disc desiccation, kyphosis, scoliosis, osteopenia, anemia, & a B-12/iron deficiency.I have family history of diabetes, hypertension, no injuries to my head or neck..I also have suffered from forgetfulness, weakness, and faintness..I have no family history of stroke.I have now been referred to a group of Neurologists at Emory Healthcare by both my Neuro and PCP..I am very nervous and have some time to feel that way, my appointment is on January 31st.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid that I will be told yet again that they are unsure of what could by the culprit.\u00a0\u00a0What could be causing these problems?\u00a0\u00a0Also could exposure to excessive mold and mildew cause some of my symptoms and or conditions?\u00a0\u00a0I began working at our local school three years ago, and began staying sick from colds, sinus infections, bronchitis, pneumonitis, and mononucleosis.",
