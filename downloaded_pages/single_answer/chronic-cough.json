            "answer": "I'm not a doctor, best advice is to seek out a large (preferably teaching) medical center and start with an internist/family medicine type of doctor. From there he could be referred to allergist, ENT doc, etc.If you're in northern NJ, he may want to pop into NYC... e.g. NYU Medical Center, Mt. Sinai.etc.Phil",

    "question": "I am asking this for my dad. He is 64. He has several health conditions-including diabetes, high blood pressure and a problem with his ear canals-hes losing his hearing bc the ear canals are so small-they fill with fluid. he has to get his ears drained all the time to hear.\u00a0\u00a0but he has been having this re-occurring problem in the last two years where he starts coughing-where he cannot stop and the cough sounds like it evolves into a gagging sound. He also complains that with the cough-he gets a constant stuffy nose. The doctor will give him an antibiotic but it always comes back after a short period of time.\u00a0\u00a0he by the way is a nonsmoker.\u00a0\u00a0I think he may have some sort of allergy. The cough keeps him awake and there is no green or yellow mucus..only the clear phlem. Do you have any suggestions! Thank You. Marisa C. NJ",
