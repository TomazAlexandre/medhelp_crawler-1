            "answer": "Hi,Your report of lipid profile is not that bad. There are various types of cholesterols which are assessed through the lipid profile and they are indicative of any abnormalities which can be a risk factor for the deposition of atherosclerotic plaque in the blood vessels. For e.g. HDL is known as the \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d as it\u2019s responsible for taking away the lipids deposited in the blood vessels to the liver and thus it acts like a brush to clean up the vessels and normally in adult males it should be > 45mg/dl. Anything less than this value is not good and the way to increase it is through exercise. Similarly, we have the bad cholesterol which is the LDL and Triglycerides which should be < 130 (< 100 if a patient has got diabetes/heart disease) and < 150 respectively. I see that they are okay.Overall, you need not worry much about your lipid profile report. You don\u2019t need any medications to correct the same in my opinion. You need to exercise regularly and avoid smoking if you do.Mild concentric hypertrophy is basically seen in patients due to hypertension. In this, the heart walls become thickened as now the heart has to pump blood against increased pressure. It\u2019s like heart being more muscular but this is not a good sign in the long run. Nothing much to worry but simultaneously you need to ensure to control your blood pressure so that it doesn\u2019t worsen in future.I hope that helps. Please keep me posted. Take care.",
