            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you have diabetes then the pain numbness and tingling could be due to diabetes. Keeping bloods sugar under control and taking multiple vitamin supplements. This could also be due to pinched spinal nerves in the lumbar region. The treatment is to remove the compression. You have to discuss the best treatment option with a neurologist, which can range from medication to physiotherapy to traction, lumbar belts or even surgery.Alternatively you can visit a chiropractor or a physical therapist and learn some exercises which you can do to relieve the compression.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
