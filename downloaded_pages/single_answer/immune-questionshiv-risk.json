            "answer": "Relax.\u00a0\u00a0First, the infections you describe do not suggest anything abnomral with your immune system.\u00a0\u00a0UTIs are common in women, and they often increase in frequency for unexplained reasons.\u00a0\u00a0Same for yeast infections.\u00a0\u00a0Second, when HIV impairs immunity, it results in different kinds of infections, not just garden variety UTI or yeast.\u00a0\u00a0Equally important, the risk you were infected with HIV is low; EMTs and medical personnel have no higher rates of HIV than the general population.\u00a0\u00a0And oral sex carries zero to minmial risk for HIV transmission, even if one partner is infected.Just have an HIV test. The risks and symptoms you describe are not the reason; you should do it only because it is on your mind and you're obviously going to worry about it until you know you have had a negative test result. Home Access testing is fine.\u00a0\u00a0Or just have a test by your family doctor.Good luck--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

    "question": "Hi, and Thank you for taking the time to read my question. I am a 39 year old woman in a monogamous relationship with my husband of 14 years. We engaged in swinging 3 times about 4 years ago. I had protected vaginal intercourse with another man twice, and unprotected oral with the same man (not my husband) twice (not to completion). This man was an EMT so though his risk I would assume was higher, I would also assume he was tested regularly for HIV exposure. I also had unprotected oral with a female stripper whose status was unknown ( I was the giver). This last incidents duration was less than 5 minutes, my husband also had unprotected oral with the same woman.Its been 4 years since this has happened. My\u00a0\u00a0husband has ED due to advanced diabetes, so in the last 4 years I would say we managed to have intercourse 3 times. He recently tested negative for HIV (insurance purposes).The reason Im concerned is because in the last year I seem to have some immune issues coming up. Ive started to have very regular UTI's, about once monthly. This continued until I started on a cranberry supplement twice daily. Its been a year since my last one, though if I miss the cranberry for more than 2 days I get a UTI. In addition, I got shingles last November, it was a very mild case, but shingles none the less. Now yeast infections seem to be the problem. I should also mention that I have had prior to my marriage I had an HIV test which was negative. Outside the swinging my husband and I have been faithful to eachother.So, of course the big question,should I be worried and should I test? Also, how do you feel about the Home Access test?",
