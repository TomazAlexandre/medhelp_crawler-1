    "question": "Hello. new here and first post.I am seeking the right Endocrinologist in the St Luois are, one who will listen and pay as much attention to your symptoms as he/she does to the lab results. Many of you know the crazy,infuriating ride I have been on for years. Thyroid ablated ten years ago at the age of 44,six years after a complete hysterectomy(yes, I know there is a connection) The initial diagnosis was Graves Disease, in 2001. Is this indeed what I had? Not even sure...that MD had told me FOR FOUR YEARS (1997-2001) prior to thyroid ablation that my heart palps,hand tremors, hair loss, weight gain(?) depression,very frequent diarrhea,brain fog,fatigue,memory loss and confusion were all due to \"age and depression\". My Eye Dr was the one who found that something else was wrong, said SIGNIFICANT VISION LOSS IN ONE YEARS TIME IN ONE EYE ONLY = diabetes or thyroid disease. Told MD, he angrily and arrogantly proceeds to read me his pedigree and the pedigree of every professor he had learned from who \"could write a book on thryoid disease\", but writes order and tells me \"if it will make you feel better, go and have the RAI Uptake test at the hospital\". I did, T4 (I think..it was one that the normal range is 2-12) came back at over 59, bad enough that the hospital Rad Tech tells me not to \"sit on this\", and that I am \"within an inch of Thyroid Storm\". Thyroid then completely ablated by RAI...and thus began the merry go round ride from he**.",
