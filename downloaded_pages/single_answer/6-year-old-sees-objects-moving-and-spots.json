    "question": "My 6 years old daughter has been complaining of seeing green spots and images moving. For instance she was saying that when she looks at me, my face will move. Other objects in the background do not move. She also sees spots sometimes. Both the symptoms come and go.Four months back she was tested for nearsightedness but during the test, she could read one vertical column correctly but the adjacent column of the same size and at the same distance she could not read. These symptoms showed up last week. Her pediatrician tested her for diabetes yesterday and the tests were negative.I am really concerned. What should be our next step?",
