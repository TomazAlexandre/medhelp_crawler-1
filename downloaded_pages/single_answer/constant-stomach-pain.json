            "answer": "Hey Tracy!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possible causes that may need to be considered include GI infections/ inflammations, GI motility issues, hormonal/ endocrine causes, electrolyte abnormalities, growths/ masses, neurological causes, metabolic issues, diabetes related complications etc. Without a definite diagnosis at hand it would be difficult to suggest a management plan. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an internist initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 39 year old female. I'm overweight and have been having severe bouts of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. I still have my appetite, but after I eat I vomit about half of what I just ate. I have been to the ER, only because my primary doctor was on vacation. The ER is a joke and I knew that before going, but I just needed some relief from the pain and nausea. I take Zofran for the nausea a few times a day along with Ultraset for the pain. I need to work, so i can't take anyting more powerful. Every test they run comes back fine, minus the hiatial hernia that shows up all the time on the CT scan and the elevated liver enzymes (because I'm overweight). The past month has been horrible. I have absolutely no energy and the pain is increasing in intensity. My GI doctor told me to fast for a few days (I'm diabetic also). I have a hard time doing that, because I dehydrate so quickly. I'm so sick of being sick. Any suggestions? I know I have to lose weight (obviously), but that can't happen overnight and the vomiting and diarrhea just keeps getting me dehydrated. I'm trying to stay out of my doctor admitting me to the hospital, because he always wants to do that when I get so dehydrated.Any suggestions, thoughts, etc...would be helpful.Thanks in advance,Tracy",
