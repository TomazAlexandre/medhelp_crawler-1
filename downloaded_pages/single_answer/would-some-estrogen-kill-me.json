    "question": "I'm a 59 yr. young female, I take meds for diabetes (pills) HBP, Plavix & aspirin 320 Pravastatin & some pain meds. I have dry brittle hair, hair loss, I am less able to tolerate stress than before have chronic pain. Everytime I ask my Doc for estrogen he says I will have a heart attack if I take it because I am a smoker (trying to quit) I recently heard about some estrogen gel, that I would like to try. Are there any smokers out there that also take a little estrogen? I'm desparate to feel like a woman again. Thanks",
