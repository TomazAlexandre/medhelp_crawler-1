            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Yes it will be good if you can move around more and do some back and leg exercises on a daily basis. It is possible there is some disc prolapse or herniation which is pinching the nerves.Other possibility is peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes and B12 deficiency. OTC B complex supplements will also help you. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 18 years old and for a long while i have been feeling numbness and discomfort almost constantly in both of my legs. I have no idea what this could be. Perhaps it is nothing. But I do find it bothers me very much espically when sitting i find very often i have to stand and walk around however even then they slightly bother me and feel as if they are asleep. I am not an incredibly active person but i am in shape and not the least bit over weight. My job reguires alot of sitting (lifeguard at fitness center) and i also do online college course which reguire alot of sitting. Maybe its a simple as i need to move around more. But i have been becoming more worried as i feel it is getting worse.Any ideas or suggestions would be grearly appreciated. Thank you.",
