            "answer": "I am not a physician, but the mom of a type 1 and the daughter of type 2 and a volunteer, who also deals with diabetes every day.You are right that as he grows his insulin intake will need adjusting. We find that when our daughter has a growth spurt, she is not hungry for like a week and her numbers go crazy.\u00a0\u00a0When I see her numbers out of whack after 3-4 days I fax them to the endo, she adjusts her dosage, then she starts eating a gain, and we go thru the same routine.\u00a0\u00a0 We do this every month or so.I would suggest that you send your endo 3-4 days of numbers and explain what you are doing with weaning off the cup.\u00a0\u00a0They will suggest how to adjust the insulin, and give you some helpful hints. If your son is on a pump they might adjust the basal rates.As for the rule of thumb with the ratio, I find that it is different for each child. We have friend whose daughter is about the same height and weight as my daughter, but her ratios are totally different.good luck, let us know how things work out.",

    "question": "Hello all,My 3-1/2 yr old son is type 1, and we are weaning him off sippy cups to normal cups & straws for drinking.\u00a0\u00a0We've noticed he drinks much less now, but it's the same stuff:\u00a0\u00a0water & 2% milk exclusively.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, we are also noticing his noon & dinner bg readings are generally higher than usual.\u00a0\u00a0He is a growing boy and so we expect upwards adjustments in insulin doses, but we are wondering whether the reduced hydration may contribute to his body being less able to evacuate excess sugars, thus causing higher readings.\u00a0\u00a0Does this make sense?\u00a0\u00a0If not, what warning signs should we look for regarding insulin resistance?\u00a0\u00a0We've been told that a good rule of thumb for insulin dose is 1 unit per 1 kg (2.24 lbs) of body weight daily.\u00a0\u00a0He's about there now, so is there anything to worry about?Regards,Tony",
