            "answer": "Hi, your symptoms of headache and nausea could be due to the weather, unaccustomed and sudden. Also, the exercise and the sudden intake of fluids could sometimes cause mild disturbances with electrolyte balance. When you exercise in hot weather try to add a little bit of salt to water. Sometimes hypoglycemia also can cause headaches and nausea. Were your blood counts normal? if anemia has been ruled out, then metabolic disorders like Diabetes Mellitus and Hypothyroidism could cause the symptoms described by you. A simple blood test could help detect diabetes and hypothyroidism. Consult your primary care physician for these tests. Regards.",
