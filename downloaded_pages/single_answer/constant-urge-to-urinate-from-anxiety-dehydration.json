            "answer": "Its probably your anxiety. I am the exact same way and I deal mostly with health anxiety. It always worse at night as Im trying to fall asleep because that is when my anxiety is worse. I could easily pee 3-5 times before finally falling asleep. It *****...lol.\u00a0\u00a0Just started therapy so Im hoping to find some help. Its ridiculous and drives me nuts not to mention my husband who is trying to fall asleep next to me.\u00a0\u00a0Its a lot less of a problem during the day when I am busier and less anxious. I hope it gets better for u.",

    "question": "so i'v had this strange almost constant urge to urinate for about a week now. it doesnt burn, theres no weird colors or smells or anything. i know it's not diabetes cause i have no other accompanying symptoms and in general I feel fine. I'd also like to think it's not a uti since it would probably be pretty bad for a week after. This has happened once before about six months ago after a 2 day stomach problem. at that time i had horrible diarrhea followed by constipation bloating and the same constant urge to pee. i was told by someone i might be dehydrated so for a week i layed off the coke and coffee and only had water and lemonade and juice and it just went away. i have a lot of hypochondria like tendencies and i tend to focus on sensation like you wouldnt believe.\u00a0\u00a0i always assume the worst but at this point i cant imagine it would be anything serious because it would've gotten worse. it seems that when im very distracted it goes away but i dont know. i could really use some help.",
