            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The analysis does show proteinuria. The common causes for protein in the urine are infections of the kidney/bladder, disorders of the kidney/bladder, certain disorders like diabetes, strenuous exercise and certain medications. Discuss these options with your consulting doctor. He may do tests like urine analysis for microalbinuria, blood tests, X rays, ultrasonography, CT scan and sometimes cystoscopy to detect the cause for proteinuria.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
