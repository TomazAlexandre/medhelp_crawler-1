    "question": "I am starting an exercise routine again and I mostly exercise in the evening after dinner (about an hourof moderate to intense) and I've gone from 15R 15N dinner shot to 10R 11N I'm still having sever low blood sugars between 1AM and 4AM. Last time I was on an intense exercise routine I ended up going down to 2R (don't remember how much N but it was lowered considerably) and I had to bump about the amount of carbs and proteins I ate in the evening to such an extent (to combat low bloodsugars) that after more than six months of 2 hours per day of running, pilates, calisthenics, swimming, weights etc I hardly lost 2 lbs. I was eating a good 3700 calories a day. Id rather be eating 2000 or even 1500. In the end I was eating a huge dinner and a gigantic bedtime snack while taking 2R with dinner and still crashing really bad with low bloodsugars. So I gave up. When is the best time to exercise (I.e. 1/2 hour before shot? 2 hours after eating? Morning?) I can't seem to figure this stuff out. I am a 33 yr old female 5'10 173 lbs want to get to and maintain 135lb I'd settle for 140",
