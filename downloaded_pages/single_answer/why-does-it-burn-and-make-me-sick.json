            "answer": "Hello Dfinidaho,Welcome to the Pain Management Forum. I am glad that you found us but sorry to hear about your pain and elevated blood sugars.Burning and hurting in a joint can be a sign of inflammation and/or nerve involvement. Have you had an x-ray? If not I suggest you see your PCP and request one to see what may be going on in the hip.Is the lump new? is it soft or firm? Does it hurt when you touch it? Is it red or hot to touch? It could be scar tissue or it could be an abscess or a cyst. It need to be evaluated.Blood Sugars (glucose) will often elevate with an infection or inflammation or when your system is under stress. It is also possible that your disease is just progressing and may require oral antihyperglycemic medications. Please monitor your blood glucose levels closely. If they stay high you must be see your PCP. If it becomes over 200 you may want to go to your local ER. Many patients do not realize that they can call the ER Dept, report symptoms and ask for medical advice. Again if your glucose levels are over 200 I would certainly consider this.I am hopeful that you will see your PCP very soon and please let us know how you are doing. I will look forward to your updates. Good luck to you.Take Care and be vigilant in monitoring your glucose levels.Tuck",

    "question": "I had a total hip replacement about 10 years ago and now it is burning all the time from the joint to mid- thigh.\u00a0\u00a0I have a large hard bump on the side of my hip by where the incision was made. I am nauseated pretty much all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I also have type 2 diabetes and since my hip has been burning and hurting, my blood glucose levels are in the high 100's to mid 200's and can't seem to get it under control. I have always controled it with diet before, no problem. Can anyone tell me why this is happening?",
