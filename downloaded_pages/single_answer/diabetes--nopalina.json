            "answer": "Hi,I think the best person to ask would be your local pharmacist who will have more information regarding possible drug side effects and interactions. Even though Nopalina consists of \"natural\" flax seed oil and is generally thought of as \"safe,\" I do not know how it may interact with your other medications. Have a quick chat with your pharmacist the next time you are nearby.Take care.",
