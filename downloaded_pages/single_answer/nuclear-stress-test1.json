            "answer": "I had a nuclear stress test done 4 years ago after complaints of shortness of breath with exertion and chest pains.\u00a0\u00a0The day of the test, they injected Thalium (not Valium) and hooked me up with leads to monitor heart activity.\u00a0\u00a0Then I got on a treadmill and they calculated what my max heart rate could safely be.\u00a0\u00a0They started up the treadmill and I watched my heart activity being recorded on the the TV screen, as the treadmill speed up.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr.was talking to me when I felt the first PVC start, I told him that I felt one and he looked on the screen and saw it, then there were several more.\u00a0\u00a0He got my heartrate up to around 180 and said we could go to 190 if I wanted to, I told him I didnt really want to.\u00a0\u00a0After the treadmill, I had to go and sit down in a machine that took nuclear scans of the heart's reaction to the stress test.\u00a0\u00a0A small portion of the machine moves in a panoramic motion around your chest while you sit still.\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to take around 40 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0None of it was painful.\u00a0\u00a0He said he would call me the next day or so after reviewing the results.\u00a0\u00a0He called me that night at home and said that the tests showed a low ejection fraction of my left ventricle and suggested a blocked artery, I was 28 years old.\u00a0\u00a0He set up a cardiac cath that week.\u00a0\u00a0It, thankfully came out to be a false positive as the heart cath. showed good arteries.I have since in the past couple of years experienced the same exact symptoms as you mentioned!\u00a0\u00a0I even explained the feeling in my left arm as feeling like a blood pressure cuff was squeezing it, I apologized to the Dr. becuase I didnt know any other way to describe it.\u00a0\u00a0My fingers will begin to tingle and not really be numb, but will have like a decreased sensation.\u00a0\u00a0My calves have started cramping in the last few months, at one time my right calf was swollen a half inch larger than my left.If you feel like you have questions you didnt think of at the apt., Im sure you can call the office and ask the nurse there.\u00a0\u00a0They usually understand that you think of all your questions once you get home and re-run the apt through your mind a few times!\u00a0\u00a0And best of luck--post and let us know how it turns out!Mel",

    "question": "I am scheduled for my nuclear stress test Nov 11. Ech on Nov 8th. Will either of these tests show if I have peripheral artery disease. I have constant squeezing (feels like blood pressure cuff) with numb tingeling fingers in left arm. Also my legs hurt all the time, sometimes major cramping in my calves. And yesterday groin pain affecting walking all day. (I am female.) I know dr is checking out for CHF, as I have major fatigue on climbing stairs, wheezing, edema, smoke (trying to quit) and type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I know some of you have responded to me before, and I GREATLY appreciate you.\u00a0\u00a0On the stress test, do they measure endurance?Or Speed you up? Never been thru this before, and I was so nervous at the cardio consult, I didn't ask the questions I should have asked.\u00a0\u00a0If you forget and use caffine before, how bad does that effect results? Sorry for probably re-asking some questions. Wish the appointments were closer, the waiting is making me really anxious. Thanks for any help.",
