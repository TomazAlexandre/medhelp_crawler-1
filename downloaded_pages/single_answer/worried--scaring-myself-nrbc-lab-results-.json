Just had my gestational diabetes test and everything is normal, but i receive my lab results online to my email and i noticed something new in my routine\u00a0\u00a0blood work. Has anyone seen an nRBC\u00a0\u00a0result on their blood work? My result came out to 2 range 0-0. They marked it high and I Googled it and all the information is scary and confusing at the same time. Please any advice.",
