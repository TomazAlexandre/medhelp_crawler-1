            "answer": "I cannot solve the dilemma.\u00a0\u00a0No online person, regardless of expertise, can depend on verbal description to mediate between differing opinions of clinicians who have actually examined someone, or to figure out something when it remains unclear even after biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0Pro molluscum:\u00a0\u00a0most STD clinicians are pretty much up to speed on it, probably more so than most urologists or family doc; and the locations you describe are more suggested of MC than warts.\u00a0\u00a0Pro warts:\u00a0\u00a0The biopsy result.\u00a0\u00a0My inclination is to rely on the biopsy, so you should assume you have warts.\u00a0\u00a0But it is possible you have both.1) Pathologists are trained to use words like 'suggestive' and 'consistent with', to avoid overt conflict if/when clinicians make a diagnosis inconsistent with the pathology.\u00a0\u00a0I think you can rely on the biopsy diagnosis of HPV infection.2) Maybe everybody is right.3) There is no reason to suppose any different response to treatmentin people with diabetes, or to natural clearance of either HPV or the molluscum contagiosum virus.\u00a0\u00a0To my knowledge, the cell-mediated arm of the immune system, which is primarily responsible for both viruses, is not affected in diabetes, even when poorly controlled.4) Both.\u00a0\u00a0That is, recurrent warts can can involve previously treated spots, the same general area, or both.Good luck--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

    "question": "Back in May I saw my PCP about a few very small lesions in my genital area. He said he was 70% sure they were genital warts and wanted to prescribe Aldara. I asked if I could get a second opinion so he referred me to a Urologist (appointment was 2 weeks later). In the meantime, I went to the local STD clinic to get another opinion. The Doc at the clinic looked at them and said immediately that it was Molluscum. I told him that I had a Urology appointment in a couple days so he told me to have the Urologist treat them. A couple days later...I see the Urologist and he says they look like Molluscum but could be genital warts, so he did a biopsy to confirm. The biopsy results said they were",
