            "answer": "Kidney or renal failure is a very serious problem.\u00a0\u00a0A large number of common chronic medical conditions can cause and contribute to renal failure.\u00a0\u00a0 If this represents an acute change in her condition she needs to seek medical attention immediately.\u00a0\u00a0If she is, as you say, \u201cretaining water,\u201d this fluid can accumulate into the lungs creating a condition called pulmonary edema and/or stress the heart in a condition called congestive heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0Under the care of a kidney specialist (nephrologist) patients are able to do very well with dialysis.\u00a0\u00a0There are several types of dialysis, but typically, she would be placed on hemodialysis (HD). This requires going to a center two to three times a week and being placed on a machine for a couple of hours.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds scary and frankly it is, but between dialysis these patients live reasonable normal lives.There are some important things to keep in mind, this is the result of an underlying disease such as hypertension or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0HD will do nothing for the condition that lead to the renal failure.\u00a0\u00a0Given her resistance for treatment of the renal failure, one has to wonder if she is being careful in the management of her other chronic conditions.Patients refuse therapy for a lot of reasons.\u00a0\u00a0Often patients are afraid, or they don\u2019t want a change in their lifestyle or quality of life.\u00a0\u00a0 If she has incomplete information she may make a bad decision because she doesn\u2019t have all the relevant\u00a0\u00a0information.\u00a0\u00a0On the contrary, she may have all the appropriate information but elects not to have her lifestyle altered.\u00a0\u00a0 Some patients may perceive that they are becoming a burden to their family.\u00a0\u00a0If that is the case, that is her decision to make regardless if we agree with it or not.",
