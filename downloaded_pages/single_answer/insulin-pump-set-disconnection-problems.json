            "answer": "Hello,I have had diabetes for about 12 years and the medtronic minimed pump for about 10, some things if you have not tried are to use iv preps which are sticky when drying and then an iv 3000 over top. When I use them I cut a circle in the middle so I will be able to dissconect for different reasons. If not I think minimed may have some different types of sets that may help with the coming out problem.",

    "question": "Hello!\u00a0\u00a0My name is Martin.\u00a0\u00a0I have been a Type 1 diabetic since 1968 (when I was 3).\u00a0\u00a0In February 2011 I started using a Medtronic Minimed insulin pump.\u00a0\u00a0After a few teething problems, from June 2011 until February 2012 everything was fine - much improved diabetic control, quality of life etc. etc.\u00a0\u00a0However, in February 2012 a problem developed - the sets kept disconnecting themselves from me after I'd inserted them.\u00a0\u00a0This happened on somewhere between one third and one half of occasions.\u00a0\u00a0One or both of the two sticky pads did not seem to have enough stick and came unstuck.\u00a0\u00a0This happens whenever I connect it to the abdomen or buttocks, but is better on the legs.\u00a0\u00a0My right leg is a bit lumpy - if I use the left leg all the time, quite simply I will soon run out of spaces.I think I know how to mount a set - I had already been using the pump for 1 year when this started happening.\u00a0\u00a0Also, this is not attributable to hot weather - when it started happening in February, it was COLD (I have been in South Korea for the past three and a half years, you see - temp regularly below freezing in February).\u00a0\u00a0My UK doctor suggested shaving the area and spraying anti-perspirant on, both of which I have done.\u00a0\u00a0Last Thursday I mounted a new set to my abdomen, micropored the set down, tegadermed it, then micropored the tegaderm.\u00a0\u00a02 hours later everything had disconnected and I had to fit a new set (which, thankfully, seems to have stuck).\u00a0\u00a0When everything is working (and sticking) the pump is a wonderful thing; but it seems to be disconnecting itself a bit too often at the moment.\u00a0\u00a0Please help!",
