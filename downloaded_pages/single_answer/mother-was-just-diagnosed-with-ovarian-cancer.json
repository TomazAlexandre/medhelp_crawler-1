            "answer": "Hi,I understand what a huge shock this diagnosis was, for both you and Mom to suddenly have to deal with.We all feel that way when the diagnosis is cancer, it's an awful blow and turns your world upside down. You and she are confused and I guess she's dealing with it in her fear and confusion.It's a very good sign that she's obviously ready for a fight to treat, and deal with the disease.Give her some time, and be there for her. She's going to need you more than she knows, and she'll reach out to you very soon.I'm sure she'll need surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible. Make sure she has a GYN/ONC surgeon to do her surgery. They are specialists who are very well trained and competent, to have\u00a0\u00a0the best outcome. I expect that she'll also need chemo to kill any remaining cancer cells, the surgery is unable to get.She'll see an oncologist to set up her treatments once she's recovered from surgery which will also stage her disease, according to what the path lab at the he hospital finds when they test the removed tissue.I hope this was of some help to you. Please keep us informed we're here to support you and Mom when you need us.Jane",
