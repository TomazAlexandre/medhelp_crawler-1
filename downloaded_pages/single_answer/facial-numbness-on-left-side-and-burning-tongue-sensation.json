            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth etc\u00a0\u00a0can all cause facial numbness and pain. Hemi-facial numbness is also seen in Bell\u2019s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia where a spasm may cause numbness, or due to acoustic neuroma which is a benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss these possibilities with an ENT doctor.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "A friend of mine is experiencing facial numbness on the left side of her face and a burning sensation in her tongue (it burns constantly). She's had it for exactly two years. She also experiences migraine headaches . She did a little research and oddly, it seems that most people who have similar reactions seem to experience it on their left side. Her doctor thinks it could be from taking Zoloft but isn't sure. Someone else online seemed to develop this after visiting a dentist but that wasn't the case with her.I thought it would be good to post this online in case anyone has similar symptoms, as this seems to be a really good community for finding people with like experiences. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",
