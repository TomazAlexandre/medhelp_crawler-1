            "answer": "Hello again Serendipitous,I've read in other boards that folks get some relief from a medication called CYmbalta.\u00a0\u00a0I did a Google search for an article that might be more than hype or marketing and found this one:http://www.news-medical.net/?id=4596There are potential side effects as the article mentions, but perhaps -- if this med is not contra-indicated by other meds you're taking -- your physician can discuss this option with you.Neuropathy is a very painful complication of diabetes and I hope that some of the non-med suggestions taht were recommended in the earlier post will prove helpful to you also.\u00a0\u00a0Meditation, for example, has profound benefits on everything from blood pressure to depression to pain mgt... the key is to find a good teacher who can guide you -- again without hype.Since none of us here is a medical professional, be sure to discuss what you read here with your physician.\u00a0\u00a0If you're not being followed by an endocrinologist, it's time to get a referral to one.\u00a0\u00a0You may also benefit from working with a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0The one thing you can work on \"on your own\" is to get your blood sugar into near-normal ranges for most of the time.\u00a0\u00a0Folks usually report eased symptoms when they limit the\u00a0\u00a0stress & further damage caused by high blood sugar.I wish you good luck with this -- I know it painful & very difficult.",
