            "answer": "Hi,I am not sure if your symptoms are compatible with fasting hypoglycemia--do you feel like this when you wake up in the morning?\u00a0\u00a0Does it wake you from sleep? There are several reasons for true fasting hypoglycemia, some of them serious so this should be evaluated soon to determine what is going on.What I suggest is buying yourself a glucose meter and starting to actually check the numbers. Even though you are having concerning symptoms, there would be more need for concern if you feel badly with a glucose of 30 versus a glucose of 80 or even 70, so that is very important. If you are actually having low numbers, please seek out an endocrinologist soon for a full evaluation.If the numbers are not low(less than 60 all the time) then I think a diet high in protein, with small meals throughout the day should work well for you, but that decision is best left up to you and your doctor after reviewing your glucose numbers.Take care.",

    "question": "About 7 years ago, I had pneumonia, and after I got over it, I couldn't drink sodas anymore without getting a headache.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past 7 years, I've had more and more episodes of what I'm pretty sure is fasting hypoglycemia- wobbliness, dizziness, if I haven't eaten in a while, which clears up quickly after eating bread, milk, meat, or chocolate.\u00a0\u00a0I can't eat refined sugar (Krispy Kremes, birthday cake, alcohol, etc.) unless I have protein at the same time- or I have a similar reaction.\u00a0\u00a0I can usually manage to avoid symptoms with a high-protein, high-fiber/complex-carbs diet- but I seem to be getting more sensitive over time.\u00a0\u00a0I'm in my late 20s, 5'-9\", 135 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0No known history of diabetes in my family so far.Is there something that would cause fasting hypoglycemia to start suddenly like that, and is it okay to just manage my diet to control it?",
