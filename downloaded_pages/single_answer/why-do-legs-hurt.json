            "answer": "It is the findings of nerve root irritation at L5 and narrowing of the spinal canal that are probably causing your leg pain.\u00a0\u00a0Nerves and spinal cord at the lumbar level are what affect the way the legs work.\u00a0\u00a0As for your feet turning blue, that is more a circulation problem, which can come from disease or not enough movement.\u00a0\u00a0Diseases include diabetes or pulmonary issues.\u00a0\u00a0Not enough movement seems more likely because you have had SO many operations, endured so much pain, that I'll bet you tend to be less active.\u00a0\u00a0Following recovery from your surgeries, your physicians should have prescribed a physical therapy program for you, to get you up and moving about more easily.\u00a0\u00a0You should ask your doctors about getting you signed up for that.In the meantime, you can go to the Y swimming pool and start a regular schedule of wading around in there and working your way up to laps.\u00a0\u00a0At home, you can do easy stretching exercises to get more flexible and work your way up to more aerobic activity like biking and jogging.\u00a0\u00a0The most important thing to strengthen a bad back is to tighten the tummy muscles, so you can start with pulling those in firmly several times a day and slowly get to crunches.To improve the circulation in your legs, if you have gained weight, lose some pounds.\u00a0\u00a0Also, every night before bedtime, rub out with an aloe lotion the muscles in your legs and calves, and emhasizing the feet.\u00a0\u00a0Watch your salt and drink plenty of water.\u00a0\u00a0If your ankles tend to swell, wear support stockings or diabetic socks when you're up and about.\u00a0\u00a0To make sure you don't have diabetes, you should have a regular physical checkup and they should draw blood and check your sugar levels.",
