    "question": "hey everyone im new to this forum so sorry if i ask a question thats already been answered.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if stress can cause diabetes? I had blood work done on sugar levels and triglycerides and such a year ago when i was on accutane and everything was normal then. However for the past couple months i have been getting hair follicle infections/pimples/boils randomly on my thighs.\u00a0\u00a0They heal relatively quickly but they leave a red discoloration in the spot they heal.\u00a0\u00a0I am 22, 6'1\" about 160 pounds or so, and have always exercised regularly. My parents said I have no family history of it but I have been under extreme anxiety/stress for a while now. I dont handle stress very well and am a bit of a hypochondriac.\u00a0\u00a0I can't tell if i have been urinating more frequently because I always make a point to drink lots of water, juice, and green tea every day.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to a dermatologist tomorrow to look at these spots but I was just wondering if anyone can give me any insight. thanks",
