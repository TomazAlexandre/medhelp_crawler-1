            "answer": "I am so sorry that your dog developed diabetes!Dog's can develop cataracts from diabetes quite quickly.\u00a0\u00a0There is no way to tell how long your dog has had diabetes prior to diagnosis and the cataracts were probably starting to develop from the beginning (prior to diagnosis).If your dog's loss of sight is just due cataracts than Brite Eyes III or equivalent products (OcluVet Eye Drops, Can-C Carnosine Eye Drops and others) may help.\u00a0\u00a0Please check these products on Amazon.com.\u00a0\u00a0Brite Eyes III from the Life Extension company seems to be less expensive than some of the other products.\u00a0\u00a0Please also view the Reviews.I have been recommending the OcluVet product for years.\u00a0\u00a0It has worked miraculously in some cases and sometimes it is ineffective.\u00a0\u00a0There is no way to determine if it will be effective for your dog.\u00a0\u00a0Try it and see.\u00a0\u00a0It is less expensive that cataract surgery.Lastly, dogs do very well with blindness.\u00a0\u00a0A dog's nose (sense of smell) is so powerful that it can act as a kind of sonar.\u00a0\u00a0They can get around beautifully with limited or no sight.\u00a0\u00a0Just don't move the furniture around in the house without showing your dog the changes.\u00a0\u00a0If you move furniture,\u00a0\u00a0place your dog on a leash and slowly walk her around the house and slap the moved furniture to make a noise in order to point out the new location.\u00a0\u00a0 Allow her to gently walk into it and smell around it.\u00a0\u00a0After a few days she will recognise the change and avoid the obstacle.",
