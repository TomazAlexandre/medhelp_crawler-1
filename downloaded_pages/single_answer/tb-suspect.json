After 2 months later , he suffered abdominal pain and made medical check up every parts of body such as Hep B,C ,HIV, TB,Malaria and Chest X ray, ultra sound again and again.Due to X ray'result, there is a little water in his lung but they said it is no problem. Doctors could not find any other disease. And then we took CT scan and doctors decided that there is a mass inside his intestine.But when\u00a0\u00a0operation was made actually,there is no mass inside. Doctors said again this is due to folding of intestine. So they put the intestine as normal position and appendix was cut. After making operation, my father lost appetite , suffered tightly in his womb and constipation. So he became weak and finally he can breath by giving oxygen artificially and suffer congestion in the lungs. TB bacteria check was made two more times. Now he passed away. Just before he dies, doctors ask to take X ray and to check the TB bacteria again. There was no bacteria in his saliva but X ray show some damage symptom on his lung. So they concluded that this is TB suspect. I really want to know the actual reason which disease can cause my father to die.",
