    "question": "I'm 31 weeks and I've had sciatica for 3 months already and I found out a few weeks ago I have gestational diabetes. I can't wait to be done with this pregnancy to have my body back and function like a normal human being. How do you ladies get through it? I can't take pain medication but I wish I could. I can barely walk at times let alone work/ clean and take care of myself.Help?",
