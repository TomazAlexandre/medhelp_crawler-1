            "answer": "Hello,Such kind of wavy nails can be due to koilonychias or psoriasis. It can e due to Beau\u2019s lines as well which can be due to uncontrolled diabetes and peripheral vascular disease, scarlet fever, measles, mumps and pneumonia. Beau's lines can also be a sign of zinc deficiency.I would suggest a dermatologist\u2019s consultation to confirm the diagnosis.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "My fingernails have been getting increasingly wavy, both up-and-down the nail, and from side-to-side across the nail. They are bending and breaking very easily and I'm finding I cant use my nails for tasks I used to take for granted, Several months ago, perhaps even a year ago, i had all kinds of dents in most of my nails. I wasn't sure what was the cause of that either, but that has disappeared (for the most part), since these waves have appeared.I have an appointment with a dermatologist in a little less than three weeks. What can I do in the mean time, and is there anything I should have prepared for the dermatologist when I go, other than the description I have just given in this thread?I should also note I have other dermatological problems. Please look at my other threads if you are interested.Thanks so much for reading! Any input is very much appreciated!",
