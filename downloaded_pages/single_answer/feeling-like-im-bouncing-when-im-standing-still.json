    "question": "For the last year (at least), I have occasionally had this weird sensation when I am standing that I'm bouncing gently up and down when I'm totally stationary. And I also feel slightly out of it, really heavy, and like I have an elevator in my body, going up and down, if that makes sense.\u00a0\u00a0It's like when you're in your car on a bridge or overpass and it's bouncing, that's exactly what it feels like.\u00a0\u00a0I'm ok once I sit down, though.\u00a0\u00a0My last doc had me thinking it was something in my head, but I actually fainted from these symptoms 2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I do have type 2 diabetes, but it's been under control. Anyone else ever had this happen?",
