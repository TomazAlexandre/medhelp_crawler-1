            "answer": "sounds like you have an arthritic joint to the great toe area.\u00a0\u00a0the other pain is probably resulting from offloading the foot and applying increased pressure to the other joints.cortisone injections and supportive shoes help.\u00a0\u00a0if you continue to have pain, get an xray done.\u00a0\u00a0you may need a surgical procedure to decompress the joints.",

    "question": "For the last several months been having pain in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0Im a 51 yr.old female with no diabetes just high blood pressure. .well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0The pain started in my right foot mostly at the base of the big toe in the joint. No redness or swelling. Then it sort of went across the top of my foot at the base of toes.\u00a0\u00a0I cant position either foot to the side as theres pain with that too along the outside of foot. Just to hit these certain areas especially the big toe sends me thru the roof.\u00a0\u00a0It doesnt seem to bother when I wear shoes.\u00a0\u00a0Mornings are extremely painful upon standing, very hard to walk for the first 10 minutes. any ideas as to what this is?\u00a0\u00a0 Came on all of a sudden.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
