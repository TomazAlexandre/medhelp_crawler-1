            "answer": "Im glad I'm not the only one! I went into labour on Wednesday-having contractions every 5 mins for 6 hours, which became more and more uncomfortable. Then they went to every 2.5-4 mins for 2 hours, we went to hospital but I was only 1cm and contractions stopped not long after. Strange but apparently not unheard of. I was 36+6 (now 37+4).I hope I start labour soon, although not holding my breath. I'm due to be induced on 3 Oct due to gestational diabetes, but would prefer it if my body would start the process before then. Had my show at 37w, but don't seem to be getting any symptoms at all now. Have another scan and consultant appt on Thursday and kind of hoping that she might just start her entrance whilst we're at the Hospital anyway! Good luck to you, hope bubba comes soon! I can't wait to be able to big both my little girls! My daughter is fed up of the bump pushing her away!",

    "question": "I'm 37+3weeks with my second. Yesterday around noon I started having consistent contractions and it lasted for about 2 hours and then it stalled. I've had some major pain in my pelvis, hips and back ever since. Well, woke up this morning and the pain was so bad it hurt to even urinate so I figured id go L&D to be checked out and make sure it wasn't an infection or something. Started having contractions back to back while I was there being checked but ithey didn't make me dilate past 1 cm so they said I'm in early stage of labor and sent me on my way. I'm still having contractions so hopefully things will progress soon! The nurse said in her personal opinion she thinks I will be in full blown active labor within a week. Wish me luck!!",
