            "answer": "Does the calcification appear as a calcification or a calcification within a nodule?\u00a0\u00a0How big is the actual nodule ? is the nodule 3mm or the calcification 3.0mm within something be it the thryoid or a nodule?I ask bcz 3mm cannot be biopsied if that is the size of a nodule.\u00a0\u00a0My remaining nodule is 3.0mm - 4.0mm in itself on my intact side of the thyroid but now signs of anything hinting at Cancer.My opinion as a patient given your history is i would get a biopsy if one is being offered in light of the ultrasound report and your history.\u00a0\u00a0It certainly will help with a diagnosis.Cheyrl",

    "question": "I have had two ultrasounds of the thyroid in the past 7 months. The first one showed calcification in lower right lobe with history of hypothyroidism for past 22 years. The second scan showed increased enlargement in both lobes and also an increase in the isthmus from 6mm to 8mm in just 7 months. I have trouble swallowing and hoarseness and have had this for past 9 to 12 months. I also have diabetes Type 2 as well as SLE which was recently diagnosed in the past five years. My concern is the 2 calcifications of 3mm in right lobe. I have family history of cancer in family ranging from breast, colon, liver and prostate and esphoegeal cancers. I keep watch of everything and try to prevent what i can. Should i have this biopsied ?",
