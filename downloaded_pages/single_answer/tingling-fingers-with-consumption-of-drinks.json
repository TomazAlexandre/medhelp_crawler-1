    "question": "So my fianc\u00e9e told me that when she drinks mountain dew or sips alcohol she has tingling in her fingers.I know insulin causes vasodilation, I know caffeine can cause vasoconstriction and I know that long term alcoholics suffer with tingling in the extremities. I also know that a sign that diabetes is close is tingling in the extremities due to insulin resistance.So I am confused now",
