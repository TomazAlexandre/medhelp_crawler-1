            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.It must be emphasized that in the MAJORITY of cases, muscle twitching are BENIGN meaning that they are of no consequence and are not resulting from a serious cause. In such cases, the twitches may be related to anxiety/stress, caffeine, and often occur after recent strenuous activity or muscle over-use. It is important in such cases to reduce stress/anxiety levels and to reduce caffeine intake.Benign fasciculation syndrome, which I will abbreviate as BFS, is a condition in which there are involuntary twitches of various muscle groups, most commonly the legs but also the face, arms, eyes, and tongue. If the diagnosis is confirmed and other causes are excluded, it can be safely said that the likelihood of progression or occurrence of a serious neurologic condition is low.Twitches in the majority of cases are benign meaning they have no consequence and do not cause serious damage or are resulting from serious damage. The twitches can occur focally (one location) or generalized (many locations). Twitches can be related to anxiety/stress, caffeine, and often occur post exercise or muscular over-use. Another type of twitching, which is normal, is called a hypnic jerk. It occurs as we are falling asleep. Again it is exacerbated by stress or caffeine. For these symptoms, the best treatment is to reduce the caffeine intake and/or reduce the stress. If the twitches are bothersome or disabling, medical treatment may be necessary. This will need to be at the discretion of your physician.",

    "question": "My left index finger has been twitching sporadically for the past week.\u00a0\u00a0It happens each day several times, at rest and when in use.\u00a0\u00a0My family has a history of Parkinson's which causes me cause for concern. My mom also had essential tremor and dystonia.\u00a0\u00a0I had surgery on both wrists for carpal tunnel last year.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I have been told I have mild neuralgia in both arms from my elbows through my fingers. I have never been diagnosed with diabetes. Could this be from the neuralgia or carpal tunnel?",
