            "answer": "Hello,I guess they are concerned with liability issues.Anyway, the approaches for losing weight are are follows:-1. Optimising insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Excess insulin will encourage your body to store fat.Particularly reducing the amount of carbs you eat will mean your insulin requirements will reduce.\u00a0\u00a0Note that this must be done carefully as your insulin requirements can drop rapidly.2. Exercise (but you must monitor your blood sugars closely to be sure you don't go high or low).3. Controlling portion size and amounts of calories.\u00a0\u00a0Usually not less than 1500 calories a day, though for slow steady weight loss.I would highly recommend \"diabetes solutions\" by Dr. Berstein as an ideal manual for using insulin and controlling blood sugars and weight.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this can help.",

    "question": "Where are the Doctors that sincerely care about helping Type 1 Diabetics Lose Weight so we may have tighter control of our blood sugars? No one wants to touch the subject wih a 10 foot poll. All Diet Centers won't even talk to us because we're a liability so they won't help us either!\u00a0\u00a0While all NORMAL PEOPLE get the help they need to lose weight. Leaving us feeling like FREAKS.",
