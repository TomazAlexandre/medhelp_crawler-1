Good luck and keep us posted!",

    "question": "I had a ct scan done on 5/5/11\u00a0\u00a0because after urinating I could not stand, walk or even stand up straight with out having extreme pain but in my left side of my pelvis.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having pain in my upper abdomen, lower back and hip area all on my right side for over a year and now they are finding that I have kidney disease along with many other things going wrong with me. On the ct scan they foind I have a \"lobulated hypodense lesion in right adnexa, probably ovarian cyst , which measures 2.2 x 2.5 cm\". this is what was on the report.\u00a0\u00a0I also have heart disease and have high blood pressure and take meds for hypothyroid plus diabetes. My primary physician has not said anything about the cyst only that I had not diverticulitis and so I am wondering if I should go ahead and see an obgyn and get checked out on my own. I am obese, and have pain in my legs, and cannot stand for long lengths of time without breaking out into a sweat from pain. I thought it was from other things I have wrong and never thought it could be from this. But then I had forgotten I had the cyst... before it was very small when it was mentioned and I really had forgotten all about it. Thank you for your help.",
