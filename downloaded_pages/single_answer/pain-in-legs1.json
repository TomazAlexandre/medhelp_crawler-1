            "answer": "Hello Freeboy,Welcome to MedHelp's Pain Management Forum. I'm sorry to hear about your undiagnosed pain.There are pain conditions that effect the soft tissues/muscles\u00a0\u00a0and cause pain. Have you actually consulted a Rheumatologist? If not I would do so.Have you consulted a D.O. (Doctor of Osteopathy)? DOs that do Osteopathic Manipulation can be an enormous help. They are often able to \"find\" conditions that other physicians seem to miss - or don't even consider.Can you describe your pain? Is it an ache, throbbing, shooting, burning or something else? What makes the pain worse - what makes it better?Are you being prescribed a NSAID) Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory)?\u00a0\u00a0I would hope your medical provider has suggested something to ease your pain. Are you being treated by a Primary Care Physician (PCP)? Does your PCP have a title like, Internal Medicine or Family Practitioner? Have they x-rayed your entire leg or just your knees?I'll look forward to hearing more from you. Sorry I haven't been of much help. A bit more information may help us - help you.Regards,~Tuck",
