For the past few years I have had\u00a0\u00a0blurry vision with distant objects that usually lasts for 2 weeks and then they go away...I found that\u00a0\u00a0this occurs during the spring and summer times. I went to see my eye doctor when I had this problem in August and after tests they said my eyes were fine. I do have Type 2 diabetes which is now running a little high right now at 155 and also have high blood pressure",
