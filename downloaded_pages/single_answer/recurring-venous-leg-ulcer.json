            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your mother\u2019s medical problems. If a scab forms and falls off, on and off, then what she has is probably a non healing ulcer. This can be a venous ulcer on a varicose vein or any other ulcer that does not heal well due to either poor blood supply or underlying diabetes. Hence the origin of the ulcer has to be determined. Duplex ultrasound of the calf should be re-done to check the extent of varicose veins and atherosclerosis and blood sugar tested.If she has to wear stockings, see if an underlying padding can be given over the ulcer so that the ulcer is protected. Also, your mother should try and keep her legs up as much as possible (keeping legs raised on a stool while sitting, avoiding prolonged standing etc).Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi There:My 85 year old mother was diagnosed with multiple dvt's in her left leg over 3 years ago & has been on Warfarin since.\u00a0\u00a0She is currently on 4mg daily & her levels are therapeutic.She has had a recurring venous leg ulcer also on her left leg on/off for over 3 years and has been seeing a Dermatologist.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse that comes 3 times a week to bandage & dress her leg said he has never had a patient that has a recurring leg ulcer for over 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0My mum is getting down about this as the Dermatologist keeps telling us when the ulcer has healed to graduate to stockings.But the problem is every time it does manage to heal for a while and mum wears support socks, sure as fate the ulcer recurs again.\u00a0\u00a0To me this is just maintenance not finding/treating the underlying cause therefore the ulcer will continue to recur.I honestly believe the ulcer is related to the Warfarin mum is taking because she suffers from so many of the side affects listed, but every time we tell the doctors we get the same line \"it's not the medication\".If it's not the medication then why don't some of them try to find out what is causing them.",
