    "question": "My 13 year-old depressed daughter was voluntarily committed to a psychiatric facility.\u00a0\u00a0Child Protective Services were called because I refused to sign a blanket anti-psychotic medications consent without being informed of her diagnosis and medications recommended. I was forced to sign.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't too surprised when she was prescribed Seroquel.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that she is not schizoid and not bipolar as far as they know now.\u00a0\u00a0Since Seroquel is not approved for children under 18 and is not approved for uni-polar, what can I do to have the clinician try another approach or helping with coping skills or another medication. Since I signed to consent, it is only at the goodness of their hearts that I was told of this.\u00a0\u00a0I know as a nurse why I'm glad to give Seroquel to my confused elderly patients, but my daughter is not agitated or acting out.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse practionner says that it is a liability issue why the pharmaceutical companies add those warnings.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is morbidly obese with a strong family history of diabetes and has hyperlipidemia.\u00a0\u00a0I would like some more information on the matter.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I have no choice now (as it was put to me), but I would like to know anyway.\u00a0\u00a0I want my daughter to learn coping skills that is a more effective method of dealing with problems.",
