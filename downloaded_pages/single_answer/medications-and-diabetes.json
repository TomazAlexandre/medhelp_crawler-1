            "answer": "Hi,There are a few medications like steroids(prednisone,decadron)\u00a0\u00a0which can quickly raise blood sugars, especially in people with a tendency towards type 2 diabetes. Some blood pressure medications, anti-rejection medications and cholesterol meds can also raise blood sugars. In addition, various medications have this as an uncommon side effect. What I suggest to people with many risk factors for diabetes and/or have impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, they should check the side effect profile of any medications they take(or are being prescribed) to see if this could worsen their glucose control. Hope this answers your question.Take care.",
