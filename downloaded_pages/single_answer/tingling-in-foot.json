            "answer": "Hi!Though one cannot rule out heavy metal poisoning like lead, chances are less. Tingling sensation in different parts of foot can be due to plantar fasciitis, diabetes, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, peripheral neuropathies, hypothyroidism, SLE, alcoholism, peripheral artery disease, sciatica, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis and high blood pressure. You will need blood tests, nerve conduction studies and dopplar studies to reach a diagnosis.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "Here is the thing : Two weeks ago, I was lying in bed when I felt tingling in my left pinky toe and area around it. The other toes were not affected. The tingling was quite intense, it felt like burning. It went away pretty soon. But yesterday, I felt it again in the exactly same spot. My foot wasn't in position that could cause tingling in either case. Yesterday I also\u00a0\u00a0 had similar feeling in my heel, and very briefly and faintly, in the toes of my other foot and fingers.( but these were very brief, they went away in few seconds and didn't come back). My primary concern is lead poisoning (or some other heavy metal pois.). Taking into account intensity, duration and frequency of my symptoms, the fact that I'm not experiencing any other health problems, could it be lead poisoning? At point where lead is causing tingling, wouldn't you expect some other symptoms as well? I would really appreciate somebody helping me with this. Thanks in advance.",
