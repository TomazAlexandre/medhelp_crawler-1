            "answer": "I'm sure you can rely on your provider's diagnosis of yeast as the cause of your symptoms; and as long as your diabetes is not in near-perfect control, the problem likely will continue. The spit test is pure quackery, nothing more or less; I do not care what you have read on the net or elsewhere, it is absolutely meaningless whether 'positive' or 'negative'.\u00a0\u00a0(But it's sort of nice to hear from someone who obviously has yeast but has a negative spit test. Most of the BS comes from people who use a positive result to diagnose 'systemic candidiasis' as an explanation for a giant range of mostly emotional symptoms.)If you remain doubtful of the diagnosis, get a second opinion; you could ask your primary provider to refer you to a dermatologist.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, get your diabetes under control and the problem likely will resolve.Good luck--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

    "question": "Guess this would be the place to start. I have been diabetic for 9 years, mostly uncontroled but trying to fix that. I have what I belive is a yeast infection on my penis. (painful cuts on my penis) I have had the same cuts several times and the first time I got them I went and say my PCP and he prescribed the usual creams for a yeast infection that women get over the counter. Since then every time I get them I go that route(several times). I know yeast infections are very common in men with diabeties but I question if this is what I have. I even did the spitting in to the glass of water test to see if my \"spit\" grew legs towards the bottom of the glass and it did which is suppose to be a positive result for a yeast problem....dont know how scientific this is but seen it written several times on the net. Could this be something else??? I know my diabetes is a huge contributor if this is a yeast infection. I am not a person who sleeps around, I have been married for 9 years, although my wife is supportive I know she gets frustrated when I am unable and unwilling to perform due to the pain when the skin gets pulled taunt when I get erect while I have these cuts. And if it is yeast I certanly do not want to give it to her.The real problem to me is that can i be getting this many infections...seems to happen every few months.",
