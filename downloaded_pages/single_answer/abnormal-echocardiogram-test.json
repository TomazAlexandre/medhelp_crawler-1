    "question": "Thank you so much for your reply.\u00a0\u00a0Another echo test I had done listed the following. If you would be so kind what is your take on the following:1. Doppler parameters were consistent with abnormal left ventricular relaxation (grade 1 diastolic dysfunction).2. Left atrium: The atrium was mildly dilated.3. Mitral valve: Mild regurgitation.Is this something to worry about and could this be reversible (diet, exercise, etc..)?Thanks again!",
