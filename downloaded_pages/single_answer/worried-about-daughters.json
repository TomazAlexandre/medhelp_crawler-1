    "question": "I am a mother and have PCOS. My daughters are 10 & 7. I know there is a 50/50 chance of them developing PCOS and I was just wondering if there is any testing I could or should have done on them to detect PCOS. I know earlier detection and treatment can help possibly prevent complications of PCOS such as diabetes and heart disease, but I'm just not sure when and what tests to ask for.",
