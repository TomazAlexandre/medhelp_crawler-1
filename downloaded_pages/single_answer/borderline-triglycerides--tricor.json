            "answer": "HelloCongratulations on being proactive to manage your health. I speak extensively to African American American groups about increasing our awareness of risk factors for heart attack and stroke. In general we have 2-3x risk for having a stroke when we develop hypertension and diabetes. These disorders can affect virtually every organ in the body including the eyes, the brain with a stroke, the kidneys with kidney failure and increases the risk of amputation significantly.Unfortunately, the earlier in life these disorder occur, the greater the chance for these complications. I understand patients and families reluctance to take medications because of concerns about side affects. Ideally, it would be great if everyone could eat a low fat diet, maintain ideal body weight, exercise daily. It would eliminate the need to take many medications. However, until this occurs- you need tight control of your blood pressure to prevent heart attack stroke or congestive heart failure.As you know, the combination of birth control and hypertension increases your risk of stroke significantly. You should be thoroughly evaluate for diabetes with fasting insulin and HgbA1CI would encourage you to find a PCP who is listens to you and is interested in helping your develop a healthy lifestyle plan which might allow you to decrease or eliminate your need for medication over time. Check out my book Your Guide to Optimal Health at www.personalwellnesswheel.com. It is meant to provide you with a plan on how to attack this problem and live a healthy life using traditional and alternative therapies.Good Luck!!",
