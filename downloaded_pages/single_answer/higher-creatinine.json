            "answer": "Hi,Increased creatinine may indicate the decreased ability of the kidneys to filter fluid. This could be due to underlying medical conditions such as hypertension or diabetes in your father's case. What other tests were done?\u00a0\u00a0Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), creatinine clearance test, x-rays or scans, and sometimes even biopsies of the kidneys will also help. Dialysis will be considered if the GFR result is low. Talk to your doctor about this, ask questions about the test results and know other treatment options they are considering. Take care and do keep us posted.",
