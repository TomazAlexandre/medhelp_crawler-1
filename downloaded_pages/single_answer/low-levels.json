            "answer": "Hi, how low was the platelet count? was anemia ruled out? anemia can cause symptoms of weakness and easy fatigability. So, check with your doctor to rule out this condition. These symptoms could also be due to diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism. I would advise you to consult your doctor for an evaluation of the thyroid profile and blood sugar status. In the meantime, try to take good balanced meals with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, ensure to exercise regularly and keep yourself happy. Good luck with your therapy. Regards.",
