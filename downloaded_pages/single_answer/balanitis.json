            "answer": "The bottom line is that your GP appears to be on the right track.\u00a0\u00a0No STD is likely the cause of this problem.\u00a0\u00a0Here is my reasoning.Balanitis is not a specific medical condition.\u00a0\u00a0It is a nonspecific term, meaning inflammation of the head of the penis.\u00a0\u00a0It is more common in uncircumsized men, i.e. under the foreskin. There are several potential causes, but the two most common forms are yeast infection and nonspecific irritation, perhaps caused by bacterial overgrowth.\u00a0\u00a0Technically, some STDs could cause balanitis -- for example, a herpes outbreak under the foreskin technically is herpetic balanitis.\u00a0\u00a0But nobody uses that terminology, garden variety balanitis -- which is what you have -- is not an STD problem.\u00a0\u00a0The negative STD tests you have had provide further reassurance.That your problem tends to improve with anti-fungal (i.e., anti-yeast) treatments supports the idea that yeast is the cause. To answer one of your specific questions, it indeed is possible you and your partner are sharing a genital yeast infection.\u00a0\u00a0Such infections are not classified as STD, however, because genital yeasts are just as commonly acquired by nonsexual means.\u00a0\u00a0Although it is true that diabetes and certain other illnesses can predispose to yeast infections, the vast majority of such infections occur in people with no know predisposition and no important underlying health problem.You should continue to work with your GP, in concert with your partner and her health care provider, to sort this out.\u00a0\u00a0Additional treatment may be necessary; for example, perhaps you both could be treated with an oral anti-yeast treatment like fluconazole.\u00a0\u00a0If this doesn't work out and the problem persists, you and your partner could have a joint appointment at your local genitourinary medicine clinic.\u00a0\u00a0(I'm guessing you're in the UK, where the term \"GP\" remains in more common use than most countries.\u00a0\u00a0The UK GUM clinics are the world's best system for STD care and, as the name implies, also for any genital area health problem.)In the meantime, don't lose a lot of sleep over this. It's not an STD, and nothing that is a serious threat to your health.I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes-- HHH, MD",

    "question": "In March, I developed a red, sensitive area on the head of my penis. It had well defined edges and covered roughly half of the head, extending down right underneath the head. For 1-2 days prior to its appearance, the area was sensitive and slightly itchy. Once the red patch became visible it lasted for several days before I visited a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0My GP almost immediately diagnosed it as Balanitis (visually). He prescribed Ketoconozole cream and it improved after several days. There were never any raised bumps/sores or open skin and it looked like pictures I have seen of Balanitis. It was at times shiny and somewhat flaky.It reappeared in July and again in Oct. I reapplied the Keto each time, and it again improved within 1-2 wks. Each time it appeared in almost exactly the same pattern/location with same severity. My concern is that this is being caused by something other than Balanitis (herpes?). There were never any of the classic signs of herpes, and no other symptoms beyond the localized redness, itchiness and sensitivity on my penis (no pain/burning during urination). I was tested in Jan. for HSV 1 & 2 (neg). I was also tested in Aug. for HIV and Hep A/B (not HSV), all neg. I have been having unprotected sex with my GF since Dec. She claims to have been tested for STDs 2x over the past yr and that she has not been sleeping with anyone else. Could this be caused by a yeast infection from her?My GP insisted it was unlikely to be caused by an STD and that it was normal for it to recur. I believe I had my glucose levels tested a while back and they were OK, I eat well, exercise and am in good shape, so I do not think diabetes is the cause. I am circumcised, and have read that Balanitis is more common in uncircumcised men. I have an appt. with a urologist next week, but have been worried about this. Is it normal for Balanitis to recur in the same place? What are the chances this is caused by an STD?\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps I stopped applying the cream too early? Thanks!",
