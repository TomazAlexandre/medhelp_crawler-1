            "answer": "Hello,In your case, polyneuropathy can be responsible for erectile dysfunction. When blood vessels and nerves which control erection, are damaged, they do not communicate properly and the blood flow to penis tissue is impaired. This causes erectile dysfunction. Drugs like sildenaphil citrate may help but must be taken under medical supervision.It is not safe to use penile rings because they may cause trauma to the penis.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
