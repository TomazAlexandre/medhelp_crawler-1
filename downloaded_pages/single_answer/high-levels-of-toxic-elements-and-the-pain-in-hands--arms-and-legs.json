            "answer": "Hi,How are you?High levels of tin can occur in the body through contaminated drinking water, food, inhaling tin fumes or dust.Tin can cause neurological problems also apart from skin irritation, anemia, stomach aches, respiratory and eye irritation.The presence of tin can be detected by blood tests, urine and stool test. The equipment is not normally present in the doctor\u2019s office and you may have to request it.Hope this is helpful.",

    "question": "I just got the result of my hair analysis and the result shows that my tin level is 20.5 times as high as the normal level and my cadmium level is 7.5 times as high as the normal level.I've been having this weird pain in my hands, arms and legs for about four month. Especially my legs are so bad. My legs tingle, get an electric like sharp pain, get muscle crump for no reason. And some muscles and tendons get being pulled for no reason. Around my knees, I feel a burning sensation and the area is sensitive to touch from time to time. And also I can't wear anything tight because it worsens the symptoms. And also my legs twitch and they are sensitive to heat, and from my knees down, my legs get extremely cold. I didn't have any injury before my legs started having pain.The pain just started for nor reason so suddenly.Even though I strated feeling some pain in my legs back in April, it's been two month since I haven't been able to walk so normaly. I've been using a cane to be able to walk. Sometimes, if I feel a real sharp pain in my achili's heel, I can't stand. And if that happens, I need to crawl on the floor.Well, I took so many blood tests and a MRI for brain to check what's causing the symptoms. But the results show that I don't have any problems. I don't have any vitamine something deficiency, don't have diabetes, don't have a thyroid problem, don't have a high blood pressure, don't have high cholesterol, and don't have anemia, dont' have any kind of muscle disorders, MS, and other kind of disroders that my PCP could find through blood tests.I'm a 34 year old female who weighs 97 pounds and who is 5 feet tall.I've seen a doctor of internal medicine, neurology and rheumatology and they've told me that the symptoms I have are not normal. So they don't really know what they need to do.Anyway, I orderd this hair analysis kit to check my toxic and nutrient elements and I got the result yesterday and I found that two of the toxic elements which are tin and cadmium are really high. Also some other elements are a little bit high but they are not like the first two toxic element but they are less than twice as high as the normal level. They are mercury, magnesium and strontium. And my cobalt level is actually lower than the normal level.Well, I used to smoke cigarette. So I don't find so surprising to see my cadmium level is high. But I really don't know how I got tin so much inside my body. I do believe that the high level of tin has to do with the weird symptoms I have in my legs. But still I can't believe that the tin level is 20 times as high. Is that normal???? Can the level of tin cause some kind of weird pain in my body so badly?And I also want to know if someone can suggest to me what kind of test I should take next. What part of my body do I need to get checked? What kind of doctors do I need to see?Thank you for your help.",
