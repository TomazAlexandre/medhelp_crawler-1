    "question": "Hello you,I am a healthy young woman (23),normalweight (115 lbs),non-diabetic and I have this (most intercurrent and again disappearing symptoms) for a few years now.I remember when it all started very suddenly with panic attacks which felt like being shaky,nauseous,being poisened or hypoglycemic and a strong need for something to eat immediately, but it turned out that my blood sugar level is always okey in these situations,also my blood pressure except for the fast pulse rate,but after all, eating something makes it better.There are times when I often have these kind of panic attacks and always something to eat with me,but there are also longer times when almost nothing happens to me.Then I have this fits which are definitively the worst symptoms I have.I have them approximately three to seven times a year.They could last from a half day to two or almost three and it comes very suddenly and without any reason to me.I begin to feel very nauseous,like my stomach wants to be pulled out itself but I can`t vomit.I have also a very fast heart beat,sometimes also a mild heightened blood pressure,a feeling of extreme weakness,kind of delirium-like symptoms in my head (films,bizarre thoughts in head,altered consciousness)and the feeling of almost dying,almost seeing black in front of the eyes.I then have to eat many dextrose cubes immediately,which make the symptoms all a bit better and when the nausea is also a bit better I start to eat like a machine and all day long.If I dont eat that amounts of food I feel very bad and with the time it slowly gets better due to the eating attacks.Then after some time the fit is over. (lasting between 12 hours and 2,3 days)But I often have some mild mental confusions and changes left for some time when a fit is gone by...Surprisingly I don`t really gain weight with this problems,my weight is very stable and doesn`t change much.I also have:-troubles concentrating since I was a child (chronic) and very mild autism-like behaviour periods (being obsessed with a special interest withouth knowing the reason why and living bit in my \"own world\" )-hyperactivity (chronic)-insomnia-bipolar symptoms-fast occuring and resolving paranoid and obscure thoughts,but recurring very often sometimes,and after it I have insight in them-\"films\" in my head (head or pseudo halluzination)-lightheadedness-kind of short absences, I think-short spells of tongue biting or troubles swallowing-eye,face and arm twitches often lasting for days-irritability-short periods of confusion-panic attacks,anxiety-being very quiet-personality changesYes I know the mental list is quite long and it is also very difficult for psychiatrists to diagnose me correctly,also had no psychologic trauma and mentally healthy parents..My bloodwork has always been okey and I also have no diabetes and good liver,kidney and thyroid values.MRT was also withouth a result,which made me quite wondering because of concentration problems,right-left problems and sometimes neuro stuff....Any idea?thank yousweetwoman :)",
