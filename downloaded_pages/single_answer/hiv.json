    "question": "I've been exposed to someone's body fluids (yes, in a \"real\" way), and I've been experiencing lots of symptoms. My blood tests say I don't have syphilis, no hepatitis, no high cholesterol, no diabetes, poop test came out negative (no protozoa or helmints), everything seems to be ok... but I've got more than\u00a0\u00a046% lymphocyte count (high), when, according to the lab, normal rate goes from 20 to 30%. Can this be caused by early HIV?* HIV test came out negative soon after exposure. I'll get re-tested but can't wait to know what this can be!",
