    "question": "HiI have recently been feeling funny when I have a lot of sugary sweets or drinks.\u00a0\u00a0For example a couple of glasses of coke.\u00a0\u00a0The feeling is difficult to explain and the best i can explain it is almost as though i am a little bit tipsy (not the sillyness but more of the funny vision).I have also lost 3 pounds in the last two weeks and have not changed my eating habits or increased excercise.I have had a diabetes test about a year ago because i was always thirsty but it came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor put it down to lanzoprozole (excuse the spelling) that i have been taking.\u00a0\u00a0Someone has recently told me that you have to fast before a test, the Doctor did an on the spot test so i never went on a fast, would this effect the results?Should I go back to the Doctors for another test or could it be something else?Thanks",
