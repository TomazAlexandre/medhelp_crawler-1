            "answer": "Hormone changes can cause all kinds of problems. When I went into menopause I gained about 15 lbs. Now that I'm settled into it (no periods for the past 3 + years) I've had more success at getting the weight back down and I feel better. Perhaps your thyroid is acting up too. That can be checked with a simple blood test. In the meantime, try to eat healthy food, smaller portions and keep on moving. Don't give up. It's so hard but you don't want to add type 2 diabetes to this. Take care.",

    "question": "Since my hysterectomy I am gaining weight so fast. Nothing that I do has helped. I am starting to have back and neck trouble as a result of carrying so much weight. I have been walking that has done nothing to help with the weight gain. Can anyone give me some suggestions as to what I can do. Getting a little depressed about this.",
