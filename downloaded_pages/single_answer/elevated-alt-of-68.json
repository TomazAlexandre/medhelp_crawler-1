    "question": "In a recent bloodwork after experiencing a sharp pain in my lower right flank and abdomen which my doctor assumed was a kidney stone, my ALT came back at 68. All other items (AST etc...) were well within their ranges. I've had my gall bladder removed years back. I rarely drink, don't pop pills other than Viagara and do not have diabetes. Hepatitis tests came back negative although an ultrasound showed a mildly fatty liver. Could that be the cause? If so, what can I do other than diet and exercise to lower this? If the fat level drops, will the ALT drop with it?",
