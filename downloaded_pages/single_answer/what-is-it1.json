            "answer": "Hi there.This is really an unusual situation.\u00a0\u00a0From what you have described, you may have had an immune phenomenon related to the vaccination you received.\u00a0\u00a0There could have been antibodies produced towards your own cells or tissues (may be towards the nerves or muscles) that eventually caused your symptoms of some sort of paralysis.Another uncommon condition is tetanus.\u00a0\u00a0This would lead to stiff muscles and hyperexcitability leading to stiffness and seizure like symptoms.For the autoimmune phenomenon, treatment with IVIg may help diminish the symptoms, and I suggest you discuss this angle with your doctor.Regards.",
