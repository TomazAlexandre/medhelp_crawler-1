    "question": "recently i experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath. Bowel movements stopped and when I did have one they were very small. Upper and lower GI were normal. Echo stress test was normal. Blood work showed slightly elevated WBC and elevated monocytes. Chest film showed interstitial prominence. CT showed mild emphasema but 2 lymph nodes the largest being 1.5 cm.(hylar and mediastinal) No suspicious pulmonary nodules. My first thought was 10 years of proton pump inhibitors blocking the intrinsic factor affecting B12 absorption.\u00a0\u00a0B12 is the only thing that helps. Antibiotics didnt help. Extreme exertional dyspnea. Any suggestions",
