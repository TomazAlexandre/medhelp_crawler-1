Sometimes the lumps are very sore, sometimes I don't notice them... I don't know if they're knots in my muscle or lymph nodes or what they are.I had a doctor check them out and he said if they're lymph nodes, then they are very small lymph nodes, maybe fatty deposits.",

    "question": "To start, I appreciate you taking the time to read this. I don't know much about cancer. I just know that so far doctors have not been able to give me reasons for my symptoms, and I'm starting to wonder what it may be.I am a 30 year old man.I have had mild upper left chest / back / shoulder / neck pain for about half a year. It seems to be mainly focused around my chest and back now. I have also noticed that I have several small lumps, possibly swollen lymph nodes in my left armpit / around my left chest. Previously, I have had swollen lymph nodes in my left neck.The pain is like pin pricks sometimes... like someone drilling their finger into my chest. Other times, I have pain like muscles are cramping across my chest and back. I want to believe that this pain is related to my posture or the way I drive or something. Because it only occurs when I'm living at work and seems to be triggered when I am holding the wheel with my left hand (rolling my arm forward, over my shoulder / at my shoulder). When I leave my work location for a week or two, it's almost like the pain or tightness releases. When I come back, it gradually returns.I am repeatedly getting ILL (not just a cold). I get flu-like symptoms about every 2-3 months it seems. I stay severely sick for about 1 week after getting infected. Each time, it seems to be getting more severe.Following my most recent illness, I have begun to experience what I would assume are severe night sweats. Yesterday, I went to bed. I woke up 1 hour later with my bed and pillow soaking wet from my chest, armpits, neck, and head. My body was also covered in sweat in these areas. I toweled off, and went back to bed without a problem. Tonight, I went to bed. Again I woke up 1 hour later with the same problem. Only this time, I went back to bed and woke up again 1 hour later with the same problem.Keep in mind, I have brought up the chest pain to my doctors (4 of them so far), and each one of them freaked out (rightfully so) and tested my heart at first. I have had many stress tests and a ct angio - all came back with a fully functional / normal heart. ...so i'm starting to think that this is not cardiac-related pain.I have had upper GI testing done. I have reflux, a moderate - large hiatal hernia, and gall stones (gall bladder still healthy). ...these are issues, but they don't explain all of my symptoms.I have had blood tests, chest and neck x-rays (several).I have not had risky sexual activity. I have been with the same woman for years and I am confident that she is faithful. I have had a full STD panel done, checked for Diabetes, Thyroid, Cholesterol, Liver, Kidneys, Blood Sugar - all came back normal.Can standard blood testing point toward / indicate possible Cancer?Does this sound like I need further testing on anything?Any thoughts or suggestions?I apologize if this is a bit rambling, I am tired from the night sweats messing with my sleep and desperate for answers on this. Thanks for your time.",
