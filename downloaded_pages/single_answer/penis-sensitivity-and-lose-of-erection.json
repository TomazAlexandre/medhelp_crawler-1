    "question": "ok so im a 19 year old male and ive been masterbating since i was around age 13 and i masterbated about 1-2 times a day including now the first time ive had sex was my last week being 17. when i was having sex i noticed i kept going soft during sex while wearing a condom and when someone gives me oral sex i can never finish. i recently got another sex partner and i dont use condoms we use spermicide because of my problem. this works but i only last 2-5 minutes so it is aggravating but im afraid i lost sensitivity in my penis because of all the masterbation. is there anyway to get it back? i havent masterbated in almost 2 weeks but the problem still occurs is there a pill that will help me? please helpthanks",
