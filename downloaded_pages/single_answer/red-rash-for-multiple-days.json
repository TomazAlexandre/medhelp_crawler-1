            "answer": "Hi,How are you? What other symptoms are present? It is good that the initial tests and evaluation of your dermatologist are fine. Aside from allergic reaction, it could also be due to infection, skin conditions or underlying medical conditions such as kidney and liver diseases, neurological issues or diabetes. Take care and do keep us posted with the biopsy result. Best regards.",

    "question": "I have a rash that started on my feet 4 days ago, the rash stayed around for the day then got better but never completely disappeared . It then moved to my hands and know three days later it has crawled up my torso and up my arms. The rash is red and slightly itchy and burning. I'm on clarinex for 5 days and it only cuts the edge off of it. My derm looked at it and took a biopsy to see if its urticaria vasculitis. All my blood test came back normal a week prior which tested sed rate and ANA.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any other ideas as I wait for the biopsy results.",
