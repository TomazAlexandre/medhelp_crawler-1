    "question": "I am a 20 year old virgin female and I started urinating frequently about 3 months ago (a lot every hour or so) and did a urine test at my doctor which came up clean.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabetes or a UTI.\u00a0\u00a0She said it was probably just stress, but it didn't go away, so I went back a few weeks later.\u00a0\u00a0I had an ultrasound of my bladder and it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor made me do another urine test and a little bit of blood showed.\u00a0\u00a0She doesn't know what it could be and I don't know what is wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0It has been going on for a few months now and it is really quite annoying having to go to the washroom constantly.\u00a0\u00a0What could it be?",
