    "question": "Hi,I am looking for someone who has diabetes and going through the fertility treatment. I am hoping that I will find someone going through the same journey as I am.I am using glyboride 15-20 mg/day, glumetza 1000mg/day (metformin) for my diabetes. With the fertility treatment my Dr. put me on Dexamethosone and Femara, then on Prometrium after I ovulated. However, with these medications excluding femara I have noticed my blood sugar has sky rocketed. It worries me knowing that my sugar is so high while I am trying to get pregnant. Now I am not sure if I should be on insulin during the treatment to keep the sugar level in control. I will have to be on it anyway if I get pregnant. I had used insulin during my fertility treatment over 4 years ago which resulted in a succesful pregnancy. However, I only used Femara at that time.Does Insulin have less interaction with the fertility drugs than the other medications?Can anybody please share their thoughts on this?",
