    "question": "Hi everyone,I am in my twenties and twice a week I eat a lot of candy and cookies etc. I know it's not good, so i am really trying to get a grip on my eating habbit. I also eat fruit, green tea, vegetables, fish and other healthy food. I never drink coffee and tea with sugar. The problem is when I eat cookies and candy I eat a lot of it in one hour like when i am watching tv.I know my blood sugar level most be very high then and I wonder if this is extra bad for me cause my pancreas has to work hard then. I also know white bread, pasta etc has a high gly index but I never eat this, always whole greans. Recenlty I have been eating foods with low gly index more and also mung bean noodle, glassnoodles. Would it be a good idea to eat mung bean noodles three times a day instead of bread? Cause when i eat bread i eat it with chocopaste, cheese or other sweet or salt things.I am slim, excerise daily for like 30 minutes and have no diabetes in my family. The thing is i have to get up at night two times to pee or sometimes even more, and I noticed i have to pee more when i eat more sweets. Is this because there is to much insuline and my body has to pee it out?does anybody know if eating food with a lot of sugar and a high gly index in a short time is extra harmful for my pancreas and blood sugar level?",
