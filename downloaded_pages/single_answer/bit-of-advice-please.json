            "answer": "Hi!Since, you usually have a period every month and this is the first time they have got delayed for so long, it is important to rule out ectopic pregnancy. You can get this diagnosed through a blood pregnancy test and an ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis. Other than this, may be you have polycystic ovaries which have become symptomatic now, or probably hypothyroidism or severe anemia or diabetes. Excess weight gain or weight loss can also be the cause. A comprehensive investigation may be required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
