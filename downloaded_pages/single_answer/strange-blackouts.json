    "question": "Hi,Over the years, I have had a sudden surge of nausea, sharp headache to the left of my temple, which is just the beginning, then it climaxes. I am fully conscious, I feel fatigue, fever, my vision goes fuzzy and there is a splash of colors then everything goes black. I have full mobility, walk, drink water, everything, and I discovered if I sit down and fixate my head towards the ground, then my vision regains and all of my symptoms go away. I have already been tested for diabetes and it's been clean. Is it heat exhaustion? I'm not sure, if you could post any ideas that would be great!Thanks. (also I am underweight for my age I don't know if this will help)",
