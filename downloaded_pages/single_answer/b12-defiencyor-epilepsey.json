    "question": "I have started having B12 injections with my doctor ..who has diagnosed me with reactive\u00a0\u00a0hypoglcemia .All my life i have had allergies/eczema etc and at age 14 i had a head injury (frontal) and 3 months later started having what was dianosed as petit mal epileptic seizures .For 34 years i took 1mg of Rivotril( clonezapam).In 2004 I saw a neurologist who gave me an EEG and said he could not see Epilepsey but that it could still be there and was now called myoclonic epilepsey.He said if i had further symptoms he would try me on Epilum but as i had tried that drug when it first came on the market and did not have any success with it i didnt want to do that .He started to withdraw me off the Rivotril.This took 6 months to do.In 2005 i was off them totally and symptom free and then in 2006 the symptoms that i have always called \" The Jumps\" ( petit Mal) came back..excercise seems to exacerbate it and especially in the mornings and as i go to the gym every morning it is very disruptive to my lifestyle.I have had a blood test for food intolerances of which there were many that were positive and also for hypoglyceamia which was also positive and also CDI ( cranial diabetes insipudus )was picked up through these tests.The CDI is under control now through a nasal spray.I am also on an elimination diet and have been for the last 6 months.Initially the B12 injections worked really well but i am still having symptoms although not as often and i would value another opinion as i dont really want to go back to taking RivotrilThankyouRegardsDeb",
