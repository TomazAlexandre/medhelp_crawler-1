            "answer": "I'm assuming they're talking about gestational diabetes. Did you take the 1 hour test? If so, you might have just failed that. If you did, it's not terrible because they'll have you do a 3 hour test and you could pass that. More or less just watch your diet and intakes. Sorry I can't be of more help. I'm sure someone else who has/had it will be able to tell you better of what to cut out and eat.",
