            "answer": "Hello,This tingling sensation can be due to excessive masturbation causing nerve compression. Tingling sensation of the penis can be due to anxiety, contact dermatitis, traumatic damage to the nerves of penis, diabetes, prostatitis, genital herpes, urethritis and STD\u2019s like Gonorrhea and Syphilis but they are less likely in your case.I would suggest you to keep the area clean and wear cotton underwear. Also apply a mild steroid cream on the penis. If the symptoms persist then the above said conditions have to be ruled out. Please consult a urologist in that case.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "I'm an 18 year old male, and whenever as of today and yesterday , after masturbating i still have this tingling feeling right below the head of my penis ( right above where the stem meets the head). Its a pleasant feeling, as if i am being sexually stimulated ,even when my penis is flaccid, though at this point it is irritating as i cannot NOT focus on the feeling--its a bit distracting. I've tried masturbating again and again ( with false hope that this feeling is because of pent up sexual tension) but to no avail i still have the tingly sensation. It is not painful, does not burn or even hurt in any way, shape ,\u00a0\u00a0or form. I masturbated 5 times today ( i normally don't masturbate this often, at most once per day if even that) because of the sensation. Could this be a problem or infection? I'm a virgin and with no history of STI's or STDs.",
