    "question": "Who: 50 year old woman from Eastern Europe in good health.Symptoms:Has had mild leg pain for the past 4 years. Recently, the pain has increased in her right leg, and the leg is unable to support her, she cannot put any weight on it. The pain is from her foot all the way up to her hip. It does not seem to be centered around her knee.Doctors: She has been to doctors in her country, but no one has been able to give a diagnosis. She has tried physical therapy, but that did not help. She tried Icy Hot analgesic cream which seemed to help the pain somewhat.Other symptoms:I could not find any other symptoms. She has no skin, digestive, lung, back, urinary, or female health issues. She has no history of injury and no recent trauma or emotional issues.Diagnosis??What in the world could this be? Is this a symptom of some disease? Is this rheumatoid arthritis? Is this nerve damage? Any ideas?Thanks!-Kelly",
