    "question": "I have a question about my 4.5yr old son. My son has always drank more than he eats and urinates more than other kids. We had urine tests done a few months ago and the first came back positive for elevated protein but not sugar. Subsequent tests and blood tests have come back fine. My wife and I are still nervous because of the drinking and urinating but also that he still naps. He is definately not a lazy kid, but still likes to nap almost every day. He is very small and doesn't gain much weight. What are your guys opinions on his symptoms. I know you aren't doctors but any help would be great.Thanks.",
