            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The numbness could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar nerve at the elbow level. Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause numbness of little and ring finger.Since you have extreme dizziness now there is every possibility that you have compression of the cervical spinal nerves. This can happen due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, herniated disc, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. The treatment is to remove the compression. You have to discuss the best treatment option with a neurologist, which can range from medication to physiotherapy to traction, cervical collars or even surgery.Alternatively you can visit a chiropractor or a physical therapist and learn some exercises which you can do to relieve the compression.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "To begin with, I have an overactive vagal nerve. It causes me to faint or pass out easily. I've had experiences where I just wake up and I'll be walking around, just fine and dandy for about ten minutes, then all of a sudden, everything seems to.. just go down hill. I'll find myself in front of the toilet in a cold sweat, no energy, and severe nausea. On occasion, I'll even throw up whatever is in my stomach.But that isn't what I'm worried about. That's hereditary. Lately, I've been dizzy. Just, abnormally dizzy. I'll be fine one second, then I'll turn my head and feel like I'm about to fall over. Today, not only was I dizzy, I could barely breathe. It was strange. It felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen in my system.. like my heart wasn't pumping enough. Then my pinky and ring finger on both hands were tingling.I took about a two hour nap, and now I'm fine.I don't understand whats going on.",
