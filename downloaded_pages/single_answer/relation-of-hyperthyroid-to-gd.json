    "question": "Is there a relation between gestational diabetes, and postpartum thyroid problems ? I had GD, and forgot to get checked at my 6 week apptment to make sure it was all okay. 5 months later i went to my family doc with a skin rash, and blood tests revealed overactive thyroid. I have a thyroid ultra sound soon, and have been refered back to the same doc that treated me for GD.Is it possible that i have diabetes and the thyroid thing is a symptom of that?",
