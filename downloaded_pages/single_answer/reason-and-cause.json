            "answer": "Hello Dear,People with diabetes can develop nerve problems at any time, but risk rises with age and longer duration of diabetes. Diabetic neuropathies also appear to be more common in people who have problems controlling their blood glucose, also called blood sugar, as well as those with high levels of blood fat and blood pressure and those who are overweight.Hyperglycemia causes increased levels of intracellular glucose in nerves, leading to saturation of the normal glycolytic pathway. Extra glucose is shunted into the polyol pathway and converted to sorbitol and fructose by the enzymes aldose reductase and sorbitol dehydrogenase. Accumulation of sorbitol and fructose lead to reduced nerve myoinositol, decreased membrane Na+/K+-ATPase activity, impaired axonal transport, and structural breakdown of nerves, causing abnormal action potential propagationThe best way to prevent neuropathy is to keep your blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as possible. Maintaining safe blood glucose levels protects nerves throughout your body.For additional information about preventing diabetes complications, including neuropathy, see the Prevent Diabetes Problems Series at www.diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/complicationsBest",

    "question": "I am a 46 year old female diabetic with an A1C of 5.5. I have always averaged between 5.3 and 6.7, mostly 5.5 to 5.9. I have been diabetic since 2000. My neurologist explained the reason for my neuropathy is diabetic related; she explans that even though my A1C is good it is because my blood levels fluctuate to really high and really low. My levels\u00a0\u00a0have routinely been constant but slightly higher in the morning but still about 140 or less. She did one initial exam and history and the nerve conduction test and EMG. While I am not questioning the diagnosis, I am questioning the cause. Does this cause sound reasonable? She diagnosed it as sensorymotor polyneuropathy.",
