    "question": "Kind of a long story but I hope I will receive responses from people with similar issues. I am 24 year old female and I have ALWAYS had problems with feeling weak, shaky and tired if I skip meals. I usually will end up with a headache as well. In the morning I wake up with a headache because I have not yet eaten or had my coffee. Over the past few months I feel like my symptoms are worsening. I sweat profusely throughout the day even when I'm just doing regular household chores ie; dish washing, folding clothes or doing laundry. I am always hotter than anyone else in the room...my skin even feels hot to the touch but I do not have a fever. Another concerning symptom that has been worsening is this numbness, tingly feeling on my lips, hands and toes and very intense heart palpitations. I have a two year old son and when I became pregnant I was tested for diabetes and it came out positive. They did another test after that and it turned out negative which was quite confusing but I kind of brushed it off. Lately, around the same time everyday (5pm and after) I start feeling the numbness, tingling in my lips and my hands are shaking. I was working from 8am to 9pm for a couple months and my job consisted of typing and sometimes I felt like my tremors were so bad that I couldn't type. I am quite a hypochondriac and suffer from anxiety but these symptoms are ones that have been there for a while. I am currently taking Lamictal (mood stabilizer) and Zoloft (anti depressant) A couple of months ago (during my full time job, 45 hours a week) I went through an episode of night sweats that continued for a couple weeks and slowly tapered off. It was accompanied with no other symptoms. I am aware that anti depressants can cause night sweats but I had been on them for 6 months before I had the night sweats. I also know that anxiety can cause night sweats but I am wondering if all of these symptoms suggest diabetes or hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0I've read that low blood sugar can cause night sweats, but I was just confused that they stopped. I still sweat somewhat at night, but not as much as before. If anyone has hypoglycemia or diabetes and has had similar problems PLEASE respond and help me out :) I'd greatly appreciate it! (Sorry so long!) lol",
