            "answer": "Here is some information about PCOS from my website:www.integrativefertilitymd.comPCOS can affect 5% of all women and common symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, increased growth of hair on the body, loss of hair on the head, acne, and weight gain. Based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM sponsored Consensus Workshop Group, PCOS is diagnosed in women who meet two of the three following criteria: ovarian dysfunction (not ovulating regularly), hyperandrogenism (increased male type hormones on lab testing or clinically increased hair growth), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries which show multiple small cysts on ultrasound). PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose tolerance test.You should see your Reproductive Endocrinologist or Gynecologist to make the diagnosis.There is a diagnosis called acanthosis nigricans that is associated with PCOS and hyperinsulinemia and prediabetes, so you should ask your dermatologist about that and whether you need an insulin level and a 2 hour glucose tolerance test.",
