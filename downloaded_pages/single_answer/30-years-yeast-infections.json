            "answer": "Ugh, so sorry to read your history with the yeast infection.\u00a0\u00a0Good gosh that is a lot of yeast infections!\u00a0\u00a0Now, I always think running things by a doctor IS helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors are pretty good these days about incorporating natural remedies into what they tell you to do.\u00a0\u00a0 So, maybe a pelvic wouldn't be a bad idea especially if you haven't had one in years.I am not sure what is going on with the ph situation in your vagina.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you are doing all the right things.\u00a0\u00a0I assume you are taking a probiotic.\u00a0\u00a0I assume you never ever douche.\u00a0\u00a0You wear loose undies made of cotton and change them when they get sweaty.So, I have no idea if any of these things work but there was a girl here for a long time whose passion was naturally treating yeast infections.\u00a0\u00a0Some of her ideas seemed out there but she said they worked.\u00a0\u00a0I have NO experience with any of these so take them for what they are worth.\u00a0\u00a0She treated herself with lemon juice and she would insert garlic.\u00a0\u00a0??\u00a0\u00a0She said it worked.\u00a0\u00a0I've also heard of salt water baths.but I do really think it is time to see a doctor again.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",
