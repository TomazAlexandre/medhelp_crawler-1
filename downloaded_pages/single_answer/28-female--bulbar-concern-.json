            "answer": "Hi!Yes, symptom-wise, bulbar ALS is a possibility. However, there is no specific test for bulbar ALS. Diagnosis is by ruling out other conditions such as spinal nerve compression high up in the cervical spine, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, electrolyte disturbance, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or due to bad posture. Lyme and lupus are the other possibilities. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
