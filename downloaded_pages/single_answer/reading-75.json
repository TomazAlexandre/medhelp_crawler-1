            "answer": "I'm assuming you don't live in the U.S. so you have a different number system. 7.5 is equivalent to 135. You don't say if this test was fasting or after food; I'll assume it was after food. It is not extremely high, but most non-diabetics don't go up much past 120, so it might be indicative of something. He is right you need further testing (An A1C or an OGTT) to see what is actually going on. Some doctors think you have to present as very ill (in DKA) to be a type 1 diabetic; this is not always the case, and she could also be type 2. Those symptoms are a bit concerning, I'm sure. I'm glad the return visit is so soon so you don't have too long to worry. If worse comes to worse and she is diabetic, I recommend learning as much as you can about diabetes. It takes a lot of learning and work, especially in the beginning, but it IS a manageable condition and she can do what she wants in her life if she ends up having diabetes. Let us know!",
