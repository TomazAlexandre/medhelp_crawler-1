            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!I think you should consider the amount of alcohol you consume. Alcohol consumption increases urine production and blunts your senses. Hence when you are asleep, this sense of full bladder further reduces and bed wetting occurs. Also check if you have diabetes, which will further increase this problem. Avoid alcohol intake 3-4 hours before bedtime. Drink in moderation. Avoid totally if the problem persists.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
