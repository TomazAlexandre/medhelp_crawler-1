            "answer": "Hi Peek,We are absolutely working on allowing multiple values to be entered for several of the trackers. As you guessed, they will function more like the log structure that we'll use for tracking diabetes.We're also investigating print functionality. You can already pseudo-print using the steps listed here:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/574416It's not the best way to print, and it doesn't work for the pain tracker, but it's at least something to go on until we launch full print functionality.What's the other tracker you would like to add calcium channel blocker to? We can get that added for you.Thanks,MedHelp",

    "question": "I shall continue to bemoan the lack of ability to track multiple blood pressure and pulse entries each day, and the lack of a printer friendly mode for printing out these important results.These are 2 basic, often crucially important parameters for many of us to track and print for our doctors.\u00a0\u00a0I don't often track them here, b/c I have another site that allows me to do both.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could do it here.\u00a0\u00a0I keep an old fashioned pencil and paper around and input my values on the other site.\u00a0\u00a0I am forgetting to come here to track them.If there is an upcoming diabetes tracker, it will have to have the ability to track multiple entries during the day and night.\u00a0\u00a0Why can't this be done with BP's and pulse rates?I'm trying to use the BP tracker more consistently, but I have to choose only one time to record an entry, so I'm going to arbitrarily make it the first one of the day.Also, the \"treatment\" part...I am on a calcium channel blocker, and there are at least 2 trackers where I need to input it.\u00a0\u00a0Can any of these meds cross onto other trackers automatically?Thanks,Peek",
