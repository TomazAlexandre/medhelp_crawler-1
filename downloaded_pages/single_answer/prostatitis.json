            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Burning sensation after ejaculation is a common symptom in STD\u2019s, but it can also occur in routine urinary tract infections. Did you mean that you have an urge to urinate, but unable to pass urine? This could happen due to prostatic enlargement, which can cause obstructive symptoms and infection in the urinary tract.Get a urine analysis and culture done along with examination of the prostrate.Another possibility is diabetes, which can cause increased frequency of passing urine. And diabetes has a potential to cause urinary tract infections, because of presence of glucose in urine, which serves as nutrient for the growth of bacteria.So, it would be advisable to get a check of blood sugars and visit a urologist.All the best.",

    "question": "I\u00b4ve been suffering since maybe 6 or 7 years from a burning sensation in my urethra a couple of minutes after ejaculating and for at least half an hour. It feels a bit as if I had to urinate very badly but I don\u00b4t really have to and it doesn\u00b4t help a lot. It hurts considerably and it seems to happen more often with the years, though it still doesn\u00b4t happen always after ejaculating. I\u00b4m 30 years old and in fair shape. I do urinate more often than the usual person since quite a long time ago. I beleive unlikely the possibility of STD, I practise safe sex. (Thank you very much for your time.)",
