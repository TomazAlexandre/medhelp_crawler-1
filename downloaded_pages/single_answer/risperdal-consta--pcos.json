            "answer": "Based on my experience, I really think it can. I am so thrilled that I finally found out about PCOS because I think I might finally have the answer to what's been going on with me... acne, excessive hair growth, depression, anxiety, slight weight gain, and complete cessation of a period for the 2 yrs I was on risperdal. My theory is that the risperdal forced absence of period caused an increase in androgens, which resulted in PCOS. I am getting tested on Monday and keeping my fingers crossed that my blood work shows a positive indication of PCOS. That way, I can get into the solution and start taking Yaz, which, from what I understand, is THE b.c. for PCOS because of the ingredient spironolactane, which blocks androgens.",
