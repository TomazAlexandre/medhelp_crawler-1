            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The most probable cause for the twitching could be neuropathy, a disorder of the nerves. Most common cause for neuropathy is diabetes. It can also be due to metabolic disorders, vitamin deficiencies, and traumatic injuries. Sometimes temporal arteritis could also cause this sensation. You may need proper evaluation by your GP, please consult him for a neurological assessment.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "My right temple flutters every 20 minutes or so. It feels like a worm crawling or a butterfly flapping its wings. My medical science teacher suggested drinking orange juice for calcium to stop the muscle spasm, but it did not help. Its very annoying and it makes me feel itchy. Does anyone know the cause of it and what I could do to stop it?",
