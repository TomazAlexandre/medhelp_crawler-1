    "question": "A very good friend (of my husband's) went into Diabetic shock a week ago (he is 37, no meds, overweight, didn't know he had it. His Dad died from Diabetic complications priorly though so there must have been signs). When the parimedics came they couldn't get a reading on his blood sugar. The hosp took the reading at 2000! Paremedics said that is a record for them. So now several things have happened. He developed a fever but they said no infection. They did antibiotics anyway. Then he developed an infection anyway, which is now under control. His Kidneys have stopped working so he has been on dialysis daily. Stomach got very very bloated before dialsys. Better now. His body stopped producing white blood cells so they give him plasma a lot. He has internal bleeding so they have a drain tube down his throat into his stomach which has been bringing up blood but now they say he's bleeding from his Pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0Last night they were going in to stop it. Not sure if he is alive today, but I need to know what you all think about his situation honesty. Have you ever heard of this happening, is there any chance of him coming out of this that you see? I know you are not doctors, and please be candid. I want to be supportive of my husband during this time, but realistic of the outcome. Thanks for anything you can add. I will be checking the responses throughout the day.",
