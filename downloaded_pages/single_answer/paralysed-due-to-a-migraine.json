            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Was an EMG or nerve conduction studies done? What about an EEG? It could also be seizure activity, only an EEG (electroencephalogram) can help confirm this. This is done under the guidance of a neurologist. Also, metabolic disorders Diabetes Mellitus and Hypothyroidism could cause the symptoms described by you. A simple blood test could help detect diabetes and hypothyroidism. So, don't worry and discuss these options with your doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
