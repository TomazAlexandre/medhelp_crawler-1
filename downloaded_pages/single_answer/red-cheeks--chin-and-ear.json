            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are in menopausal age group, then this could be due to flushing. Hormone replacement therapy will help. Alcohol, certain drugs, allergy to food additives, heat intolerance, hot beverages and food, anxiety, orthostatic hypotension, certain endocrine disorders like those involving the adrenals, diabetes etc all cause facial flushing and redness. If there is a flush only during the day and after sports then it could be heat sensitivity. Apply cold compress on and off during the day. Splash a lot of cold water (not freezing cold but cool) on face on and off. See if this helps. If it does not help, consult a doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "I have suffered from red cheeks for years. The redness comes without warning, it\u00a0\u00a0begins with a light irritation under the\u00a0\u00a0right eye, then the it spreads over the cheek bone, moves down\u00a0\u00a0to the chin and from there all over the face. It's like I have a red mask but white under the eyes. The same happens with the right ear. Suddenly it becomes red, hot and\u00a0\u00a0itchy. If I rub it or scratch it becomes deeper red or almost purple.\u00a0\u00a0Cheek redness can last for several hours but the red ear for about an hour or two.If I drink alcohol this always happens, a few sips of wine or beer turns the redness on. Sometimes I get also very rapid heart rate, nasal congestion and shortness of breath, especially if I drink more than one or two glasses of wine. If I drink more than that\u00a0\u00a0the situation gets worse and can last for two days with sleep disturbances due to arrhythmia. I don't mind skipping wine, although I find in annoying not being able to drink a little wine without turning into a monster.I would like to know if somebody know this problem and what to do about it.",
