            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear that you are having such a problem. It's true that these infections are often very difficult to deal with but I would think some solution would have been found after 9 weeks. It seems that a cause and solution for the infection should be found before your mastectomy is done. The non-healing attributed to diabetes is usually due to poor circulation so I doubt that it has much to do with your current problem. I would think that the area might need to heal without being closed under these circumstances but only your treating Physician knows all the details of this particular situation. If you are having the mastectomy this coming week any opinions or advice regarding the non-healing lumpectomy area would be useless at this point. Even though it seems like a drastic measure I truly hope that it will solve your problem. Best wishes for a speedy post-op recovery.",

    "question": "I had a lumpectomy 9 weeks ago. It will not heal, I've been back to my surgeon every week since then, back to the operating table 3 more times. I had a breast reduction 22 years ago, my surgeon says that it's because of scar tissue. I am an insulin dependent diabetic for 23 years but he says my diabetes has nothing to do with it. He closes it it reopens and same four times later. I change and wash, sanitize and apply antibiotics four to five times a day with no help. The smell is revolting, a few weeks ago I developed a nasty aftertaste anytime I burp, I'm wondering is the infection in my digestive tract. I'm having a bilateral mastectomy this week. I don't know what else can be done and I can't start chemo or radiation until it heals. I'm also past the 60 day treatment start day. Help!!!",
