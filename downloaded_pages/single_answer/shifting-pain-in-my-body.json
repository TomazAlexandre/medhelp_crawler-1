    "question": "I am 41 years old. I have diagnosed diabetes 4 years back. I have been experiencing severe pain in my hip joints and cramping pain in the back for the past 6 years. While sleeping, it is very painful for me to turn around. There seems to be no fixed pattern or season for this pain. Sometimes it is in the neck, sometimes in the right of the spine, sometimes left of the spine. Sometimes it shifts to my hip joints. At that moment I have to limp. Sometimes the pain is continuous for months together, sometimes for a few weeks, sometimes I have no pain for months together. The pain as of now is very severe like cramps. When ever I reach out for something, I feel a cramping pain in my back, to the right or left of the spine. Please suggest me the reason & remedy for this unbearable pain. I have been to the ortho doctor, a rheumatologist, and a neurophysician who have had an X-Ray of my spine and an MRI also but nothing was diagnosed.",
