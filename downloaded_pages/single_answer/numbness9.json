            "answer": "Hello.Since you have to stand for long period of time, I suspect there is a disc protrusion at the lower neck level.Another possibility was alcohol related neuropathy. But this seems a distant possibility. And in alcohol related neuropathy, mostly the lower limbs are involved, and only in severe cases do the hands get involved.I would recommend that you get yourself examined by a Neurologist and get an MRI of the spine.Some disc bulging is normal, but if the disc is protruding and impinging on some nerves, it will need attention.Also get your blood sugar checked, to rule out diabetes.Regards",
