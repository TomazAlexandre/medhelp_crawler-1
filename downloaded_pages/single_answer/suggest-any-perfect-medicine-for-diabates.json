            "answer": "Hello,natural way is optimizing weight, daily exercise (including aerobic and weight training), low carb diet (maybe very low carb), which will be low carb, moderate protein and high in healthy fats.For people for whom the natural way is not enough, metformin / Glucophage is an insulin sensitizer that may be very helpful in Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0There are some other oral meds that may work ok for some.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that I believe injected insulin is the best (combined with lifestyle and low carb diet), as it gives excellent blood sugar control when properly used (and diabetes is not the problem and cause of complications - but high blood sugar is).",
