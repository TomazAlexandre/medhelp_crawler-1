    "question": "Hi all,26 year old male here.For the past week, Ive had the constant urge to urinate every 30 minutes. When I go to the washroom, I get small amounts of urine, sometimes just dribbles (but usually just a small amount).My stream during these times is pretty weak, probably because of the small amount of urine. However, when I wake up in the morning and urinate, everything is normal....I have no burning when urinating, however, I do have some burning sensation when NOT urinating... so as I type this, I have a 2 out of 10 discomfort in the head of my penis... nothing to really bother me tho.My doctor has tested for UTI, STD and Diabetes... all negative.I had an ultrasound done about 2 months ago for something unrelated... showed no abnormalities in kidneys/liver/bladder/etc....My eGFR is well above 60 and normal...When my doctor did a urine dip test, it showed traces of white blood cells and protein. He sent it off to the lab, and everything came back normal.... he said the dip test arent too reliable, and that the lab would have found anything had there been somethingThe only thing I havent had checked is prostate.... but all the doctors say Im too young (26) to even bother with that... Although Im not sure if BPH is that uncommon in younger men?Any ideas what it can be?This discussion is related to/posts/show/1341384.",
