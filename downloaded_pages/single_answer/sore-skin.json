    "question": "I'm a normal 18 year old, but lately the skin on my back has been really sore. The other day it was really sore around my waist line, and it hurt to even wear underwear. It was very painful to be touched by anyone. I've heard this is a symptom of\u00a0\u00a0type 1 diabetes. I'm also tired a lot, and my mouth is often dry. Could that be whats causing this?",
