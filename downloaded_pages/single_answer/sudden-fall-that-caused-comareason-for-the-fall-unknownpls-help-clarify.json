            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your father. It is really difficult to say what exactly happened. Cervical spondylitis can cause dizziness. It can also be due to a sudden drop in blood pressure since he was on BP medications. It could be that he just slipped and fell. Also, people who are on blood thinners like aspirin, tend to bleed a lot. So a head injury could have caused a lot of bleeding. And at times this is really difficult to manage in a sensitive area like brain. It is really difficult to say what happened. I pray God gives you the courage to deal with this tremendous loss. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "hi,My 72 year old father recently died due to brain haemorage/clots. Pls take the time to read everything below as it is very difficult for me to understand the cause of his brain damage.My father was on aspirin,clopidigrel and also on BP/statin medications on daily basis.He also has stents placed in his heart arteries 5 years back but otherwise he as very fit and healthy.His BP was always under control and he had no diabetes.Saturday-My 72 year old father reported dizziness and went to a doctor who prescribed strugen and vertin since he thought he had vertigo.Sunday through Tuesday morning - My father was normal and reported no dizzinessTuesday afternoon:My father fell down at home suddenly.He went to open the door and on his way he fell down on his back with such a force that\u00a0\u00a0he had severe brain damage and went into coma the same day.There was nothing to slip in the living room. He did not even call my mom for help before he fell.Tuesday night - Doctor had to perform an emergency surgery the same day as his brain had numerous clots/bleeding and his skull also was damaged.Neurosurgeon removed all the clots through surgery but his GCS never improved post brain surgery.His brain stem was not damaged though and his vitals were normal.Postsurgery - There were no new developments seen on CT scans post surgery.But GCS was at 4 for 10 days and never improved.He never came out of coma since his fall.After 10 days his BP reduced which had to be controlled with medicines.Also his body was very cold for many days.So in the Critical care unit,they had to put him on warmers.Then on the 11th day he died due to cardiac arrest.They tried to save him but by that time his whole body was already critical.His urine output was also very low after few days.Doctors said that even if he had survived he would have been a vegetable bcoz they usually see GCS score improving after surgery but it did not happen in my father's case.My questions are:1.What could be the reason for such a sudden bad fall?2.Can BP go high even when a person is on BP medications?However in the ambulance his BP seemed normal.Not sure if it could have shot up when he fell down?3.He had no diabetes and his cholesterol and BP was always normal.This being the case,could his carotid artery clogging cause such a blackout/fall?Not sure abt his carotid arteries though4.Wont the anticlotting medications that he was taking, prevent brain clots?5.2 weeks before his fall he had retinal detachment surgery due to herpes/varicella zoster infection.He was on valcyclovir for 6 weeks.But his eyes seemed better and improving.He never stopped plavix/aspirin even during the eye and brain surgery.Could a clot have travelled from retina/optic nerve to his brain that could have caused such a sudden fall?6.Could herpes /varicella have affected his brain before he started taking antiviral medications?7.Although my father suffered from vertigo for several years.His vertigo was temporary and relieved after taking vertin.He never reported of headaches.He also had cervical/lumbar spondylitis which was kept in control.Could this be linked to his fall?My father has never fallen before and this was our first experience.I feel that the doctor who checked him 3 days before the fall (on saturday) should have prescribed him a CT scan instead of giving him vertigo medicines.Not sure if the CT scan would have shown any brain anomalies but atleast it would have prevented his fall on Tuesday (3 days after he reported dizziness).However cannot sue the doctor too bcoz this was in a country where there is no means of suing doctors for doing such a bad job :(So this is just for my information only.Any inputs appreciated.Thanks!",
