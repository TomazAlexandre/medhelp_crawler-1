    "question": "Hi,My dad had a stroke 7 yrs back which paralyzed his left side of his body. With physiotherapy he gained mobility and could walk in 5 months (after which he started to go back for work) and he stopped his physiotherapy.However his recovery was only 50%, he cannot move his left arms and legs as good as his right.What physiotherapy exercises should be done for hands and legs (with pictures or videos) ?With physiotherapy now, is there a possibility of any more improvement ?Plus, his body is tilted towards his right after the stroke, as he exerts pressure on his right. Is there a way to get it back to normal or is this tilt permanent ?P.S: He is 64 years old now and a diabetes patient.",
