            "answer": "Hello,Relcof PE causing increased blood sugar levels is unheard of as a side effect but it has been generally advised that those who are diabetic should talk to their doctor before taking this medicine.Did you get a prior evaluation of your blood sugar levels for diabetes?I feel that if you are taking this medicine and getting such high levels of blood sugar levels,then it is better to get yourself screened for diabetes first.A consultation of an endocrinologist will be the best.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing and if you have any additional queries.",
