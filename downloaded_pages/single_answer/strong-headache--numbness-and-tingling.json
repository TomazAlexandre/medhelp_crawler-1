            "answer": "Hi,How is your father? Aside from MRI, what other tests were done? Are there other co-morbid conditions such as diabetes or hypertension? Headache, tingling and numbness are often associated with neuropathies or neurological issues. He may also benefit from further evaluation by a neurologist. Treatment will depend on the diagnosis. Complementary and alternative medicine such as acupuncture may also help. Take care and do keep us posted.",
