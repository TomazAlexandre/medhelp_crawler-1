            "answer": "Hi!Pain along one side of foot with numbness of toes can either be due to pinched nerves in ankle or due to peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes, hypothyroidism, lupus etc. Faulty foot wear can also cause nerve compression, so check this aspect. You can try dipping your feet in warm water and doing foot and toe exercises. Also rotational exercises and stretch exercises of ankle joint may help. Please consult your doctor regarding this.Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.
