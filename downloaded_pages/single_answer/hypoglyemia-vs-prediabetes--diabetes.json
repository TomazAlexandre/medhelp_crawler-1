            "answer": "\"what is the difference between hypoglycemia, prediabetes and diabetes.\"* Hypoglycemia occurs when your fasting blood sugar [glucose] dips below 60 mg/dl. Normal fasting glucose ranges are 60/70 to 99 mg/dl.* Prediabetes occurs when your fasting glucose falls between 100 to 125 mg/dl.* Diabetes is considered when fasting glucose is >126 mg/dl. Your A1c converts to an estimated daily glucose average of 123 mg/dl, a blink of an eye from diabetes land.\"I recently eliminated (90%) most high glycemic carbs but am still confused which I should eliminate altogether and which I can eat once in a while.\"Kudos on the restricting high GI carbs from your diet. You can eliminate sugar from your coffee and honey from your tea as both elevate blood sugars. Use a sweetener such as Splenda or Stevia instead.\"don't eat excessive sweets\"Huh? You either do eat, or you do not eat sweets. The latter is important with controlling your blood sugars. With diabetes or borderline diabetes a little bit does hurt, big time.\".what can I do to not become diabetic\"Your BMI of 20.9 is normal so weight is no issue. Eliminating high GI carbs is good too. The best approach to diabetes is, of course, prevention. You have to make a conscious effort towards making lifestyle changes. Making lifestyles changes to ones diet is not awful or difficult. Instead of trying to figure out what not to eat focus on what you should eat. Avoid white foods as these quickly turn into sugar after digestion. Eat quality proteins like fish and fowl, nuts and seeds, beans and legumes, fresh vegetables and small amounts of whole grains. Meats should be broiled, grilled or baked on a grated wire meshed rack to allow fats to drain and prepared with seasoning instead of breaded. Eat fruits with other foods to slow absorption of fructose [fruits sugar]. Also eat smaller meals more frequently, exercise at least one hour a day [doing cardiovascular exercises], and keep stress low with meditation. Do avoid and limit intake of foods made with white flour - breads & crackers. Also, pasta, potatoes, white rice as these are digested faster and their sugars quickly enter the blood stream.You didn't mention whether you own a home glucose test meter. You can buy one at Wal-Mart or your local drug/pharmacy store for under $15. Your best friend is your home glucose test meter. Until you can grasp which foods your body can tolerate it is extremely important to test your glucose preprandial [before a meal] and postprandial [2-3 hours after a meal]; preprandial provides a baseline while postprandial informs you how foods you ate affect your glucose levels. The postprandial levels should be <141 mg/dl, better <121 mg/dl. Normal [70-99 mg/dl] is time to celebrate. Good luck",
