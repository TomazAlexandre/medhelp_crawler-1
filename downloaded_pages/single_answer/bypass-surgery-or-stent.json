    "question": "I recently had a heart cath and discovered my LAD is blocked in several places at 70%.\u00a0\u00a0My cardiologist shared with me that a stent would have been the first choice, however, the placement of the stent would have blocked blood flow to two other arteries that run off my LAD right where one of the stents would be place and that would cause chest pain for me. We are meeting to discuss bypass surgery. I'm nervous about bypass surgery but want to do the right thing.\u00a0\u00a0Should I get a second opinion?\u00a0\u00a0I trust my cardiologist but friends and family say to get a second opion.",
