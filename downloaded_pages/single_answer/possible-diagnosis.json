            "answer": "Its hard for psychiatrists or neurologists to tell akathesia or dystonia (temporary) from tardive dyskinesia except that the first two are temporary movement disorders and tardive dyskinesia is permanent and if not stopped in time can turn into full Parkinsonian conditions such as I have including tardive psychosis (which I am under study for as a condition). A movement disorders specialist could make an informed opinion. I don't want to post doctor's names but depending where you live I could give you some referrals. Of course, if you are diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia, every known antipsychotic available except for Clozaril will worsen it so you will be switched to that. It has an unpleasent side effect profile and potential blood dyscreias and requires blood work but its effective and far better than letting tardive conditions worsen. As I've posted I am on glycine, a glutamate antagonist, a new class of antipsychotics in study that will not create tardive conditions or diabetes both risks of current antipsychotics and promotes a full recovery. My psychopharmocologist is corresponding with the hospital that first researched Clozaril (I will not post the name for confidentiality purposes) and when my study is published in a psychiatric journal I will post the links for everyone to read. However, the director of the hospital himself, a well known psychiatrist said a good predictor of tardive dyskinesia is severe akathesia as it was in me. I would strongly reccomend asking about Clozaril regardless as what you describe could likely be tardive dyskinesia or develop into it and while it is developing it can be masked by the same medications that cause it. And keep up to date with new medications in development. Here's a link that updates itself:http://www.psychmeds123.info/",

    "question": "In 2004 I was diagnosed with primary insomnia. At this point, I began taking Zyprexa 5 mg. I was on this med for 6 months. I then took 2.5 mg Zyprexa and 20 mg Celexa, for an additional 6 months. Later, I took Remeron for 6 to 8 months, then Seroquel 50 then 75 mg. After taking Seroquel for 5 weeks I began to have severe muscle spasms in my legs, primarily my right leg. I currently have symptoms such as stiffness, feelings of electric shock, cramping, muscle contractions/spasms, and pain on the bottom of my right foot which feels like I have crushed glass in my sock (this a a short description of sensations). If I lay on my back and lift my legs there are visible muscle contractions from the top of my calves to my ankles. These are very painful and constant. My legs feel best when they are at their straighest ie) standing or lying down with toes pointed up. When standing, however, my legs begins to tighten and I feel like I have glass/pins on the the bottom of my foot. I have been to several neurologists. The neurologist that I worked with for 1 year explained that I may have Restless Legs Syndrome from exposure to a dopamine antagonist. A neurologist at John's Hopkins told me I have RLS and an Akathesia. I have had 2 EMG's which were negative, and several MRIs of the spine and brain, also negative. Having read much about RLS I feel that my symptoms are more like Dystonia or Tardive Dyskinesia. Can you please give me your opinion as to my diagnosis?",
