            "answer": "Hi!Systolic hypertension or high systolic (above 140 mmHg) and normal diastolic blood pressure is due to reduced compliance of the aorta that comes with age. This increases pressure on the left ventricle, and causes hypertrophy of left ventricle and ischemia (low oxygen) to heart. If systolic hypertension is not controlled, heart may show signs of failure. Treatment includes lifestyle changes: low fat, high fiber, exercise, etc. You need to keep cholesterol levels in check with diet and medications. If you have diabetes or are overweight, you have to keep that in check.Please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!",
