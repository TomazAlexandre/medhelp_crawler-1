    "question": "I have been having a lot of pain and movement in my stomach after completing medication for the treatment of gastristis. For the last three weeks I have had diarrhea. I have been back and forth to my doctor with new and continuing complaints of various symptoms. She don't seem to take my complaints serious. I have experienced severe stomach cramping, leg, back, groin and buttock pains. She continues to prescribe me pain medication without finding out what the pain is coming from. I have a series of medical problems. Diabetes, Thyroid, and DJD. I finally convenienced her to prescribe me ointment for my rectum pain. After about 5 minutes, my rectum and stomach is in severe pain. I am very concerned about this rectum pain, because I thought the ointment was to make me feel better, not worst. Has anyone experienced this?",
