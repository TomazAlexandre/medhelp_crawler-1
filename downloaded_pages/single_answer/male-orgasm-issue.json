    "question": "I'm 47 and for the past year I'm unable to feel the sensation of an orgasm but I do ejaculate. I've been thru several tests with my urologist but no change in my condition. He relates the issue to my prostate but didn't see the need to prescribe anything. He said it would resolve on it's own, it hasn't. I have Crohns disease and don't know if the 2 are related. any ideas?",
