            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!Your symptoms could be due to benign intracranial hypertension, a condition in which there is \u201cRaised intracranial pressure in the absence of a mass lesion or of hydrocephalus.\u201d Please refer for more detailed information: http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/40000790/Since you have visual disturbances, it will be fruitful to consult an eye specialist. A headache predominantly in the neck area along with dizziness could also be due to cervical spondylosis. However this will not cause visual problems.The other thing you should look at is a carotid artery problem. This artery supplies the brain. \u201cOther signs or symptoms of a carotid artery blockage may be\u2022\tWeakness or paralysis of your arm, leg, or face on one side of your body.\u2022\tNumbness or tingling of your arm, leg, or face on one side of your body.\u2022\tTrouble swallowing.\u2022\tLoss of eyesight, or blurry eyesight in one eye.\u2022\tDizziness, confusion, fainting, or coma.\u201dRefer for detailed information: http://www.texheartsurgeons.com/CarotidDisease.htmYour symptoms could be due to a single problem or a combination of problems. You need to consult a neurologist and an eye specialist. Thyroid disorders and diabetes should also be ruled out.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss this with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am really worried. I have had this dizzy sensation since having my baby. I have had the work up from an ENT who was really quiet the rude doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a CT scan of the head and sinuses. I went to a neurologist that said I had migraines, and sent me on my way with medicine for that and an anti-depressant.\u00a0\u00a0(Which I am not taking) I had numbness and tingling and that has since gone away.\u00a0\u00a0My whole head feels like it is going to explode and I find it hard to concentrate.\u00a0\u00a0The back of my neck is painful and I am just so confused on what is wrong.\u00a0\u00a0I have found myself not doing my job as well and that I am jumbling my words.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said it could be an inner ear thing and possibly my allergies, but I am doubtful.\u00a0\u00a0 I also have had major changes in my vision.So I am wondering if anyone else has had this problem or if anyone has any suggestions.I have done the whole sinus type things to see if things would clear up but have not been successful!",
