            "answer": "You asked a question about a similarly outlandish scenario 2 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0That time you worried about catching HIV from a stylist cutting your hair.Needle sharing is a risk only among injection drug users, and it requires shaing hollow needles that can retain blood inside the needle.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, it isn't possible you had a sufficiently traumatic needlestick to catch HIV without even knowing it.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody in the world has ever caught HIV in the way you describe here and you are not going to be the first.\u00a0\u00a0You should not be tested on account of this event.Please do some reading on your own to understand the real risks for HIV.HHH, MD",

    "question": "Dr. EWH / HHH,I wanted to ask you about a possibility of exposure through needle prick. I was on a plane coming back from a trip and had an isle seat by lavatory - high traffic area, people walking back and forth and often making contact with my shoulder. I fell asleep and when I woke up I had a little painful sensation in my shoulder - the area resembled something like a mosquito bite (little raised area, maybe it is a newly forming pimple - not sure but mosquito is out of question). But what I thought was - what if someone had a needle in a pocket that got exposed and poked me while the person was standing on line next to me? Maybe the person had some medical condition like diabetes and does insulin shots or something else. I know it's a \"what if\" question but I thought that in general if needle sharing is a known way to transmit the virus - what if something like the situation that I described took place? So I thought I'll ask you if that would be considered to be a risk of HIV transmission in case the person is positive or if the same needle could prick someone who's positive before? I didn't see any blood stains/drops on the inside of my shirt so I guess even if the occurrence that I'm describing took place the needle didn't go deep enough - does that change things? Do I have any reason for concern here? In general - would such exposures be considered a risk? I wanted to clear things up for myself since I know that needle sharing is considered to be a risk.Thank you.",
