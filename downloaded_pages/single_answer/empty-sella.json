            "answer": "Hi,Empty Sella is what they call it when they do an MRI and can't see the pituitary within the sella turica (this is a structure in the brain).\u00a0\u00a0This may be becuase the pituitary is flattened against the wall, because it has been misplaced (still there but in different position not visible on the MRI), or because it is damaged for some reason.Do you have any symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes there are no symptoms and no treatment is required.\u00a0\u00a0However, empty Sella can be associated with hypopituitary (pituitary problems).\u00a0\u00a0This can cause other problems like adrenal problems, thyroid problems, diabetes, fertility problems, hypertension, among others.If you can post some more details, i will see if I can answer more.Type in Empty Sella Syndrome and you;ll come up with links on this.Best wishesSally",
