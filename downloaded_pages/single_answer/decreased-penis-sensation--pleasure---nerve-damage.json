            "answer": "Hi,Decreased penis sensation can be due to many reasons. The most common being neuropathy (envolvement of nerves of the penis). Other common causes are, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and some medications (antidepressants). It is unlikely that prostatitis or the medicines you have taken could lead to your symptoms. Please get an appointment fixed with a neurologist.",

    "question": "Hi,About a year ago, I went to the Urologist because I was having severe pain in my abdominal/testicle region. The doctor said it was probably prostatitis and prescribed some medication (Cipro). This didnt seem to help, so I went to another doctor who hypothesized that maybe it was something called Interstitial Cystitis. He prescribed Elimron which over the past 6 months has helped to make me pain free most of the time unless I have caffeine, spicy foods, or alcohol. Anyways, ever since all this started, I have noticed that the very tip of my penis no longer responds the way it used to when touched. I still have feeling, but masturbating is no longer pleasurable. It feels like the pleasure sensation is just missing. I'm usually not in pain otherwise, so I dont think other pain is masking the normal pleasure. I have also felt less attracted to other people due to this decreased sensation. I can get an erection, but it doesnt feel good. I remember when I first started noticing this, I had some tingling sensations in my upper thighs as well, but this doesnt really happen anymore. Is it possible that a prostate infection or something else could have caused nerve damage in my penis? I am young (24) and have never once had any sexual problems before this. The main reason I think nerves must be related is that I just feel like pleasure sensations that used to be there are no longer present. It's a very odd feeling. Anyways, should I see a neurologist? Any ideas of what this might be?",
