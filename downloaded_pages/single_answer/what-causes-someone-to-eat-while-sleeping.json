            "answer": "Your first priority is your safety. By all means do what you have to do to be safe.Is he sleep eating or just eating at night? Very big difference. If he is sleep eating, he could benefit from seeing a reputable sleep specialist experienced in this activity. It is in the same family as other sleepwalking activities.If he is awake and repeatedly eating at night and defending his need to do so, it can be a side effect of sleep disruption from other sleep disorders. Poor sleep or insufficient sleep throws the appetite hormones (leptin and ghrelin) out of kilter and the body always craves food and it's never enough. It also has been shown to cause an increased desire for night eating. The body interprets the stress of the sleep problems as a danger sign and sends out signals to hoard energy (calories) and slows the metabolism.He sounds like a prime candidate for a sleep study, maybe particularly for sleep apnea. People who have a tendency towards sleep apnea and drink at night risk worsening the condition as the drinking further relaxes the throat muscles. With all his eating I would imagine he's gained weight, which also increases his risk for sleep apnea.It may be sleep apnea started this whole downward cycle for him, but at any rate, he needs to start with a sleep study and if diagnosed with anything treatable, he must be committed to following through to reclaim his life. If he has sleep apnea, he is at an increased risk for heart attack, stroke, diabetes, HBP, impotence... just to name a few.If his abuse is at any time other than when asleep, I have little sympathy for him. I can say though that if he has a sleep disorder, it can really alter ones personality for the worse. Please get yourself safe. Direct him toward getting diagnosed and treated, and then if and when he is being treated therapeutically, you can decide if his agitation has also improved. If he is an alcoholic, that needs to be addressed. He may find getting healthy would decrease his need for drink. If he is not willing to do anything to help himself, there's your answer - walk away and don't look back.",
