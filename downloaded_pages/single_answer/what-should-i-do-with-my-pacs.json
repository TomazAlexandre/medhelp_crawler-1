            "answer": "I don't have PAC's when my heart rate hits ~90 BPM or at least I can't see them. I think it is because the calculated frequency at which they happen matches the BPM at that time. At a lower heart rate they will show up. I am on 50mg\u00a0\u00a0Metoprolol ER and given that I have ~18,000 to 25,000 per day. I have had them up to 38,000 per day. Does this medication make a difference? I don't know - I think I will make another test without medication to check it out before I get to see the cardiologist again at the end of the year.",
