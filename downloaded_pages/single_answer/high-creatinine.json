            "answer": "Hi Tom,I understand your concern regarding your GFR and I agree with your attending that there are many factors to consider such as\u00a0\u00a0symptoms, laboratory test results and overall health.It is good that there are no co-morbid conditions, your blood pressure and cholesterol are okay. Continue eating healthy, seek regular consult with your nephrologist, have regular blood tests and think positive always. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hello. This is my first post on this forum and just looking for some feedback from someone in a similar situation.\u00a0\u00a0I had bladder cancer and was treated with cisplatin 2.5 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I had my bladder removed and have a neobladder now. Shortly after the chemo, my creatinine starred increasing after being very normal before.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last 2 years, it has now increased to 2.6. I have a nephrologist and have been to Mayo. My GFR ranges from 23-27 and my doc has told me that when the GFR gets down to 20 I should begin looking at transplant and dialysis options.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 67 years old and have had clear CT cancer scans but am now scared to death that I will end up on dialysis soon as I can't have a transplant until I'm 5 years cancer free.\u00a0\u00a0When I try to get some estimates from my doc on how much time I have, or if I could possibly stabilize I don't felt much help.\u00a0\u00a0He just says if I take a guess, I will only be wrong.I have no diabetes, normal cholesterol, great blood pressure and other than the cancer and kidney disease I'm in great health.:)Can anyone out there give me some information on what they have experienced or know of that might help me?\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible I could go a long time at these levels?\u00a0\u00a0How long before dialysis? I feel great and the only symptoms I have are slight fatigue and a little ammonia breath now and then.\u00a0\u00a0I am watching my diet closely.Any insight would certainly be appreciated.Thanks a bunch!Tom",
