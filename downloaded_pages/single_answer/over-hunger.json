            "answer": "Hi!Conditions like diabetes, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, hypoglycaemia, eating disorders, stress, anxiety and worms in stool can cause increased appetite. To decrease your weight you need to slowly decrease the calories you eat. Fats and carbohydrates should be taken in moderation. You also need to build in an exercise regimen. Do discuss this with your family doctor and a dietician. A balanced diet and daily exercise will help. Hope it helps.Take care!",
