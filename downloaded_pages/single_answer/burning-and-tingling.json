            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms are suggestive of vitamin B 12 deficiency. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body can also cause such symptoms.You can take multivitamins and multiminerals for some time and see if the symptoms improve.If the symptoms persist then other possibilities like thyroid disorder,diabetes,compression or entrapment of nerve, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus will have to be probed.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.",
