            "answer": "Hi,You should not use steroids for more than a few days to weeks , especially without a doctor's consultation. You could get your blood sugar checked to rule out diabetes. Nothing can be said with surety without having a look at the lesions. This could be tinea cruris or ringworm infection.Tinea cruris is best treated with antifungal drugs applied topically. Traditionally creams containing tolnaftate, clotrimazole or miconazole have been used, although newer agents such as butenafine are also used.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jock_ItchTo cure the infection naturally, keep moist and warm areas of the body clean and dry. Change anything the fungus comes into contact with daily, like undergarments and towels. You can use talcum powder to help keep the area dry. Powders with menthol or zinc oxide like Gold Bond medicated powder, and creams containing 1% hydrocortisone should help soothe the itch if not treat the infection altogether.Let us know if you need any other information and consult your dermatologist if the lesions persist.Regards.",
