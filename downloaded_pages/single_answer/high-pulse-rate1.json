            "answer": "not necessarily.\u00a0\u00a0the most common reason that I see in clinic is \"inappropriate sinus tachycardia\" which essentially means that your heart rate is faster than it should be based on your level of exertion.\u00a0\u00a0I see several cases of this per week.\u00a0\u00a0If other causes are ruled out with a echocardiogram and normal thyroid studies and a good history/physical, that is the most likely diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0The treatment is usually beta blockers or calcium channel blockers and reassurance that your heart is ok --- anxiety can play role in making it worse but does not explain everything about it.\u00a0\u00a0Is it a risk factor for cardiovascular events over the long term -- yes it is, but it is not one of the big risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, increased cholesterol, family history or tobacco.\u00a0\u00a0It is only a piece of the puzzle.\u00a0\u00a0You manage your risk of disease every day with decisions that you don't think about like do I exercise or have these French fries instead.\u00a0\u00a0These are controllable significant choices.\u00a0\u00a0Your heart rate, if you do in fact have inappropriate sinus tachycardia, is not as easy to control.\u00a0\u00a0My philosophy is to focus on controllable factors because you can change them.\u00a0\u00a0Worrying about things beyond your control is just worrying.I hope this addresses your questions and eases your concerns rather than increase them --- I was trying to decrease your concerns and hope that it came across that way.",

    "question": "Hello I have been having a problem with a high pulse rate since April, I ended up in the hospital becaue it was above 180, I had an ekg and ultasound and it was normal. I was refered to an endercoligest after going back and forth about my thyroid I was told today that I need to see a cardioligest right away.... when the Dr took my pulse rate it was 92 ( I am taking a beta blocker to slow it down) I didn't think that was high when I start feeling bad it around 130-150Does high pulse rate indicate a heart problems?thanks",
