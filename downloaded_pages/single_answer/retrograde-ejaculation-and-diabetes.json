            "answer": "I had hemorrhoid surgery which was a one day outpatient event but because I couldn't urinate I had to stay overnight\u00a0\u00a0until\u00a0\u00a0I could. The third day I had the worst pain of my life of my life. But something had to have gone wrong because it was over 1 year and 6 months and I hadn\u2019t had an ejaculation. I was a 56 year old male who had sex at least 4 or 5 night every week. This all stopped right after my hemorrhoid surgery and I can't get a straight answer concerning what has happened to me.\u00a0\u00a0Why did I go limp after having my hemorrhoids cut out?\u00a0\u00a0What is the association of erectile dysfunction and hemorrhoid removal? Can\u2019t anybody convince me that this surgery had nothing to do with my erectile dysfunction!",

    "question": "my husband is 34 and has retrograde ejaculation. we tried IVF in feb and it didnt work. before going into it again we would really like to try naturally. we have tried sudafed before but didnt really think that it worked. how often before intercourse should he take it? and does he need to take it a few days before or is taking it the same day ok? also i have been reading alot ab how if the prostrate is not correct that that can cause alot of problems too. would it be ok if he started taking pills to hlep support his prostrate since thats where most of the reproductive issues are and since the retrograde is due to a weak bladder muscle. thank you and i hope you can give us some info!",
