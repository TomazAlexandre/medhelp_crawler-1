            "answer": "Hi laliqe, how are you and how is your mother doing? Has your mother been attended to the stroke caused due to last year injury and any investigation and treatment she received for it? Is there any neurological residue persisting? There are many causes for bleeding behind the eyeball, commonly diabetes, hypertension, abnormality in blood vessels, vitreous hemorrhage. The severity can be known once the cause is found. You need to consult a Eye specialist as soon as possible to get investigated and treated to avoid further vision loss. Update on her progress and share your thoughts. Take care.",
