            "answer": "Hello,These symptoms can be due to cholinergic urticaria or parasthesia skin. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi,I got a condition that i couldn't seem to find an answer for 2 years. I got a burning sensation from left inner thigh to the buttock area. This sensation increases when the area is warm, so it increases and becomes intolerable when sitting too long or wearing pants etc. I can only relax when i remain with my underpants. I am pretty sure that it is not 'Sciatica' or some sports injury related thing since i dont have pain in leg and it is not constant. I have dry skin my thigh, penis and buttock area. There are no further visible symptoms. Can it be a fungal infection? I went to an urologist and he couldn't say anything. What is this??I am not sure what it is but i couldn't find an answer and a satisfactory relievement to his for 2 years and its simply ruined my life.",
