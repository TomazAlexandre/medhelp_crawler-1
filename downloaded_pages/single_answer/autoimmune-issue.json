            "answer": "I am sorry but I don\u2019t have an answer to this unusual combination of numbness, tingling, \u201coverall tiredness\u201d and diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the diarrhea is unrelated.\u00a0\u00a0If so, the remaining symptoms would be consistent with the hyperventilation syndrome but this, in no way, would explain your apparent response to the 2 antihistamines, unless that was a placebo effect.If your symptoms are on the basis of physical disease, there is a possibility that it would fall within the realm of allergic\u00a0\u00a0immunologic or autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that you return to the allergist, who it must be recalled, provided effective therapy.\u00a0\u00a0If she is unable to establish a specific diagnosis, you should ask her for a referral to a specialist in autoimmune and metabolic diseases, including diabetes that sometimes presents with intestinal problems and peripheral neuropathy, a specialist with familiarity with the more uncommon metabolic diseases.Good luck.",

    "question": "1 1/2 years ago I slowly began noticing numbness and some tingling in my tongue and around my mouth.\u00a0\u00a0When that happens I also feel more sensitivity in my hands, feet and and an overall tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0It was particularly noticeable right after eating and especially if the food was warm.\u00a0\u00a0My primary care physician thought it was angioendema likely from ibuprofen (I had been taking a lot for headaches).\u00a0\u00a0I went off that for two months but my symptoms didn't change so I went to an allergist.\u00a0\u00a0After several visits, and with no outward symptoms visible, she decided to test my CU index.\u00a0\u00a0This was elevated to 27 with the normal range being under 10.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking Zyrtec, and when that didn't help much we added Zantac for both histimine blockers.\u00a0\u00a0The combination helped considerably.\u00a0\u00a0After about six months I began feeling better and was able to reduce the dosage by half.\u00a0\u00a0My CU index dropped to a normal range.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last month I have begun to feel the symptoms increasing again and so I doubled my dose.\u00a0\u00a0I have found that if I don't take enough of the dosage, not only do the symptoms in my mouth, hands and feet become more noticeable but I also have diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0I am reluctant to go back to the doctor because I felt she didn't know what was causing it and there isn't much to do for it other than take these medicines.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any suggestions?",
