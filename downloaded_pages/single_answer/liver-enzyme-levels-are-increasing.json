    "question": "My question is in regards to my husbands liver enzyme levels.He has chronic HepC, and just finished combo/therapy about 3 weeks ago. Halfway through the treatments he had no measurable virus in his blood, but the enzyme levels were lower than they are now after completing the treatments. What does this mean???He has significant damage to his liver, stage 3-4 cirrhosis, so this is pretty upsetting to me that these numbers are going up. He also has diabetes, and his blood sugar was normal during treatment for the HepC, but now is going through the roof.Any info would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Dana",
