            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are many causes of dizziness, lightheadedness, passing out, blackouts etc. It is difficult to comment without examination. I am just enumerating the possible causes. You can discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Dizziness could be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position), internal ear problems and cervical spondylitis or compression of cervical spinal nerves. All these cause dizziness when you get up from lying down position or when you change position that results in a change in the level of your head. Cervical spondylitis and ear problems also cause dizziness on changing the position of the neck.Other causes are anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling.This could be due to hypoglycemia, especially if taking food helps you.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "So I've been having these 'dizzy' spells for quite a long time - but I'm not sure if it qualifies as dizzyness without any neurological symptoms or loss of coordination/balance? I went to an ear doctor who went through it with me, and he said I had no symptoms - and he's right, because I DIDN'T HAVE THE SYMPTOMS WHEN HE CHECKED... It's only sometimes.Today, I was driving my car, and I had to reverse a lot.. This made me feel a bit dizzy and sick, so I waited for a while before continuing to drive.. As long as it went forwards, there wasn't really a problem. Now, it's afternoon, and it's almost 10 hours ago I drove. At lunch I felt slightly better, but it's back now.. Dizzyness from driving alone would NOT last that long?Thanks!",
