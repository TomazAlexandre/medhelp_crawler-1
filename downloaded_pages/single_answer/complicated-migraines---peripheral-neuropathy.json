            "answer": "I do not think that the medications you have listed would cause your symptoms. If the symptoms are only occuring in the evening and represent an uncomfortable sensation which makes you want to move ( this would relieve the sensation), perhaps you have restless leg syndrome. Otherwise other causes for a peripheral neuropathy should be evaluated. In addition to the common causes (diabetes, thyroid disease, and B12 and folate deficiency) other disorders such as inflammatory conditions and (since you mention the liver disease) viral Hepatitis should be evaluated.. Inflammatory disorders or vasculitis could explain your headaches, blood vessel changes, and perhaps the peripheral neuropathy. You should discuss this with your neurologist and take things from there. Good lcuk.",
