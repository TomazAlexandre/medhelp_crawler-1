    "question": "Very glad to see this forum, and thank you for the opportunity to post a question.\u00a0\u00a0I have 5 stents in my LAD resulting from 8 heart caths done over the past 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0Throughout the past two years, I've had continuous chest pressure, although it was minimized after my last stent.\u00a0\u00a0I am now taking Ranexa which helps, but I still have daily pressure in the center of my chest right at the sternum (kind of like someone is poking a finger on the inside).\u00a0\u00a0I am taking Plavix, Lisinipril, Zetia, Toprol, Isosorbide Mononitrate, Cilostazol, Ranexa, Lipitor and Niacin.\u00a0\u00a0My questions are:(1)\u00a0\u00a0Of my 8 heart caths, the last two have been clear and I passed my last nuke stress test about 4 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0My cholesterol is down to 120 and HDL/LDL are finally within normal levels.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any meds you'd recommend I get off - seems to me like I'm on too many and I'm often dizzy:(2)\u00a0\u00a0I still have continuing chest pressure.\u00a0\u00a0When do you think it would be reasonable to go in for another test (nuke stress, etc) to ensure I'm doing well?\u00a0\u00a0With my history of blocking back up (again, 8 caths in 2 years and all but the last two required some form of angioplasty), I want to stay on top of things.(3)\u00a0\u00a0If I go to the hospital everytime I have chest pressure in the middle of my chest, I'd be there quite often.\u00a0\u00a0I am also out of breath a lot of the time, especially when exerting myself.\u00a0\u00a0What should be my rule for going to the ER?\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to go anymore if my symptoms are not serious b/c I've grown a little less fond of hospitals :-), but don't want to die of a heart attack either.\u00a0\u00a0Suggestions?(4) Any idea what could be causing the chest pressure?\u00a0\u00a0I don't have reflux, asthma, or diabetes (been tested), but this chest pressure while not disabling is certainly distracting and lessens my quality of life somewhat.\u00a0\u00a0Hard to exercise when you have chest pressure.Thanks for any info you can provide!",
