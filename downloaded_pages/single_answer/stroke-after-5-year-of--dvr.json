            "answer": "Hi there!Well, PT/ INR is maintained by altering the warfarin dosage, keeping in mind the drug interactions. In patients with variable PT/ INR, frequent testing is advisable. Recurrent stroke could occur secondary to increased or decreased blood coagulability or due to cardiac causes. There are a few antibiotics that may be relatively safer to use with the medication, though they may or may not suit the particular infection. It is best advised to discuss the situation and the management plan in detail with is treating doctor rand keep the drug interactions and side effect into consideration, prior to starting any new medication.Hope this is helpfulTake care!",
