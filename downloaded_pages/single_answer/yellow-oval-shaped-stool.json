    "question": "Ok, I am type 2 diabetic. I am currentlyI taking Metformin 500mg (take 1 table by mouth every morning and 2 tablets with supper), Glipizide 10mg (take 1 tablet by mouth twice a day), and Pravastatin Sodium 20mg (take 1 tablet by mouth daily). Last night around 9pm I eat 2 pieces of fried chicken with red beans and white rice, season fries, coleslaw. I did not eat all day to I guess you can say I over did it. Anyway, after two hours my blood sugar was at 350 (that's the highest i've ever seen it) so I took 2 more of my metformin. In the morning I woke up with abdominal pain and diarrhea. I ate a 1/2 of a oatmeal cook and after a few seconds I had to go to the restroom. As I was using the restroom I notice 3 yellowish oval shaped stool, I went ahead a examined it. When I sliced it the middle I saw it was white inside and the texture of the yellowish oval shaped stool was almost fatty, liver like. Can anyone please let me know if this is serious? Or is it ok and most likely it well go away after a while?",
