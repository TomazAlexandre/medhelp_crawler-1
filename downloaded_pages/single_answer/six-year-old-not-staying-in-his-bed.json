            "answer": "While I can only presume, this difficulty is likely related to your overall mehtod of setting limits and following through on violations of those limits. While it is true that many young children, when they wake up at night, are scared, the real issue to address is what your son is going to do at those times. If he is truly scared, he will want to seek you out. That in itself is reasonable - he's just a young child. What about the option of having him go to you, not his mother? Then guide him back to bed. Let him know that his access to some favored daily privilege will be contingent on adhering to the plan. Another option might be to place a sleeping bag outside your room. If he wakes up, is scared, and wants to be close (without actually being in your room), he can crawl into the sleeping bag. Now, the fact that he is waking up at all during the night is at the root of the problem. If this has been occurring for only a short while, things will likely change and he will remain asleep for the whole night (the normal situation for his age). If not, speak with his doctor about using melatonin to help him remain asleep. Melatonin is the brain chemical that regulates the sleep/wake cycle. Synthetic preparations are available and might help him. But do not use this,or any other over the counter preparation, without the guidance of his doctor.",
