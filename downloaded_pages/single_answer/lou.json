            "answer": "Hello,These looks like parasthesia skin and since you are having it in both legs, hence it is important to rule out any lower spinal problems for which you have to get a MRI lower spine and nerve conduction velocity test done from a neurologist.Other than that, t can be due to injury to the back or spinal cord, Lack of blood supply to the legs as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause numbness in the legs.You can take multivitamins for some time. Also get your blood sugar tested.I hope it helps. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
