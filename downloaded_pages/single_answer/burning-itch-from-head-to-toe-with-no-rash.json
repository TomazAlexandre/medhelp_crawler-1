            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis). Other conditions cause itchy skin as well. Skin conditions like dermatitis, scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch. Lastly, phototherapy can also be tried.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted in case you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",

    "question": "For the past week now I have had a burning itch which comes and goes at random from underneath my feet to my scalp. It's been bothering me as there is no rash visible but when I scratch the same area for a few minutes little bumps appear but they aren't red and they go away almost immediately if I stop the scratching. They almost look like blisters but they're not.I havent changed any of my skincare products or been or done anything unusual where I could have picked up anything infectious.I visited a doctor on Friday and she took blood tests but nothing is showing up? There is alot of pollen in the air here this time of year and I dont know if this could be the cause.Sometimes the itching affects my eyes and I tend to rub them, making them quite puffy but again it goes away as soon as I stop.What could this possibly be? I'm at my wits end with this as no one has any advice or answers for me.",
