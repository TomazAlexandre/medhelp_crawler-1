    "question": "Ok, so i'm 33 wks and 5 days and just found out that i have developed gestational diabetes. I had to go to a diabetes clinic wednesday morning, and there i was given a machine to measure my sugar after every meal, and every morning i have to measure my ketones....now if its really dark on the ketostix that's not good because that means that you didn't eat enough the day before.This morning mine was right in between....it was moderate....so does this mean that something is wrong? I don't want anything that is toxic passed to the baby...should i be worried? I'm so scared.",
