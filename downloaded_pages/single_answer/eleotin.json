            "answer": "Hi,I am not familiar with Eleotin. On a brief websearch I did not find any clinical studies talking about it, but if you know of some I would like to read them. I cannot say \"yes\" or \"nay\" to this because I do not have enough information\u00a0\u00a0about it, which is often the case with many herbal medications. I do suggest approaching this, and any medication, with caution when they say they have \"no side effects\", \"are all natural\" and \"can cure diabetes.\" Those are very lofty claims and unlikely to be 100% true. So if you decide to take them, be careful. I suggest speaking with your doctor about it, and at the very least having a baseline set\u00a0\u00a0of blood tests so monitor for side effects later.Take care.",
