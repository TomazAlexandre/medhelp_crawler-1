            "answer": "Hi,How are you? A stroke is the rapidly developing loss of brain functions due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain. This can be due to ischemia caused by thrombosis or embolism or due to a hemorrhage. Warning signs of stroke include: sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination; and sudden, severe headache with no known cause. Risk factors for stroke include advanced age, hypertension, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), diabetes, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking and atrial fibrillation.If it persists, have this evaluated further for proper management. A complete neurologic and physical examination will help rule out possible causes such as tension headache or migraine. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I have this pain that travels from the base of the left side of my head to top of head.\u00a0\u00a0It comes and goes, almost like a slow pulse. I don't know if it is my sinus or something else. It is bad enough to have me in bed and scared enough to consider er. At what point do you stop guessing and what other symptoms would I look for if it were a stroke?",
