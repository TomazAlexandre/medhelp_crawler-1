            "answer": "Depends on your age mostly. It's probably nothing to do with the reason the MR was done in the first place and small areas of white matter hyperintensity are common as anyone gets older. They can represent nothing serious, in older people they probably represent small blood vessel disease and are hence usually considered normal findings in anyone over 40. If they are on one side only, or at a push if your MRI was done for symptoms of TIAs (mini-strokes) then it might be considered evidence that you had had some mini-strokes but outside of this context they should probably be ignored. It's worth confirming you don't have any risk factors for vascular disease (not smoking, not being diabetic/having your diabetes under control, checking and controlling your cholesterol and blood pressure but aside from these which are good practise in anyone, probably not much else to say.Don't worry about it too much. You're a VOMIT - Victim Of Medical Imaging Technology.",
