            "answer": "for starters, unquenchable thirst could be a symptom of a serious problem, eg. diabetes (i think), so best to speak to your doc.i found that before i was diagnosed, when i was hypothyroid, and also when i was taking too much synthroid (originally prescribed 4 times the dose i take now - i was hyperthyroid from the meds) i had unquenchable thirst. the doctors didnt know why, i was so scared by it i even went to the emergency at the hospital and they did heaps of tests and said i was ok and they didnt know either. at that stage i was drinking 6L (or maybe even more) of water a day.after that, i got my dosage to what felt like close to the right level for me (and tsh was good too), and my thirst went away and i started drinking normally - one day i was drinking 6L/day, the next down to a normal 2-3L/day!even now i find that when my dosage changes and i go a bit hypo or hyper i get heaps heaps thirsty.a couple of my doctors told me that i had probably started drinking too much and my body had got used to it and that i needed to \"reset\" my body. they told me to only eat/drink 1L of fluid per day for a few days and then i would go back to normal. i tried this for one day and felt like it was completely wrong, and like i needed the water. i got dehydrated too, and i was crying all day coz i was so thirsty. so i didnt even last the whole day, and turns out when my thyroid levels went right my thirst went away anyway.for me, i think the thirst was from thyroid. i was tested for heaps of other things (eg. diabetes, parathyroid hormone, high calcium etc etc....) and they were all fine.i think it would be best for you to ask your doctor, and check out whether it could be from something else though, i know that once we have one autoimmune problem, we're apparently more likely to get others (eg. diabetes).good luck! and i hope your thirst goes away, i know how horrible and scary it is!!",
