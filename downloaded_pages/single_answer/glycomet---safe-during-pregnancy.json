    "question": "Glycomet - safe during pregnancy?Hi All,My wife is 28 years old and has type diabetes for the past 1.5 years. She has family history of diabetes. Her glucose and hemoglobin A1c are under control. We are planing for a baby and consulted an endocrinologist about it. He has recommended that she take tablet Glycomet 250 mg\u00a0\u00a0(one tablet each day).He indicated that she continue taking Glycomet until she conceives and it does not affect the fetus even if she has conceived and takes the tablet for a few days and then shift to insulin once it is confirmed that she has conceived.I have complete faith in his suggestion, but I just want to 100% sure about this, so please suggest if we are on the right track?",
