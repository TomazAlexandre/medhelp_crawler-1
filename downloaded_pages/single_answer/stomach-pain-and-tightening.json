    "question": "Our daughter Olivea was diagnosed at two years old. She is currently eleven and manages herself fairly well. She has been having terrible stomach pain and tightening for the past few days with no relief. I have heard that stomach pain and troubles with the digestive organs are common with diabetics. Is there anything or anyone who knows what this may be?",
