            "answer": "I would have guessed varices too.Here is an excerpt from a Mayo article which might be something to discuss with your Mother-in Law's physician.Capsule endoscopyCapsule endoscopy is a procedure that uses a tiny wireless camera to take pictures of your digestive tract. A capsule endoscopy camera sits inside a vitamin-sized capsule that you swallow. As the capsule travels through your digestive tract, the camera takes thousands of pictures that are transmitted to a recorder you wear on a belt around your waist.Capsule endoscopy helps doctors see inside your small intestine \u2014 an area that isn't easily reached with more-traditional endoscopy procedures. Traditional endoscopy involves passing a long, flexible tube equipped with a video camera down your throat or through your rectum. Capsule endoscopy is usually initiated in your doctor's office.Capsule endoscopy is sometimes referred to as capsule enteroscopy or small bowel endoscopy.\"See:\u00a0\u00a0http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/capsule-endoscopy/MY00139Good luck,Mike",

Doctors have still not found out the cause of this severe bleeding neither they are able to find out from where bleeding occurred",
