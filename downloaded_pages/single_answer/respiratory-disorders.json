    "question": "I have what one doctor called pulmonary spasms. Very painful every time my heart beats.\u00a0\u00a0This is not an every-day occurrence, but when it happens, the only relief I can get is from holding my breath as hard as I can. I also have COPD, with asthma, chronic bronchitis, diabetes, HBP and sometimes depression. I just got out of the hospital in January after having double pneumonia...stayed 10 days. No one seems to understand what I'm trying to describe and that it is mostly all over the trunk and neck of my body.\u00a0\u00a0Can you help me?",
