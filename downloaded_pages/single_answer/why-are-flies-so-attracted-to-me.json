    "question": "Hey, As the title suggests I have an annoying problem where common flies and the other insects (mosquitoes, bees, moths) are attracted to my body, at least much more then the average person. It's a problem Ive been dealing with for a few years now and it's effecting my social life and confidence dramatically. Every time I go outside flies seem to swarm to me and basically congregate wherever I am and have been. I shower twice a day and don't use any fragrant deodorants or cleaning products, I also don't have any bad BO issues, so I know its not a problem caused by poor hygiene or cleanliness.I've seen 4 doctors about this problem and none of them have been able to give me a reason why they are so attracted to me. One of the doctors suspected diabetes could be a cause, but found no problems there, diabetes test came up all clear. Also notice when I'm near dogs they tend to come up close and sniff my legs for an extended period of time ( longer then usual). I'm wondering if has something to do with the sweat/oils I secrete from my skin that makes these insects so attracted to me.If anyone has any knowledge or advice how to work out what's causing these flies to follow me I would be much appreciative. Also bug spray doesn't seem to stop them, they still seem to be drawn to me after applying it.",
