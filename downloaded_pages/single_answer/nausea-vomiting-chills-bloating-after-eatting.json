    "question": "Intermittently I experience nausea, bloating, vomiting, chills, and experience paleness in my face and hands after eating. Most recently it was after eating a banana which have caused me no other problems throughout my life previously. I ate some rice cakes about 6 hours prior and that was all that I ate for the day. I have had a colonoscopy and egd\u00a0\u00a0that came back normal and all kinds of blood work that came back normal as well. I am gluten free and a type 2 diabetic. My sugars usually around 130 - 140...when I experience these episodes of upset it happens after eating. I feel very nauseous and weak with episodes of paleness..if I lay down my color returns until I am in an up right position for a few minutes. After about an hour of feeling increasingly bloated I vomit. Sometimes I feel immediately better sometimes I still feel bloated and nauseous for hours after. Sometimes I have abdominal pain in my lower left and left front side. No diarrhea and I'm able to have a small normal BM if needed. Any ideas as to my plight?",
