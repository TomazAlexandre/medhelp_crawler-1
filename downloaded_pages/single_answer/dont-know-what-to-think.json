    "question": "My husband and I have been together for 12 years now. We have always had great sex as far as I was concerned. But the first few years we were together when he would be angry about something he would tell me that he didn't feel enough but still was able to have an orgasm within 30 seconds. Now, he tells me that what he said was not true that he had to keep telling me that to cover his lie up. He we are 12 years later hadn't done anything at all for months and he is not able to get or maintain an erection if we try to have sex. But, he stays fully erect during me giving him oral and is able to ejaculate. I feel like even though he is only the 3rd man I have ever been with that I will never be able to satisfy him during sexual intercourse (when he is actually able to). There are many time he goes down during sex. Everything keeps him erect except when he goes to put it inside of me. I am so confused and my heart is breaking. I sit and put myself down so badly now and I cry. I told him tonight that I will do other things to satisfy him and when he is about to ejaculate he can put it in me. Then he said when then how will you get your pleasure? How am I supposed to really see this. Im 43 yrs old and he is 42. All of his tests at the doctor were normal. This is killing my heart.",
