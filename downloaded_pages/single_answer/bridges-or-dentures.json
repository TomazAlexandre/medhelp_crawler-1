    "question": "I am 59 yrs old and I have diabetes. In the last five yrs Ive spent around six thousand dollars at the dentist. Keep in mind that 6 yrs ago I had no problems. Now everytime I go in twice a year there is another major problem. Right now I have a broken tooth. My dentist is sending me to an oral surgeon to have it remove, then replace it with a bridge and fill yet more cavites. It comes to 4,000 dollars PLUS the oral surgeon. My questions is, is it worth all of this work? They say it's from the diabeits, so I can expect more problems. After this procedure I will have spent over 10,000 on work. They say my teeth are to good to pull, I say I can't afford this and I'm ready for dentures. I'd like to know your opinion. I understand you cant say for sure not seeing my mouth, but I feel like the expenses or just more than I can afford.",
