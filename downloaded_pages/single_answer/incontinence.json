            "answer": "Hi,Before we jump towards controlling it, have you been evaluated to determine why you have it? You are fairly young, and barring other medical conditions, I would not expect you to develop this unless you have a urinary tract infection or your diabetes has been very poorly controlled. I think you should first see a urologist for an evaluation. They are also likely best to advise you on the best ways of controlling it.Sorry I could not offer more specific advice regarding your question. I am sure the diuretic is having some effect on this also, so perhaps you can discuss other alternatives with your doctor.Take care.",
