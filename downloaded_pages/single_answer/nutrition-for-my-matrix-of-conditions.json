In trying to address my Diabetes thru diet, I find that I should not use some of the very foods suggested , in treatment of IBS. I too take ahost of vitamins/minerals and do not smoke or drink. I have recently added /increased my Vit D and am trying to use probiotics and CoQ10, Fish Oil among other things.\u00a0\u00a0I posed the same question under\u00a0\u00a0Nutrition\u00a0\u00a0but no answers yet.I am wondering if the only way to go is consult a Dietition? When i ask a past Dr.about that, he replied \" No, he did not think that would help \" but... from everything I can read, that is exactly what i should do.Hope we both can benefit from some answers here!PJJ",
