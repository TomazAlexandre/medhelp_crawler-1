            "answer": "Hi!All of us tend to overeat once in a while when we are feeling low, or when we love the food or when we are out with friends etc. However, if this persists with every meal then yes, you may have an eating disorder, or diabetes or hyperthyroidism. This is not bulimia. In bulimia the person eats a lot over a short period of time and then makes an attempt to vomit this out. You appear to have compulsive eating or binge eating disorder (BED). BED can be treated with the help of cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy. Some times it is treated with drugs. Please consult a doctor regarding this. You will in addition need to consult a psychologist/psychiatrist, a nutrition expert and a physical therapist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
