    "question": "I've read several other forums with people that have had issues similar to mine, but not quite the same. I've been dealing with generalized itching since before I can remember. Both my biological mother & bio grandmother have the same condition, which is undiagnosed in all of us.No 2 days are the same. I've seemed to have created a schedule that keeps most attacks away, but if it's really hot/humid or any other number of set offs... the itch attack can debilitate me for hours and can be very painful. Yet I can go days or weeks without an attack.I've had bloodwork done (an allergy panel): not allergic to anything food-borne or air-borne(trees, pollen dust...)I've seen a neurologist: everything came back fineI've seen a dermatologist: tried to claim it as eczema & prescribed steroidal cream that made it worse and atarax to help me sleep through the night. My doctor said if it were eczema the cream would make it better, definitely not worse! Besides I have no rashes, no dry or scaly skin, no bumps or abrasions.My doctor gave me Xyzal, the new Claratin (still deciding if it's helping or not)I would love to have this thing figured out!!",
