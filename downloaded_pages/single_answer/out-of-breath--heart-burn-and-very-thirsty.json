    "question": "Recently I've been very thirsty and out of breath. My stomach aches a lot during the day and from time to time I get bad heart burn pain or a pain right under my chest that makes.This has went on for about 2 weeks.. I am starting to get nervous that this may be something serious. I am only 22 years old and 125 pounds so I don't think it's an issue with being over weight or unhealthy. I may not be eating the best but perhaps that could be a factor. When I am thirsty I still cannot breath well but continue to drink hoping it will help me breathe better.Does anyone know what these symptoms may be?",
