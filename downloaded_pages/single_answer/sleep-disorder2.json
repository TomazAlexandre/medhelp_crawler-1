            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum, tingling sensation on the chest, needs a detailed evaluation. Cardiac problem is the most important cause, but it has been ruled out in your case.Some other possibilities are acid reflux, certain medications, malnutrition, food allergies, hormonal imbalance (menopause as relevant in your case), nerve damage (thoracic nerves), anxiety, diabetes, thyroid disorder like hypothyroidism etc. We cannot rule out the exact cause without medical findings.You need to undergo some blood tests, endoscopy, thyroid profile etc to rule out the cause. Hormonal imbalance secondary to menopause can also be important cause. Stress is also known to worsen or alter the pain sensations. You need to undergo mental relaxation exercise. I can appreciate the pressure you are going through. I suggest you to consult physician for further evaluation. Take care and regards.",

It is mostly associated when I am lying on my left side and will subside on right. I saw a cardiologist and had lab work, stress test, echo and ekg, all normal.\u00a0\u00a0He sggested it may be related to my back since i have had a multi level discectomy 4 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0He had read some correlation.\u00a0\u00a0I have gained weight over the past year and suggested if this could be related to weight on my heart.\u00a0\u00a0He felt no.\u00a0\u00a0I also have been under some stress since January with my children's father having terminal cancer. But, the tingling seems more positional.\u00a0\u00a0 I am 56 and have been post menopausal for 2 years only.\u00a0\u00a0since I had a strong family history, I did have a full cardiac cath and cardiac echo 5 years ago and all were completely normal with NO blockage at all.",
