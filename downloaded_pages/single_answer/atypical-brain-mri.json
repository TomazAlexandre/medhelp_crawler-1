            "answer": "Please keep in mind that I have not personally examined you nor have I seen your MRI (which is the basis of the post) and cannot make an accurate diagnosis without doing so.\u00a0\u00a0White matter changes, depending on exactly where they are and what your clinical history is, can represent a number of things including non-specific changes that are found in normal individuals. Again, it's very important where they are located how big they are and how they appear on the MRI - but in some patients, it really doesn't mean anything at all and are clinically insignificant.\u00a0\u00a0It certainly does NOT necessarily mean there is brain deterioration and is NOT caused by stress.MS of course is a possibility, especially in a young woman with neurological symptoms. But other common diseases include migraines and microvascular (tiny blood vessel) changes related to high blood pressure and diabetes. Less common diseases include sarcoids, lymphoma and Lyme disease.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck with your upcoming appointment.",

    "question": "3 yrs ago I saw a Neurologist for parasthesia (face/right arm) he sent me to P/T re a spur on the C3/C4 disc - I recently had the same problem and went to my primary care figuring the same issue - she is 65/semi-retired and an OB/GYN - she suspected MS and sent me for a brain scan and a cervical spine scan - the Cscan showed the spur on the C3/C4 disc the brain scan however was \"not clear\" radiologist report could be early M.S. - early Vasal Disease - Arteries? There was apparently white matter but a clear diagnosis was not formulated - I am 47 and fit as can be - I have no prior illness history - However, I am a chronic \"Worrier\" and stress case. I have no other physical symptoms and my PCP did not test anything else - I was asked if I had migraines which could appear as white patches on MRI but I do not - can acute stress cause white patches on MRI? I am going to see the original neurologist at the end of July - what else can cause white patches on the MRI? Could the MRI be wrong? And, perhaps those white patches may have been there for years? If so, is it brain deterioration? I am back at the physical therapist who is treating the symptoms of tingling which I believe are because of the spur on the spine - which is why I originally went to the doctor because I wanted a referral to P/T - and now this???",
