            "answer": "Dear ruthyz,I do understand your concern. From the scenario that you have described, your mother has renal failure. This would imply a condition where the kidneys are not functioning at an optimum level. However, in your mother\u2019s case, her levels suggest that the problem is not very severe and can still be handled. Now, this could be due to several causes.First amongst them would be high blood pressure and diabetes which are capable of independently damaging the kidneys. This leads to a condition where the kidneys do not function properly and thus the urea and the creatinine rise.The second would be an obstructive cause. This would imply a condition where there is an obstruction in the flow of urine. This would lead to a buildup in the pressure which could compromise the function of the kidneys. This is reversible if the obstruction is removed, unless, the problems has been quite long standing,The first thing that we need to start with is an ultrasound of the kidneys to assess the presence of any obstruction. If this is not present, we would need to investigate this further. If your mother has high blood pressure and/or diabetes, they need to be stringently controlled. This would help us manage this condition much better and also prevent further damage.It is unlikely that the tiredness, loss of appetite, bad odour is because of high serum creatinine levels. She needs to be worked up better. Please see a physician to get this evaluated so we get to the bottom of this quickly.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Thank you for using MedHelp's \"Ask an Expert\" Service, where we feature some of world's renowned medical experts in their fields.
