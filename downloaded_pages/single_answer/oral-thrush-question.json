            "answer": "Stress can weaken your immune system and allow Candida (the yeast that causes thrush) to thrive because of your immune imbalance. Overuse of mouthwash can contribute to it because though it kills bad germs and bacteria, our body has normal flora (good bacteria) that keeps yeast in check which is normally present in our bodies. On the flipside, not brushing twice a day and flossing daily can be a cause.Another factor to consider is hydration. A dry mouth can let the Candida flourish. It is common knowledge, that your body needs 8 x 8oz of water a day, but it is less common knowledge that for every ounce of coffee or tea you drink, which is dehydrating, you need an extra ounce of water to replace it. If you drink 32oz sweet tea and 12oz of coffee in a day, to maintain balance, you would need to drink six extra 8oz glasses of water!Treatment: while it is active, stop using mouthwash to allow your natural flora to regrow while making sure to brush every morning and night and floss nightly. Apple cidar vinegar is a wonderful home remedy. I recommend placing a splash on the corner of clean wash rag and brushing your tongue with it (the acidity can damage tooth enamel overtime which is why I urge this method as opposed to gargling with it). I do not think I would recommend doing it if the thrush has caused cracks or bleeding because it will cause discomfort.",

    "question": "I have a few questions regarding oral thrush.\u00a0\u00a0I had an oral thrush experience at age 28.\u00a0\u00a0The thrush did not spread and was confined to only one small spot in the middle of my tongue.\u00a0\u00a0The dentist at that time prescribed nystatin which failed to allevaite the condition.\u00a0\u00a0Lozenges were then tried and upon them not working, Diflucan was prescribed.\u00a0\u00a0Diflucan eradicated the yeast along with GSE (grapefruit seed extract) and twice daily cups of organic unsweetened yogurt.\u00a0\u00a0Flash forward 12 years and the oral thrush once again presents itself in the same exact location and in same exact size.\u00a0\u00a0The thrush appeared after a bout with a viral upper respiratory infection which resolved itself.\u00a0\u00a0I visited my doctor who did a prelim. exam, and a test for diabetes which came back normal, as it did back when I was 28. It appears that diabetes is not an issue with me.\u00a0\u00a0I have only had ONE sexual partner, my husband, who I have been married to for over 8 years, so HIV is obviously not an issue.\u00a0\u00a0I have never smoked, chewed tobacco or drank alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0I eat a very low sugar diet, mostly organic foods, drink matcha green tea, and walk/run 2-3 miles per day.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, I have NEVER experienced a vaginal yeast infection, and have had normal periods my entire life.\u00a0\u00a0 So my question is? What gives? Is 2 oral yeast infections in approx. 10-12 years considered recurring yeast infections?\u00a0\u00a0I do suffer from very bad panic attacks and have done so since approx. age 11.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking nystatin again but I fear that it will not work as it failed to work a decade ago.\u00a0\u00a0A week before the thrush appeared I had my 6 month dental check, which I never miss, and my mouth was fine, no cavities, no problems.\u00a0\u00a0I have 4 impacted wisdom teeth that cannot be removed, per the oral surgeon, and a molar that had a root canal performed on it in 1999. There was some infection underneath the capped molar according to my dentist\u00a0\u00a0back in 2006 , but my dentist checks me every 6 months and reports that I am in good dental health.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a physical 6 months ago and all blood work and thyroid tests came back nomal. Why then do I have oral thrush? I am very frustrated by this and fear I may be dying of a disease.\u00a0\u00a0Have you seen oral thrush in otherwise healthy adults and if so how do I address the root of this fungal infection?This discussion is related to/posts/show/421330.",
