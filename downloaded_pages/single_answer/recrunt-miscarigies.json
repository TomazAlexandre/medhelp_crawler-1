            "answer": "Hello,Duphaston contains progesterone and is often prescribed in pregnancy to maintain pregnancy. Recurrent miscarriage can be due to uterine conditions like uterine malformation, cervical conditions like incompetent cervix, chromosomal disorders, endocrine causes like diabetes or thyroid disease, PCOS( polycystic ovarian disease), thrombophilia, increased NK( natural killer) cells, ovarian factors or infections like listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, and certain viral infections (rubella, herpes simplex, measles, cytomegalo virus, coxsackie virus). You need a detailed work up from the gynecologist to confirm the cause and then that cause also needs to be treated.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
