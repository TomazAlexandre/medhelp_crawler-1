            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dry mouth could be the side effect of any medication you are taking. It could be due to Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome but this will also cause dry eyes.GERD or reflux disease too can cause similar symptoms. A generalized dehydration too can cause these problems.Iron and vitamin deficiency, fungal infection, hypertension, diabetes, strokes and transient ischemic attacks, anemia, smoking all cause dry mouth. Poor oral hygiene is another cause. Nerve damage due to some trauma or surgery can be another cause.Of these medication, gastric reflux, fungal infection, poor oral hygiene, and smoking can also cause bitter taste.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
