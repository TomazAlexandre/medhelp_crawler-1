            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!It is really difficult to comment. \u201cSo, is Splenda safe? The truth is we just don\u2019t know yet. There are no long-term studies of the side effects of Splenda in humans. The manufacturer\u2019s own short-term studies showed that very high doses of sucralose (far beyond what would be expected in an ordinary diet) caused shrunken thymus glands, enlarged livers, and kidney disorders in rodents. (A more recent study also shows that Splenda significantly decreases beneficial gut flora.)\u201d\u201cHere are two other reasons for our concern: first, in the eleven years after Splenda was put on the market, no independent studies of sucralose lasting more than six months have been done in humans. Second, none of the trials that were done was very large \u2014 the largest was 128 people studied for three months, making us wonder, what happens when you\u2019ve used sucralose for a year, or two, or ten? Then there\u2019s the fact that Splenda, as a product, consists of more than just sucralose\u2014it\u2019s made with dextrose, and sometimes also with maltodextrin, neither of which were included in the original studies and trials of sucralose. So the reality is that we are the guinea pigs for Splenda.\u201dPlease refer: http://www.womentowomen.com/healthyweight/splenda.aspxIf you have high sugar levels in blood then you must follow this up with a glucose tolerance test and if this is also found abnormal then you must take up treatment for diabetes. This could be causing your weight gain. Also get your blood pressure checked.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
