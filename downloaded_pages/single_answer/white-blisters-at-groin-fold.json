            "answer": "Yes, this can simply be due to heat and friction.A good idea would be to make an appointment to see your doctor so that you can have a swab taken to identify any fungal problem.If you are overweight, sweating in that area can cause this uncomfortable condition.It would also be a good idea to get checked out for diabetes if you are prone to getting this condition.Wash regularly, morning and evening and dry gently.\u00a0\u00a0You can apply medicated talcs to help absorb any moisture.\u00a0\u00a0Wear only cotton underwear and no tight clothing and avoid nylon tights.If this is a fungal problem you will require a cream like Canesten which can also comes as a spray.\u00a0\u00a0Antifungal creams can be purchased from the pharmacy as well as antifungal talc.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that you do get the right one as some are for use on the feet.\u00a0\u00a0Your pharmacist will be able to advise you if you are not able to see your doctor.Seeing your doctor and getting a swab test taken, is the ideal as you may require more than just a course of an antifungal cream.Applying natural set yogurt to the cleaned and dry area will also help to sooth and heal.Do not neglect this, because it can get much worse and will take a lot longer to treat.\u00a0\u00a0Any open sores and wounds are also a source for bacteria to enter.Best wishes.",

    "question": "I have 5 white blisters at groin fold...this has been reoccurring for the last 4 weeks or so. It typically feels hot and uncomfortable in the area....similar to heat related chaffing. Upon investigating the area....I found 5 eraser head sized blisters that are easy to rupture and remove layer of skin. I don't believe it is herpes due to location and non-clustering. Can this simply be due to heat and friction?",
