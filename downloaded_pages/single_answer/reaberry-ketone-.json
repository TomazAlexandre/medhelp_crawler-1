To begin with:1. Choose to eat healthy food and maintain a healthy weightFor a list of \"diabetes superfood\", please go to:Diabetes Superfoods - American Diabetes Associationhttp://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/making-healthy-food-choices/diabetes-superfoods.html2. Make physical activity part of your daily routine.Studies had shown that regular daily exercises, like walking for 10 - 20 minutes, can lower your blood sugar and improve your A1C. Daily exercises is just as important and effective as your anti-diabetic medication(s).3. Decrease consumptions of sugar-sweetened drinks and fatty, processed food, such as chips, cakes and donuts.Metformin is a very effective anti-diabetic medicine. However, like all medicines, you need to take it correctly and with caution.

Instead of spending money on unclaimed dietary supplement, spend it on healthy, wholesome food, like fresh vegetables and complex carbohydrates.Here is a link to Type 2 Diabetes and Dietary Supplements: What the Science Says by National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), part of National Institute\u00a0\u00a0of Health, NIH.http://nccam.nih.gov/health/providers/digest/diabetes-science.htmIf you'd like more information on Diabetes Management and nutritions, please go to:1.
