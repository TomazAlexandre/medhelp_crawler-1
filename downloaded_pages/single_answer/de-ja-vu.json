    "question": "My best guy friends\u00a0\u00a0has diabetes and im\u00a0\u00a0not sure\u00a0\u00a0if its his medication they have him on which I believe\u00a0\u00a0it is called Metaformin but he is experience nausa. Also\u00a0\u00a0he says he has de ja vu alot\u00a0\u00a0and when he\u00a0\u00a0has it he suddenly will get very sick\u00a0\u00a0to his stomach and his\u00a0\u00a0head\u00a0\u00a0hurts then he\u00a0\u00a0loses\u00a0\u00a0track for a\u00a0\u00a0minute where he is at. He\u00a0\u00a0complains about a pain in\u00a0\u00a0his\u00a0\u00a0body his chest, stomach. Im\u00a0\u00a0not sure if he is having an anxeity or maybe some little\u00a0\u00a0seizure. He says he becomes very\u00a0\u00a0light\u00a0\u00a0headed\u00a0\u00a0 and he\u00a0\u00a0can still have a\u00a0\u00a0conversation but then sometimes its\u00a0\u00a0like he\u00a0\u00a0loses sight of whats going\u00a0\u00a0on. Now\u00a0\u00a0my concern is this the\u00a0\u00a0medication\u00a0\u00a0or is it something\u00a0\u00a0else that may be causing him\u00a0\u00a0to have\u00a0\u00a0these attacks. Also so you know he is a 25 year old\u00a0\u00a0male and he is 6'5. Thank you",
