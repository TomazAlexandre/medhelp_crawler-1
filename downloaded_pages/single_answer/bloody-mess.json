            "answer": "Did the doctor prescribe anything for you?If not, I am surprised that he did not prescribe an antihistamine for you.I presume the doctor examined the scratches and did not see any marks of scabies.\u00a0\u00a0Getting scabies will make you itch a lot.\u00a0\u00a0To treat scabies you would need the appropriate medication for this.\u00a0\u00a0Scabies is contagious so if your husband or other members of your family start to itch, think about whether you have scabies.\u00a0\u00a0With scabies, you may notice little white tram lines on your skin as they burrow underneath.Sometimes profuse itching can be caused by something that you eat, drink or touch, soaps, perfumes, detergents, plants, the list is endless.Sometimes if you get an animal scratch or a bug bite, an infection will set in.\u00a0\u00a0Have you been feeling well?\u00a0\u00a0If not you have a bacterial infection.Because you have scratched your skin raw, this is entry of bacteria to enter.\u00a0\u00a0Try not to scratch as hard as it is.\u00a0\u00a0Take a cool shower.You could apply natural set yogurt or calomine lotion or calomine based creams to the skin, but it appears that you have so much of your body itching.Another thing that can cause severe itching is if you have a glucose intolerance, pre diabetes or diabetes.In the meantime don't use normal soap, only use the soap that has a pH level as our skin, non perfumed soap and baby washes may be fine.If you have recently changed your detergent or fabric softener, your itching may be from that.\u00a0\u00a0Only use a non biological washing detergent and softeners for delicate skins.\u00a0\u00a0Wear cotton fabrics rather than nylon and wool.Coconut may be helpful because this has antifungal and antibacterial properties.\u00a0\u00a0Use the virgin coconut oil to rub into your skin.\u00a0\u00a0You can eat it off the spoon and use it in cooking too.\u00a0\u00a0It is the only oil that does not change its composition with heating.\u00a0\u00a0It is a trans fat, so be careful on the amount that you eat.You can also purchase Epsom Salts from the web.\u00a0\u00a0The larger the quantity the cheaper it becomes.\u00a0\u00a0Put 2 large cups full of Epsom Salts into your bath water and soak in that.\u00a0\u00a0You will need to put some baby oil or coconut oil into the water (not too much so that you don't slip and slide) as well as the Epsom Salts, because Epsom Salts are drying to the skin.\u00a0\u00a0Epsom Salts contain magnesium and that is absorbed through your skin.\u00a0\u00a0This is a good thin.\u00a0\u00a0Epsom salts neutralises the pH level of your skin.Keep a written record of everything that you eat, drink and touch to see if your condition worsens.\u00a0\u00a0This is so that you can avoid it.If you are still having the itching, see the doctor again and ask him to prescribe an antihistamine; consider whether you have an infection - and an antibiotic would be required for that.\u00a0\u00a0Ask him to arrange for you to have a blood test done to check your HbA1C levels and kidney and liver functions.",
