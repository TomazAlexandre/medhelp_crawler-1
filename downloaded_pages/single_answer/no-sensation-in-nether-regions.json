            "answer": "Hello,Get an examination done from a gynecologist and get nerve conduction tests done to rule out any nerve problem. It can be due to stress and anxiety or relationship problems with your partner. Talk to your husband for the psychological support. If you are having any stress, then this psychological support will help. A healthy affectionate communication with the partner helps in decreasing anxiety and stress.However if there is no stress and anxiety then the physical causes need to be ruled out. These include anemia, diabetes and hormonal imbalance. Some investigations which need to be done( some may have been done in the hormonal studies) are follicle stimulating hormone levels, estradiol, thyroxine and thyrotrophin levels in the blood test reports.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I need help. The most I feel when stimulating my clitorus is a slight tickling sensation. The only thing I feel from penetration is pressure. It's like there is no feeling down there what so ever. Yes, I am pulling back the hood. I know I can get aroused because I can feel throbbing and I do get wet. The problem is when I go to take care of the problem, nothing feels good. I've tried a vibrator a few times and manual stimulation to no avail. The only thing I haven't tried is oral sex and I am afraid to do it because what if I feel no pleasure from that? I would be devastated. I have never even been close to an orgasm and I'm 18. I don't understand what's wrong with me! Is it a hormonal problem, or is there damage down there? Can this be fixed. And before it's suggested, yes, I am relaxed. Deep breathing and all that jazz. I literally feel no please. Just maybe a bit of a tickle and the slight urge to pee. Maybe if I keep on it longer it will happen? Am I just being impatient? I hope so... Please help.",
