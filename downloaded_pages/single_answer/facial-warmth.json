            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Liver and kidney disorder may be responsible for facial warmth. If you are a lady, and in menopause age, then this is a common symptom. You would need to consult your gynecologist regarding this. Hormone replacement therapy usually helps. Alcohol, certain drugs, allergy to food additives, heat intolerance, hot beverages and food, anxiety, orthostatic hypotension, certain endocrine disorders like those involving the adrenals, diabetes etc all cause facial flushing. If there is a flush only during the day and after sports then it could be heat sensitivity. Apply cold compress on and off during the day. Splash a lot of cold water (not freezing cold but cool) on face on and off. See if this helps.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
