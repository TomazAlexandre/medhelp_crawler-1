    "question": "Hello, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 7 years ago at the age of 25.\u00a0\u00a0Recently I have noticed a strange odor on my pillow and in my room after a night of sleep. The strange thing is the smell doesnt seem to be on my clothes or anywhere else and only seems to emerge in the morning after sleeping. It is a strange smell that Ive never smelled before but definitely sticks to my pillows and is very present in the air in the room after sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0My girlfriend has on and off complained of a strange body odor as well. I have only noticed this in about the last year however, so I have no idea if it even has anything to do with my diabetes. Any ideas and information would be helpful because Im getting sick of this smell. Thank you.",
