            "answer": "Hi,Generalized pins and needles sensations can occur due to anxiety, stress, peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes, B 12 deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, and nerve compression due to disc herniation or prolapse in the spine.I would suggest you to take some B complex supplements and see if they help. Also do some deep breathing exercises to cut down your daily stress.If the symptoms do not improve please consult your GP and get a clinical evaluation done.Thanks",
