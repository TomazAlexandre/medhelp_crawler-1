            "answer": "Hi,How are you? It is good that the results are negative. If there is no improvement with the medications prescribed, you should inform your doctor so an alternative medication may be given. Try to avoid other medications unless prescribed to avoid exacerbation and always keep the area clean and dry.A boil\u00a0\u00a0is a localized infection deep in the skin. There are several different types of boils depending on the location: furuncle, carbuncle, cystic acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, or pilonidal cyst. Boils could be due to an ingrown hair, breaks in the skin infected with bacteria, foreign material that has become lodged in the skin, or plugged sweat glands that become infected. People with certain illnesses such as\u00a0\u00a0diabetes or kidney failure and taking medications impair the body's immune system are more likely to develop boils.Take care and do keep us posted.",
