            "answer": "Dear GopalJee,You and your mother are clearly faced with some tough decisions.\u00a0\u00a0Therapy for ovarian cancer is often taylored to the individual person. Their age, other medical conditions, and desires will always be factored in to deciding what to do.The standard of care that gives many women the best opportunity for a prolonged survival is surgery and chemotherapy.If possible a primary surgery is done to remove all or as much of the cancer as possible. This usually includes removal of the ovaries and tubes, the uterus, the apron of fat that hangs off the stomach which is called the omentum, the appendix, lymph node biopsies of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes. For many women with advanced ovarian cancer, a bowel resection is remove cancer is frequently performed.Following surgery, chemotherapy with carboplatin and taxol is administered for 6 to 8 treatment cycles. This is usually given through a vein (IV). In certain select women with stage 3 ovarian cancer (those who have optimal surgery, do not have alot of adhesions in the abdomen, and who have not had a bowel resection) , chemotherapy can be given directly into the abdomen (IP or intraperitoneal chemotherapy). This has many more side effects and many women are unable to tolerate the side effects.For women who have this therapy with stage 3 ovarian cancer, there is a 25 to 50 percent chance of living for 5 years or longer.For women who still have signs of cancer after this apporach, it is quite worrisome. Their chance of cure is very low. The chance that they will survival more than a year or two is also very low.\u00a0\u00a0For women who have signs of their cancer returning within a year or two, their chance of cure is very low as well.Your mother did not undergo surgery and she still has signs of her cancer. She has several life threatening medical conditions as well. You and she have decided to not consider further therapy for the cancer.I respect your decision but it is hard for me to comment on your decision.\u00a0\u00a0 I need the actual hard data on your mother's other medical conditions to accurately say what the risks of surgery are for her.I take care of many women who have successfully undergone heart surgery, have diabetes, and other conditions who are able to do well with aggressive surgery and chemotherapy. To understand risk, it is important to have a recent heart test such as a stress test or ultrasound of the heart to look at the function of the heart.I know this all must be very deifficultbest wishes",

    "question": "My mother was diagnosed of having Ca Ovary Stahe IIIc 9 moths ago. She is of 60 and has diabetes and already been through open-heart surgery.Soem 18 years back she had a surgery where only one of the ovaries was removed and probably that was a major mistake. The other one developed a Ca Ovary.She has already received 6 rounds of chemo with Carboplatin + Taxol. When diagnosed, the mass was of 7cm X 7 cm and now it is of 4cm X 2cm.She has now been advised for a surgery which I think, she is not willing to go for or probably, she will not withstand.When we told this to our doctor, we were then advised to go for chemo again. Since her last chemo was in Oct'07, and my mother is in good condition of following her daily routine herself, I would like to leave her as is and enjoy her life. And, as soon as it aggravates, we will face the chemo again.I need your help if we are thinking is appropriate.Please help.",
