    "question": "I only ask because I have been carrying around about 20-30 pounds of generalized pitting edema/fluid for about two years now and nobody can figure out the underlying cause.I've been screened for heart, liver, kidney diseases, as well as albumin/protein deficiency and thyroid issues. Everything comes back normal but I still have the fluid. When the edema gets severe, I feel very dried out, almost like I am dehydrated. Normal bp, no diabetes and I was normal weight before the water retention. I'm not taking any medsI've got some major colitis and gastritis issues but docs say that the edema is not connected",
