            "answer": "The diabetes does not usually (there may be exceptions) have anything to do with spasms. The usual reason is calcium deficient. Drink several glasses of milk may cure them. Sometime it is magnesium or potasiun deficiency. But be careful about taking too much. A single banana a day should put you in shape or a single magnesium glycinate capsule.The cramps are usually completely relieved by taking quinine sulfate tablets, which, unfortunately, after 100 years as an over-the-counter remedy, was taken off the market by the FDA. It is still available through friendly physicians. I have a good stockpile, which I made-up when there was notice it was going to be withdrawn. As long as you don't have cardiac problems and take them judiciously there should be no problem. They were withdrawn in the United States by the F.D.A. because there were several deaths, all amongst people who swallowed them like candy.",
