            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!This could be due to side effects of some medicines you recently started. Do you remember any? Rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, anemia, HIV/AIDS, and high blood pressure too produce similar symptoms. Bloatedness of stomach could be due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a common condition associated with Sjogren's syndrome. Infected salivary glands and dryness too both cause salty taste in mouth. Tingling feeling is due to dryness in the mouth.This needs a more detailed investigation and probably you should consult your doctor and get the tests done to rule out these problems. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
