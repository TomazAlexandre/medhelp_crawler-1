            "answer": "Recommended preliminary laboratory tests for men with sexual problems typically include fasting glucose, lipids, and hormonal profiles. These tests are performed primarily to identify or confirm specific causes (e.g., hypogonadism) or to assess the role of medical comorbidities or concomitant illnesses (e.g., diabetes, hyperlipidemia).The primary aim of these investigation is to identify treatable conditions or previously undetected medical illnesses that may contribute directly to erectile dysfunction. Additional laboratory tests (e.g., thyroid function) may be performed at the discretion of the physician based on the medical history and clinician's judgment.On the basis of the results of the above tests and correlating with physical examination, further advice may be sought from a specialist (e.g., cardiologist, endocrinologist, psychologist, or urologist).",

    "question": "Hi!I have been having problems attaining and maintaining erections for about three weeks now. I realize that this can be caused by stress and other psychological factor, but I have a \"feeling\" that there is something \"wrong\" with me physically. I know that the physical causes of said problem can range from problems with the arteries, diabetes, problems in the functionality of the lungs, liver or kidneys, pituitary gland or thyroid, and cancers of almost any of these organs, including the testicles. I have not noticed a lump, but I have had a dull ache in the groin area very recently (a few days now), but I know this doesn't have to be related to cancer. I went to a doctor Monday afternoon and told him of my fears. I fully admit to my status as a worrier, and he is very cognizant of my status as a hypochondriac and is almost certain (pending the results of some labs I did yesterday) that it is related to my problem. I was tested for diabetes and high blood pressure in his office and these things were eliminated as causes. They took some specimens (urine, blood - to check testosterone levels, and a throat culture because of some problems I have had there recently), and we are currently awaiting the results of those. Question: Knowing all this what tests would you go about using to be sure that the cause of the erectile dysfunction was not physical, as I will work towards resolving any mental causes as soon as I am sure the physical ones have been eliminated. Thanks!",
