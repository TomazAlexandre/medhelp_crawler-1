            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.It could be an allergic reaction to the medication. But since it is persistent there could be other causes for your symptoms. The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Certain systemic disorders like anaemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. So please consult your primary care physician who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test to rule out a cardiac cause for the symptoms. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest. Lung function tests could further help in evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
