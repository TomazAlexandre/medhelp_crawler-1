            "answer": "Hello,Without being able to review your entire history it will not be possible to give you an exact answer, but generally speaking the probability of a chest pain to be related to the heart depends on the characteristics of the pain and the risks factors of the patient (age, gender, smoking, cocaine use, family history of heart attack at young age), diabetes or high blood sugar, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. First of all, from the information that you provided is possible that you have pre-hypertension (early high blood pressure) that can be related to your weight (your body surface area is 33 and normal is <25), so you should check that with your physician. About the chest pain is hard to answer the question without knowing the characteristics of the pain, but the fact that you have the pain everyday and all the studies are negative so far, decrease significantly the chances that the pain is related to the heart. There are other possible explanations for chest pain, like spasms of the esophagus, acid reflux to the esophagus from the stomach or pain from the chest wall as an example.I suggest you to address the anxiety problem with your doctor and see if the symptoms decrease after lowering the stress levels.Good luck.",
