    "question": "Posted by Debbie on August 15, 1999 at 12:33:32My husband found out a year and a half ago he has Hep C.\u00a0\u00a0At that time his platelet count was 110,ooo.\u00a0\u00a0He has had a biopsy and has fibrosis and an enlarged spleen.\u00a0\u00a0In the last year his platlet count has dropped to 68,000.\u00a0\u00a0All the doctors keep saying is don't worry.\u00a0\u00a0I can't believe that this is ok to drop that much in that length of time.\u00a0\u00a0We also figure that he's had this for about 25 years, was a heavy drinker, but has been sober for two years now.\u00a0\u00a0What happens if platlets keep going down?\u00a0\u00a0He's also sick alot and has diabetes.Posted by HFHSM.D.-D.M. on September 08, 1999 at 15:42:45Dear Debbie:First I regret the delay in answering the MedHelp questions in the last month but the delay was due to factors outside my control.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate your questions and I appreciate your concern about your husband",
