    "question": "My father has recently suffered from a pontine hemorrhage. He is 56 years old and a diabetes victim, as well. The doctors gave us no hope in the beginning, but luckily, my father woke from the coma. It has been about 2 months now ince the accident. We feel like he recognizes us by our voices but we're worried about the extent of the recovery. If anyone has a familiar story, please share it with me- I would like to know the usual rate of recovery for such patients and how well an average patient recovers. Thank you",
