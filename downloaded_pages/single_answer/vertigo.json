            "answer": "Hi there. Vertigo can be caused due to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, labyrinthitis, meniere\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, head trauma, migraine etc.. Complications from diabetes can cause arteriosclerosis causing vertigo symptoms. Symptoms may be nausea, vomiting etc. Tests like electrocardiogram, CT scan, and blood sugars etc. should be done. Treatment involves treatment of any middle ear infection, vestibular rehabilitation exercises and certain medicines prescribed by the otolaryngologist. Take care.",
