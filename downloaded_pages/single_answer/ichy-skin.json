            "answer": "HiThis itch could be due to scabies, body lice, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis or fungal infection. It could be allergy or due to liver or thyroid problem or due to diabetes too. It can be due to excess dryness. Most itches are noticed at night as the body is warm in bed or at home and there are few distractions.Please discuss your case with your doctor. Since there can be many medical problems, a clinical judgment is required. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining and a detailed medical history. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted.",
