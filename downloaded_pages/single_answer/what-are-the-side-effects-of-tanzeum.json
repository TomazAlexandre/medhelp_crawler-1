    "question": "My sister, who is overweight but not currently diagnosed with any form of diabetes, was prescribed tanzrum by an internist to help manage her blood sugar levels and lose weight. Immediately following an injection she became sick. We thought it was a virus or food poisoning but it has last two weeks and she doesn't seem to be feeling any better. She feels weak and faint now. Before she could not eat anything, her stomach was a mess. Yesterday she cried because she was feeling so poorly and she just told me she is going to urgent care. Her internist said it was probably indigestion. Could this be a residual side effect from her medicine, tanzeum? Why would an internist prescribe a diabetes drug if she didn't have diabetes? Is that normal?",
