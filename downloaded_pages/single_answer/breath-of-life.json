            "answer": "Hi!If you have ALS and it is progressing then yes, you can have problem with breathing. Breathlessness can be due to several causes. The commonest cause is anemia. It can also be due to asthma like conditions, bronchitis, high blood pressure, diabetes, hypothyroidism or obesity. Certain heart conditions too can cause breathlessness like mitral valve prolapse, high pulmonary artery pressure etc. Stress and anxiety too can be a cause and so also gastric reflux. What is important is to find out whether you are breathless all the time or is it due to exertion. At times certain triggers can cause breathlessness like a visit to a dusty area, using the blower of a vacuum cleaner, visit to a garden with flowers, perfumes, sprays etc. This is a type of allergic asthma and avoiding allergens will help take care. The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Take care!",
