    "question": "I get a yeast infection at least once a month and I have no sex drive.\u00a0\u00a0I also tend to tear alot during intercourse.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried talking to two different GYN about it and neither seem to think there is a problem with it.\u00a0\u00a0Even if it isn't a medical problem, it is a problem for me personally, it isn't fair that my husband has to suffer sexually in our relationship because of me.I have tried Diflucan, OTC creams, plain yogurt, primal defense for women, showers and no baths, airing out before I get dressed and nothing has worked.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have HIV, diabetes, and I am not pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any insight to what might be causing this or are the two problems possibly linked?",
