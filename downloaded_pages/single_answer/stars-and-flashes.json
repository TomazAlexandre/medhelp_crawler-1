I have diabetes type 1 due to removal of 80% of my pancreas. I just had a check up at the eye doctor for a check\u00a0\u00a0up and a base for my diabetes. I know i have ocular migraines. These are not the same. I,m 48 and suffer from chronic panceratitis, gastropararises, hypothyriodism, and take many meds. I wander if all my meds. could be causing the stars or something else. I've had many x-rays and cat scans but not for this reason but nothing has come up about them.",
