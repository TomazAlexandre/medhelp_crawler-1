            "answer": "Hello,One of the possibilities for such burning sensations is hormonal changes which occur at this age i.e. because of menopause. The other possibilities are parasathesia because of abnormal functioning of neurons. It can also occur due to diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, vita min B 12 deficiency, thyroid disease or malnutrition. I suggest you to consult a gynaecologist for your mother and get her started on hormonal replacement therapy.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
