            "answer": "your big problem is the Btetta, if u go to the byetta website and read the formum u will see what I am talking about, I have 2 pkgs in my frig, I refused to take them after reading all the hoar storys of Byetta. I always look up Diabetic med's on line to find out the risks. U should let your Dr know right away, your med's may need adjusting, and I swear I would ask about the Byetta because it has caused Pancreitis and this is soemthing your dr can test u for. Something is really wrong, and if its that (pancreaitis) then after treatment u might see a change. I was glad I found the byetta website, I asked my new Dr to do a C-peptide and I had a level showing hardly any insulin coming from my pancreas, and byetta would have killed me. So please go to your Dr, u shouldn't be feeling like this, Debbie",

    "question": "I am 56 year old male. Diagnosed type 1.5 diabetic about four years ago. Lost 42 pounds. 6' 2\" tall and now 194 pounds as required by doctor. BMI 24.2. Blood pressure and cholesterol perfect. Originally I had issues with high glucose levels into the 250+ range but following the weight loss my highs are at a minimum. Have a huge family history of diabetes so none of this was unexpected.Problem.\u00a0\u00a0I can be at 190 and within minutes drop to 25. These precipitous drops are not only debilitating but dangerous.\u00a0\u00a0I have virtually no warning. I have tried for four years now to find a common denominator that causes these severe drops. Knowing what I face with diabetes and a family history I have taken this seriously and adhere to strict diet and exercise programs.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is not unfamiliar to me.\u00a0\u00a0I have NO desire to eat. Food has no taste to me at all and I have to force myself to take each and every bite.\u00a0\u00a0But, I take each bite and adhere to a solid diet of 1600 - 1800 calories per day with no more than 200 to 220 carbs per day.\u00a0\u00a0After eating I feel bloated and uncomfortable with some nausea at times.\u00a0\u00a0But it passes.\u00a0\u00a0I take Byetta 10ml 2X per day along with Metforming 500 mg.\u00a0\u00a0.What I think I have discovered is that about 1.5 - 2 hours following a full meal is when I seem to crash. Not all of the time but with some frequency.. I can eat a perfectly balanced meal\u00a0\u00a0.\u00a0\u00a0. carbs, calories, protein,\u00a0\u00a0. . . . everything as directed and I still can crash to 25 to 35 with no warning. I have tried eating small frequent meals throughout the day but cannot always do that.\u00a0\u00a0Still, I have these sudden drops.I believe something is wrong gastronomically.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for gastroparesis and damage to the vagus nerve and while my processing may be a little slow it does not appear to be slow enough to cause this problem.Does anyone have any experience with this issue?\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe this is just simply a case of hypoglycemia, although one can be hypoglycemic and diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I am extremely frustrated after gaining control of my high numbers and not be able to stop these terrible, sudden drops.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any help or suggestions.Thanks,Yorkster",
