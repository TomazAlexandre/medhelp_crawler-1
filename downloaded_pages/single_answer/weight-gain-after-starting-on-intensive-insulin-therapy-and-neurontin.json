            "answer": "Hi, I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I can find many comments and notes about how Neurontin causes weight gain, but nothing about how to stop that weight gain, other than to look for an alternative medicine.Are you finding you are eating more now?\u00a0\u00a0If your glucose scores aren't under control, it can cause you to eat more, which would cause more fat to be stored.\u00a0\u00a0If eating too much is adding to the problem, there is a product called Symlin which can reduce your appetite.\u00a0\u00a0It is an artificial form of another protein that your pancreas makes, which also stops when your pancreas stops producing insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Just a couple ideas for you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
