            "answer": "i have been having this problem, since sometime in June 2008, about a yr after my disc at L5/S1 ruptured causing cauda equina syndrome. These pains st\u00e0rted about a year later. At first I thought that maybe I was getting some of the feeling back on my left side but after 7 years I'm thinking that ship has sailed and still the pain persist\u00a0\u00a0It's like having someone put a live wire against my left foot for a few seconds at a time,over and over, causing me to not be able to do simple things like\u00a0\u00a0cleaning house, getting a full nights sleep. I have been surfing the web trying to get an idea of what it is. I did tell my pain management\u00a0\u00a0doctor about it h e laughed it off and blamed it on the diabetes. I have talked to other diabetics and when I describe my pain they are surprised and have no idea what I'm talking about. If any of you have been told the cause or even a suspected cause of these 'shocks.'",
