            "answer": "A glomerular filtration rate of 56 is a moderate decrease in kidney function and is not unexpected on the basis of her age and her diabetes. A nephrologist could give you a more expert opinion, but I do not think that you can predict that she is facing kidney failure in the sense that she will require dialysis. I think that she needs to be followed with checks of her renal function over time to learn if there is a trend. Certainly, better control of her diabetes and reduction of her triglycerides will help to maximize her chances of avoiding or slowing down further decline in her glomerular filtration rate.Hope that this helps.S.A.Liroff, M.D.This information is provided for general medical educational purposes only.
