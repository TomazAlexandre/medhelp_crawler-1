            "answer": "Hi,It depends on when that blood sugar was taken. If that was a fasting sugar in the morning, atleast 8 hours after eating anything, then it is high and actually already in diabetes range. If\u00a0\u00a0it was random(and some time during the day after eating) it may not be too bad, and you will need further testing to determine if you have diabetes(or pre-diabetes).In the meantime, definitely do as you are doing: increase your exercise and watch what you eat. If you are overweight, try to start a weight loss program with a goal of losing about 7-10% of your current weight. We know from research studies that this small amount of weight loss can drastically reduce your chances of developing diabetes in future.Best of luck and take care.",

    "question": "Hello. About 4 months ago I had blood work done and my glucose was 117. Now, a few weeks ago, I had blood work done and it went up to 137. I have a Doctor's appointment on March 7 to discuss\u00a0\u00a0my bloodwork. Diabetes runs in my family and I pray that I do not get it. Is it true that with diet and exercise you can possibly prevent it? I have started to eat less and ride the exercise bike and walk the treadmill, but I am scared that it might be too late. Does anyone know what the normal sugar should be at? Is 137 really high?Thanks, Louie13",
