    "question": "My wife is diabetic and when her lower limbs itch she scratches them in spite of a history of wounds that take many weeks or months to heal. I'll take her to urgent care tomarrow but I wanted to share our short term treatment. Out of despiration I have taken to putting a wrung-out CLEAN cloth in the freezer for 15 minutes then applying it to her legs.
