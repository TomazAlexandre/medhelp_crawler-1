            "answer": "Hi,You could have a UTI or prostatitis. If you have been sexually active there is a chance that you could have a STD as well. The grabbing sensation you feel could be a cramp.UTIs can occur due to inadequate fluid intake, inflammation or infection of the prostate gland, underlying disease in the kidney, infections in sexual partner, untreated STDs, underlying metabolic disorders such as diabetes, etc. The infective organisms may be located only within the prostate and/or kidney and come into the urethra during ejaculation. If they are not flushed away by urine, they would continue to be present in the urethra and try to grow there causing irritation and pain.You will need to have a urinalysis done, preferably from a sample collected just after ejaculation. This should be followed by a culture sensitivity test to determine which antibiotic the organism is sensitive to.Antibiotic therapy is prescribed based on the organism isolated and the antibiotic sensitivity that has been reported for the organism.Ensure that you keep your fluid intake over 2000 ml per day and avoid irritants, such as caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. Also avoid sitting for long periods of time or on surfaces that are not well padded. You can also increase intake of citrus fruits an juices to acidify your urine and to flush out the bacteria from your urinary tract.If you do indulge in intercourse during the period of treatment, ensure that you practise safe sex (condoms) so as to not infect or be infected by your partner.Do keep us posted on your doubts and progress.",
