            "answer": "Hi,This may be nerve related. Do you experience similar sensation in other parts of the body? Is there any discoloration in the nail or the affected area?I suggest that you continue to observe this. If this has been present for quite some time already then an initial consult with a neurologist may be able to help. A blood test to rule out diabetes and also a complete neurological examination may be necessary.",
