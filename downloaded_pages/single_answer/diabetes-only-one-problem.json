            "answer": "HI,I am afaid that I cannot give specific comments because I do not know your history in detail, and it sounds rather complicated from your brief outline. You likely have seen some very good doctors and had appropriate tests done, so I would hope that atleast one of them has you on the correct path.\"Empty sella syndrome\" is actually a radiological diagnosis moreso than endocrine because people can have totally normal pituitary function even if an MRI reads \"empty sella\"--what often is the case is that the pituitary is pressed\u00a0\u00a0up against the side of the sella so it looks \"empty\" but infact it works just fine. So the real diagnosis has to come from your endocrine tests.Addisons is most often autoimmune in nature, and can be accompanied by other autoimmune diseases. Is your thyroid disease autoimmune?Again I am sorry I cannot be of more help, but I am quite limited in what I can suggest on this forum(here we are rather general--what you need is more specific second opinion and that requires in depth knowledge of your medical history). If you like, you can contact me at my practice website www.endocrinehelp.com to discuss a formal second opinion. Otherwise I think you should try to speak as much as you can with your current Endo and press for answers to your questions.Best of luck to you, take care.",

    "question": "My endo. did an ultrasound of my thyroid in her office. Except of \"no blood flow\" she said it looked normal so the \"problems\" must be coming from the pituitary\". I tried asking questions about what could be wrong, etc. however, she said \"we would probably never know\" &that it would probably \"never change or improve\". I also have problems with Addisons, repeatedly high PTH labs, Diabetes now, low VitD, 1MRI\u00a0\u00a0saying I had Empty Sella but have had normal MRIs since&also a few other abnormal ENDO. labs. Should I be satisfied with this answer regarding the pituitary and thyroid? Are all these problems related? They have all come up within the last 3 years or so.\u00a0\u00a0My PCP has sent me to three different ENDOs and recently even to the Mayo Clinic where the ENDO felt I had too many \"rare things wrong for them to all be true\" so he \"didn't believe any of them\". I also have Ehlers Danlos.Help plz. Have no $ for more docs as my health is going downhill and the costs are rising! Thank you so much for any health or direction. I am so exhausted all the time now and am in chronic pain from the Ehlers Danlos.",
