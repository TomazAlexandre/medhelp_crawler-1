    "question": "I read an interesting article about using omega 3 fish oil to treat bi polar.In a double blind test bi polar people responded well to treatment favorably over bi polars that didnt.I thought it was interesting because I started omega 3 along with vitamin e and c to prevent diabetes.Now I am not giving up my celexa zyprexa combo but I was wondering if I could maybe lower my dosage.I am making plans to talk to med manager at my next appointment and see if she has heard anything about this.( I also take the B vitamins as wellas calcium and magnisium)I would also like to hear from anyone about the bio thing they are using in Canada to treat bi polar.Love Venora",
