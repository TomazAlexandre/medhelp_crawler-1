            "answer": "All you can do is reassure him that you love him and want him to be around and healthy for many years to come. If you have children you can remind him they need their dad and he is putting himself at risk for many many illnesses. Weight is the cause of so many medical problems which he is already beginning to see. Perhaps his doctor can talk to him as well as many people respect professional opinions. Since he used to play football perhaps you can appeal to that side of him that used to relish being fit and active, or have his buddies talk with him as well. But the bottom line, I'm afraid is that you can't make a person change. They have to want to. Is there a chance he is depressed? Depression is a very real condition and it affects everything from motivation, to appetite to sleep. If so, this is something he can speak with his doctor about. Best of luck to you.",
