Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I had a cardiac arrest in 1995 resulting in a mitral valve replacement, defibrillator implanted in abdomen, and pacemaker.\u00a0\u00a0Since then I have been diagnosed with CHF and an upgrade to a bi-ventricular pacemaker.\u00a0\u00a0Last Dec. it was discovered the epicardial leads from the defibrillator were causing problems and needed to be removed.\u00a0\u00a0I had a laser\u00a0\u00a0lead extraction done, defibrillator removed, and a combination device--biventricular pacemaker/defibrillator.\u00a0\u00a0Since that time I have been in atrial fibrillation most of the time.\u00a0\u00a0I have also developed a much distended belly diagnosed as chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction.\u00a0\u00a0I was told to go on amiarodone for the -Afib and to live with the cipo.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know of any correlation between the heart issues and the development of CIPO?
