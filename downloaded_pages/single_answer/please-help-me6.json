    "question": "Hi there I'm a fifteen year old female. Sense july fifth I get up every morning starting at four with a terrible stomach ache and the need to puke and poop. I would usually lay down till I couldnt handle it anymore and would get up and puke up bile and very very soft stool. Sense september first I've been getting worse. I was puking up bile and having really soft stools. This continued into the beginning of the school year and then one morning I was so sick my mom took me to the doctors who just tested me for mono. (I've had strep throat seven times this year twice in the summer and it always takes me atleast a week to recover) it came back negative and she sent.me.home thinking I was just a stomach bug and sent me home. Tuesday came I was the same then Wednesday took a turn for the worse. Ontop of waking.up sick everyday and not.being.able to eat I was having.severe upper right abdominal pain. I went to my other doctor.who said I should.have been on acid reflex medicine sense.I was younger. Then she continued to examine me and saw I was having pain and symptoms of somthing being wr with my gallbladder so she sent me for an ultra sound. It was so painful it had me in.tear. that's how sensative that area is. The ultra sound came back finand so did the blood work. That night I was getting worse and at ten o'clock I started puking.up bile.and.couldn't.stop!! I got to the emergency room.and continued to puke and they gave me.dilotin!!! They took xrays of my lungs and chest. I also peed in a cup got more blood.work and examoned but everything.appeared okay aloth my doctor at the hospitol was gonna do a catscan but decided to presceibe me vikes and nausua pills. I was continuing to have this pain and went back to the er about five days later and at this point I've missed two weeks of school.\u00a0\u00a0When I.got.back to.the hospitol and I was describing.my.symptoms to the nurse she was rolling her eyes and pretty much saying there's nothing wrong with me and being.completly rude! Then the doctor came in (different one from my last hospitol trip) and she examined me and said she couldn't see anything wrong I need to see a gi doctor. But she said I have the symtoms.of biliary dykanisis or sometjing like that. She prescribed me perks motrin and nasua pills and sent me on my way. Finally third week being deathly sick I get a gi doctor who.sends me for a catscan. Of course durning the test I have an allergic reactoction to the contrast but I was fine and so were the results. My gi then decided to do a stomach biopsy and that came.back fine. Yesturday (fourth week of being sick) I got a hida scan.and.after an hour.there was no.sign of my.gallbladder which would mean its abnormal. They told me and my mom to come back in an hour and still no food or drink. I went back and they put me under and saw only alittle has filled. The girl doing the test left the room for a minute and the man who looks at the test came in and double.checked and made sure I haven't had ny food or water.. then the girl.came in and they decided to carry on with seeing if my gallbladder is functioning properly. At the end he cMe.back in and said my.gallbladder emptied fine but was delayed at filling. He said it wasn't abnormal but the girl who ran the test said she thibks it is and also went on to ask the man if its possible for my.gallbladder to be functiong correctly but still hurt he said no. Then when he left the room and we were about to leave she said it could be a piece to the puzzle. I'm still waiting to hear from my gi doctor about results and were.we.go.from here but please someone.help me. I'm a teenager who just wants to be healthy. I haven't even been able to hold my one year old niece!!
