            "answer": "Occurring 6 months after your father's hip replacement, a direct association between the surgery and the pleural effusion would be very unlikely.\u00a0\u00a0The common complication, of pulmonary embolus, following this surgery would have occurred in the immediate post-operative period, not 6 months later.\u00a0\u00a0If, however, the hip replacement has not gone well, resulting in your father's chronic immobilization, that could predispose him to thrombophlebitis and clots to the lung.\u00a0\u00a0Pleural effusions due to pulmonary embolism are usually exudates (75%) and may or may not contain blood.Congestive heart failure in association with left bundle branch block (LBBB), with or without a heart attack, can result in pleural effusions, but these are transudates (not exudates) seldom massive and almost never unilateral.\u00a0\u00a0The LBBB itself is not correctable but the consequences of LBBB, heart failure and arrhythmias are treatable.\u00a0\u00a0The treatment is often complex and should be under the supervision of a cardiologist.You are right, there is some urgency in determining the cause of this effusion.\u00a0\u00a0There are a number of causes of unilateral, massive, exudative pleural effusion but the most common causes are infection and cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Any fluid removed should be examined for infectious organisms, including tuberculosis (TB) and malignant cells.\u00a0\u00a0If these tests are negative and if there are no shadows in the lung on x-ray, that is, the lungs are clear, a pleural biopsy should be done.\u00a0\u00a0If a mass or infiltrate of the lung is present on chest x-ray or CT scan of the lung, bronchoscopy by a pulmonary specialist and/or CT guided needle biopsy by an interventional radiologist should be considered.\u00a0\u00a0If, again, the lung is clear, the most direct way to a diagnosis will be by examination of the pleura.Your statement that biopsy is not much better than examination of the pleural fluid is correct, for closed or 'blind' pleural biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0However, when biopsy is performed under local anesthesia via thoracoscopy, which allows for direct visualization of the pleural surface, the diagnostic yield can exceed 90%.\u00a0\u00a0This procedure is usually performed by a thoracic surgeon or a pulmonologist.The biopsy should be examined microscopically and should be cultured for fungi and TB.\u00a0\u00a0Once the diagnosis is established with certainty, it should be possible to relieve your father's pain.Good luck.",

    "question": "Pre-assessment (in Spring/06) for a hip-replacement operation revealed that my 86-year-old father has a left Bundle Branch Blockage (electrical current to heart.)\u00a0\u00a0The hip operation was done in July/06.\u00a0\u00a0In December/06, he suffered a large left-sided pleural effusion - 3 litres were drained off.\u00a0\u00a0The fluid analysis was exudative with some blood, but no cause was revealed.\u00a0\u00a0He continues to have periodic undiognosed nipping/jabbing twinges under his left breast and towards his side.(He has diet-controlled, type 2 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He is taking Enalapril for high blood pressure, Doxazosin for hypertension, Simvastatin for cholesterol and a daily Aspirin.)QUESTIONS:1.Could there be a connection between the hip operation and the pleural effusion? If so, will it clear by itself?2.Given that there is probably some urgency in determining the cause of the pleural effusion, what would be the most efficient order in which to do that? CT lung scan? Ultrasound? MRI? D-dimer test? Biopsy (would Biopsy be recommendable given his age, the excruciating pain, and the fact that biopsies only yield 9 per cent results over the effusion analysis?) Thoracentisis? CT Angiography? Other?3.What investigation should be done about his Left Bundle Branch Blockage?4.\u00a0\u00a0Should he be seeing a pulmonologist or a cardiologist or both?Thank you very much for your help.\u00a0\u00a0I will be waiting anxiously for any information on this.",
