    "question": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. I had a bi-lateral mastectami, with clear margins, no lymph node involvement. On a recent heart ct scan they found several lung nodules, 1 measuring 1.2 cm. These were not on my chest x-ray a year ago.I had a pet scan, and the doctor said it didn't show any signs of cancer. I have read that with diabetes you can sometimes get a false negative. My blood sugars have been running between 200-300, do you think that further testing will be required to make sure this is not cancer? My doctor isn't planning to check it again for 4 months, and that seems too long to me.",
