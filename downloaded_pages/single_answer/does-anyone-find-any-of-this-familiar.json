            "answer": "Since you have been hyper AND hypo, I would suggest you ask for antibody tests for both conditions. Three or four, not just TPOab.If you have Hashimoto's, which is auto-immune hypothyroidism, it can sometimes cause a hyperthyroid phase, which is transient and can cause a lot of confusion in diagnosing the exact problem.You could also have \"hot nodules\" which are spitting out hormone unpredictably. I think nodules would show up on an MRI, but I'm not sure. An ultrasound would show nodules. An uptake scan would show any hot nodules. A hot nodule would cause your levels to go up and down.If you don't have any significant nodules, you may have antibodies for Grave's and Hashimotos both. There are fifty ways to have a thyroid problem, and it may take several different tests to give you the correct diagnosis.I'm surprised the Endo hasn't run more tests. You may want to consider a second opinion and see if a different Endo will be a little more motivated to pinpoint your specific type of thyroid disorder.Some Endos specialize in Diabetes, because it is less complicated and there is a limitless supply of patients. You need to find an Endo that treats thyroids every day, and is interested in getting to the root of the problem rather than treating the test result of the week.",

    "question": "In 2004 I was diagnosed with graves disease by high labs and an uptake scan.\u00a0\u00a0I was prescribed Tapazol and 6 months my symptoms went away which included feeling like I had 15 cups of coffee, brain fog, feeling like I had amnesia, palpitations (those didn't go away), but the most bothersome was panic attacks so I had to completely avoid caffeine.\u00a0\u00a0From January 2005-August 2007 no problems.\u00a0\u00a0Now in September of 2007 everything started all over again but my panic attacks was the first to start.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the dr and labs showed slight hyperthyroid.\u00a0\u00a0My panic attacks started manifesting in weird ways so I am now on Xanax which is starting to not work as well as it did when I first started taking it.\u00a0\u00a0Went to Endocrinologist and labs came back hypo except I am having the symptoms of hyper ( sweating, feeling shaky, palpitations, can't remember much, and panic attacks) but I was put on 50 mcg of synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0Developed a headache that finally went away after I was told to stop synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0Just recently started to being thirsty enough to notice it. Had MRI for TSH adenoma or any other abnormality in the pituitary gland, result was negative.\u00a0\u00a0So now I am starting all over again.\u00a0\u00a0Could anyone give me a suggestion as to what this might be?\u00a0\u00a0One thing that I know no that I didn't back in '04 is that there are many test that I haven't had.\u00a0\u00a0No antibody test just TSH, T4 and Free T4 thats it.",
