    "question": "My 4 year old granddaughter who has had diahrrea for the past few weeks, wakes up shakey and not feeling well. She was taken to the ER where her blood sugar was found to be 220. She also had red and white blood cells in her urine, as well as glucose, ketones, and protien. Could this be a result of dehydration? Or is there a chance she could have type 1 DM?",
