    "question": "I don't know what happen but here is the story.\u00a0\u00a0I am a female and over 50 yrs old.\u00a0\u00a0I recently quit smoking and at the same time my doctor put me on 50,000 units of vit d for 8 weeks 1x wk. I also cut down on my blood pressure medicine propanolol by half.Within 4 weeks of this happening, my hands suddenly started to swell with red plams, very swollen, and then very painful. I also noticed I was not urinating as much.\u00a0\u00a0This lasted about 4 weeks and then the swelling and pain started to subside.\u00a0\u00a0The next 4 weeks I just have minor pain and slight swelling with red palms. I also have diabetes controled by diet.It is going into the 3rd month and this has not gone away.\u00a0\u00a0I see an arthritis doctor in a couple of more week.sI am hoping this has nothing to do with a disease ie arthritis, etc. I am thinking maybe i shocked my system with quitting smoking cold turkey and reduce my meds might have something to with it.\u00a0\u00a0Any help out there",
