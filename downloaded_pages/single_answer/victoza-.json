    "question": "I was just put on this medicine.\u00a0\u00a0I love it for the fact that my sugars were out of control. Even with insulin and an oral mediation. The Dr is trying to get it approved through insurance. I just hope I can keep taking it for the first time in a year 1/2 my sugar is under control. I do need to lose weight also but my first priority is to get it in check. Cause no matter what I eat my sugar goes up. I just hope I can keep taking it.",
