Low Testosterone and Diabeties can go hand and hand...\u00a0\u00a0Low Test for a long time can shrink the penis and this sounds like what is happenening... the Dr should have known about this...\u00a0\u00a0His Low Testosterone could be a big contributing factor as to why he has diabeties cause the androgens make the receptors in the muscles more receptive to insulin and Type 2 diabeties is insulin resistance... so what happens is more glycogen is stored into the fat cells instead of the muscle cells... in return the higher excess fat converts more testosterone into estrogen and estrogen upregulates more fat storage and the process keeps repeating...\u00a0\u00a0If he gets on Testosterone replacement his penis will come back out to normal again and his receptors will be more receptive to insulin and his diabeties should improve quite a lot...Hope you stop back to read this...\u00a0\u00a0its sad to see Dr's not looking at the whole picture of health and then treating the symptoms instead of the root problem...",

    "question": "My good friend has shared a problem with me and I am trying to help him get more advice. He is single, has diabetes and is overweight. His penis has been retracted approx. 4 years. and his MD said not to worry about it if it wasnt a problem (not active). However, his penis can no longer be coaxed out at all because his foreskin (circumsized) is all that is outside. It has tightened into a hard tight circle which is too small to let the penis head come out, even if flacid. He thinks nothing can be done. Is this true? Is there no procedure that could possibly clip the foreskin enough to let the penis head back out. As far as the retraction itself, it appears to be medication related. Thanks for your help.",
