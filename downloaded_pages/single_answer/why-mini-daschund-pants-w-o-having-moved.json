            "answer": "Ask your vet to do an x-ray or other imaging of her.\u00a0\u00a0Also ask your vet to run a complete blood panel on her (looking for diabetes too).The panting and vomiting could be diabetes, kidney problems, intestinal blockage . . . there is a lot going on that could be treated.\u00a0\u00a0 (We kept my sweet doxie boy around for an additional 6 months while treating his diabetes)My sweet doxie girl, the same age as yours, has cancer and it causes similar symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0We had to put her through multiple surgeries for the cancer last year but she is doing SO MUCH better now.\u00a0\u00a0Don't give up on your baby - doxies are the greatest gift to those of us who are privileged enough to be owned by them.Also talk to your vet about putting her on stool softeners - she is probably holding her stool because she is afraid of the pain (which just complicates the problem more).It's worth the investment on additional testing.UtahmommaThree beautiful doxies sleeping at my feet right now and one waiting at the rainbow bridge",

    "question": "I have a mini daschund, female almost 10 yrs. old. Several months ago I had to rush her to vet because her anal glands ruptured tearing her skin & requiring surgery to stitch her w/ several stitches. She recovered and been taken back to vet several times to have them expressed, but for the last month or so (she's been constipated several times for very long time) she has for no reason at all, would start panting as if she had been running, would try to use the bathroom @ same time & be in great pain all @ same time, she throws up, (she's an inside only pet) so we know she hasn't eaten anything from outside. I hope you can help, she's always trying to go to bathroom, panting, and throwing up. Is it time to put her down?",
