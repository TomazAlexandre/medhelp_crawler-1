    "question": "Hello,This is for my 59 year old mother who has been experiencing chronic diarrhea for the past 10 years. It all started with her first colonoscopy 10 years ago, and then she had another one about 3 years ago and it has become very bad. She eats pretty normal, nothing special or horrible, but also just standard. There is nothing really cut out of her diet, but she also is not eating buckets of ice cream. She has no idea what is wrong, and doctors also seem to be stunned. She has tried probiotics\u00a0\u00a0and added fiber, but that is not doing anything. I was not sure if it could be IBS or Colitis, or maybe diabetes? She is not a large large lady, probably about 135 and 5'4. Any thoughts would be appreciated!",
