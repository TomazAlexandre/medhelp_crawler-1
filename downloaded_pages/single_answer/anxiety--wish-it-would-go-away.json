Maybe go once and get a feel for it.\u00a0\u00a0It will be a lot easier to make an informed decision when you've tried it once.",

    "question": "I'm 29 years old. I have taken birth control pills sinceI was 19 years old. Wish I have never been on the pill. I am thinking that the change in hormone balance has made me an anxious mess for years. I finally went off the pill 6 months ago. I don't feel any better but I don't want to go back on the pill again. My symptoms are when I exercise my left leg gets tingly and tight. Sometimes my arm tingels or hurts. Sometimes I get a weird tingly dull pain on the left side of my head and sometimes its associated with tingles on my left side of my face. I've gone to the neuroligist had an mri done and was fine. I had bloodwork after I told the dr about my leg tingling and the bloodwork was to find out if I was B12 deficient or if I had diabetes those came up negative. I've had 2 ekgs done in the past few months from chest tightness or pain. That came back fine. I have not been on any meds other than occosionally taking .25 mg of xanax which helps\u00a0\u00a0calm me down but does not get rid of the symptoms. I just got presricbed to take Zoloft again but not sure if I want to go down that path again. Nothing seem to help. If I do take meds it helps for a few months or almost a year and then I'll get anxiety symptoms all over again. I have never sought out counseling somehow I dont think talking to a stranger would help. I don't know what to do anymore. I just feel like laying in bed all day every day. I do feel better knowing that there are so many people that have these weird crazy feelings and symptoms but I wish there was a cure so we all didn't have to deal with this for the rest of our lives. It's so sad. I guess I don't really have a question. I just wanted to share my story and hope we all over come our daily battles with anxiety. If anyone has suggestions on how to do that please share. Thank you.",
