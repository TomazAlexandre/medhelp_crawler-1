            "answer": "Hey Jaz. Tough place to be for sure.While personally I have had no direct experience as a patient of these conditions, there a few things that I can suggest,through my\u00a0\u00a0Natural and Holistic health studies, my ownpersonal dealings with PTSD/anxiety/undiagnosed systemic condition (which are all behind me now) and the complex patient cases I have taken on, specially when conventional medicine has failed to provide answers.So your UC operation may have saved your life, help you remain fairly healthy, however, it did not remove entirely theunderlying factors responsible for your UC development.Autoimmunity is by far the leading theory behind the cause of UC, with genetics playing a role in at least 25% of all UC cases.The autoimmune cause, is consistent, in your case with theonset of Diabetes 1 (Diabetes mellitus is a common A/I disorder, significantly associated with UC) and as of recent with your MS diagnosis.Your likelihood of getting diagnosed with additional autoimmune conditions increases after your 1st A/I diagnosis.Genetics alone do not fully explain this phenomenon,however, underlying co-factors involved in genetic mutationexpression should be explored.My suggestion is to get\u00a0\u00a0genetic testing asap.By identifying gene mutations, you can explore through epigenetics the possibility of correcting the effects of thesemutations.On a side note, I\u00a0\u00a0recently helped a friend with MS get on Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) who has since experienced notable improvement.LDN is not an established conventional medicine therapy (orphan drug with very little profit potential & off label)You should look into it, but beware, most doctors are notkeen on prescribing off label, unless they are familiar withthe particular therapy.I would also do exhaustive testing for deficiencies, but you must know what to look for and what tests to avoid, as many tests are flawed giving false negative results, keeping patients in limbo.\u00a0\u00a0Preferably after the genetic testing.My last suggestion is to do a comprehensive elimination diet, group by group, starting with the wheat/grain/gluten group for a minimum of 3 months, since gluten effectscan linger around for many months after the elimination of gluten.As an alternative to the above, you may want to try Dr Coca's Pulse test, which takes a week to complete.It's free download. Not a conventional medical test.Another self-test without any profit potential for thehealth care industry.Oh, I almost forgot. You need to rule out the presence of Candida in your body. Nothing improves/heals well when one has CandidaJust try the saliva test for candida as a screening test.Look it up online and repeat a couple times to confirm.Let me know what you think.I hope this helps.Best wishes,Niko",

    "question": "34 years ago, age 22, major life saving op due to quick onset of ulcerative colitis,\u00a0\u00a0then 4 years ago at age 52, in good health, or so it seemed I woke up with a numb face, blood test confirmed I had type 1 diabetis. A year later bouble vision, several MRI scans later in late 2014, diagnosed with MS.Strange , but I am healthy, very little time off work apart from recovery from the op all those years ago. I take my meds, insulin, small unit amounts twice a day and capaxone 3 times a week.Just wondered, all linked to auto immune, I think, is there any one out there with a similar treble and how do they cope, the MS symtoms are frustration, sometimes anger is my main issue, the tiredness I adjust well to. At 56 I am lucky that I dont need to work, I would struggle due to tiredness but lucky I can walk, balance a bit poor, had to give up on golf because of it, I was good and expectations too high, with balance and timing annoying for me.Good to hear any similar people and their experiences, positive or negative and their coping strategies.thanks Jaz",
