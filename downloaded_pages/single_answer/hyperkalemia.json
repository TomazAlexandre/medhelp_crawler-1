            "answer": "Hello,There are many 6causes of hyperkalemia.Acidosis, kidney diseases like nephritis,obstrutive uropathies,electrolyte imbalances, diabetes mellitus,rhabdomyolysis are few common causes of hyperkalemia. There are times when potassium can be falsely elevated due to some error .They can be due to specimen collection issues, specimen processing/ handling/transport issues and patient/physiological issues. Any test result must be correlated clinically. This is merely an advice and not a substitute for clinical examination. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause. Hope it helps.Best wishes and regards!",

    "question": "I am a 26 yo female with no known kidney disease. Yesterday when I received my blood work my potassium was elevated at 5.4. When I had blood work the end of december my potassium was 3.6, so according to that it has made a big jump. My creatinine was normal and my eGFR was also normal. Do you think this is possibly just a false high? Im freaking out a little bit. But I do remember that they phlebotomist was really rough and it hurt pretty bad, whereas it normally doesnt.\u00a0\u00a0I read that blood cells could rupture causing potassium to leak into the blood sample giving you a false reading.",
