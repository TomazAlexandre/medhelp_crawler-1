    "question": "I have recently started to bring up phlegm in my mouth it has blood in it. I do not cough it up it just comes into my mouth and happens on a morning about 3 hours everyday, 6 - 7 times. I am type 2 diabetes and am a non smoker, never have smoked. Could an increase from 1 to 3 metformin tablets have anything to do with it? Please help.",
