            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!I am sorry to say, but it will be difficult to diagnose your condition on net.If you have edema of your legs and feet, then too much pressure on your skin due to underlying water can cause peeling of skin.The swelling of feet could be due to water retention as in low protein in blood, kidney problems, heart problems, pressure on the dorsal aorta, severe anemia, deep vein thrombosis, liver diseases etc. It could be due to hypothyroidism too. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You can refer to this link for a complete list of possible causes for ankle, leg and feet swelling: http://en.diagnosispro.com/differential_diagnosis-for/bilateral-leg-edema-swelling/39352-154.htmlAlso this could be due to allergies, dermatitis, or psoriasis. You would need to consult a skin specialist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
