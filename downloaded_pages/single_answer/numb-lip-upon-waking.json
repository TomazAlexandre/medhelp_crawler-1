            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for writing in this forum.Without examination,confirmation of a diagnosis is tough ,but there are various possibilities for such symptoms.Numbness of lips is particularly seen in hypocalcemia,hypoparathyroidism,Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon(do you feel your hands and feet to be cold?),diabetes, due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Remeron which is tetracyclic antidepressant can cause dry mouth but not numbness of lips as its side effect.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 and calcium supplements for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a physician and get the other possibilities ruled out.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.Warm regards.",

    "question": "I took a nap today for two hours and when I woke my bottom lip was numb on the left half. From the corner of the mouth to the center. My tongue felt a little swollen on that side, but not really numb. This is the first time it's happened to me.My psychiatrist put me on Remeron, 15mg, which I started 11/16.",
