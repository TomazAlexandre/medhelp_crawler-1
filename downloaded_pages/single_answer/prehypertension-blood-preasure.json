            "answer": "I'll probably get in trouble for this but just borrowed this information from http://www.umm.edu/patiented/articles/what_high_blood_pressure_000014_1.htm as I don't understand about blood pressure at all.\u00a0\u00a0But I think you're OK as it's only just above the 120 mark and the diastolic is only 49.\u00a0\u00a0If you are worried then have a chat with your gp.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure is always very low about 90/45 or 50 which means I tire easily.\u00a0\u00a0Hope it helps.Blood Pressure RangesBlood Pressure CategoryRanges for Most Adults (systolic/diastolic)Normal Blood Pressure (systolic/diastolic)Systolic below 120 mm HgDiastolic below 80 mm HgPrehypertension (Formerly Normal to High-Normal Blood Pressure)Systolic 120 - 139 mm HgDiastolic 80 - 89 mm Hg(NOTE: 139/89 or below should be the minimum goal for everyone. People with diabetes or chronic kidney disease should strive for 130/80 or less . )Mild Hypertension (Stage 1)Systolic 140 - 159 mm HgDiastolic 90 - 99 mm HgModerate to Severe Hypertension (Stage 2)Systolic over 160 mm Hg orDiastolic over 100 mm HgNote: If one of the measurements is in a higher category than the other, the higher measurement is usually used to determine the stage. For example, if systolic pressure is 165 (Stage 2) and diastolic is 92 (Stage 1), the patient would still be diagnosed with Stage 2 hypertension. It should be strongly noted that a high systolic pressure compared to a normal or low diastolic pressure should be a major focus of concern in most adults.",
