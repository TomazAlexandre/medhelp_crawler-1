            "answer": "HiDiabetes increases the risk for skin infections especially fungal or yeast infections. I do understand that this may be very discomforting. What is important to determine here is your glucose or blood sugar control. It is necessary that you should have this assessed further. I would suggest that your Hemoglobin A1C be determined as well as an FBS be obtained. This will help us ascertain if your sugar control is adequate.Wash the area with a mild cleanser such as Cetaphil. Wash especially after passing stools. Apply KY jelly or a lubricant prior to passing stools to avoid direct contact of stools with the affected area. Have this assessed by your medical internist. You may need to have your current medications changed.",
