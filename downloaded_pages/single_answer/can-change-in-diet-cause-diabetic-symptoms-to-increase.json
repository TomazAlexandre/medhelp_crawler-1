    "question": "First let me say, my dad's side of the family has a history of diabetes. Because I'm not close to them and wasn't raised around them, I don't know of symptoms or things to look for.About a month ago I mentioned to someone about my toes going numb (not to sleep, no tingling, just numb), after realizing it wasn't something that other people experienced, i looked up what could cause this. I saw this could be a symptom of diabetes. Looking over the symptoms there are a few things on there that I have experienced, such as, Dry skin, skin irritation (guttate psoriasis), Boils, numbness in toes, I have reoccuring yeast infections (not in the vaginal area), poor skin healing, and drowsiness.Of course I've always come up with reasons for these symptoms, but never thought all symptoms could be from one thing.I've been trying to loose weight lately, and I'm wondering, can that cause symptoms to present themselves? Is it possible that I have had diabetes and didn't know. I've never been tested for it. But, it seems since I've started dieting, I've had more severe symptoms.Any help would be greatly appreciated!!",
