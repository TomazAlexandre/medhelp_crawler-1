            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Yes, there appears to be a swelling under the incision, probably due to collection of fluid/blood/pus. This would need drainage if the doctor who can examine you feels the same. If it is just fluid then pressure bandage may help. Sometimes, infection persists after an operation. Do you have diabetes? This can also cause persisting infection. Please ask your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
