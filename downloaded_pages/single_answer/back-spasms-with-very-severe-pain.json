            "answer": "Hi!If you have back pain with spasms then you need to get investigated for deficiency of potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D.\u00a0\u00a0Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms.Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes, Lyme's, lupus or hypothyroidism can also be the cause. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been taking Baclofen 10 MG twice daily and 5 MGS Prednisone. It seemed that the problem was about solved as long I took the meds but it has returned\u00a0\u00a0and is worse. It does not help that I have asthma too. I am 67 yrs old., fine otherwise and still working. Am I taking enough Baclofen and should I return to my doctor? I get the spasms very badly and hope there is nothing worse going on. Thankyou.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mari",
