            "answer": "Hello,I cannot confirm a diagnosis without examination,but it can be calluses, foot blisters or fibromas. Place protective covering or bandages over the sore to decrease friction on the skin until the sore heals. Rub sandpaper disks or pumice stone over hard thickened regions. Soak feet or hands in warm soapy water to soften calluses.Then rub with a pumice stone and apply some moisturizer. Wear shoes that fit properly and keep feet as dry as possible.Wearing wet shoes, boots and socks willaggravate the problem.So change socks regularly and use foot powder to help keep your feet dry.If still the lumps persist,then pls go in for removal by surgical means or with keratolytic agents (medicines that break up hardened areas of skin).Burning sensation in the other leg can be due to alcohol intake metabolic disorders like diabetes,hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the burning sensation is gone or not.If the symptoms persist then pls consult a physician.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
