            "answer": "Hi.You must have meant a ureteral stricture or narrowing of the ureters. Was the cause of the stricture ascertained? External structures such as nearby tissues and organs may cause narrowing of the ureters. In some patients, a mass , an infection or something that has been present at birth as in the case of structural anomalies may cause the narrowing.Were there any repeated bouts of urinary tract infections before?Any history of abdominal or pelvic surgeries?I suggest that you discuss with your grandmother's physician if a ureteral stent is indicated at this point.Does your grandmother have any associated disease conditions like diabetes or hypertension?Any history of urinary tract stones in the family?",
