    "question": "Please help!! I was diagnosed with ITP 8 years ago. My symptoms are getting worse that I\"m experiencing and i dont think they have anything to do with my ITP. My Doctors are NOT helpful. They say I also suffer from depression and chronic anxiety. Even though I'm telling them that these symptoms only start 2-3 weeks before my period.I am normally a happy person, but I've been keeping a journal lately and I've noticed that before my period..my platelets seem to get quite low..5-10. I am tired of infusions..as this doesn\"t eleviate these symptoms. Thy are..a bad burning feeling under my skin{face]To touch my skin isn\"t hot..just under the skin. Then the headaches start..intense and then my neck stiffens up. I am noticing in the last 2 -3 years that I'm developing heartburn . My spleen has been removed. Prednisone did not work. I just can't live like this anymore. The burning under my skin\u00a0\u00a0and ears is what i\"m scared about..sonjaI",
