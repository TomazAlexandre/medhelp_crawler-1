    "question": "Ever since I can remember I have been in psychological and physical trouble. I believe some of the physiological symptoms I was tortured by may have their basis\u00a0\u00a0partially,\u00a0\u00a0in the hormonal balance of my body. Symptoms; Extreme physical discomfort of three main characteristics: An empty rotten core,\u00a0\u00a0Extreme external tactile sensitivity, Violent, chaotic impulses ricochetting in my body. 99% of my energy was taken up dealing with this physiological discomfort\u00a0\u00a0and its attendant psychological destruction.\u00a0\u00a0Even as my core was non-existent, or worse, I sometimes felt myself disappearing beneath clouds of sensations. My sexual impulses have been part of the chaotic and toxic soup. It was like those sensations and stimulations were put into a food processor, coarsely chopped and dumped into my body.\u00a0\u00a0There they attached haphazardly to other impulses and stimulations,\u00a0\u00a0creating a confusing , reverberating mess, over which I had little control. For the most part my sexual feelings were constant, negative, and mixed with self destructive violence. They were not comforting in any way Quite sometime after my nervous breakdown (which lasted many years), I got some help. Eventually after trying several drugs I got stabilized on Xyprexa and Zoloft.I am trying to transition off of Xyprexa because I developed diabetes. The transition has been somewhat rocky and confusing. I have dipped down into the toxic emptiness that was a constant irritant of my pre-nervous breakdown life. Thus the symptoms have been refreshed for me. I thought again about what underlying causes might be.\u00a0\u00a0For the most part, my body has had no self comforting aspect to it. Where most people have strong warm solid feelings of pleasure, I have had feelings of poison, void and corruption. There was a constant clashing - as if matter and anti-matter were coming into contact, and the anti-matter was more pervasive. I am interested in finding out if a hormonal imbalance may have been a factor in my discomfort throughout. This would make a lot of sense to me. I have constantly been plagued with male and female energy (and persectives), fighting, fighting, fighting inside me. The female energy left me toxic, confused, vacillating and deeply disturbed. The male energy was stimulating, provoking and forceful, but devoid of character, maturity and sustainability. I had my hormone levels checked using a saliva test.\u00a0\u00a0It showed that my Estradiol was very high (4.2 compared to a normal range of 0.5-1.5), my Progesterone was somewhat low (21 compared to a normal range of 25-100), my Testosterone was in the normal range (98 out of a normal range of 50-200). I am wondering if some type of hormone therapy might be part of the mix in attempting to redress the incompleteness of my chemical makeup.\u00a0\u00a0Might this improve my sense of self- give some developement\u00a0\u00a0to the aspects of life they influence. Any advice you can give me, and how to seek out such treatment, would be helpful - Mike",
