    "question": "My son is 3 year old and 6 months. Born at a healthy weight of 7 lbs 13 oz and a height of 21 1/2 '. Head circ. of 13 1/2. He seemed healthy and we went home 3 days later. At 6 weeks he developed a cold which turned out to be RSV. At 8 weeks he developed a capillary malformation on his lower half of his right leg into his foot. From then on we have had complications after complications colds, sinus infections, ear infections bronchitis and pneumonia. He had his 1st set of tubes in and adenoids out at 6 months of age. He did not crawl till 9 months and he walked ok at 16 months. At one point he had chronic drinking and excessive peeing so they tested him for diabetes and his blood work and urine showed he had diabetes insipidus. Put of DDAVP he did not respond and the higher the dose the sicker he got as his sodium dropped. After the second hospitalization for this I decided that I wanted him to see an endocrine out of town. There they did two water deprivation tests a week apart and determined that he had idiopathic DI and to take the medication for it was killing him. At 16 months he had another round about of RSV which of course brought on more pneumonia and bronchitis and severe sinus infections. He had two sets of cat scans that determined his sinuses to be very blocked and swollen with mucinal thickness. He was tested for CF by his immunologist/ pulmonary specialist but it was negative. He was determined to have childhood asthma. In all of this he was having pain in his boy parts and ultrasound showed he had microlethiasis. After seeing an urologist we have to go for yearly ultrasounds. He also developed a rash that is constantly on face, upper arms upper legs and buttocks. We see a derm for this but nothing can be done for the rash or the capillary malformation. He is knocked kneed and bow legged and walks with one hip higher then the other. It was determined that his right hip is higher then his left hip and that his pelvis is tilted in causing stress on his knees to where it is noticeable. He also has developed excessive drooling and the inability to ball his food up correctly while chewing causing him to choke while swallowing. He sees a feeding therapist and a speech therapist for this matter. He also was diagnosed with gross fine motor skills delay and during the evaluation was determined that he has sensory processing disorder. He sees an occupational therapist for that as well. So since he was born he has had RSV 2 x, Bronchitis about 7 times, pneumonia 5 x, 11 sinus infections He has had surgery 4 sets of tubes, adenoids out, tonsils out, laser surgery on his leg 2 x tongue surgery from falling while running and he clamped his tip of his tongue in between his teeth. 4 hospitalizations for RSV, sodium dropping 2 x and pneumonia. He sees a dermatologist, orthopedic, a pulminologist, and endocrinologist, an urologist, ENT, immunologist and 4 therapists. I understand things could be worse but the poor kid cannot catch a break. He needs an answer so we can help him without doing all this his entire life.Just this past week all his therapist have gotten together and want him to see a pediatric neurologist or a pediatric developmental doctor",
