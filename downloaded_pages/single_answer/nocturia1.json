            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. Nocturia can happen due to diabetes, urinary incontinence, BPH, sleep apnea, renal failure etc. But as the frequency is not increased during day time and also as your father has been off catheter only since two weeks,I don\u2019t think it is serious. You can wait for some more time for this to settle down and if it does not then consult a urologist and discuss the above mentioned possibilities.Best.",
