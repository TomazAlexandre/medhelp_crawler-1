            "answer": "I agree. You have several different symptoms, it appears to be getting worse, and it can not all be explained away as part of diabetes. At the very least call your doctor right away, and my instinct says as well that the ER is the place for you to go. We don't want anything to happen to you.",

I do not know alot about the desease but for the past week I have been having som issues and I just wanted to know if its due to the diebetes. I started with a my ear hurting think I might be getting an ear infection but it kinda felt further back, Then it turned into a head ache on my whole left side of my head and then it felt as if it was going down my neck. I keep taking moltrine 800 that I have and now this morning I woke up and my left arm is all numb all the way down to my fingers. plus my vission is off. when I look at the screen and stuff its a lil blurry and I have always had perfect vission. If anyone knows wat is going on here please tell me. I am a mother of 2 and my husband is away for a deployment and its not easy to just go to the hopital. Im getting worried that something bad is going to happen and my kids are to young to help they are 2 and 1.",
