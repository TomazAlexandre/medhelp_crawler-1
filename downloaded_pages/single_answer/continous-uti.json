            "answer": "Hello,Recurrent urine infections could be due to various reasons. Most common cause is stones in kidney which is blocking urine pathway.\u00a0\u00a0This can cause blood in urine as well as proteins in urine. Other causes are incomplete treatment or antibiotics which are not sensitive to the infection being used, changing sexual partners frequently, pregnancy, diabetes and of course childhood infections. The urine can also be due to retention of urine anywhere in its flow due t obstruction.You may need a series of investigations like urine examination, urine culture, ultrasound, kindey function tests or cystoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. Please consult a urologist and get it done.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hello, I have had three uti's in the past two months. The first two times there was blood in my urine but no protein. I was on antibiotics each time and I just found out I had another one. This time they found protein in my urine so they are sending me for an ultrasound of my kidneys. The symptoms I've had are noticable blood, pain, and not being able to go to the bathroom as much as needed. Can anyone tell me if this could be associated with my hysterectomy I had 5 months ago? I am a 22 year old female with one child. I have never had a uti before my surgery.. Also what is the difference between protein being in you urine? I'm so confused about whats going on. *plus i have been EXTREMELY tired and its getting exhausting*",
