            "answer": "Hi,It will help us to know where exactly do you have these headaches and what their nature is. The possibility of migraine cannot be ruled out because migraines can occur with or without aura symptoms. It is also important to rule out poor eyesight and eye strain.Since your neurological tests have been normal the chances of brain lesions are very less.Since you are a diabetic make sure you eat on time to avoid rapid fall in sugar levels after medications. I would suggest you to find a good headache specialist in your area.Let us know if you have any more questions.",
