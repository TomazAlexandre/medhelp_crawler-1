    "question": "HiMy mom had cataract surgery in July. The first eye went well and seemed to be healing well. During the 2nd surgery 3 weeks later, my mom had a terrible time. Her blood pressure went high, and they had to give her oxygen as her sugar levels also raced up. She said the 2nd eye like the 1st eye surgery, hurt. Now, 1 month and almost 2 weeks, she is having swelling below the eyes. Is this normal? How long did it take someone you know to heal.She is 83 years old with High BP, diabetes and heart disease",
