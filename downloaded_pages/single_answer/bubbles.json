            "answer": "Hi!Blisters under the skin can be due to lupus, diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition. Since the lesions do not itch possibility of contact dermatitis is more or less ruled out. It is difficult to diagnose such lesions on net. You will need clinical examination followed by some tests. Do discuss this with your skin doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
