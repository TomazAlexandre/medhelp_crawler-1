    "question": "Hi I'm really at a loss as to where to turn I've been suffering from severe migraines for the past 3 years that come and go and with the migraines I have a habit of passing out.....I often feel very lethargic and I see floaters in my vision, blurred vision, double vision.\u00a0\u00a0I used to have an amazing memory never studied in school always A student and could do anything with numbers.\u00a0\u00a0Now I have a hard time remembering to do small tasks, I forget numbers, I forget things I did just a day or so earlier and I find my personality has been affected as well....I used to be able to pass off just about anything but now the slightest thing seems to affect me whether it makes me angry or upset it just affects me differently.\u00a0\u00a0Also, my balance is really bad it seems I don't have any balance at all.I had a CT scan done 2 years ago and wasn't told the results except that they thought I may have too much fluid built up on my spine and it was applyin pressure to my brain....They wanted to do a lumbar puncture to test the amount of fluid but I'm fairly large and the neurologist said he didn't have a needle long enough to penetrate my spine.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor threw it off as that and gave me a prescription which started with an s which is for depression but he said in very low doses taken on a continual basis it can be used as a painkiller and will help with the build up of fluid.I just had another CT scan done last week and received the results today stating that there's a 7mm lesion on my brain which they have no idea of what it could be and that it's very unusal for someone my age 26 to have.\u00a0\u00a0I'm bein sent to have an MRI completed to determine whether or not a biopsy is needed of the growth.This was stated to my from my GP and honestly I'm really confused and shocked.\u00a0\u00a0I have no idea what this could potentially mean or where it could lead.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that both my grandparents have had colon cancer, my mother, aunt and grandmother have had endometrial cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Both my grandfathers as well as my father have heart disease and have all had bipasses completed.\u00a0\u00a02 of my grandparents on my fathers side have suffered strokes my grandmother several and she also suffers from severe type 2 diabetes.Please if you can give me any sort of information at all outside of the simple line that was provided by my doctor would be great.ThanksJenna",
