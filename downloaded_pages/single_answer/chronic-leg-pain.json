            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your daughter. I understand she has been through a lot of tests, but I am just enumerating the various causes that should be looked into as I have not examined her. The various causes of leg pain are atherosclerosis, deep vein thrombosis - leg pain on walking (A blood clot in a deep vein), Leriche syndrome (block in abdominal aorta and/or main leg artery), limb ischaemia (low oxygen to limbs), sciatica, spondylitis of lower vertebrae and peripheral vascular disease (arteries of limbs are involved). A color Doppler test will rule out the possibility of involvement of an artery or vein and its blockage by a clot. Paresthesias or abnormal sensations due to peripheral neuropathies secondary to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme's or lupus should also be ruled out.Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "I read the post of the 32 year old with chronic leg pain and periodic arm pain and it seemed she is describing my daughter's complaints precisely. I'm worried and don't know how to help. Her complaint is the same - seemingly endless soreness like that you described in the legs, made worse by activity. She also suffers from the arm pain now and again. My daughter too has had blood tests that show no problems. She takes the best whole food vitamins, has a healthy diet, and gets lots of exercise. As of late she's just fed up with the pain. She said she can't remember a time when it wasn't a problem and she's now convinced she'll have it for the rest of her life. I wish I could help somehow. Any information or ideas would sure be appreciated.This discussion is related to/posts/Chronic-Pain/Pain-Ache-in-Legs--Arms/show/1339497.",
