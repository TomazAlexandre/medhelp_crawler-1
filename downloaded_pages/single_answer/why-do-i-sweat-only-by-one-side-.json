            "answer": "Hi,How are you? What other symptoms are present? A normal sweat pattern is symmetrical and if one side of the body sweats more, there could indeed be a neurological problem. If this persists, you may need to have this evaluated by a neurologist who specializes in the neurophysiology of hyperhidrosis. Essential hyperhidrosis is characterized by excessive sweating that is more than the required to mantain thermal regulation. It can also be due to secondary causes such as conditions such as pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, hypopituitarism, anxiety, menopause, carcinoid syndrome, and drug withdrawal.It is best that you have this evaluated for proper diagnosis. Take care and do keep us posted.",
