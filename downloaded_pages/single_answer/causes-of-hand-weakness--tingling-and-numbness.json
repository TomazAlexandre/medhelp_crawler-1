            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Weakness in the hand with tingling numbness can be due to peripheral neuropathy or due to nerve compression.Peripheral neuropathy can be due to diabetes or Vitamin B12 deficiency. You can take OTC B12 supplements and see if it helps you.Nerve compression can occur at the level of the wrist joint which is known as carpal tunnel syndrome.It can also occur at the level of the elbow joint when it is known as cubital tunnel syndrome.Physical exercises of the hand and arm along with B12 supplements will help in the weakness.",
