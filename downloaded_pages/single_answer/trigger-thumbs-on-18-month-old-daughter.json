            "answer": "Hello jadebuttercup,The following information on the trigger thumb would be vital for the critical insights for the management of trigger thumb in your 18 month daughter.Triggering of the thumb occurs when focal degenerative changes within the flexor pollicis longus tendon lead to a localized swelling that limits tendon excursion within the tendon sheath.Trigger thumb usually occurs idiopathically. It develops more frequently in individuals with diabetes and in patients with osteoarthritis. Trigger thumb is more likely to occur in an individual with any condition that causes proliferation of the tenosynovium, such as inflammatory arthritis, gout, or chronic infection (eg, fungus or atypical mycobacteria). The roles of overuse and trauma in trigger thumb are controversial, although the condition does have a predilection for the dominant hand.Conservative treatment of trigger thumb is aimed toward the irritation surrounding the tendon through immobilization and anti-inflammatory medication. This includes oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroid injection, and judicious use of a hand-based splint that prevents motion of the MP and IP joints of the thumb (each maintained in 15\u00b0 of flexion). The splint most commonly is worn at night and prevents the excessive flexing and locking that occurs during sleep. Patients with severe symptoms may need to wear the splint for daytime activities as well. The splint should not be worn for more than 10-14 days on a constant basis; after that period, wean the patient from the splint to avoid permanent stiffness.Patients with a history of triggering for more than 4-6 months or who present with locking are less likely to respond to medical treatment. Most patients who improve with corticosteroid injection do so after the first injection; some may require a second or even third injection after an appropriate interval.Refer: http://www.emedicine.com/orthoped/topic571.htmBest",

    "question": "I recently noticed that my daughter (18 months old) holds both of her thumbs with the last joint bent toward her palm.\u00a0\u00a0I can push on them and she seems uncomfortable and with one of them will usually cry.\u00a0\u00a0I can usually straighten one of them, but the other is harder and often I can't straighten it at all.\u00a0\u00a0When I do try to straighten them and feel resistance you can tell that she is not the one resisting.\u00a0\u00a0I was just looking online and found information on childhood trigger thumbs.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if this sounds like what I am seeing in my daughter.\u00a0\u00a0If it is, will it correct itself?\u00a0\u00a0Is there something I can do at home to work with her on to help correct it.\u00a0\u00a0I found several places that discussed surgery for it...is this always necessary?\u00a0\u00a0Any information you can give me on this would be so helpful.She doesn't appear to be in pain or limited in her activities that I have noticed.Thanks!",
