            "answer": "If you had a gastric problem before 3 years and you still feel its more problematic now ,you need to observe for many more symptoms.But if you had a cough and no other problems,then you need not worry about anything.Your cholesterol levels seem to be a bit high than normal ranges.Daily food intake is suggested with more vegetables with fiber,proteins,half boiled foods may help you to control cholesterol(Chinese),foods cooked with more oil,roasts and fries are not to be taken,more fruits,adequate fluids(juices or water),stop taking more fatty foods like ghee and sweets as they have risk of Diabetes,no coffee or strong tea,no drinking or smoking.Keeping good nature calls improves your health status.Daily walk upto 2kms,brisk,jogging if you are not so obese may be considered.Pranayam and Yoga may help you with your cough problem.More exercise and walk helps you to control Blood LDL.You can prefer Allopathy only when you have more other symptoms but not only one complaint.Regular Doctor check ups and tests can help you to evaluate your future problems.If you dont understand this message me and I will reply you back in Hindi with more details.",
