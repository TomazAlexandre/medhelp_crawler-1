    "question": "I seem to have contracted a yeast infection and moccasin type athletes foot at the same time... I live a relatively average life generally free of health problems... I had a yeast infection once years before, and I've never had athletes foot before. I was wondering if it could be an indication of something else; possibly something more severe? Or if they're related? Or if anyone has experienced anything similar?Any input would be appreciated.",
