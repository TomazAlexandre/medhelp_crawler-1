            "answer": "Dehydration can be a cause of strong smelling urine and it may take a little while for the strong smell to go away if you have only just begun to drink more water. There are a number of possible causes, but it's hard to guess. It can also be a sign of a UTI, a side effect of diabetes, or something else. My guess would be that it's more from dehydration and it'll go away when you are more consistent with drinking lots of water. Though if the strong smell continues for another few weeks, I'd make a doctor's appointment to get checked.",
