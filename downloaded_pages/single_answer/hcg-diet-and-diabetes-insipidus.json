            "answer": "You really need a doctor's supervision if you are to do the hcg diet. It does affect sleep because it affects the hypothalmus which controls sleep, hunger, thirst, temperature and fat storage/metabolism. The thing is, it makes you very thirsty and you have to drink tons of water which helps to flush out the fat you are metabolizing. So with your history, I don't know how it would affect you. And I don't know if you could get a doctor to help you with this. Most md's won't do the hcg because they don't believe it works. However, you mentioned the homeopathic version. Do you have a naturopath?Also, have you tried CES for your insomnia? It is cranial electrical stimulation. It is pretty safe and I haven't heard any contraindications for using it. It is a very low voltage,\u00a0\u00a0you can hardly feel it. It is supposed to change your brain waves which helps insomnia, among other things.",
