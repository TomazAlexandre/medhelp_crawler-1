Don't assume we know, or can read your mind, or know what country you reside in. Please do NOT make things up. The quality of your post equals the quality of the response. Try to be concise.\"normal fasting and random glucose but high insulin around 110 (1st time) and 127 (in repeat).\"Did you fast prior to the test? Later you say you did for the 4th test. Is the above your 1st? Did you stop taking any medication prior to the test?Normal insulin values are are 5-20 mcU/mL while fasting. (Note: mcU/mL = micro unit per milliliter). Elevated insulin can be seen with:Insulinoma - pancreas tumorType 2 diabetesAnd, high insulin, even with normal blood sugar, may indicate that the pancreas is working harder than normal to lower the blood-sugar level. This situation is usually caused by the body being resistant to insulin's effect -- a condition called \"insulin resistance syndrome.\" It is very common with polycystic ovary disease, PCOS. Go see a doctor specializing in Gynecologic Oncology to rule out PCOS.You follow with \"my fasting glucose levels are 70 and 80 and glucose random is 92.\" If these were in mg/dl then you would be considered normal.Scroll down and read the thread in post - [What are the non-Diabetic levels (mmol/L) of Glucose by Frank303, Nov 08, 2008] for mmol/l and mg/dl glucose table.",
