            "answer": "Hello,Loss of libido in men can be due to psychological conditions like performance anxiety, medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal and neurologic causes. Normal levels of testosterone fall between 250 and 800 nanograms of testosterone per deciliter of blood. So your testosterone levels fall in the normal range. Lab investigations like complete blood examination, urine examination, ultrasound lower abdomen and sometimes a urethral swab will help in diagnosis. Treatment will be started thereafter. My advise would be to consult a urologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
