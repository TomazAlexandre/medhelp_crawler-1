            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The simplest cause could be either or combination of anemia, dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, overwork and fatigue.The other possibilities of chronic fever with body ache can be conditions such as tuberculosis, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and other auto immune disorders, UTI, drug fever, glandular fever, otitis media, IBS, HIV, STDs, endocarditis, parasitic infestations, fungal infections, lymphomas and other cancers.Most labs have a fever panel to rule out most diseases that can cause persistent low grade fever.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
