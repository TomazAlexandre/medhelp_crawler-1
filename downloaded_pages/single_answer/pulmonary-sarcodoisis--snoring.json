            "answer": "As far as I know, there's no link between sarcoidosis and sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is so common that it can occur in anyone, no matter what other medical conditions you may have. This is something that you can develop even if you don't have sarcoidosis. If you snore that loudly, you need to get a sleep study to make sure you don't have obstructive sleep apnea. Untreated sleep apnea can cause hypertension, weight gain, depression, anxiety, diabetes, heart disease, heart attack and stroke.Also, since the standard form of treatment is steroids (like in MS), and since weight gain is a frequent side effect of oral steroids, then this can unmask any underlying snoring and sleep apnea. Hope this helps.",
