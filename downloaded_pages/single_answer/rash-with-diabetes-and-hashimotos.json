Recently went to the doctor for stiff joints and just not feeling like myself ( physically and mentally ). Was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes and Hashimotos disease.I have started insulin but no treatment for the Hashimots till I finish getting my cardiac clearance.

This rash has been going on for about 15\u00a0\u00a0weeks. I have been to 3 different dermatologists and no relief. I have been treated with everything from predisone to dapsone ( for 2.5 weeks with no relief ).
