    "question": "I've been referred to a urologist due to high levels of blood being present in my urine. There were two tests done 2 1/2 weeks apart inbetween periods. It's not blood that can be seen by the eye. I've never had this issue before and am curious what this could be and what a urologist will do to me *skerred*. I have had maybe four UTIs in the last 6 years so that doesn't seem unusual. I had an injury (kick) to the bladder/ovary area a month ago which caused a lot of pain to the baseball sized ovarian cyst I later found out I've got. I have a small cyst on my left kidney. And several more ovarian cysts that are tiny compared to the big one. They did a CT scan and ultrasound (including intrauterine ultrasound) and that's all they found. Also tested for STDs though that wouldn't be an issue for me (hahaha... sad). Those turned out negative. I'm 34. Just wondering what this could be?? I thought earlier in the year I had diabetes b/c I noticed I retain water in the day and am up a lot at night going to the bathroom. I still am but because of sleep meds it's not as bad as before. But I had a test done and the dr ruled out diabetes. Anyway just curious, I can't seem to figure out what it could be that they couldn't detect on the CT scan or ultrasound.",
