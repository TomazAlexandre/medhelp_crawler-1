            "answer": "Hi,As mentioned from the other post, urgency to urinate may be caused by prostate or diabetes problems, medication side effect, tumor and other brain or nervous system diseases. If there is penile wasting also, further evaluation and additional diagnostic tests are\u00a0\u00a0important to determine the underlying cause. Take care and do keep us posted with your urologist follow-up. Best regards.",

    "question": "Hi,For the last two weeks I have been suffering with a constant urge to urinate.\u00a0\u00a0The urge manifests itself at the tip of my penis and is sometimes more acute than others.\u00a0\u00a0I believe this may be connected to other symptom that affected me earlier in life.When I was in my early twenties I was one day lifting some heavy weights when I felt a sudden pain in my groin area at the base of my penis.\u00a0\u00a0The pain went away after three or four days but a couple of week later I noticed some penal atrophy and wasting.\u00a0\u00a0This continued for around a year or so but eventually it seemed to settled down.\u00a0\u00a0I however was left with a distinct curve in my penis and some reduction in circumference.\u00a0\u00a0On Urologist did diagnose me with Peyronie's disease however I do not have any hard places of skin so I am not so sure about this diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I did not have any long term problems and could function normally so I forgot about the problem.Unfortunately around 6 months ago I started to have pains in the groin area again.\u00a0\u00a0Also a numbness in my right testicle and right leg.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 37.\u00a0\u00a0This pain came and went so I did not immediately go see the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0However I have now noticed that there seems to have been an increased wasting of the penis.\u00a0\u00a0It feels very light when not erect and also often very cold as if there is not a properly blood circulation.\u00a0\u00a0Also as stated above I have started to get this very unpleasant urge to urinate which really doesn\u2019t stop.I am going to see a urologist on Monday and I have had a full STD check and have been checked for any urinary infection all came back as negative.\u00a0\u00a0I just wondered what your thoughts were.Many thanks.",
