Cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, small vessel disease, and diabetes raise one's risk for strokeBlood thinning medicines (known as anticoagulants) can help if the blockage is less severe or if blood clots have formed that might break off and float to the brain. Anticoagulants are also used to prevent stroke in persons with an irregular heartbeat, recent heart attack, heart valve abnormality, or a heart valve replacement.The most commonly used medications are aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), combination aspirin/extended release dipyridamole (Aggrenox), ticlopidine (Ticlid), and warfarin (Coumadin).These can be taken if your physician suggests.Refer http://www.americangeriatrics.org/education/forum/stroke.shtmlBest",
