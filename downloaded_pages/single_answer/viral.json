            "answer": "Hello,Without examination,confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but various possibilities for your symptoms are there.First and foremost is the possibility of gastroenteritis. Gastroenteritis is an irritation and infection of the digestive tract. It can often cause sudden and sometimes violent upsets and may be confused with spastic colitis. Gastroenteritis can be produced fromviral,bacterial and parasitic infections, contaminated food or water, food poisoning, use of harsh laxatives, change in bacteria that normally live in the intestinal tract, chemical toxins in certain plants, seafood, or contaminated food, and heavy metal poisoning.Take adequate fluids throughout the day. The BRAT diet (ie, bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) or soft easily digestible semisolid diet can also be taken. Antimicrobial therapy is indicated for some bacterial gastroenteritis infections. However, many are self-limited and do not require therapy.The specific antibiotics are taken for specific bacteria after stool culture.If the symptoms still persist then other possibilities need evaluation.The various other possibilities are GERD(gastro esophageal reflux disease), acute non-GI infections (pyelonephritis, pneumonia), liver diseases, pancreatic disorder,peptic disease of upper GI tract,gastric carcinoma,CNS diseases like infections, tumors, multiple sclerosis and metabolic disturbances like diabetes and adrenal insufficiency.Confirmed diagnosis can only be made after examinaition and investigations.Pls consult a physician for that.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",
