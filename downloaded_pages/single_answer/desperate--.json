            "answer": "Hello and welcome!You need to give your body time to adjust. Building muscle mass can lead to weight gain. Once you have reached a plateau level weight loss seems to be difficult. Take up lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, oats and other whole grain products and lean meat and take carbohydrates in moderation and limit fat and sugar. Week by week slowly increase the exercise which should include both aerobics and strength training.Eating too often or eating portions that are too large will also cause weight gain. Drink plenty of water and continue with your exercises. Avoid the intake of alcohol and smoking. Balanced eating is the only sustainable way to achieve long-term healthy weight loss. If the problem persists rule out conditions like anaemia, hypothyroidism and diabetes which can prevent weight loss. I hope you find this useful. Do write to us again with more queries.Take care!",
