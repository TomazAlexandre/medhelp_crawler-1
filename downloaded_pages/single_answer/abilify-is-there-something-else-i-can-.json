            "answer": "The only FDA approved antipsychotic that doesn't cause tardive dyskinesia is Clozaril and that has a set of severe side effects of its own. It should be noted however that I have been noted as having made a full recovery from schizoaffective disorder with an antipsychotic agent in Phase II FDA study, glycine. I am the first person to take it by itself as a primary antipsychotic. However, in the official study its given as an adjunct (along with a conventional antipsychotic) antipsychotic. For more information google \"Dr. Javitt, glycine\". Some psychopharmocologists have put it into use when a person can't respond to known antipsychotics or can't tolerate their side effects. Its part of a class of antipsychotics, the glutamate antagonists that won't cause tardive dyskinesia or diabetes and promote a fuller recovery.",
