    "question": "I was diagnosed with both Hashimoto's and Grave's Disease.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that my TSH is \"a little better\" (I dont know the numbers).\u00a0\u00a0The endo said that he wanted to repeat the TSH, T4 in 4 months.\u00a0\u00a0He told me that \"the thyroid is battling it out and we will need to see which side wins.\"\u00a0\u00a0I am positive for TSI, TPO, TG.\u00a0\u00a0My TSH was originally 0.02.\u00a0\u00a0T3 and T4 upper end normal values.\u00a0\u00a0My heart rate has not been bellow 100 in a month.\u00a0\u00a0My BP is up 130/90 (higher than it was even when i was pregnant).\u00a0\u00a0I am irritable and tiered all the time.\u00a0\u00a0My eyes now itch in my eyelids and are dry (he said \"Maybe it is allergies or conjuctivitus\").\u00a0\u00a0My hands are dry for the first time in my life.\u00a0\u00a0I have gained about 15 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0My u/s showed a 1.0 cm solid lesion that is somewhat ill-defined.\u00a0\u00a0Mild thyromegaly measuring 4.8 on both sides and is heterogeneous.\u00a0\u00a0He recommended me to go to the hospital and have the radiologist do a ultra-sound guided FNA biopsey ($1300 out of pocket due to deductable) for a 3-5% chance of cancer.\u00a0\u00a0I was surprised he did not do the FNA himself. He has said at both appointments that he can feel a small nodule.\u00a0\u00a0He offered me a beta-blocker but I have asthma and had gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid of the bronchospasms and the increased risk of type 2 DM.\u00a0\u00a0When I asked him if the beta blocker would help with the irritability and fatigue he said no.\u00a0\u00a0I am on no medications at this time.\u00a0\u00a0Should I seek a second opinion?\u00a0\u00a0There are no other endo's in my town and I would need to take time off of work and travel about 2 hours.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to know if there is relief or if yall think they would have the same opinion of \"lets wait and see what happens.\"\u00a0\u00a0I live in Central FL.",
