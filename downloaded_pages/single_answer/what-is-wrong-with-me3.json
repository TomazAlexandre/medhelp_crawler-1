    "question": "Dear doctor,I am a gril of 25 years old and it is more than 2 years i am having a persistent problem. First it began like a frequent urge to urinate but never had burnings or any other problem.Have been tested by the doctors, the urine test and urinoculture have both always been normal, have had ultra sound of the tummy for ovaries and everything was normal. Now after two years i began having the problem of burning.It burns in the moment when i urinate and the burning sensation continues for half an hour or one hour. I went to the doctor again . The urine test is normal, the blood test for diabetes was normal, the blood level is high but still inside the normal range and as 3 months ago i had sex for the first time and it was unprotected the doctor tested me for chlamydia through taking a swab from urethra adn one from vagina just to be in the safe part. The results were normal so i had nothing. During the time of waiting the results of the chlamydia test the doctor game me doxycicline because he was afraid in case i had maybe chlamydia. so i had for a week one tablet per day. Then as the urine test blood test for diabete and test for chlamydia were normal the docotr game me nothing because clinically i am healthy.( continue on the next message because there is not space here :)",
