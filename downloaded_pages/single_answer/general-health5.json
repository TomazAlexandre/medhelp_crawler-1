            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This could be due to generalized weakness or low blood pressure. It could be the side effect of drugs you tool. Lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue could be the cause. Peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. should be ruled out.Get your blood pressure and blood sugar monitored. Eat healthy, take rest and drink plenty of fluids. In all probability all this should help. Otherwise the above mentioned causes will need to be ruled out.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
