            "answer": "I was suspected to have GD with my daughter because she was HUGE and presented all the signs of a GD baby.I failed my 1hr gluecose test, and passed by ONE POINT at my 3 hour.I went from 234 to 189 by my 3rd month. And then went from 189 to 242 by the time I was 8 days over due.And most of that weight was swelling because when I went to my WIC appt a month after I had my daughter I was 202. Ain't no way someone loses 40 lbs on bed rest!! lmaoI was tested too early and once I moved back to where I'm at now, I was too far along and no doctor would see me, so I hadda just go to the hospital if something happened.I'll never know if I did or not, but my obgyn I'm seeing with this pregnancy said I probably did and I get my sugar levels tested every month now to make sure it doesn't slip by.I'm 30 weeks 3 days now.My gluecose levels are GREAT.I've only gained 14lbs so far with this pregnancy and probably won't gain too much more if I keep doing good like I am.GD babies are actually known to go OVERDUE instead of come prematurely.So your baby being born premature was probably due to another cause.But you DO risk developing gestational diabetes with each pregnancy you have.But just cuz you had it last time, doesn't mean you will this time.You also risk developing perminent diabetes when you get older.I wouldn't worry about it too much though.When you do get pregnant, just watch your diet and you should be alright.",
