            "answer": "Hi there. this could be nerve entrapment pain at any level, right from the cervical spine due to disc degeneration or prolapsed, compression at the shoulder level, at the elbow level or the wrist, wherever the median or radial nerve can be compressed between the bone or the tissue planes. You will need to be checked with a cervical spine MRI, shoulder joint x-ray, nerve conduction velocity study. Rule out systemic causes like hypothyroidism, vitamin B deficiencies, diabetes\u00a0\u00a0and rheumatoid arthritis, etc. Take care.",
