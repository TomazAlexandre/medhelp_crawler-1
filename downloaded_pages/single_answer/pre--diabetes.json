    "question": "Recently have been experiencing lightheadedness, eye pain and blurriness in right eye, muscle tightness in the left calf and muscle twitching in right upper leg. Have long family history of diabetes but all blood work checked out fine. Had eyes examined for new glasses and eyes checked out fine. GP did all of the \"push / pull\" neurology tests and that checked out fine. GP suggested I see a neurologists if I wanted to investigate further, but I really don't think the problem is neurological. Could this be pre-diabetes?",
