    "question": "My 86 yr old diabetic Dad is reluctant to extract his remaining 5 upper front teeth even after advised by 4 different dentists. One dentist said he has to get bone grafting. Another said dont bother with bone grafting because it will take too long and he has diabetes and needs dentures to eat, and implants will take too long. But my Dad really wants them. Dad insists his rotted discolored remaining 6, 7,8,9,10 are strong and imbedded well even though 2 of them are worn down to the gum base. Can one or 2 of his front uppers remain and 2 implants be installed on the upper worn out ridge and just experiment ASAP and if it doesnt work, we can pull the rest of the front teeth later? But at least he can begin to eat sooner than 90 days for extractions to heal?His upper ridge is very high but the front is lower. The CT scan shows he has enough space for implants to just clear his sinus.",
