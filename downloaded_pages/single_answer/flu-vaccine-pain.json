            "answer": "Hello!The most common side effect of the flu vaccine in adults is soreness at the spot where the shot was given. It usually lasts for less than two days. The immune system of a person who has been given the vaccine starts making protective antibodies against the killed viruses in the vaccine. This leads to soreness. These antibodies allow the body to fight against flu. Whether this inability to lift the arms is due to the flu shot or some other cause needs to be confirmed. In people with diabetes mellitus conditions like frozen shoulder can cause this symptom. Tears in rotator cuff, hypothyroid myopathy are other possibilities. If the pain is very severe and intolerable do get it seen by a doctor. That will be helpful. Do keep us posted.Take care and best wishes!",
