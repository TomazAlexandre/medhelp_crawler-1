Your leg numbness could be due to injury to a nerve, pressure on spinal or peripheral nerves (neuropathy), vitamin deficiency, lack of blood supply due to cholesterol plaque from atherosclerosis in the extremities, viral infection and use of certain medications.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, atherosclerosis can also cause pain, numbness, and tingling while walking and they can also reduce blood supply and lead to numbness.

    "question": "Dears Sirs/Madam, Eight years ago I started getting numbness in both of my large toes. The numbness went on to affect all of my toes; then the balls of my feet & now covers the whole of my feet. The sensations from these are twofold, when walking it feels as though I am walking on air bags & I can live with this; but as soon as I lie down the sensations become extremely annoying. The tingling becomes more intensified with flashes of stinging pain like lightning strikes; make getting off to sleep mostly a nightmare.I have been tested for diabetes etc & even having special inserts made for my shoes but nothing has helped. I have never taken drugs & I never have had a lust for drink. I am seventy now and wonder if this can still get worse.Yours SincerelyBarryThis discussion is related to/posts/show/896962.",
