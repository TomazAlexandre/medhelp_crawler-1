    "question": "I was diagnosed with Diabetes when I was 40. I am now 54. Because of the Great Recession, I am not working and my husbands company shut down, and so we have no insurance. We buy insulin from Walmart without a prescription thank God for them. But its not what was prescribed for me in the past. for the last 2 years my vision has been getting worse. My eyeglass prescription kept getting stronger and stronger. Now I cant afford an Ophthalmologist, and my sight in my left eye is all but gone.It started from the outside and worked its way in.. an opaque area that makes it look like I am looking through a piece of white cloth to see anything. My eye itself looks completely normal. No visible cataract. When my husband looks at it with a flashlight from the side or front same.. nothing visible with the naked eye that might resemble a cataract.Now my right is beginning the same thing. From the outside in, just like the left one.What do you think it could be. And is there anything I do about it without going to an Ophthalmologist?",
