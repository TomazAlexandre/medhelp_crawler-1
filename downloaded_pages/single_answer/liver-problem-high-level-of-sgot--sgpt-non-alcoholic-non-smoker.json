            "answer": "Hi,Elevated levels of SGOT and SGPT may indicate some form of liver injury or disease due to any source. Elevation of these enzymes can occur due to muscle damage. There is mild elevation of liver enzymes in chronic hepatitis C infection s and cirrhosis of liver. Another common condition causing mildly elevated SGOT and SGPT is fatty liver. Non alcoholic fatty liver is usually seen in diabetes mellitus and obesity. Use of some antibiotics and antiseizure medications can also be a possibility. If all these causes have been ruled out systemic disorders like Wilson's disease, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and autoimmune hepatitis, haemochromatosis should be ruled out. If you are obese reduce your weight.You will need clinical evaluation and additional tests like viral markers, serum iron ferritin levels, serum ceruloplasmin and ultrasound abdomen .Do consult a gastroenterologist. That will be helpful. Do keep us posted.Take care and good luck!",
