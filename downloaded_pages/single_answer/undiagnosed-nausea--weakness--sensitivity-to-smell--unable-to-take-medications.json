            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Commonest cause of nausea is acidity. Take omeprazole and antacid gel and see if it helps. Since certain smells and medicines triggers it, chances of acidity are high. When this is associated with gastric reflux, it often causes alteration in nasal mucosa and perception of smell.Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have unpredictable, yet ultimately persistent nausea that is often induced by smells that do not bother other people (such as the fabric softener smell on clothes).\u00a0\u00a0One day I will feel okay, but the next I may be incapacitated by the nauseous feelings.\u00a0\u00a0I am unable to take any sort of medication because it produces the same effect.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to numerous doctors without any conclusive results, and I thought I would try this forum to see if anyone has any similar symptoms or solutions.",
