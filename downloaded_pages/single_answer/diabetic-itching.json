            "answer": "Hello,The dermatologists are best suited to answer this question, however if creams are not wring they may want to try some oral medications like benadryl or atarax. If you do have an infection that ofcourse will need to be treated. People with diabetes are prone to yeast infections on the skin, for example. Be sure that your liver tests are normal as some liver problems can lead to itchy skin.I would not simply \"suggest you stop scratching.\"",

One dermotologist took skin samples and said\u00a0\u00a0did have a mild skin infection.\u00a0\u00a0He gave me a prescription for some skin cream.\u00a0\u00a0A second dermatologist siad \"it's caused by diabetis\".\u00a0\u00a0He said to use Sarna Original and to stop scratching.
