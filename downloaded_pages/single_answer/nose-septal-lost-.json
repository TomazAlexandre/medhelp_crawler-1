            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The nasal septum can be reconstructed, so please don\u2019t worry. This does not cause any problems with living and does not affect the lifespan. Before reconstruction your doctor may want to make sure there is no persisting infection. Also, diabetes needs to be ruled out. There are different surgical methods for reconstruction. Consult a plastic surgeon, he will guide you appropriately.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
