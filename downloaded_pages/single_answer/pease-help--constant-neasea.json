            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you have pain under your right rib and constant nausea then there could be a liver infection or a gall bladder problem. Get a liver function test, ultrasound or CT of abdomen, pancreatic enzymes, a repeat chest X-ray and hemogram and iron status. Since there was blood in urine, and you are pale, get a kidney function test done (not simple urine examination). Chances of IBS too are very high. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea.Please consult an internal medicine specialist or a GI doctor you are with and discuss these possibilities.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "hi,My symtoms started about three months ago. i suddenly started feeling sick. i went to my doctor and he originally thought it might be a kidney ifection as he tested my urine at the surgery and said it has blood and protien in it, so i was put on antibiotics. However once the Urine sample came back from the lab they said everything was fine. we sent off another sample and again they said everything was fine. i was then treated for gastritis and put on Omeprzole. this helped only a little. i am able to eat then a few bites of food and and not much liquid. i have had an abdominal ultrasound and a endoscopy to look into my stomach. both of then have come back as normal. in this time i have lost three stone. To preper for my Endoscopy i had to come off my Omeprazole and this cause canstant vomiting so bad that i had to go to hospital to have a drip. The same thing happened as it did at my GP surgery- my urine wias tested there and it had blood in it buy once sent the labs it can back as OK. i have also had an ache in my right side below my rib cage for this whole time but no really bad pain.I dont know of there is any conection but wen i got ill a few months ago (for a rutine lung infection that cleared up quickly with antibiotics) many people commented on how when i was ill i went yellow instead of pale.i am being sent for a CT and am waiting for the biopsy results of my endoscopy.Any help anyone couldd give me would be much help. thanks",
