            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Blood sugar control cannot be achieved only through medication. Also, you may need to consult your doctor again and again to see what medication and doses and what medication combinations suit best. Apart from this you would need to watch what you eat, control portion size, eat foods that will not spike your blood sugar too much. Also you need to exercise. So you also need to consult a nutrition expert and also build up an exercise regimen to burn the glucose. Please discuss this with your treating doctor. If this combination does not help, then your doctor may put you on insulin. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
