            "answer": "You may want to post this on the kidney forum. A GFR of 31 is a serious thing, and although not immediately life threatening needs to be taken really seriously. You can live a lifetime with a GFR of 31 provided it stays at 31. I know nothing about urea levels. My nephrologist just goes by GFR.That is stage 3 kidney disease, bordering on stage 4 (which is under 30). If I was in your shoes I would be starting a kidney diet right now, and going to a nephrologist to get a kidney ultrasound and otherwise checked out. If you have high blood pressure or diabetes it is especially important to get that under control.I rose my GFR by 10% when I started the kidney diet and quit using NSAIDS (apirin, aleve, advil, etc.). I went from Stage 3 to Stage 2. So it isn't all bad news. There is a lot you may be able to do. Depends on why your kidneys aren't functioning properly. If it is poor filtration reducing certain elements like phosphorus and potassium will really help it along.",
