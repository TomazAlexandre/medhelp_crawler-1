Myself - I would wait, being changes cause problems, but keep a sort of diary to note any changes w/him - something you can look back on and \"see\" any differences.The AlkPhos has me bumfuzzled.

    "question": "I care for my uncle who is 83 years old. His physician was cocnerned about his last lab work.\u00a0\u00a0Bilrubin levels have gone from 0.9 in July of 2006 to 1.3 in March 2007 and then 1.4 last July.\u00a0\u00a0His physician is concerned because tit appears to be steadily increasing.\u00a0\u00a0Also the phosphatase (I don't think I have that spelled correctly) level has gone from 27 in March 2007, to 21 in July 2007.\u00a0\u00a0The physician indiciated that these two levels indicate possible liver disease.
