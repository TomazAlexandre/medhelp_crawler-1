    "question": "I am currently experiencing numbness with my tongue that cause extreme fatigue and makes it difficult to talk, I also have trouble remembering simple tasks and focusing. I also have a lump under my chin that I was told was just fat but I know that it's not because some days it appears bigger and I will wake up with my jaw area feeling swollen and will last throughout the day. And I wake up with my muscles aching (it feels like the pain you have when you have the flu but worse) and will also last throughout the day. And if I sit or stand for too long my legs will cramp up and it is painful to walk. Recently I'm noticing numbness in my fingertips. I have been to many doctors and no one has figured it out. Wondering if anybody may be familiar with these symptoms and may be able to direct me for help.",
