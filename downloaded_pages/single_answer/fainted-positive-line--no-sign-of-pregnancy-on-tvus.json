    "question": "It could be 9 weeks and 5 by now. LMP Feb. 11... No period day 42 HPT fainted positive line. Day 45 spotting\u00a0\u00a0on and off . Lasted for 2 days. Day 52 spotting again days passed minimal bleeding but not red brownish lasted for 3 days took duvadilan and duphaston since then. It will stop and few days after back with spottings only when I go up and down stairs. Then nearly 9 weeks had spotting led to cramping and minimal bleeding to light red bleeding. With some sort of a tissue comes out with it. Next day had my 1st meeting with the OB. Told her the situation and I had TVUS done and she said no trace of pregnancy. Here is the result of TVUS Impression: normal sized anteverted uterus with intact endometrium normal ovaries with corpus luteum on the right. (BTW, I have history of Ectopic pregnancy years ago and took my left fallopian tube). Going back, she just prescribed me with ferrous sulfate and continue with my previous mantainance meds LoSartan and amlodipine since I have diabetes and hypertension. And ask me to have my CBC since I'm bleeding and BHCG. Coz she said she couldn't see any sign of pregnancy. Or I already ad Early Miscarriage. Want to know if there's a chance that the TVUS had mistaken and Am still pregnant coz my abdomen is getting bigger and there are times it gets hard and my breast hurts with occasional hardness with a feeling of getting fever. Just like I felt with my 3 pregnancy years ago. hope for your advice as soon as possible coz I'm really confused... Thanks a lot and God bless... May the Lord give you the wisdom to give every one who's in need of clearer advices...",
