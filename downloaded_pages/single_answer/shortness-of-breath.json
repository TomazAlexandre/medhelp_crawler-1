            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.What's the slow bowel due to, diabetes or hypothyroidism? Have yourself evaluated for this. To check for nerve compression, a nerve conduction will help. But the nerve compression may not be responsible for your shortness of breath. As your pulmonary functions tests are normal, your symptoms could also be due to small airway disease, which affects the respiratory bronchioles. Disease of small airways results from exposure to tobacco smoke, mineral dust, air-pollutants, and viral infections. It may also be associated with connective tissue disorders. The pulmonary function tests are abnormal only late in the disease and the damage done is irreversible. Therefore, management lies in preventing exposure to smoke and dust, whether in the form of smoking tobacco or exposure to industrial dusts in the work environment. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with central sleep apnea, but I also have shortness of breath during the day, causing low energy and sleepiness.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms get worse upon heavy lifting or when my neck is flexed forward or backward for any length of time.\u00a0\u00a0Shortness of breath also occurs when bending over too much, or riding in a bumpy car or airplane, or even when floating upright in a pool (buoyancy vs. gravity).\u00a0\u00a0 I'm convinced I have some kind of nerve compression.\u00a0\u00a0I have been dealing with this for over 7 years and the symptoms are gradually getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0I have fibromyalgia as a result of sleep deprivation as well.\u00a0\u00a0 I've had breathing tests done and they are always normal.\u00a0\u00a0The initial onset of symptoms occured after 4 years of lap swimming and weight training with lower neck pain followed by radiating pain in my back between the shoulder blades.\u00a0\u00a0 I eventually had MRI's of the neck and thoracic spine revealing T7-8 herniation and\u00a0\u00a0C5-6 herniation.\u00a0\u00a0However,\u00a0\u00a0no compression is ever noted in the radialogy report... Can there still be nerve damage and worsening symptoms as aggravated by body postures and weight-bearing situations even though the MRI's never reveal any compression??\u00a0\u00a0Do I need to get my phrenic nerve tested?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I also feel like my\u00a0\u00a0chest is somewhat paralyzed and that my diaphragm is doing all the breathing, atleast at night.\u00a0\u00a0Other symptoms include a slow bowel for which I have to take Myralax daily.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any insight or suggestion.",
