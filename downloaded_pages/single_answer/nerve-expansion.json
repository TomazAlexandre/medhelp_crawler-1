            "answer": "Dear Bhagat,As such there is no expansion but there is inflammation of nerves due to several causes . It can actually affect one specific nerve or it can affect different nerves in different parts of the body, so the severity of the disease depends on the affected areas of the nervous system. Mainly neuritis manifests itself in the areas where the nerves are affected. There is tingling and stabbing pain in the affected nerves. The pain is usually not constant. It comes in attacks.\u00a0\u00a0During severe cases the muscles surrounding the nerves will loose all feeling .AIDS, diabetes, alcoholism and nutrition deficiencies affect the peripheral nervous system. And a mild form of peripheral neuritis may occur if too much pressure is put on a single nerve for too long.Complete evaluation is to be done to find the cause.",
