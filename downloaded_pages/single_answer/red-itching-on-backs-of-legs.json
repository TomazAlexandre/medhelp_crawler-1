            "answer": "Hello,Leg itch may be a part of generalized itch caused by different disorders such as xerotic eczema, senile pruritis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, infestations, infections, obstructive biliary disease, chronic renal failure, malignancy, medications, neurodermatitis, diabetes, peripheral nerve damage, emotional stress, psychic disorders, etc.that can only be diagnosed by a dermatologist.Scratching can trigger additional itching, so resist to scratch, if possible.You can use Over-the-counter moisturizing cream.By the time it get diagnosed you can continue antihistaminics like Benadrly or Claritin.You can also use hydrocortisone topical cream in low (1%) concentration (to prevent thining of the skin) will reduce skin inflammation.Cough in morning is not releated with this problem so to ruled any URTI(upper respiratory tract infection) you may visit to your physician.Hope it helps.Regards",
