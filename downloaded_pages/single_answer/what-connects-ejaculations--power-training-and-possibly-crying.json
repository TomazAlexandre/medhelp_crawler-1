            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to parasthesia which is due to dysfunctioning of neurons and can occur due to nerve irritation also. It can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, neurological causes or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar, vitamin B 12 and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. Animal protein is the richest source of vitamin B 12 and if you are a vegetarian then you may be having vitamin B 12 deficiency. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve. If the symptoms persist then get an evaluation done from a physician and also get nerve conduction velocity tests done to rule out any nerve irritation.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I'm experiencing a strange low intensity burning under my scalp after each activity (yes, I'm a sissy), and have been for a couple of years. During that time I've lost a lot of hair and now whatever is wrong has finished off the topmost layer of whatever it burns in and moved deeper.It's connected directly to these activities - at least the first two for certain. It's episodic - usually it appears in the evenings after the aforementioned activities and disappears after sleep.After it moved deeper inside my head, the symptoms became scarier. Now after each episode I'm losing focus in my right eye, and also feel unpleasant numbness in my right thumb on my foot.I've been to a lot of doctors, but so far had no luck in identifying the thing. Would appreciate any suggestion of what I should suggest my doctor to test for. Thank you. Very much.",
