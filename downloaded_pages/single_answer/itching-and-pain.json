Vaginal yeast infections can be brought on by antibiotics, birth control pills, pregnancy, menstruation, condom use, sexual intercourse, diabetes, and a weakened immune system. On the other hand, vaginitis which usually presents with inflammation, itching, discharge, and odor\u00a0\u00a0may be caused by other infections such as urethritis or sexually transmitted diseases.It is important to have this evaluated further to reach a diagnosis. Treatment is dependent on the underlying cause. A urinalysis may also be done to rule out urinary tract infection. Try to keep the area clean and dry.

    "question": "Well, for the past week I have been having problems with my vaginal area. The vagina is very itchy and also my urethra , and I also have symptoms similar to an urinary tract infection. Pain when I pee, my urine smells, and I haven't had a full flow for a few days. I also noticed that my bladder is constantly feeling full and I have been extremely uncomfortable in the vaginal area. My OB/GYN isn't open, and I don't know how much of an emergency this might be.",
