    "question": "Recently my cousin began Medifast and she' was an insulin dependent diabetic. Since then, she has lost 57 pounds, looks great, feels great, off insulin, 100% ckup from dr. She said the weigh just melted off. So, I began Medifast a week ago and have 70-75 pounds to loose, taking a pill for diabetes currently, hypothyroid and doing this with my doctor's approval (although he is relunctant to provide 100% support but said let's try and see what happens).I want to know if anyone has tried Medifast? I know I can read the support page on their website but I want to hear both sides. I tried weight watchers for 1 1/2 yrs--I didn't loose a pound but my mother lost 62 pounds. Very discouraging--my doctor says it's my irregular thyroid and that I'm not trying hard enough--I was actually starving!!! And, I only listen to my doctor half the time when he's being a downer and negative about alternatives available. I don't like diet pills and surgery--these were never an option.So far on the Medifast, I'm not hungry, have lost 7 3/4 lbs.--that's awesome in my books considering I haven't seen anything go down in over 6 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, when I started the program I weighed 227 1/2. My goal is to get off the diabetic pills, loose the weight and maintain my weight. Somewhere in there, I would reeeeeeeeeealy like for my thyroid to behave!",
