            "answer": "You seem to have a lot of symptoms there.The bone pain sounds like it might be bursitis.The pain on the right side could be your kidney, liver, pulled/torn muscle, or even a hernia...depends on exactly where it's at and what kind of pain it is. But with the gas/diarrhea it could be your pancreas as well. I would talk to your doctor more about it. Maybe have him double check your enzyme levels.If you had diabetes one year ago, you still have it. Diabetes doesn't go away once you've been diagnosed with it. Even a reading of around 200 is high. Your blood sugar level should be around 100-110 after eating and around 80 after fasting.You should also tell your doctor that you stopped taking insulin. They can put you on a regulated insulin plan where you take certain amounts based on your current reading..so if it's 200, you would take less, and if it's 600 you would take more.As far as being tired, that may be related to the diabetes.You\u00a0\u00a0might want to talk to him about an anti-anxiety medication as well.",
