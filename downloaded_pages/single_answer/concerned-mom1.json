            "answer": "Lisa,Rest easy, this may sound like a lot of medication but it is a common med cocktail used to treat depression/anxiety with or without bi-polar components.\u00a0\u00a0Each med has a different job in re-balancing the brains chemical soup. Sadly, it only takes one of your neuro chemicals to be out of the normal range to cause a domino effect.Here is a breakdown of what each med does in laymen terms: Zoloft is an antidepressant with some anti-anxiety properties, dosed between 50 to 300mg.\u00a0\u00a0Buspar is an anti-anxiety drug but is usually added on to stop or slow \"Dose creep\" which is a syndrome where to doctor has to keep upping the dose to get the same effect that occurs during earlier treatment (sometimes the brain finds \"work arounds\" to medicines causing them to be less effective). Buspar is dosed between 5 to 30mgs. Finally, Abilify is a mood stabilizer that I have seen works miracles when added to other mood disorder medications. Abilify tends to turbo charge the effectiveness of other meds and is dosed between 5 to 40mg. Some people will need to take these meds for a few years and some for life. It just depends on the brains ability to repair itself. Think of someone with Type 1 diabetes, their body has lost the ability to produce insulin so they need to take insulin medication for the rest of their life.As you can see, your daughter is on low end doses of all three medications.\u00a0\u00a0These meds can take weeks to a couple of months to garner the effect that the doctor is looking for so be patient. Finally, the only real warning I can give you is to never let her go off the meds \"cold turkey\" as the brain can revolt in a very unpleasant way. If she ever comes off the meds or changes them in the future, it must be done on a strict time line with her doctor!I hope this helps...",
