    "question": "My best friend recently found out that she had an enlarged left kidney through an ultrasound. She has recently also been experiencing lower back pain.\u00a0\u00a0She was told to do a urine test, which ended up showing no signs of infection or abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors here, who don't have the best reputation of being thorough, simply said to come back in a month and see if there is any change.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, the back pain continues.\u00a0\u00a0The concerning thing is that she is a Type 1 Diabetic and I know that there can be complications related to that.\u00a0\u00a0She has had diabetes for about 8 years now and recently got on the pump so her sugars are better managed in the past 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0She also has a condition called CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and feels many or all the symptoms associated with it which includes lethargy, body aches, etc.\u00a0\u00a0 She has some ovarian cysts and she also uses Mirena.\u00a0\u00a0My question is: What steps should she be taking to diagnose the cause of the enlarged kidney?\u00a0\u00a0Could it be an infection, diabetes related, a side effect from Mirena????,",
