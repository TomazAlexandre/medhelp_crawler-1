            "answer": "Hello,The symptoms are suggestive of parasthesia skin. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition. Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not. In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hello,I'm 25 years old. The only real health issue I've had in the past is asthma which is currently being controlled with an albuterol inhaler. For the past two months or so I've been experiencing hot flashes. They occur randomly when I'm doing any light to moderate activity. It mostly affects the top section of my body. I will begin to feel a burning sensation which will become visible by a red rash and then I will feel a prickly feeling all over that area like pins and needles. Finally, I will begin to itch. It's terribly uncomfortable. It'll usually last 10 minutes or so. Right now I'm lucky that it's winter and if I go outside with the cold temperature it'll help stop the burning quicker. However, I've found no way of preventing it. I'm hoping it's nothing to do with estrogen crashes or ovarian failure but so far that's all I've found for explanations on health websites. Any other thoughts?",
