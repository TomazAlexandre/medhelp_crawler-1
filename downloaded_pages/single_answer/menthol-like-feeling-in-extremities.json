            "answer": "Dear Farraway, welcome to the medhelp forum. The causes for this cool and tingling sensation in the extremities could be due to pinched or compressed nerve root in spine due to degenerative disc disease of cervical spine if all the extremities and lumbar spine if only lower extremities are affected. This could be manifestation of peripheral neuropathy, causes being diabetes, alcoholic. Did you travel abroad or possible unprotected sexual exposure? Deranged renal function and leprosy also need to be ruled out. You need to consult a physician for detailed systemic evaluation and run certain blood tests like complete blood counts, blood sugar, urea and electrolytes, vitamin B12 levels, TSH and electrophoresis. These should help in arriving at a probable diagnosis and appropriate management. Wish you all the best.",
