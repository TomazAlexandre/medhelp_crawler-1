            "answer": "Hello,The very first thing that comes to my mind on the basis of your posting is diabetes mellitus. This disease occurs due to a deficiency of insulin (formed in the pancreas for control of blood sugar levels) and usually manifests with symptoms of excessive thirst & frequent water intake, frequent & night-time urination and excessive hunger & frequent meals.For this, you need to get your blood sugar levels checked twice (first in the morning after a 12-hour fasting and second 2-hours after taking 75g of glucose). Other conditions that may mimic your symptoms include infections (particularly urinary tract infections), drug-induced, an excessive loss of water & salt (due to excessive/drug-induced urination, profuse sweating, loose motions/vomiting), an enlarged prostate (causing bladder outflow problems), an insufficient functioning state of the heart, liver or kidney, or an anxiety state. Please consult your doctor for a thorough evaluation, appropriate tests and further advice.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
