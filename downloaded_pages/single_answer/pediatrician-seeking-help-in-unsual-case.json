            "answer": "So you are describing a child who has had significant fluctuations in weight and appetite. There is more and more research as you know discussing the obesity genes and what to watch for. Genetic testing is not out of the question to assess the final question of Prader Willi or other chromosomal problems. Also we don't have midparental height to see what his percentile should be, making for a missing piece of the puzzle. Stick with the growth hormone but be sure you are seeing your peds endo every 4 months, he may need different dosing. Now he also sounds like he may have insulin resistance, given\u00a0\u00a0his borderline hba1c and weight gain.They may even consider him a candidate for metformin if his hba1c is borderline and he has elevated insulin levels.There are rare genetic ties like melanocorticotropin 4 receptor abnormalities that are rare but sometimes found.Work carefully with your endo, as thyroid may become a problem that did not show up prior etc.Also the meds used to treat various bipolar disease states also influence metabolism and many metabolic pathways",

    "question": "I am a pediatrician with an adopted son who has an unusual assortment of Endocrine issues.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, very little biological family history is available.\u00a0\u00a0He is a 10 year old black male with Bipolar disorder who has an insatiable appetite and is Prader-Willi-like in his food seeking behaviors (mostly carbohydrates).\u00a0\u00a0He became morbidly obese at 5 years old but lost 1/3 of his body weight when methylphenidate was started for ADHD.\u00a0\u00a0 At that time, he suddenly recognized the concept of \"fullness\", which he claimed he never experienced before.\u00a0\u00a0At that point, his growth rate started dropping from 75%ile to current 10th%ile.\u00a0\u00a0Exactly one year ago, he started putting the weight back on at an extraordinary rate (despite participation in many sports), and he is again morbidly obese.\u00a0\u00a0However, his growth continued to lag and drop centiles.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, leptin levels were found to be extremely low, especially for weight. IRGF's were also low, and a GH stimulation test showed significant growth hormone deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0He has taken GH for 4 months now, and has gained 0.9 inches (from 12th to 14th percentile) and 16 pounds (from 94th to 96th percentile).\u00a0\u00a0Bone age is about a year delayed.\u00a0\u00a0Head MRI was normal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hemoglobin A1C was recently tested twice at 6.1, then 6.2 four months later.\u00a0\u00a0Attempts for weight loss are thwarted by two things: he is an amazing food hider/hunter and can get past any lock; sports are becoming painful and cause bipolar rages; he has no desire to change.\u00a0\u00a0Most articles associate HIGH GH and Leptin levels with obesity.\u00a0\u00a0Please help: where do we go from here, have you heard of this weird constellation of problems, is there anything else we should be considering/exploring, and when should treatment for diabetes mellitus be considered? THANKS!!",
