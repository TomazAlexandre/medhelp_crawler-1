            "answer": "In order to get a complete picture of what is going on, you need to have a complete workup. Bloodwork should consist of TSH, Free T3, Free T4 and ALL testing for Hashimoto's and Grave's autoimmune diseases. You need to know WHY you are hypothyroid, not just take a pill and feel confused as to why. Right? That is what happened to me at the beginning. I would also insist on a Thyroid Ultrasound.Your diet isn't so much a factor unless you are taking in high amounts of iodine or kelp or things like that.If this is a temporary situation, then you will know within short time. Otherwise, yes you could be on meds forever. A situation that most of us have started in denial as well. No one wants to Have to take a pill the rest of their lives. I fought it for a year and became much worse. The important thing right now is to find a doctor who SPECIALIZES in Thyroid. A lot of endos specialize in diabetes and have learned just basics of thyroid. So you need to be picky and search it out. Good luck and keep us updated! :)",

    "question": "I have recently started taking Synthroid (50mcg) and I am concerned about whether taking it permanently or temporarily suppresses thyroid functioning; which is it? I don't want to be stuck taking this if the diagnosis turns out to be wrong. Which leads to a second question: how much can diet and alcohol affect thyroid function and is this temporary or permanent? I ask as my doctor looked at the TSH levels (9.1) and made a prescription with no examination of lifestyle. Again, I would hate to be stuck on a lifetime treatment for something that could be handled with a change in diet and alcohol consumption.",
