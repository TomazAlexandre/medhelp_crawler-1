            "answer": "Hi!A heat sensation or sudden feeling of warmth can be a sign of blood clot or deep vein thrombosis. It can also be due to pinched nerve or due to diabetic neuropathy. If you are on birth control pills, then this could be due to the side effect of pills as they can also cause deep vein thrombosis. For diagnosis first a duplex ultrasound or color dopplar would need to be done. If this is negative then a nerve conduction study and test for diabetes. If there is a chance then if everything else is negative, then lupus may need to be tested for. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm a 16 yr old girl and I have weird spots all over my legs. They vary between red and brown. They are quite small but I have loads of them. Apparently everyone has them, but mine are quite dark and stand out. If I pick it, either blood or a hair follicle will come out. It still looks weird though. I'm not fat, I weigh 45 kg and I'm 5 ft 3. My legs are kind of curvy.",
