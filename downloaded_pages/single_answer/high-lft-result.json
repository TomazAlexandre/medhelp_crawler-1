            "answer": "I am not a physician, but a volunteer, the mom of a type 1 and the daughter of type 2 diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest that you call your endocrinologist and tell him/ her that you are no longer taking any medications, and ask how you should proceed till they can give you an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0I can tell you that if you were taking medication to lower your blood sugars and they are now running high, you are running the risk of developing DKA (ketoacidosis).Diabetic ketoacidosis, or DKA, is severe, out-of-control diabetes (high blood sugar) that needs emergency treatment. DKA is caused by a profound lack of circulating insulin. This may happen because of illness, taking too little insulin, or getting too little exercise. The body starts using stored fat for energy, and ketones bodies (acids) build up in the blood. DKA also accounts for most hospitalization and is the most common cause of death, mostly due to cerebral edema, in pediatric diabetes. Furthermore, treating DKA incorrectly can result in cerebral edema and death.I am not sure what the test results mean or if\u00a0\u00a0 he will be on insulin, but I do strongly suggest that you call and discuss this with your endocrinologist ASAP.I am sorry that I could not be of more help.\u00a0\u00a0Please let us know how things went.",
