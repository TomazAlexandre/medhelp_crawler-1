I will leave my response posted for a few days since I have no other way to contact you, and then I will have to delete your offer. If you wish to contact the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation in order to offer to DONATE the pump, you can reach them on www.jdrf.org, or perhaps you will want to be put in contact with their local chapter so you can meet some other diabetic people or parents of diabetic children so you can offer the pump personally. The JDRF organization also cannot help facilitate a sale since we cannot appear to be endorsing a product for legal reasons, but if you contact your local JDRF chapter and meet some people, you can try to sell it one-on-one with individuals.",
