            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Pneumonitis is inflammation of the lung. And the aorta which is a blood vessel is atheromatous. Blood vessels are narrowed most commonly due to atherosclerosis, a disease where the 'fatty' material in the blood gets deposited in the walls of the blood vessels. Certain conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking and sedentary life style promote this. When a blood clot tries to pass through a narrowed lumen it causes an obstruction to flow.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
