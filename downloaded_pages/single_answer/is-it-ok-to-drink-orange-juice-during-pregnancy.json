            "answer": "Dear kariiArellano:Congratulation!Yes, it is ok to drink fruit juice, such as orange and apple juice, during pregnancy. It is important to stay hydrated during pregnancy, for example, at least 8 - 10 glasses of water daily.Please consult your primary care provider and OBGYN to see if you are at risk for gestational diabetes, or diabetes during pregnancy. If you are at risk or have gestational diabetes, then you need to avoid beverages that are high in sugar content, i.e. fruit punch, soda, juice with high-fructose corn syrup.It is also a good idea to avoid artificial sweeteners because of safety concerns regarding possible cancer risks.If you are taking certain medications, such as statins (cholesterol lowering drugs), nifedipine (blood pressure-lowering med), and etc., then you should not be drinking grapefruit juice or eating grapefruits. Make sure you double check with your pharmacist and primary care provider/OBGYN regarding your medical conditions and medication list.Good luck and take care!For more information on nutrition during pregnancy and pregnancy wellness, please go to:1.
