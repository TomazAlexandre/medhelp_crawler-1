            "answer": "I live in Healesville and have been travelling the WORLD to find a good endo. You are kidding me about a good one in Australia, right? Sorry, just couldn't help myself.I see Simon Forehan in Cabrini Hospital and he is highly trained in thyroid. BUT doesn't like giving out T3 supplement.\u00a0\u00a0(So if you think you might need it, don't go see him)Depending on what your thyroid issues are you you might have to see if you can just do the ring arounds and see if anyone has an appointment coming up. I was lucky and got to see Simon on a Monday following a ring around and that was on the Thursday before.I HIGHLY do NOT recommend Dr Gerstmann in Ringwood. He makes ALL his patients wait 2 hours (literally), nice enough to talk to, but really doesn't listen, he is doing research in a diabetic injection and I think it not really into thyroids.Of course, don't forget you need a referral from the GP!",

    "question": "Hi there, wonder if any of you super Aussies on here recommend a really good endo in Victoria please? I'm not too keen on the one I have plus they have just rescheduled my appointment til January as \"she doesn't work afternoons anymore'.Urrgh!I live in Berwick but am willing to travel for someone who knows their stuff on thyroid disease. I understand I may still not get an appointment til Jan anyway (they are all so busy) just want someone who specialises in thryoid stuff more than diabetes.Thanks in advance",
