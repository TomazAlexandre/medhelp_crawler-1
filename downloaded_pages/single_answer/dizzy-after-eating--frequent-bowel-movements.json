    "question": "I get dizzy/odd /foggy headed feeling for no reason.It seems to be linked to a dull \"lump sensation\" in my lower rt quad. The more I feel this lower rt quad sensation, the greater the dizziness. Usually accompanied by bowel movement, but the dizziness remains. Been going on for 40+ days w/only a day or 2 here and there of \"near normal\" feeling.Like so many, all my tests come back negative. Colonoscopy, complete and varied blood work, hernia check, diabetes check, (only 15 hr fast, not glucose intolerance), holter monitor, stress ekg, chest xray, abdominal ct, 24 hr urine, regular urine, etc.Only thing so far is \"possible thickening\" of the small intestine and insuline test came back 1pt low. I am scheduled for a barium follow through.My symptoms sometimes include pulse rate going up and down for no reason/during rest and some irregularities. My doctor is starting to seem a little impatient. I really need help here, it is ruining my life.",
