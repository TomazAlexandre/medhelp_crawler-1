            "answer": "Hi irene,My story is very similar to yours. I was diagnosed in 1990, a1c of 9.and b.s.over 400. Unfortunately I had an additional problem, coronary artery disease (CAD), that hopefully you don't and never will have. Although I got my b.s. under control and my a1c down to 6.2 the diabetes had damaged my heart arteries and I subsequently had to have triple coronary bypass surgery. I recovered from the surgery and returned to my former activities.To make a long story short let me just say that I blew my diet, stopped my exercise and regained the 50 pounds I had lost. Needless to say by diabtes returned and this time I developed diabetes related peripheral nuropathy (burning and pinprick like pain in my feet) of the lower extremities. I am back on my medicines and I do a supervised exercise program for 1 hour 5 days a week, watch my diet and take my medicines and my diabetes is back UNDER CONTROL.Notice I used upper case letters to spell out under control above. If we lose enough weight and stay active diabetes symptoms may disapear--but we are not cured. If we are not very careful, it will come back. Diabetes is very similar to high blood pressure in that we can treat it and keep it under control, but if we stop the treatment it can and often will come back.Please take care of yourself.troytroy",

    "question": "Hi, I was originally diagnosed about 8 years ago with b.s around 400. Was on oral meds for a time. Had a hard time getting my numbers down, then went on a very strict diet and exercised alot. I was able to get off all meds. Within the last 3 years my weight kept creeping up. I didn't exercise, and wasn't as strict with diet. Within the last year I really didn't watch my diet and also started enjoying mixed drinks on the weekends. Last Oct. my a1c was 6.8, with a fasting of 128, this Oct. it was 177 but in Dec. I started having fastings of over 300. I even had a couple of readings during the day over 500. Of course I was eating whatever I wanted and having drinks. Needless to say I'm on Meds. now, since end of Dec. I didn't think it would come back. Why did it get so high?",
