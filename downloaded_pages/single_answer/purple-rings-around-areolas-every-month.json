    "question": "Each month around the time of ovulation until I get my period I experience purple rings around my areolas. This has been going on for almost a year now. I am certain I am not pregnant, this is not a pregnancy symptom. My periods have become much shorter and much more irregular as the months pass and my pms symptoms have become more intense. Could this be some sort of hormone imbalance?",
