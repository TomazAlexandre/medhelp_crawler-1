    "question": "I am looking for some answers on my condition. I don't have diabetes so it is not related to that.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed at the OSU clinic by Dr. JR. Mendell and given some meds for small nerve fiber sensory neuropathy, but that was back in 2000-2001.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any new treatments for this chronic condition?\u00a0\u00a0I cannot take pain pills so I take a nasal pain med(Stadol NS), but am looking for something different to take. I am allergic or have a sensitivity to all pain meds in pill form, they make me deathly ill.Thank you,synjyn51",
