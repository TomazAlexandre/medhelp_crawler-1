    "question": "Hi,I am 23yr old female, 5'4, 120 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I have been constantly hungry for years, and I am almost never satisfied.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the hunger will be so intense, it hurts and I feel that I am going to pass out (I have 3 times).\u00a0\u00a0When I eat, I feel momentarily better but I quickly feel dizzy and nauseous.\u00a0\u00a0After this goes on all day long, I am exhausted and sleeping for an hour or two helps.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried everything that I can think of to help this. I have been following a healthy vegetarian diet for years, work out twice a week, and I have been tested for diabetes. I even went to the measure of not consuming any sugar for six months and I still didn't feel balanced. My mood is either really high and energetic or really low and it is hard to concentrate.Any suggestions?",
