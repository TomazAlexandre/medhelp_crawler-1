            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms are typically suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) or median neuropathy at the wrist is a medical condition in which the median nerve is compressed at the wrist, leading to pain, paresthesias(numb sensation), and muscle weakness in the forearm and handA form of compressive neuropathy, CTS is more common in women than it is in men and has a peak incidence around age 42, though it can occur at any age. The first symptoms of CTS may appear when sleeping and typically include numbness and paresthesia (a numb and tingling sensation) in the fingers, especially the thumb, index, and middle fingers.Clinical assessment by history taking and physical examination can frequently diagnose CTS.Treatments can be generally divided into four basic categories: 1. You must rest your hand for weeks 2. The doctor may include some drugs to relieve the pain 3. Doctor may give you a cast to help ease pain 4. If the hand does not cure, you may need surgery.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpal_tunnel_syndromeI feel that evaluation by a physician or neurologist will be the best because other conditions like diabetes,vit B12 deficiency,thyroid or parathyroid diseases,abnormal levels of calcium,sodium and potassium,motor neuron disease,multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis also have to be ruled out before confirming a diagnosis..Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.",
