            "answer": "Hello,Uncontrolled tremors might intentional i.e., when you start doing something, or rest tremors i.e., when the part of the body is at rest or postural tremors, i.e., when you try to maintain a particular posture.The causes vary depending on the type of tremor: It may be caused by cerebellar disease, some cases of Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stress, anxiety, hyperthyroidism, alcohol withdrawal, caffeine and drug consumption, Wilson's disease, liver disease, kidney disease. If it is only in one or two fingers, with not much interruption in daily activities, then you may ignore it, stress is also a cause. But if it is a problem, then you may consult a neurologist.Do keep me posted.Regards",
