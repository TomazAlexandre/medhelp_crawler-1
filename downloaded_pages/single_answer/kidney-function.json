    "question": "My dad has diabetes, has for years and along with that kidney failure.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor had told him that his kidney function was at 37% for the longest time, several years.\u00a0\u00a0Now the doc says that the function has increased to 43%.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, can this be possible (the doc himself said it was a miracle).\u00a0\u00a0I didn't think that the function percentage would go up without some sort of dialysis or something.\u00a0\u00a0And we wonder of it is one of those things that show better before it gets worse.\u00a0\u00a0(Hope not)Thanks for your time.",
