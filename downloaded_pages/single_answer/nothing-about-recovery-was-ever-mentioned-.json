            "answer": "Well, that first little box there where the lady said that she was never doing anything to learn about managing her moods is her own fault. It is our responsability as patients to learn about our disorder and to learn about every medicine or treatment we are facing. That includes learning how to take care of ourselves outside of the clincal and medication settings. I would say the same thing to anyone with a chornic illness such as cancer, diabetes, HIV, etc. etc.I was alone with no medication in this for almost 20 years! No hospitalizations or anything, but somehow I made it this far. It is not easy. I won't say it is easy to anyone. In fact it is very diffcult, lonely, and terrifying at times. But I constantly work very hard at managing my mood. I am not always successful at it, no. But I have to be aware of myself as best I can no matter what. I have to try. We all have to try. Even when we give up. I know that sounds funny, but it is true.A little over a week ago I was flipping out worse than I have in a long time, today I'm okay. Tomorrow who knows.",
