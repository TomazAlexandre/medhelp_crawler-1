            "answer": "Hi Jax,Your MDs are trying to find out what is wrong with you, with all these tests being ordered.\u00a0\u00a0It's a trying and scary time, but it would surely be wrong for anyone to say what's wrong with you, if the MDs haven't figured it out yet.\u00a0\u00a0Just ride it out for now...and try to relax....get the tests done...and keep in mind, that many disorders/diseases are diagnosed without specific tests being able to say for sure ( in other words, many diseases are diagnosed by ruling out other possibilities).\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you!",

    "question": "I'm having stomach pain, loss of appetite & bouts of diarrhea & constipation. I've had an endoscopy (normal), colonoscopy (some blood), sono of my abdomen (normal) and a cat scan (showed a cyst, free fluid in my pelvis & a complex cyst vs solid nodule in the other ovary) I'm now having problems regulating my blood sugar (dropped below 60 a few times) and have lost 8 pounds this week. This started as having severe pain and urge to use the bathroom a few times a week for a few months, and now has been a daily struggle for just under a month. I'm scared, I'm not getting answers, and I keep getting sent for more & more tests. What is wrong with me? I just got engaged a few days ago and instead of celebrating, I'm sick in the bathroom and fighting to keep it together. My sister has PCOS, my aunt has IBS, my dad has diabetes & my grandma has crohns. All doctors are aware of this. My next two tests are an internal sonogram & a CT enterography.",
