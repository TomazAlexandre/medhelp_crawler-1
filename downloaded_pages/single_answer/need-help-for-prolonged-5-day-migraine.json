            "answer": "Could it be caffeine withdrawal? Caffeine can help with migraines, so it's a possibility. However, I doubt that is really the answer.While I completely hear you about no insurance, I really recommend a visit to a neurologist, or at least the ER.When I get really severe migraines, my doc (and the ER once) have given me Stadol. It's a shot and I guarantee it knocks me on my a$$. However, that is an emergency thing .. not for constant use. They do have a nostril version that my doc gave me to take to India with me this summer -- just because he knows what I'm like with that bad of a migraine.As far as advice at this point? aside from getting to the ER? ice packs or an ice bath ... maybe benadryl? You need to do something to stop the attack, which means interrupting the cycle of inflammation (if this is a migraine). Maybe some acupressure? I know that if you can get the body to relax, sleep, and actually get some REM sleep, you can probably stop the cycle.",
