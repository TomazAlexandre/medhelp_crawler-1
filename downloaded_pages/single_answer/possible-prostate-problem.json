    "question": "I am a 37 year old man. Had surgery for torsion over ten years ago. Still a small tender area! Frequent urination on some days, clear stream and very weak. Often difficulty commencing urination and always a small dribble afterwards. In tandem I often feel pain in my lower back(left side) which(unless it is my imagination)goes away after I urinate.Could it be possible that I have an enlarged prostate? The male side of my family shows a penchant for diabetes also.",
