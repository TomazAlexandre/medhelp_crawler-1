            "answer": "If your vision checked out okay at the Eye Hospital then some things that your general physician should exclude include: diabetes, high blood pressure, anemia, heart disease, blood vessel disease especially in the neck and head (vacular disease).The eye hospital almost certainly did tests for glasses and most likely would have prescribed them if they felt it indicated.If your general physical exam doesn't disclose any helalth problems be sure to keep your follow up appointment at the Eye Hospital. Doctors can always do more tests if things don't get better or new symptoms appear. An Eye Hospital may have a neuro-ophthalmologist.\u00a0\u00a0Making difficult diagnosis is their expertise.Additionally you need to do the diet and exercise thing and get your weight and cholesterol down to healthy levels. If you try 3-4 months of diet and exercise and your cholesterol stays that high you need to discuss with your physician trying a statin or similiar medication to get your blood cholesterol down below 200.JCH MD Eye Physician & Surgeon\u00a0\u00a0 Ophthalmologist = Eye MD",

    "question": "Hi,I am 30, male, computer programmer. I've never had any problem in my eyes before, but 17 days ago my left eye got blurred and then I started getting dizzy sometimes. I went to the GP and he said it could be conjunctivitis. I applied the eyewash he prescribed for 5 days, no improvements though.Then I went to the eye hospital and they made a lot of exams (also with dilated pupil) and the doctor there said she couldn't find anything wrong in my eyes and then asked me to go back within 5 weeks time (24/08).After these exams I started felling my vision getting a bit better. But today it is more blurred than yesterday (less than in the first days though). I check this by looking in some objects at home, which are always in the same place, and see if I can read the text on them. Other test is to try to focus the computer screen with the right eye covered. I could see reasonable well yesterday, today it is worse, but still better than the first days.After going to the eye hospital I went to the GP again, and he told me I should go to optician and maybe find a pair of glasses which would make me feel more comfortable.I don't want to wear glasses before be sure what was the cause of the problem. By my experience in this period of 17 days my vision goes better some days and worse other days. Maybe (and hopefully) it can be reversible.The symptoms I feel in my left eye are:- Blurred vision (Some days better, some days worse).- Sometimes it is itching a bit;- Sometimes I have a feeling as the eyelid is a bit glued;I have high cholesterol (280) and I am over weight (Not hugely though). I also don't have a healthy diet.I always had perfect vision and now I am scared as this symptoms could be an alert for any other serious problem I have and don't know yet.P.S.: Sorry for my English, It's difficult to me to described the symptoms as my English is not so good.Regards",
