            "answer": "Hi there!A sugar level of 74 is fine. Slightly increased fluid intake/ urination may not be abnormal in children; besides, increased thirst and urination can also be caused due to dehydration, infections, etc. However since you describe an increased colour and odour, you may like to get this evaluated by her pediatrician for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management, if required.Hope this helps.Take care!",
