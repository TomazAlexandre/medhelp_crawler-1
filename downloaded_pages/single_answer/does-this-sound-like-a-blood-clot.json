            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. The symptoms could be due to superficial nerve compression (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve), that comes from the hip area and gets pinched. This condition is called meralgia paresthetica and is often due to weight gain or wearing tight clothes and belts. Losing some weight or wearing loose clothes and belts often helps relieve the pain/numbness/tingling. Also injection of lignocaine (anesthetic agent) at the site helps. In your case you can apply a pain reliever at the site. Keep a hot water bottle/heating pad while sleeping and apply a local analgesic cream.Other possibilities are vascular pathologies such as deep vein thrombosis and clots and will need a dopplar study. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme's and lupus are the other possibilities. It can also be spinal nerve compression in lower back. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "25yo male here. I've been having pain in various spots on my left leg and sometimes a general aching feeling. The spots include my inner thigh, anterior thigh just about knee, and posterior and anterior calf. My leg also feels heavy sometimes. I also have occasional numbness/tingling in my foot or anterior thigh just above my knee. I've also noticed that what I assume to be a vein bulges out from the front-middle of my calf whenever I squat down. It is just to the outside of my shin bone. It can be easily felt.I am a little overweight and the last time I worked out was almost two months ago. I rode in a plane a couple of months ago. It was around a 3 hour flight. I drive about 6 hours total (3 at a time) about every other month. I also have a sedentary job.I brought up my concern about a blood clot with my cardiologist (I have a bicuspid aortic valve), but she pretty much dismissed it saying she didn't think I had a blood clot and that it sounded more like fibromyalgia. That was almost a month ago. I am still having the pain. Right now, my leg from about my mid thigh down. I do have health anxiety, so I'm a little paranoid here.",
