            "answer": "Hello,Since you are a diabetic, you are more prone to get infections from bacteria or fungi (candida) and this may cause delayed healing also. However if you are having proteinuria with diabetes, then it can indicate deteriorating kidney function with chronic kidney disease. In that case your kidney function tests especially serum urea, creatinine and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio needs to be done.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
