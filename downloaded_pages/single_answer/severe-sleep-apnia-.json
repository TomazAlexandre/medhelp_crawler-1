            "answer": "I don't have any recommendations as far as ENT's go but I do understand how your husband feels regarding hid trach. I have had one for over 3 years now, for different reasons (live on a vent), but I felt pretty self conscious about it at first. As time went on, it did get better, I don't even think about it these days anymore...but it did take time to accept it. I hope that if he does go through with the surgery that it is a success. Good luck to the both of you. Sunny",
