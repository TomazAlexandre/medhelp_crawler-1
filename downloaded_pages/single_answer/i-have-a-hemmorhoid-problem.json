            "answer": "Hi!The only solution that will give long term benefit is to keep constipation away. Hence talk to your doctors about a change in prescription or a dose adjustment. Apart from medications, chronic constipation can be due to dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. Hence these possibilities too need to be ruled out.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
