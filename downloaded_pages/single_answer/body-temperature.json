            "answer": "Hello Donna,It depends on what you consider a low body temperature. 98.6 is considered \"normal\" but that is an average. Not everyone will be at that temperature. Mine normally runs about 97.4. When my temp is 99 I am hot and feverish. When it's below 97.4 I am chilled. Those slight variants can be \"normal\" for some ppl.Obviously exposure to cold can lower your body temperature.\u00a0\u00a0There are just a few other causes that include,\u00a0\u00a0low thyroid, diabetes or infection. Low thyroid is by far the most common of the three.Do you have other symptoms? It's always best to consult your PCP. Please let us know how you are doing.My Best to You,~Tuck",
