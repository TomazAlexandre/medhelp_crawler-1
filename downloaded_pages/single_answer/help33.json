            "answer": "Hi!I went through your post on MS Forum. Tingling and numbness in one leg is most likely to be due to an\u00a0\u00a0injury in lower back, a nerve compression in lower back, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, peripheral neuropathy as seen in diabetes or autoimmune disorders,\u00a0\u00a0low vitamin B12, an injury to leg or due to wearing tight foot wear.First rule out these possibilities before thinking of MS! Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
