            "answer": "Hi there!Well, these could be signs of a neuropathy due to nutritional deficiency or any other secondary cause such as diabetes, nerve impingement etc. Other important possibilities that need to be ruled out are muscular/ related causes, vascular insufficiency, infection, inflammations etc. In addition joint pain can also be caused by infections/ inflammations, arthritis, bursitis, tendonitis, cyst formation, dislocations, injuries to the ligaments/ tendons, bone growths/ tumours, nerve injuries etc; just to name a few. It would be best to get this evaluated by a primary care physician initially and then depending on the cause suspected/ diagnosed, a management plan can be initiated or specialist (neurologist/ orthopedician/ vascular surgeon) care may be sought.Hope this helps.Take care!",
