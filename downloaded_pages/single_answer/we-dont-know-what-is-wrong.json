            "answer": "Im a registered nurse and critical care is my speciality. First her bloodpressure can elevate due to the unrelieved pain. Also with diabetes can cause neuropathy(pain to the feet). Motrin is an antiinflammatory helps with swelling but if she has a high pain tolerance it won't touch her pain. My advice follow up with her primary md and dont give up! Save the ER visits for urgent care others you'll spend countless hours, numerous test to be told what follow up with your md.",

    "question": "My mother recently starting complaining about her chest and back hurting, then her foot started swelling and hurting and on top of that her hip started hurting. We have ruled out her heart through 4 days at the hospital and them not finding anything wrong with her. They have sent her home today with 400mg of Motrin for pain and Morphine didn't even touch her pain just made her groggy. We don't know what to do next. Oh and she also has diabetes. we don't know if that has any effect on it or not we just know that some of the medicine they gave her raised her glucose level. Her blood pressure was also high during this time and just recently came down to 172/85 which they sent her home with. HELP!!",
