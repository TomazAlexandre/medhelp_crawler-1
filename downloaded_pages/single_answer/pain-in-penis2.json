            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!This could be due to referred pain of kidney stones, genital herpes, candidiasis, cancer of penis, disorders of the foreskin or balanitis. It could also be a STD. You need to consult an urologist for this. Also rule out diabetes as this does not allow any infection to heal (like in balanitis). If you are a smoker, then you need to give up smoking.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
