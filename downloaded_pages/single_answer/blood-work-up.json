            "answer": "Hi!In lab reports often a marginal deviation from the range is marked low or high. However, in clinical practice this deviation is considered acceptable. For example the anion gap is 6, which is absolutely normal. The range is between 3 and 11 mEq/L. Similarly, sodium levels range from 135 to 145 mEq/L, so 139 is normal. Plasm osmolality varies from 275 to 295 milliosmoles per kilogram. So, 278 is normal. AG ratio varies from 1.2-1.5, and 1.1 is slightly lower value. However, whether this is low enough to cause trouble or not needs to be investigated. A persisting low value needs to be investigated primarily for malabsorption syndromes, kidney problems, diabetes etc. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I had blood work done and when I got the results I was marked low in four different catagories. Sodium level--139Anion gap--6Osmolality--278A/G ratio--1.1I was disappointed that there was not an explanation with the results. Can you help me?",
