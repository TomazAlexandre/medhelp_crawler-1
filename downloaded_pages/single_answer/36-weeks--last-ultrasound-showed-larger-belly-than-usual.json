    "question": "Im 36 weeks along, I am having a baby girl. The last ultrasound I had was last week and im due for a follow up ultrasound on the 28th of October. The Dr. said everything looked normal except for the babies belly. Im scared to what it might be since he said that it was slightly bigger than the head. I dont have gestational diabetes so im really concerned!! Any thoughts or similar experiences????",
