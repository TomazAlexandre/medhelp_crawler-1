            "answer": "Hi,You do have some mildly elevated blood sugars after you eat(the accepted normal range is up to 140) and right on the border for fasting levels. Your diastolic blood pressure is mildly elevated as well. I cannot say if you are DEFINITELY headed towards diabetes or hypertension in the future, but right now you do show some early signs of both, so 100% effort in lifestyle changes should be at the top of your list right now.Take care.",
