            "answer": "While its possible that you may have an obscure disease, common things are common, and it is more likely that you have the things I mentioned beforeOver the internet, its not possible to get clues from your history or exam that might narrow further testing for a more obscure neurological disease. Otherwise, one could order any number of tests under the sun to 'look' for a problem. Medical tests can have a significant false positive rate sometimes, and a wrong diagnosis can result in more injury than good. So any furhter testing should be guided by a detailed history and exam.I suggest you seek a second opinion, at a large center, where this could be done.Muscle wasting would likely show up within a few months of ongoing symptoms IF the muscles or its nerve supply is affected. Further Lyme testing may be useful, but the yield will be low. Further testing then may include a spinal tap, blood work for Lyme, sarcoid, inflammatory or vasculitic conditions, diabetes as I mentioned, HIV, and other viruses.\u00a0\u00a0Again the chance that any of these tests would be useful is low.Good luck",

    "question": "I had posted a question with my symptoms listed and April 7, 2005 titled Worrysome Right Sided Neurological Issues, since we are to limit this to 2 questions, here is my last question:You had given me a list of what other things it could be if my right sided problems were not neurological but assuming that they are, any ideas what they could be or what other test I should have besides the mri and emg...any obsure disease that you know of that this could be?\u00a0\u00a0Could stress cause onesided problems like my internist thinks? (not that I think I am under stress except for worrying about this)\u00a0\u00a0If I had been having these problems for the last few months, would muscle weakness have shown up on my emg this soon?\u00a0\u00a0I don't feel like I have weakness but I do have calf spasms.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?",
