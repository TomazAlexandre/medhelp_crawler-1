            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to chafing due to skin. On this cut, apply topical antibiotic cream like Neosporin and he may need oral antibiotics. Also avoid intercourse and masturbation for a few days when he takes these antibiotics. Also he should get his blood sugar levels checked as diabetes is responsible for delayed wound healing.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "About 9 months ago my boyfriend got a 1 in. cut on his penis. Every time his penis was erect, the cut would reopen so we refrained from having sex. He went to the doctor and got a special cream to heal it. About 4-5 months later the same area reopened and again, we had to stop anything that would cause his penis to be erect because it would reopen. Yesterday, the same place was rubbed the wrong way and it is very red and inflamed (however not a cut like it usually is). When he went to the doctor the first time he was STD tested but it came up negative. However, a few weeks before his first cut, he had a one-night stand with a girl who had Chlamydia. Hes not sure if she had it when he slept with her. Could it still be Chlamydia or is anyone else having this same problem? Its greatly affecting our sex life and emotionally hurting him because he 'doesn't feel like a man'. Does anyone have any suggestions or have been through this same thing that might know what it is? Thank you for any help you can give me.",
