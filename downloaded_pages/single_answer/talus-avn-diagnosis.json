            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without the relevant clinical details it would be difficult comment precisely on the situation. Non-union and AVN are common complications following talus neck fractures or could also occur if there were other risk factors present such as diabetes etc. It may present a few months following the initial injury, while the primary surgery is unlikely to be the cause. I would suggest discussing the appropriate management plan at this time with your treating orthopedician.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I fractured my R Talus neck 6/2010 at 6pm. Hospital emergency did xray, splinted and released me to find a orthopedic to do surgery on my own. 24 hours later I end up at the same hospital for surgery. 2 years later I am diagnosed with AVN after 3 surgeries to repair. I was told by a local Orthopedic that the time it too screw the bone together was the cause of developing AVN from lack of blood flow being non union. I was told by the initial surgeon I was 80% to recover cause of the clean break.",
