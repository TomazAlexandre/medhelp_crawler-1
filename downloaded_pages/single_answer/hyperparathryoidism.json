    "question": "I am a 25 year old male, I was diagnosed as being hypothyroid about 6 years ago and have since been taken off my 75 mcg synthroid dose (over 6 months ago).\u00a0\u00a0My thyroid function has been consistantly normal since but some of the symptoms I had been experiencing which caused me to question my thyroid function again have stayed.\u00a0\u00a0I have recently been experiencing the following symptoms anxiety, fatigue, aching bones, nausea, and tiredness (tiredness especially after eating).I have had the following lab results:Ionic Calcium of 1.35 mmol/L (normal upper range to 1.25 mmol/l)on a seperate day:Serum calcium of 2.57 mmol/L (normal up to 2.55 mmol/L)PTH = 3.3 pmol/L (normal range up to 6.4)Phosphorous = 1.20 mmol/l (range=0.8-1.4)Chloride = 107 mmol/l (range=98-106)Is this hyperparathyroidism? if so could this cause diabetes (or glucose intolerance). I seem to have varying symptoms from day to day and feel like I'm losing my mind.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't felt this terrible since I had a bowel obstruction and resection from my crohn's disease and my GP doesn't seem to think it is Primary hyperparathyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I seeing an endocrinologist next month.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had a Sestamibi scan that was negative.\u00a0\u00a0I have done some research and discovered that these scans aren't always reliable and actually shouldn't be used as diagnostic tools for this disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Is Hypercalcemia ever normal, even if it is this mild? I used to be a very active person but for the past year I have been getting progressively worse.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible that my hyperthyroidism (which was caused by unnecessarily being on synthroid) caused my parathyroid glands to overproduce PTH slightly?\u00a0\u00a0I know that the thyroid produces calcitonin and that this and PTH do sort of a balancing act.\u00a0\u00a0Is this possible or is it PHPT? or nothing?Thanks.",
