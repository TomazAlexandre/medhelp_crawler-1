            "answer": "I had one colonic and it did nothing.\u00a0\u00a0However, everyone I have talked to says it takes a series of them, up to 12 spaced a week or two apart, before they can do any good.On the other hand, I just spoke to my doctor and he says there are no double blind studies indicating they are effective, and he says the majority of gastroenterologists believe they are not effective.On yet another hand, I have been told that colonics in combination with acupuncture and a regimen of MMS Chlorine Dioxide can be effective for the elimination of parasites, which in turn can benefit things like diabetes.I am not a doctor so I figure this may be quackery and techno-shamanistic voodoo.\u00a0\u00a0Then again, modern medicine is little more than that anyway, and the advice you get from most doctors is tainted by their intimate connection to big pharma.My thought is, if there have been no double blind studies, and no double blind studies have been cited for the proposition that colonics are not effective, then the doctors don't really know one way or the other, and until someone does a credible study, then everyone is just whistling in the dark.",
