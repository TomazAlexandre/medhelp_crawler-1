    "question": "I've been on a strict diet since diagnosed with GD. I'm currently 34 weeks and wishing it would just end. I'm not taking these changes well. The diabetes center is pumping me with more and more insulin even when my glucose is 91 MG. My OB isn't doing much of anything. She is treating my case like a normal pregnancy and not high risk. I don't even know how big the baby is getting. All the information I've received claims that the doctors will monitor the mother and the baby weekly; in addition, preform ultrasounds to determine the size of the baby and how much amniotic fluid is in the uterus. What should I do, am I over thinking this?",
