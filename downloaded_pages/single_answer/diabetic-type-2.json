            "answer": "Have you been educated on diabetes control and management? You doctor should have provided you with written information on lifestyle changes you MUST make\u00a0\u00a0- eating a diabetic nutrition [diet], maintain proper body weight, perform daily physical exercise, maintain proper cholesterol, triglyceride and blood pressure. Diabetes will progress if you ignore just one of the aforementioned. Go to the American Diabetes Association [ADA] web site and learn about this disease and make those lifestyle changes. Do not rely on medication alone to do it for you, it is there to help you lower your glucose levels, the rest is up to you. Good luck.",
