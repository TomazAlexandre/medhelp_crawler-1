            "answer": "Hi,I understand your concern regarding your results especially with your previous history. The thyroglobulin test is primarily used as a tumor marker to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment as well as monitor for recurrence. In monitoring for cancer recurrence, change over time is more important than one particular thyroglobulin test result, hence, it is important to have serial thyroglobulin tests performed at the same laboratory. The thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) test, on the other hand,\u00a0\u00a0is usually\u00a0\u00a0ordered along with the thyroglobulin test and a positive test for\u00a0\u00a0antithyroglobulin antibodies may be due to a variety of issues also such as Graves disease, Hypothyroidism, Thyrotoxicosis, diabetes and even pregnant women and relatives of those with autoimmune thyroiditis. It is best that you discuss the results with your attending physician. Your medical history, diagnosis, symptoms and results of other diagnostic tests may need to be done. Take care and do keep us posted.",
