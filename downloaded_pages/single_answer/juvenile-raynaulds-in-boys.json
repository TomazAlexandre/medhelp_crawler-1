            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Your son could be suffering from Raynaud\u2019s. A vascular surgeon should be consulted. Alternately he could be having peripheral neuropathy due to uncontrolled diabetes. You should run blood tests to rule out diabetes.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Maybe you can seek another opinion. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My Son has Raynaud's he is now 12, it has gotten worse.\u00a0\u00a0I first went to my doctor with concerns when he was about 3 years old.\u00a0\u00a0He only gets it in his feet. The same two toes on both feet with patches would go white.\u00a0\u00a0It would take 15 minutes of rubbing them to get the circulation back.\u00a0\u00a0He would get this several times a week during the winter and occasionally during the summer even when no signs of coldness.\u00a0\u00a0 As years have gone and continue reassurance from the doctor he is fine it's Raynaud's, that happens, and\u00a0\u00a0seeing the severity of this going from not just two toes and some spotches to both feet totally white and numb to almost daily even outside in July.\u00a0\u00a0I made an appointment asking for tests and help.\u00a0\u00a0He had a Duplex Arterial Ulterasound of the lower extremities.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor called back said everything was fine.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to leave it, finely I went and got a copy of the report to assure myself.\u00a0\u00a0 The report said the ankle-brachial index is essentially normal bilaterally.\u00a0\u00a0But, also stated that this test is to show Large vessel disease and Raynauds is a small vessel disease and the word essentially did not sit well also. I do not know if I am still worring for nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Should I requesta\u00a0\u00a0certain test and what one's? If I need to ignore the primary doctor and seek a specialist and what kind?",
