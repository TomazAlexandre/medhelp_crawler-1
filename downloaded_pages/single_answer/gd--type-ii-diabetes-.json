    "question": "I have PCOS and had GD in my first pregnancy. What are my chances of\u00a0\u00a0Type II Diabetes in the future? Also, if I have another child will my chances increase more? We are a little worried as my mother in law had PCOS and after her third pregnancy her diabetes never went away. She has now been on insulin for 25 years. I am normal weight, eat well and regularly work out, so not sure what else I could do on this front. Any advise would be helpful as I cannot find any information on my situation and it may influence our decision to have a second pregnancy.This discussion is related to/posts/show/323636.",
