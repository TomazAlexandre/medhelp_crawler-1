    "question": "I have been experiencing all over joint pain and fatigue for over a year now. My doctor has done a lot of standard testing and says, based on my blood sugar levels I have pre diabetes. While I know from reading that this would account for the fatigue and general feeling of exhaustion I can't find anything that would explain the joint pain. Does anyone else out there have joint pain and stiffness all over the body associated with pre diabetes??? Any thoughts?",
