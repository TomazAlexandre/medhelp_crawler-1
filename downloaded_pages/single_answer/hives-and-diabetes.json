            "answer": "No, hives are not a typical symptom of diabetes. But even so, he needs to be seen by a doctor -- hives, loss of appetite, and thirst causing him to drink a lot and urinate a lot are signs that something is wrong. And only a doctor can run appropriate tests to find out the cause. I do wish him the very best.",
