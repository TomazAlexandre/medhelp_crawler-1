    "question": "I have type II diabetes, well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0 I had the retinal screening exam in July, and the report was...\"no problems noted\".\u00a0\u00a0But in the fall, I saw an optometrist to update my glasses.\u00a0\u00a0 She noted an early cataract in one eye, and some \"drusens\" in the other.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My primary care physician does not see any reason to refer me to an opthamologist, since the retinal report was good.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Note that I have NEVER actually had an opthamologist look in my eye.....at the -Navy hospital, a technician takes a high resolution digital image of the retina.\u00a0\u00a0 Sometime later, the retinal specialist reviews that and mails out the report.\u00a0\u00a0Since my A1c is below 7, they will only repeat this exam every 2 years.Should I be concerned at all, and should I just go out on my own and get an eye examination??Thanks for any suggestions.",
