            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Drop Foot syndrome may be attributed to a variety of factors, including many neurological diseases, paralysis of muscles, injuries to the legs or hips, drug toxicity, post-surgical infections, diabetes and tumors of the brain or spinal cord. Understanding the specific cause may help with determining the treatment options for this condition. Nerve stimulation or surgery have also\u00a0\u00a0been used in the past. If rehab did not help, you may benefit from further evaluation and second opinion from other doctors. Take care and do keep us posted.",
