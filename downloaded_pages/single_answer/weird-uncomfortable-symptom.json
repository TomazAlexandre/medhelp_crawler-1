            "answer": "Hello,These symptoms can be due to dermatitis skin. The other possibility is of parasthesia skin. Apply a mild soap like Dove or Cetaphil and some good hypoallergenic moisturizers. If the symptoms persist then get an evaluation done from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello, I am pretty uncertain what this can be. Since a couple of months ago I feel like my back and sometimes arms are sunburned, the skin feels a bit hot, but haven\u00b4t been sunburned, the skin does not look red, but it just feels incredible and uncomfortably burned. It is intermittent, have it somed days, others not, the instensity and location in my back also varies. Do not present any other symptom, just that, when I first felt it I was going through a very stressful time, but now at days, none of this is happening in my life, so I am starting to wonder if it something serious, like Fibromyalgia, Diabetes, Peripheral Neuropathy, or something else, even STD have I thought, even though I have not had unprotected sex.Does somebody have a clue as to what it can be, I live in a tropical country, always have, take meds for hypertension, am 33 years old, this feeling is sometimes unbearabel and worts, is not having a clue as to what it can be.Thank you. .",
