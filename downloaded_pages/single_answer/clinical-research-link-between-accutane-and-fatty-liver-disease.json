    "question": "Recent blood work has shown that I have mildly elevated readings of AST (80's) and ALT (90's).\u00a0\u00a0My doctor suspects fatty liver disease.\u00a0\u00a0I've never been a big drinker so nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is probably the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Upon further reading, I found that NAFLD can be caused by a slew of reasons - from being overweight, to supplements, to family history.I could stand to drop a few pounds but am not significantly overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I am active and work out regularly.\u00a0\u00a0There is no documented family history of fatty liver disease....which leads me to my question.\u00a0\u00a0I was on ACCUTANE in high school for acne (18 years ago) and remember having a slew of blood work done to monitor liver function, triglycerides, etc. back then.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any clinical or research evidence that shows a link between Accutane use early in life with a diagnosis of NAFLD later in life?",
