            "answer": "Hi!Neuropathy is a type of damage to a nerve. Palsy means weakness or absence of function of muscles due to this nerve damage. So this condition could be peripheral (peripheral neuropathy or damage of nerves other than brain and spinal cord) as seen in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s, lupus, and metal toxicities.The other possibility is that the neuropathy is central (central neuropathy). This happens due to damage of portions of neurons in brain and spinal cord. This can happen due to multiple sclerosis, ischemia in brain, stroke, tumor, benign intracranial hypertension etc.Depending on your symptoms your neurologist decides whether you have a peripheral or a central neuropathy. Further tests are then conducted to find the cause. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "I just got back from the DR. they did some tests because I have arm pain and numbness, they said its not my heart and they did these stroke tests where I put my arms up, and other tests too. They took out a lot of blood. He said I have neuropathy palsy, thats what he wrote on the discharge paper, I've been \"googling\" searching for what that is but I dont get any results, I get Carpel Tunnel Syndrome or Heridatary Neuropathy with Pressure Pulsy or something like that, I dont know if its the same as what I was diagnosed with. Does any have this condition? what is it? what are the complications? etc if anyone can give me any information I would really appreciate the help.",
