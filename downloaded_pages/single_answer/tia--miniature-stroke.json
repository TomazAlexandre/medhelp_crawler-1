            "answer": "Hi, TIA or transient ischemic attack, which as the name indicates there is a temporary lack of blood flow to a particular part of the brain. The blood flow is restored quickly and the symptoms disappear within 24 hours. For most patients with a TIA, the symptoms last less than one hour. The longer the symptoms last, the more likely that there will be permanent brain tissue injury. So, a normal CT scan does not rule out a TIA. Therapy for TIAs is focused on controlled high risk factors like diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Also, smoking is a high risk factor and should be avoided. Besides this blood thinners are given to improve blood supply to the brain. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance. Regards.",

    "question": "My girlfriend recently exhibited signs of a miniature stroke in the late afternoon. One experienced dizziness, numbness in the face, slurred speech, and some confusion/disorientation. She immediately called the hospital and the nurse on the line noted that she was slurring her speech, and that the symptoms described were similar to those of a miniature stroke. She left work and was admitted to the emergency room, where she had to wait until late evening until she was given a ct scan. It was approximately a 5 hour wait. The CT scan came back normal, she was not diagnosed with anything.After coming home and researching lasting side effects of TIA it is troubling seeing that the symptoms she exhibited are so similar to TIA, yet no treatment was provided. Much of the medical advice urges individuals that might have experienced a miniature stroke to seek treatment immediately because if left untreated, it could lead to dangerous side effects or a more major stroke in the future. The problem is that since the original ct scan came back okay, she does not have any grounds by which to receive treatment.It is not normal for somebody's face to go numb and to experience dizziness and slurred speech in the way that my girlfriend did, yet what options do we have since the doctor she went to said that she was okay?Any advice would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Kevin",
