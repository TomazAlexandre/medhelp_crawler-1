            "answer": "From the symptoms two possibilities need to be ruled out. The first possibility is of diabetes which can cause neuropathy of the bladder sphincter and hence retrogarde ejaculation. The second possibility is of any obstruction in the urethra which is causing obstruction to the ejaculate. My sincere advice would be to get your blood sugar levels evaluated and consult a urologist for further advice. An ultrasound testicles and penis can help in confirming the diagnosis.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "hello, i am a 23 year old male, and since i can remember, have had a retrograde ejaculation problem. sometimes i have complete dry orgasms, and other times very little semen comes out. i have seen a urologist, and he said my prostate was fine and my ejaculatory ducts were in tact. i am not a diabetic, and dont take any medication, actually on the contrary i am an active athlete and in pretty good shape.it has been quite frustrating, as i can not figure out why i still have this problem. i was wondering if there is medication, or surgery, or even some tips someone could give me in regards to this problem. thank you very much!",
