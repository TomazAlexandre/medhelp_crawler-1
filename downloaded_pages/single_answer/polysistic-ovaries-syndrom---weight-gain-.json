            "answer": "The metformin should help you lose weight, but you have to follow a pretty good diet, also because you run the risk of developing type II diabetes along with PCOS... I already have pre-diabetes and hypothyroidism (which you are also at risk for, if you don't already have it), so I altered my diet to eliminate as much bread and bread products (pizza, pancakes, waffles, cakes, cookies and any other products with white flour) along with anything that includes added sugar or artificial sweeteners.My meals are centered around fresh veggies (both cooked and raw), lean protein and healthy fats.\u00a0\u00a0I've gone back to full fat dairy because when they take out the fat, they add sugar and other things that aren't as good for us as the fat.\u00a0\u00a0I also eat avocados, coconut oil, olive oil, etc.After I became hypothyroid, I struggled for several years before I was finally diagnosed with pre-diabetes and my doctor put me on a low fat, low carb, ultra high protein diet and I gained and gained and gained... The diet my doctor had me on consisted of 100+ mg protein/day, about the same amount of carbs and almost no fat... Most of the protein intake was in the form of shakes/smoothies, which I began to hate within a week of starting the diet.\u00a0\u00a0I was almost always hungry and while I might full, temporarily, I was never truly satisfied.I'd been reading about low carb/high fat and while I wasn't in favor of that either, I decided to modify it, into my own diet, because there are 2 types of carbs and they usually only take simple carbs into consideration...Simple carbs are those found in breads and bread products and other processed foods, as well as sugary snacks, sodas and other things that, generally, aren't good for us.\u00a0\u00a0Those are the carbs that spike our blood sugar quickly, which in turn causes insulin to spike as well.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is called the fat storage hormone, because whatever simple carbs you eat and don't use for immediate energy, insulin shuttles off to the fat cells to store for later use and we almost never use it, because we end up taking in much more than we use.Complex carbs, on the other hand, are those found in veggies and whole grains... it's otherwise known as fiber and it, either breaks down very slowly, or it doesn't break down at all, so it doesn't cause our blood sugar to spike, which in turn, doesn't cause insulin to spike, so nothing gets carried into the fat cells... the fiber keeps you feeling fuller longer and what isn't digested gets carried out of the body as waste.Healthy fats are also important to help make us feel more satisfied when we eat and it helps keep us feeling fuller, so we aren't constantly running to the fridge looking for something to snack on, like we do when we eat something sweet or a sandwich with white bread, etc.The good thing is that you really don't have to make a lot of drastic changes all at once... small changes over a period of time will make a huge difference and you'll barely notice them, except that you'll see that they're making a difference in your weight and you'll probably notice that you feel better, as well.\u00a0\u00a0I sure did...",
