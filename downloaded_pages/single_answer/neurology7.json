            "answer": "Hi there!There is little that can be done to treat old/ chronic infarcts, while management is aimed to prevent such episodes in future. Management may include adequate control of conditions such as hypertension, diabetes etc if associated, medications that lower blood clotting capacity, physiotherapy for associated physical deformities if any etc. I would suggest s discussing the situation and the suggested management plan in detail with the treating neurologist.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
