            "answer": "Hi,I am afraid I cannot comment on effects of the anesthesia etc on the course of your mother's diabetes, especially as I do not know details of what was done.It is unlikely that a medication given one time had a lasting effect so that one year later she still has high sugars because of it. More likely, this is part of the course of your mother's diabetes.Your mother should be seen by her doctor or a specialist soon so that she can start on a regimen to bring her sugars down . Those post-meal sugars are far too high.\u00a0\u00a0We have many medicatons, including insulins, that can be tailored for her and make things alot better, so I encourage you to seek out help soon.Take care.",

    "question": "Hi,My mother has diabetes since 15 years, she is 55 now.\u00a0\u00a0It was pretty much controlled (at 130-140 post lunch), but she met with an accident in Feb last year (2007) and had to be operated for installation of a rod in her fractured arm.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, her diabetes has shot out of control.Earlier, she was taking medication (Glycomet GP2), but after the operation she was put on insulin and even a dose of 20 IU twice a day (Novolet Human Mixtard 30:70) is unable to lower the post lunch sugar levels to below 400.This has become a big concern and I seek guidance on what can be done on the same.\u00a0\u00a0Is this because of the anesthesia or other drugs given during operation?",
