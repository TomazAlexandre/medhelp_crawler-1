    "question": "Hello,I am currently 17 and was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when I was 5 years old, there is no history of diabetes in my family on my mothers or my fathers side and the disease has unfortunately started with me.\u00a0\u00a0I was also diagnosed with coeliac disease when I was 15 and 98% of the time the foods I eat are gluten and yeast free (the other 2% would be things like soy sauce)I inject insulin four times a day, lantus and actrapid before breakfast and actrapid at lunch and dinner time. I inject in my stomach or inner thighs.I am extremely sporty participating in possibly 2 hours of sport every day of the week and I participate in state levels so the issue of making sure my sugar levels don't drop while in sport is always hanging around but this sometimes causes my sugar levels to be high and stay high which in effect doesnt allow me to participate at the best of my ability which is a major problem especially in athletics.Considering I am so involved in intesive sport I have always been fairly slim and muscular and have always been happy with my body until an injury two years ago that caused me to put on approximately 10 kilos.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently 59 kilos and 164 cm and am not overweight at all but have noticed a significant aesthetic flaw in my body which causes me to feel self conscious every minute of the day especially in summer.All over my thighs, bum and stomach I have cellulite which only really shows in sunlight and it kills me because I do so much intesive activity that I know it must be due to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I havent tried creams or anything because everywhere I look in shops I can't find them.\u00a0\u00a0There has got to be some kind of cure to it, I see girls 30 kilos heavier than I am and who are completely inactive who have less cellulite.\u00a0\u00a0It makes it very difficult for me to fo about my everyday life to the point where I won't go to the beach or hang out with friends often in summer because of this problem that I feel I shouldn't have.Can anybody help me with a) the issue with sugar levels and sport and b) why i have the cellulite and any way to rid myself of it.Thank you for reading and helping me.",
