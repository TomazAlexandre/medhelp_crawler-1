    "question": "Hi, My fiance has been experiencing numbness and tingling in his hands and feet. I am posting in this forum because he has a large family history related to arthritis, and because I have no Idea what the cause is. I hope you can help me put some ideas together what they may be from.My fiance is 24 years old he a healthy weight, doesn't smoke, doesn't excessively drink and does not use drugs. What concerns me is that for the past 3 months he has been experiencing tingling and numbness sensations in his hands and feet mostly fingers and toes, but about 3 weeks ago it started to affect his entire hands and feet. this made both of us nervous and we quickly went to go see a doctor (not a fun thing with no insurance). He was diagnosed with anxiety, personally I don't feel that he was thouroughly assessed and no tests were run. He has been taking the beta blocker as the doctor prescribed, with no improvement in his symptoms.History:He has been diagnosed with ADHD and has a concave chest which decreases his lung capacity..other than that he has no other medical diagnoses. His family has a history of rheumatioid arthritis, gout, degernerative joint disease and diabetes ( I tested his blood sugar and it was within a normal range, but the doctor did not test it)current symptoms:numbness and tingling in extremitiespossible related symptoms:has had a chronic cough since he was a childcracks his neck several times a day because it feels stifftachycardia when he stands up and walks across the roomincreased saliva productionThank you",
