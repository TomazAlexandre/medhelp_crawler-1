    "question": "Got sick a year ago with respiratory infection. Hospitalized shortly after with what dr. called pneumonia. Next dr. said my heart was enlarged..did a cardiac cath..found I had diastolic dysfunction..77% ejection fraction...now mild myocardial ichemia..December I woke up to the darkest day of my life. I thought it was the worst depression could be. Diabetes Type 2..blood sugars began dropping dramatically and then along with this blood pressure and heart rate. So much chest pain. My entire body feels hot! My joints are locking up! Muscle weakness! I've lost 50 lbs this past year..no reason except being sick. Some say it's depression and that I'm getting some dementia..I'm only 57. I've got hypothyroid, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, depression, anxiety,lactose and fructose intolerance, history of biliary dyskenisia, some kidney failure and congestive heart failure. They tested me for Cushings Disease..the saliva tests came back okay. I've never smoked or drank or done any drugs. Had four kids...2 miscarriages. This pain is incredible! I can't sleep for more that 2 1/2 - 3 hrs straight. The docs around here are clueless. What kind of a doctor do I see and where would you suggest I find him?",
