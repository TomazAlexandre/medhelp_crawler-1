            "answer": "Hello,I'm a volunteer who's a long-time diabetic and not a health professional (none of us here is a physician), so please discuss what you read here with your medical team.Some of the symptoms you describe *are* consistent with diabetes ... thirst, fatigue. The pains you describe are sometimes symptoms of complications of untreated/ undiagnosed diabetes, but as a set, these could certainly be symptoms of other things.As a Coke drinker, it might seem like heresy to consider diet colas as a transition, but given your family history and your already excessive weight, it may be time to make new lifestyle choices.I have had diabetes for over 35 years and am otherwise quite healthy, so please understand that diabetes is often the most deadly when its undiagnosed and untreated.\u00a0\u00a0The longer a person's body endures excessive blood sugars and ketones, the more damage is done.\u00a0\u00a0Gaining control of things *can* reverse some forms of complications and will certainly slow the progression of others.It's not clear you have diabetes, but I urge you to contact your doctor and to anticipate the need to make lifestyle changes.\u00a0\u00a0You're a very young man.Changing how we do things as adults is very difficult and it takes courage & support.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
