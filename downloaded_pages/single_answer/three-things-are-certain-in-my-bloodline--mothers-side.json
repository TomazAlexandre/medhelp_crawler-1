    "question": "These three things are that when we turn 40, or in our 40s, we will develop glaucoma, diabetes, and low thyroid function. It never skips a beat. I have 2 of the 3, now. My thyroid has gone bad, plus glaucoma. I can fight the diabetes from getting to me if I start now. Also, I never could stand anyone whispering into my right ear and have a low tolerance for noise or light, recurrent corneal tear erosions, scoliosis, pitting edema in ankles for many years, even before I gained my wieght of 190 lbs, gallstones, offending gallbladder removed in March, have removed my own salivary gland stones from my sublingual duct on one side, there were 4 in all., and tonsil stones. Does this sound like there is a bigger picture that I'm not seeing? Is there something autoimmune going on here that I may not be aware of?",
