            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. There could be various causes for this dizziness and headaches. Have you been checked for hypo or hypertension, fluid and electrolyte disturbances, disturbed sleep and poor nutrition, anemia and micronutrient deficiencies? The abnormal spot on MRI could be non-specific; it may be due to decreased blood flow in the small blood vessels in brain particularly if you have hypertension, diabetes or high cholesterol. It can be seen in migraine headaches, which is again a vascular headache. Multiple sclerosis needs to be investigated if you have other symptoms. Your symptoms need to be correlated with clinical findings and other investigations before coming to a diagnosis. Consult a neurologist at the earliest. Wishing you all the best.",

    "question": "I am a 25 year old female. For the past three weeks I have been experiencing an awkward dizzy sort of drugged and confused feeling on a constant basis. Although, sometimes it is stronger than others. I also have fainted on 4 occasions over this time period, and have had headaches almost everyday this past week. I was referred to an ENT to see if this might be a result of an inner ear problem. He then sent me to get an MRI of both my brain and ear canal. The results came back that I don't have anything in my ear canal, but they discovered an abnormal spot on something called T2? I have been referred to a neurologist, since I was only seeing an ENT before. I would like to know if this is something that could be serious, or rather something that happens often and is common.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
