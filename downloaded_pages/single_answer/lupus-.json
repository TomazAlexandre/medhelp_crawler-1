            "answer": "Hi!To grow your hair back, the exact cause of hair loss has to be treated. If it is lupus, then it this to be kept under control. Also consult a skin specialist to check if there is another cause. Also it needs to be seen whether you have localized or generalized hair loss.Localized hair loss can be due to scarring alopecia (causing the dent, eg: discoid lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, lichen planopilaris, kerion, metastatic carcinoma, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, prolonged pressure, and cicatricial pemphigus), alopecia areata, tinea capitis (fungal infection), sarcoidosis, follicular mucinosis, bacterial infection, aplasia cutis,\u00a0\u00a0burns (including chemical burns due to shampoos, oils or something that causes an allergic reaction), herpes zoster, squamous cell carcinoma, and other such conditions. The skin of the scalp should be biopsied.Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of generalized hair loss. Iron deficiency can be due to poor intake or poor absorption or due to hidden loss from bleeding as is seen in UTI and gut problems like IBS. The cause of anemia has to be found out by various blood tests. Iron replacement along with diet rich in iron and hemoglobin should be given. Please consult a hematologist if iron deficiency is detected. Generalized hair loss can also be due to dandruff, dermatitis, shampoos, oils, soaps, dust and dirt etc. Thyroid disorders and diabetes too could be a cause. Insomnia, stress and anxiety along with poor diet and excess of caffeine too can be the cause.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
