    "question": "Respected Sir,My mom recently had Angiography and results showed that she is having a60% and 95 % blockage in the same blood vessel in her right part of theheart.So doctors have suggested Angioplasty, but some people suggested about ainsitute in Nagpur(India) named \"Cardicare\" (www.cardicareaipc.com) run by Dr. V.K. Bhagwatkar. He claims that he can cure heart blockage by some infusions(claimed to be imported from U.S), some heart exercise and diet controlplan. He also claimed that he can cure diabetes (she is diabetic paitent).So i googled about him and his treatment procedure (coz i have heard thereis no cure for diabetes)but found nothing, so i am little doubtful abouthis treatment and i want your suggestion about the reliability andauthenticity of his treatment. As i am a lot concerned for my mom. I hopei will get an experience suggestion from you as soon as possible.P.S- I have consulted some of the best cardio surgeons in Nagpur(INDIA) they said they cant suggest anything.Thanking YouPrajwal",
