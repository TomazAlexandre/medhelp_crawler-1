    "question": "My 10yr old was just put on his Lantus (already on Novolog & Humulin)and he has really bad cramps now. Can this new one cause this or could it be a combination of all 3 insulins causeing his pain? He has been a diabetic for almost 3 years & he has not complained like this before, and it started 2 days after his first doseof the Lantus. Do you know if this is one of the side affects. Thank You",
