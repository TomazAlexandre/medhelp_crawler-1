            "answer": "I would suggest you post about this in the forum for parenting. However, as for medications for bipolar for someone of that age I would say be careful. After getting a diagnosis, see if it can be worked out with talk therapy but if medication is neccessitated then do some research first. One thing that is of concern and the psychiatric community would not neccessarily disagree with this is the prescription of antipsychotics to children given the risk of tardive dyskensia and diabetes and antipsychotics are often used as mood stabilizers. I would suggest that unless there is a proven overwhelming need for medication (and again mood stabilizers unlike antipsychotics don't create tardive dyskinesia but all medications have stronger effects in a person of that young age) that behavior therapy be tried first as long as it is constructive (not aversive conditioning which is abusive) and see if that helps. But it would good to obtain advice from parents who have actually coped with this as well.",
