            "answer": "I think that you really need to be aware that just because you are going to a specialist, which I assume is an Endo, that does not mean that he will be a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Many specialize in diabetes, not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Others have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\" and only want to diagnose and medicate a hypo patient based on TSH.\u00a0\u00a0That absolutely does not work.\u00a0\u00a0TSH doesn't even correlate very well with Free T3 and Free T4 (the biologically active thyroid hormones), much less with symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Scientific studies have shown that the thyroid test that correlates best with symptoms is Free T3, while Free T4 and TSH did not correlate.Your next hurdle will be if the doctor uses \"Reference Range Endocrinology\", by which he will interpret any test result that falls within the so-called \"normal' range is adequate for you.\u00a0\u00a0That is also incorrect.\u00a0\u00a0the ranges are far too broad for that to be the case.\u00a0\u00a0Many members report that symptom relief for them required that Free T3 was adjusted into the upper third of its range, and Free T4 adjusted to around the midpoint of its range.\u00a0\u00a0When these two thyroid hormones are at that level, it is not at all unusual for the TSH to be suppressed below its range.\u00a0\u00a0In that situation, many doctors will decide that you have become hyper, even if you feel good and have no hyper symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Then they want to reduce your meds.\u00a0\u00a0Wrong again.A good thyroid doctor will treat you clinically by testing and adjusting Free T3 and Free T4 as necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0You can get some good info about clinical treatment from this link.http://hormonerestoration.com/files/ThyroidPMD.pdf",
