            "answer": "\u0003Symptoms of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the same -- excessive thirst, hunger, fatigue and unexplained weight loss after the blood sugar levels have been high for a period of time. These symptoms are caused by malfunctions of the pancreas, the organ that makes insulin available for your body in order to convert the carbohydrates you eat into energy. Your symptoms sound more like possible hypoglycemia, which is caused by an over-sensitive pancreas putting too MUCH insulin into the body in response to sugar that has been eaten. If you feel better after you eat the candy, it would appear that perhaps your blood sugar levels have dropped low and that the quick sugar fix makes you feel better by bringing those sugar levels back closer to normal. Some physicians believe that hypoglycemia can be a precursor to later type 2 diabetes, which happens when people no longer manufacture enough insulin or perhaps do not use the insulin that they do manufacture properly. In any event, testing for either diabetes or hypoglycemia is simple, and I would encourage you to see a doctor to have a glucose tolerance test. The results of this one simple test would show your doctor if you have either diabetes or hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can be deadly if it happens while you are driving a car, and there are dietary restrictions that can prevent it or control it.",
