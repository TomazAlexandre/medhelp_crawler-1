            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. There are several types of neuropathy, but without being able to examine you in details I can not provide a precise diagnosis. Most common form is a peripheral neuropathy and occurred by deterioration in the nerve function at the limbs. It represents with symptoms of loss of sensation (or pins and needles like) in the arms, hands, legs and feet. Since there are many causes of neuropathy, hence treatment involves seeking these conditions out and correcting any underlying problem such as poor sugar control in diabetes in order to get a relief in your symptoms. Unfortunately, there is no permanent cure of neuropathy but symptomatic relief can be provided. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I have a problem that is driving me crazy trying to get to sleep...I am tired.. I Go to bed. Dose off for seconds then immediately woken up by a tingling shocking Joy buzzer feeling in a small area bottom center of right foot only..Causes a twitch and my leg jumps because it almost feels like a tickle. Again it only happens at the exact time that I dose off and it keeps me awake for hours until I actually pass out. .Doc says nuropothy because I also have ankle and leg pain at rest mostly. Pulses seem to be good in both feet he said, so he doesn't think it is clogged arterys in legs or anything like that. I used to take\u00a0\u00a0quinine but I guess it was off the market but that helped the leg pain ..I now take take carbidopa 25mg/levodopa100mg. Not helping the pain or shocks.. I came up with tieing a belt around the foot and keeping pressure on the nerve spot where the shock seems to be firing off and that helped for a while but thats failing also. I didn't make it so tight as to not cut off circulation to my foot, Doc also said it may be nerve damaged and I thought it might have been from playing drums. Its my bass drum foot ..Any help please. I am so tired I want to shoot myself in the foot some nights..I probably only slept 6 hours in the last 3 nights,,Thanks",
