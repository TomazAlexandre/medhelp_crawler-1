            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Well, if you do not feel the symptoms when your mind is diverted, then the symptoms could be related to anxiety. Also, since you have numbness and jitters, it is important to rule out vitamin D and B12 deficiency, electrolyte imbalance, diabetes, thyroid and parathyroid problems and liver and kidney problems. Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Ever since I was young I've had anxiety, small bouts of depression, IBS, and people notice when they shake my hand that my hand jitters. I've always walked toe to heel (you're supposed to walk heel to toe I hear), and I sometimes sit on my tailbone area.A few weeks ago I noticed my legs would occasionally feel numb, but it came and went. Then last week I had a bad sinus attack where I was blowing my nose hard for 15 minutes straight. A few days later I ended up feeling very dizzy, unsteady, unbalanced...like as if I'm floating.I went to the doctor (urgent care center) and got a bunch of tests: EKG, blood sugar, blood pressure sitting/standing/laying down, balance test, blood tests, urinalysis and so far everything came back good. The doctor said I got vertigo, and parasthesias for my legs...and then referred me to a primary care doctor. The next day I went and the doc did the same tests and found no problems and said she agrees that its vertigo and parasthesias.I come from a very healthy family with no history of tumors, MS, strokes, diseases...and I eat mostly organic and gluten free. I do admit I sit all day at work, and I havent been to the gym in weeks (I usually go every 2 days). Does this all sound legit to you? Doctors can make mistakes like anyone else, but im wondering if it could be another cause or what? Do people with vertigo usually feel like theyre floating, and numbness in their legs? I notice when I dont think about it, I dont feel it...maybe just anxiety?",
