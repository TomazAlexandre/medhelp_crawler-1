            "answer": "Hello,I cannot confirm anything without examination\u00a0\u00a0but it can be stasis dermatitis, erythema nodosum or venous ulcers. Erythema nodosum results in reddish, painful, tender lumps most commonly located in the front of the legs below the knees.Diagnosis is by physical examination and biopsy of the lesion.Other lab investigations like complete blood count, ESR,ASO titer, urinalysis, throat culture, intradermal tuberculin test, and chest x-ray may also be done.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
