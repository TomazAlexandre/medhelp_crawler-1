            "answer": "Hello!Bronchial asthma causes tachycardia and with control of your respiratory symptoms you would control your heart rate.It is very important to take proper medications for dilating your air ways and also to avoid all allergens which trigger your asthma.I would suggest you to continue cardio as in treadmill, cross trainer, skipping, jogging and running regularly for 45 minutes.I would also suggest you to follow up with a physician regularly and plan a diet chart with the help of a dietician.Take care!",
