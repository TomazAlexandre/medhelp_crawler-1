    "question": "Hi, its difficult to know where to start!! well.... when I was around 15/16 yearsof age I started to get problems with my glands (lymph nodes) in my neck, raising up frequently- several times a month. particularly bad if I had a late night or missed breakfast, up they would rise. Had multipal infections all through my teens until now. Tonsilitus/throatv infections etc. I have been tested six times for glandualar fever (mono) and one doctor mentioned epstein Barr but did no further tests.\u00a0\u00a0over the last two years I have found it increasingly difficult to 'get over' infections and almost feel as if I have a permanent one. last year I went to see my docoter very distressed as I felt so depressed about always feeling ill. On examination I had a nasty infection in the paratoid gland (nr the ear) He gave me medication but I had an allergic reaction to it - halluncinations etc. He gave me new medication but it took me another week to start feeling 'normalish' again but still weak and tired. I went back to work for one day and I was so weak and tired I spent the whole day crying and went home early. The next day I found I couldnt get out of bed, I would start crying. my body felt like it had 'shutdown' and I was feeling depressed. Went to the doctor and she said the infection was nasty, to take more rest. I explained how low I was feeling but she gave me vitamins and told me 'I would be fine.' Since then I have been really struggling with my glands/fatigue/sweating/poor sleep etc. Doctor did more tests, ESR levels raised 11-13 but not too high, thryroid negative, diabetes negative,\u00a0\u00a0cushings disease negative. They are still baffled as to whats wrong with me and as the months roll by the fatigue is really affecting my work and my galnds now 'come up' on a weekly basis even after 8-10 hrs sleep and a healthy lifestyle. I have moved to london and started seeing a new doctor, he is going to test my thyroid again and seems convinced this is the problem. help!! i feel like Im going crazy and need to get to the bottom of this!!",
