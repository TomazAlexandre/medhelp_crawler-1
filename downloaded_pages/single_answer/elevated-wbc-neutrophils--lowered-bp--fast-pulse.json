            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Chances are that you are suffering from EBV or mono or glandular fever. This causes recurring throat infections, flu like symptoms, malaise, body ache etc. There are special tests to detect EBV in your system. Talk to your doctor about it.The other possibility is lymphomas or leukemias. Your hematologist will help with this.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,I got my latest cbc results back. WBC : 12.3(high), & Neutrophils: 8.6(high). Although they aren't extremely high, I've been feeling awful for a few months. Been tested for thyroid, diabetes, strep, all neg. I had another cbc done today. I've had swollen glands, low back pain, sharp, stabbing, & burning, tingly type pains throughout my body, sore throat for quite some time now. I get a sore type feeling under my ribs on both sides/left breast when I cough. I haven't lost any weight & have an appetite. Another thing is I was told I have HBP a couple months ago, & today it was only 118/76, with a fast pulse of 108.(not taking HBP med.,or any other med.) The Dr. wants me to see a Hemotologist if my count from today is still elevated- I'll know the results by the end of the week. I also feel weak/fatigued, & achey alot throughout my body.\u00a0\u00a0I'm in some sort of pain daily, & sometimes it changes locations & severity, but always there. I've had alot of colds in the last few months too. I hardly ever used to get sick! I'm 38, female. Any imput or ideas are appreciated. I'm really getting worried, as I was always healthy!",
