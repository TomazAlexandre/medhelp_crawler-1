    "question": "I have seen my optometrist 5 times in the last 3 months. She has tried multiple RX's and NONE of them work.Every pair of glasses is still blurry. Every three weeks when I go back, my vision has changed. She says my refraction changes? I have to wear bi-focal also. My eyes are tired, dry, strained, blurry, and I cannot see at night to drive now. My eyes feel so tired and hurt because I have to strain to see.\u00a0\u00a0Who could help me, what kind of specialist? She said it was hard to find the \"center\" when measuring my eyes for glasses. I do have an astigmatism as well. I have to wear 250 cheaters for up close and I just suffer the blur and strain for far vision.Why does my RX change so often? What can be done? Who can I see?",
