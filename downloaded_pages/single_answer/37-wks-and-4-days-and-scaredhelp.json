I am 37weeks 5days and I am also being induced because of preclamsia and have to limit my salt intake... which I dont always stick to either.. Right now at 37 weeks we are considered to be term and our babies would be fine if they were born today!! Just calm down ..

    "question": "Ok so here's my situation...i'm 37 wks and 4 days and tomorrow i'm going to go see my OB and she is scheduling me to be induced because of Gestational Diabetes and its really high.I'm getting really nervous (and i've been reading online about inducing and everything, sometimes not a good idea) and they say that a woman with Gestational Diabetes during labour and delivery it can cause Stillbirth..well i FREAKED when i saw this. I am on isulin but for example, like today i wanted some candy and i had a few pieces...does anyone know if having too much sugar can actually kill the baby??? I felt like crying when i read this....My hands are very tingling and very swollen due to the diabetes...i go for a non stress test every week and so far everything came back ok. Sometimes the baby moves a lot and sometimes barely nothing, but the nurse also said that since its coming down to the last few weeks there isn't hardly any room in there....can someone help? By me eating candy can this actually kill the baby or cause a stillbirth? I'm so worried, i should have never starting reading all this ****....SOMEONE PLEASE HELP.",
