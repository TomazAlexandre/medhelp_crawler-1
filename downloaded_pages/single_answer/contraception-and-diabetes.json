            "answer": "HI,Temporary methods of contraception can be a matter of personal choice. IUD can stay effective for longer and do not require daily monitoring like pills. Also pills need to be taken daily and if forgotten, there is a risk of pregnancy. Also pills are associated with side effects. Condoms can prevent STD\u2019s. Hence the method best suitable for you can be decided after consultation with your Doctor.Hope this helps.",
