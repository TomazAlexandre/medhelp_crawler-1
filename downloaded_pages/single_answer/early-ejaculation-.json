            "answer": "Hi there!While it is normal for the penis to return to a flaccid state after ejaculation; premature ejaculation could develop due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in adolescents in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. You could try being relaxed and working on the psychological factors. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work; I would suggest seeing your primary care physician for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",
