            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Unintentional and unexplained weight loss is definitely not good. There are many causes like worms in stool, depression, anorexia nervosa, AIDS, cancers especially colon cancers, drug abuse, infections and loss of appetite. Loss of appetite can again be due to certain medications, drug abuse, depression, AIDS, acute and chronic infections, cancers and hypothyroidism. Either you do not eat well or there is increased metabolism as in hyperthyroid states, HIV, cancer etc. Poor absorption as in irritable bowel syndromes and malabsorption syndromes too is possible. Malabsorption syndromes are seen in intestinal tuberculosis, HIV, tropical sprue, parasites in stool and Whipple\u2019s Disease. Diabetes too can be the cause.Get your HIV and HPV status rechecked and check for viral load and concomitant Hepatitis C infection.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "I went to my doctor regarding unexpected weight loss and mentioned I feel like I'm losing muscle or bone. Odd, but its hard to explain. Stool results and thyroid tests proved normal.I have noticed that I feel and see my bone and tendons more so than before. The girth of my wrist has gotten smaller and when I place my hand on my wrist, I can literally push in between the bone.When I stretch, it feels like I am not stretching or burning anything. When I stretch my arm, the bone in the back that sticks out seems smaller.Overall, I feel weak and like whatever I eat I am not absorbing. Again, tests proved otherwise.I am male, 22yr 5'11 175 hiv+ (undetected, meds Norvir, Truvada, Reyetaz), hpv+.",
