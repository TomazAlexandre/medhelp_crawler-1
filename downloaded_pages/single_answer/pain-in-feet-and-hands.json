    "question": "My whole life I have always had sharp pains in my feet and hands, which come out of no where and last at most .5-1 second. They are so sharp at times I almost loose my stomach, and strangely always assumed it was normal and just due to nerves miss firing etc. Figuring this happened to everyone, because they happen very rarely (once a month to once a week). I asked my doctor in passing about these pains and was told they are not normal, more so due to the severity of the pain level and to monitor whether they start to happen more frequently.The last two times these pains occurred, they lasted for almost 30 minutes. Once in the middle of the night waking me up and moving from my finger tips all the way to my elbow, and the next time isolated to only the large part of the thumb muscle on my palm. I was not explained what could be wrong and am now concerned because the pain duration, the last two, has lengthened.",
