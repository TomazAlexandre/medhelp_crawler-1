            "answer": "Hi, calcification of blood vessels may not be hereditary. Calcification of vessels occurs in the elderly. The commonest causes for calcification are diabetes, hypertension,\u00a0\u00a0atherosclerosis and kidney disease. The treatment is aimed at the cause. Controlling diabetes and hypertension and following good lifestyle measures can help control calcification. Regular exercise and avoiding fatty foods can help to increase the flow through the calcified arteries. Check with your doctor to rule out the risk factors. Regards.",
