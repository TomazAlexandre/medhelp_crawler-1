            "answer": "Hi!In all probability you have a combination of trigeminal neuralgia along with upper cervical spinal nerve compression. Since your gum pain is responding to gabapentin, ask your doctor if a multivitamin or another medication can be added to completely remove the ache. NCV and EMG can be done. You could also do neck exercises and see if it helps. Also, diabetes, hypothyroidism, lupus and other connective tissue disorders may also need to be looked into. Please discuss with your treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
