            "answer": "You should see an reproductive endocrinologist again because if you have not had recent blood tests including a 2hr glucose tolerance test with a 75 gram glucose challenge, I would recommend it.The following is information from my website:PCOS can affect 5% of all women and common symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, increased growth of hair on the body, loss of hair on the head, acne, and weight gain. Based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM sponsored Consensus Workshop Group, PCOS is diagnosed in women who meet two of the three following criteria: ovarian dysfunction (not ovulating regularly), hyperandrogenism (increased male type hormones on lab testing or clinically increased hair growth), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries which show multiple small cysts on ultrasound). PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose toleranceI would suggest that you see a reproductive endocrinologist who specializes in treating women with PCOS.",

    "question": "I have the classic symptoms of PCOS, except that a few years ago, I went up several cup sizes and I now have a slightly cloudy discharge from both breasts when pressed.\u00a0\u00a0It is easier to express the discharge when my nipples turn a purple color, but it isn't quite spontaneous.I had multiple blood tests for androgens, prolactin, cortisol, etc. All came back normal, though I didn't see my numbers.\u00a0\u00a0I also had an abdominal CT scan which came back normal as well.At first, I was told something was wrong, but my regular doctor couldn't figure it out.\u00a0\u00a0I saw an endocrinologist, who after ruling out Cushing's said my problem wasn't an endocrine problem.My regular doctor didn't know what to do from there, and I'm a little at a loss.\u00a0\u00a0 I find it a little hard to believe that all of the symptoms are idiopathic.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, my doctor said that whatever is causing all of this there isn't a test.",
