            "answer": "Hi,From what I have read, SSRIs as a group are thought to potentially improve insulin sensitivity and even insulin secretion, so there should be other options for you to try. I do suggest speaking at length with your doctors about switching from an antidepressant that has been very effective for you. If you can keep your blood sugars controlled with an acceptable medical regimen and stay on the lexapro, consider that as an alternative to switching.TCAs are thought to potentially raise blood sugars, so keep that in mind too.As always, it is best to speak with your doctors who know you best...Take care.",
