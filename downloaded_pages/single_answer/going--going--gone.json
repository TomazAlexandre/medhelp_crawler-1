    "question": "When I was 40, after my third child, I had a vasectomy. By the time I reached 50, I could no longer get an erection and my sex drive was deminishing. Now, there is none or very little and my production of semen is almost non exsistant. To complicate matters, I was overweight although now I have lost much of it, and I have High Blood pressure and diabetes. Thru medication and diet my sugaar is normal and my BP is fine, but not until some damage to my body has occured. I had retinopathy ib both eyes last November and I am recovering from an amputation of a toe thos past June. I also have neuropathy in my legs and spinal stenosis.I take the following medication\u00a0\u00a0Janeuvia, Glipizide and Lantis (injections) for my sugar amd Torrol, Avalide for my blood pressure.Now I am going to mention this to my doctor this month, but I assume that with drugs like Viagra and Cialis, you have to have some erection but with the retinopathy in my eyes, I doubt that even if they could help, I would be given tjat option.Now since my kids have grown up and I am single due to the death of my wife, I have the chance to date but I am getting down over the reality that I can no longer function normaly or somewhat normaly.To complicate matters, I even tried vacuium therapy and as a result, I could use a commercial vacuum\u00a0\u00a0with a 20 hp motor and even that couldn't breath any life into the thing.Any ideas as to what I can do or any idea of what questions to ask my doctor. I realize that everything I am doing is to improve my quality of life, but this is going to be a big problem.Thanks",
