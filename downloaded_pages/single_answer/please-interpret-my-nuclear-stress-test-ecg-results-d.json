            "answer": "Hi Roxanne,#5 in your report suggests one of two things; either you have an area in your heart that is not receiving blood flow (from scar from a prior small heart attack or a severely blocked artery) or it is what we call a \"false positive\" from attenuation.\u00a0\u00a0Attenuation refers to the imaging modality for the stress test being unable to pick up a signal in that area of concern secondary to breast tissue, the diaphragm being elevated, or fatty tissue.\u00a0\u00a0If you have never had any heart disease, no prior symptoms of a heart attack, and no other cardiac history and you are an obese female, then it is most likely attenuation causing the study to appear that way.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot say with any absolute certainty without seeing your scan myself, but I would suggest you discuss with the cardiologist to see if you need a heart catheterization prior to your next surgery (which is often required for women your age).",
