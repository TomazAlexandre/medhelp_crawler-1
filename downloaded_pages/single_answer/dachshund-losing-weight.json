    "question": "I have a short haired dachshund that we adopted over a year ago. His age was unknown, but he looks to be grown, but fairly young. He has done really well, and I try to feed the best foods.\u00a0\u00a0Within the past two months he has taken to drinking a huge amount of water (about a gallon a day) and eats well, but has lost an awful lot of weight. He was really really heavy before, but now his ribs are visible.He runs around and looks happy and healthy except for the weight loss. I am wondering if it is diabetes or something worse.",
