    "question": "I have recently been diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis after two miscarriages and their followup blood work. My TSH levels were at 5.047 (range .45-4.5) and my Thyroid Peroxidas Antibodies were at 1272 (range 0-34)\u00a0\u00a0I was sent in for a thyroid ultrasound which came back: There are two hypoechoic nodules in the right thyroid isthmus 6x4x3 and 5x3x3mm.\u00a0\u00a0Small calcification in right thyroid lobe and a hypoechoic nodules measuring 2mm. Thyroid isthmus measures 3mm.\u00a0\u00a0I was told to follow up in 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0I know that they nodules are not considered large but I was concerned because of the hypoechoic nature as well as the calcification.\u00a0\u00a0I have been extremely tired with forgetfulness, slight weight gain as well as a fullness and sometimes soar feeling in my throat making it harder to swallow at times.\u00a0\u00a0About a year ago I had several episodes of dizziness and passing out.\u00a0\u00a0I was told then that I had low blood pressure with low resting heart rate followed by much higher heart rate upon standing.After being diagnosed with hashimoto's I brought up these episodes and was told they were probably the early stages of this disease presenting itself.\u00a0\u00a0I know they would have sent me in if they thought the nodules may be suspicious for cancer but I wanted to find out a little more information if I could about my situation.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot get into an endocrinologist until the end of February and I am concerned.\u00a0\u00a0My family has a long history of thyroid conditions as well as diabetes ext. My husband and I would really like to start trying to conceive again but I would like to get this figured out first because we have already suffered two miscarriages.\u00a0\u00a0If you could give me any advice/info on my specific situation that would be a great help, or if I am just paranoid.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your time!",
