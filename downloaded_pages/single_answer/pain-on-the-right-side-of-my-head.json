What kind of symptoms come with them?My general rule of thumb is that if you're concerned, you should contact your doc and let them know what is happening. As you have diabetes and high blood pressure, I would *definitely* recommend that you see a doc sooner rather than later to get things checked out.Good luck and keep us posted,~Dame",
