            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.It\u2019s unlikely that your symptoms of back pain are related to asthma, though constant cough or wheezing can cause chest pain. The symptoms mentioned could be caused by cervical spondylosis. Some metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders are known to simulate these symptoms. Please consult your primary care physician who will carry out blood tests and x rays to rule out these conditions. You seem to be very anxious and in pain, take OTC pain medications like Tylenol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. Try applying local analgesic creams. Place ice over the painful area every 1-2hrs for pain relief.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
