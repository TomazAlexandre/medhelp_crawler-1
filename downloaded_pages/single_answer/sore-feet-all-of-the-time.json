            "answer": "Hello!Try all conservative treatment. It is appropriate time to wear custom orthotics to reduce any pressure on your feet.Get yourself examined by an orthopedician and go for MRI scans to rule out any stress fractures or soft tissue tears or sprains.For non specific pain it is appropriate to see a neurologist. Also rule out other medical conditions such as diabetes, thyroid disorders and any peripheral vascular disorders.Take care!",
