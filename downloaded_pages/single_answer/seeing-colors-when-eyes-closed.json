    "question": "Lately if I decide to snooze during the day (doesn't happen at night) and I lie on the couch, just before I go to sleep I am jolted awake by a field of color (red or green so far) while my eyes are CLOSED.\u00a0\u00a0It is suddenly and scary.\u00a0\u00a0My recent history:\u00a0\u00a0just began insulin for diabetes, just had two cataract surgeries (had floaters and flashes for awhile, but not now), had right ear surgery several years ago (to remove huge amt of scar tissue which came back), then same doc cleaned out right ear two months ago so I could hear a bit better, so I now get whooshing sounds in my head (no ringing) and wonder if there is a connection between that sound and the color flashes when eyes closed.\u00a0\u00a0Both make me feel weird, to say the least.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I am going to have a stroke.",
