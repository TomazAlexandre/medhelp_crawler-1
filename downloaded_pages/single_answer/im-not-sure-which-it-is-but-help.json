[More] ith me or causing life-interrupting pain. ive always been skinny no matter how much i eat and work out, i have many bone/joint problems such as a bone spur/cyst in my right shoulder that wreaks havoc on me daily. and im sure my left one is catching up as much as i baby my right, in 2004 i was in the army and broke my pelvis and shatterd my kneecaps. after which i found out alot of really wrong things both from a letter and in the hospital after i lost my mind and tried to kill my battle-buddy. the letter stuff was the normal girlfriend leaving u and taking all your stuff and totaling your truck kinda thing. it sounds bad but its happens to alot of guys in the military. but when they put me in the hospital they told me i had a thyroid disorder that i need to keep an eye on (never been checked since, cant afford doctors thats why im here) i had diphtheria, pneumonia, and a cartilage disorder to where i have no fluids in my joints. and a borderline personality disorder. i dont think thats a bad one but it\u00a0\u00a0 flares up now and then. after being told all these things and after countless blood tests they just sent me home, no medical help, no money, no nothing. i got screwed. royaly.but right now im always thirsty, always tired, always hungry or never hungry. i fill up and still dont feel like i ate anything. i pee alot. a whole lot. and not just like trickles but enough to fill up a coke bottle like every half hour. i cant sleep. or i dont wake up. ive had jock itch from when i was an air condition repair man for almost 7 months. it wont go away ive done everything. my teeth are litteraly falling out of my head, my vision has been blurred with little floating dots for weeks. bright lights hurt. ive lost all hearing in my right ear my back and joints are always sore. my feet and hands are always frezzing cold. my normal body temp is from 96.5 to 97.8. im literally burned out. help me please.",
