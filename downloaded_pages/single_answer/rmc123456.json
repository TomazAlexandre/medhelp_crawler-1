            "answer": "Hi!Erectile dysfunction is the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance. Generally if there is any problem in the normal physiology of erection it can result in failure of erection, weak erection or early loss of erection. Many causes are there of which diabetes and low testosterone are the most important. Hence these should be eliminated first along with varicoceles. Other causes are stress and anxiety, depression,\u00a0\u00a0unrealistic sexual expectations making sex/masturbation a task rather than a pleasure, and fear of non performance based on previous experience. Smoking, alcohol, and illicit drugs can also be a cause.Try to watch movies that stimulate you, or create an environment around you that stimulates you and pamper yourself and enjoy. If all this does not help, do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
