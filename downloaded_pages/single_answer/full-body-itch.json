            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin without any rash can be due to dermatitis, hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods.Apart from antihistaminics and steroids, she should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch. Lastly, Phototherapy can also be tried.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hi, I was reading through the forums trying to locate an answer for my wife's very unusual skin itch.\u00a0\u00a0I found something from 2008, but no actual diagnosis.My wife has had it for about a week now, no marks, no rash, no bumps.\u00a0\u00a0Smooth skin, but an unbearable itching everywhere but the face and feet.\u00a0\u00a0We have used every anti-itch cream, Gold Bond, etc.\u00a0\u00a0They give only momentary relief for mins, then the itching starts again.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't matter what we try, absolutely nothing is working.As I mentioned, in the forum I was reading, their doctor prescribed steroid creams, as did ours.\u00a0\u00a0It didn't work for them, nor has it worked for my wife.Has someone heard of this before or does anyone else have similar symptoms that they found a solution for?Thanks.",
