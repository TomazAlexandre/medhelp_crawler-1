            "answer": "Sorry. there are no blood tests nor brain scans for autism.\u00a0\u00a0 It takes observation over a period of time.\u00a0\u00a0At 21 months there is not much time to be observed.\u00a0\u00a0For my daughter a diagnosis gradually unfolded.\u00a0\u00a0The behavior patterns need to be consistant over a period of time.If you and professionals see some develomental problems you can address this with therepy to get something done.\u00a0\u00a0 With diabetes, you can take a blood sample and compare to a normal range and say with some certainty with just one test bam. What they do is observe behavior\u00a0\u00a0over a peroiod of time\u00a0\u00a0and compare to a normal range when the normal range keeps changing as well with society expecttions.\u00a0\u00a0This is not as easy as it looks.As of yet brain scans of a few samples of persons with autism differ from persons without autsm.\u00a0\u00a0But. the is based on limited sample sizes and is still in development.\u00a0\u00a0Some genetic differences have been found for SOME persons with autsm but not all.As soon as children are born, we test for PKU because we see absense of certain enzymes bam.\u00a0\u00a0We can also see downs syndrome easily.Autism takes time to unfold and reveal itself.\u00a0\u00a0Cogngitive delay is currently the best they can do at thois point in time. The good news is that the early intervention has a lot in common with similar GROUPS of developmental disorders.\u00a0\u00a0This means that you are doing the right thing with speech and instruction.\u00a0\u00a0If se had an exact dx of autism at 21 months, I don't think this will change the therepy in any way.Now as she gets older, say, 4 or 5 years, this is when treatments and therepies start to change a little.",

    "question": "I have a problem for one week now with my 21 month year old daughter. SHe has been tantruming every night for one week someti,mes for hours for no reason. It gets to the point where she is so tired so the tantrums get worse but we dont know what to do becuase she doesnt even want us to look at her and when we do she gets so much more upset. She is about to be tested and evaluated for autism as she has been already screened and evalutated by early intervention. Currenlty she has screened as showing signs of autism however she has to be high funtioning as she plays and has good eye contact (expect when tantruming or going into that state of dont bother with me). She is currently receivng speech and special instructin therapy becuse of her langauge and cogntive delay. Can someone plese tell me if these are behaviors common associated with autism?I am pretty stressed out as the these test will be a duration of two months and I cant figure out what is going on with her. She seems so smart sometimes and now she is showing some imaginitavie play too.",
