    "question": "I am a 48 yr old female diagnosed with diabetes type 2 on 7/16/08, I am on oral medications.\u00a0\u00a0I was sitting on my bed playing my game when I felt my chest flutter 3 times, when it first happened I thought I was going to throw up and I got light headed.\u00a0\u00a0As fast as it came, it went away, I was just puzzled as to what could have made that happen?\u00a0\u00a0I didnt do any excertive exercises today prior to that happening so it just kinda took me by surprise. There was no sweating, chest or anything radiating down my left side.\u00a0\u00a0Could you please give me a clue as to what it could be? My husband says it sounds like Angina. I have been short breathed for a couple of days.Thank You",
