            "answer": "Hello,Since this itchy feeling occurs after showering, it can be due to contact dermatitis to any of the toiletries or cosmetic products after showering or due to dry skin. Try using hypoallergenic products and wear cotton clothes. Also since you are having eczema, apply hypoallergenic non perfumed moisturizer immediately after bathing and patting dry.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a dermatologist for evaluation.Hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I'm a teenager (14 years old)--I have eczema asthma and diabetes. In the last year my eczema has been much worse then in the past--it also seams to be triggered by getting wet (e.g. taking a shower or sweating).In the last month or so I've been having a strange issue--it often feels like I get a small \"bite\" and then the spot itches for second and then stops. I've been getting this A LOT recently probably a couple times per minute.They are all over my body (no concentration anywhere). My only theory's are something having to do with oil (due to puberty) or something having to do with sweat glands since my eczema is often triggered by sweating.I really want to know what this is as its getting to be very, very annoying!!",
