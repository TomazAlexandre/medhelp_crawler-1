            "answer": "Hello,UTI is urinary tract infection and no gender is spared. The cause of most UTIs is bacteria that initially settle (colonise) around the urethra (urine tube), and then ascend into the rest of the urinary tract. Factors that can cause this to happen include incomplete urinary emptying, hygiene of the urethra, urethra narrowing, bladder reflux disease (usually due to leaky valves between the bladder and ureter tubes that connect to the kidneys and diabetes etc. Drinking adequate amounts of water and fluids can help in relieving the symptoms of UTI.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi, I thought I had a uti because ive had one before and i had symptoms very similar to what i had been feeling a couple days ago...the urge to pee but very little comes out, burning after urination.\u00a0\u00a0that went on for about 2 days and i was sure it was a uti and planned on calling the doctor the next day, but when i woke up i was completely fine...and all symptoms gone.Can a uti cure itself? or could it have spread to my bladder/kidneys and the burning symptoms disappeared? Today (a day after the symptoms disappeared) i have felt fatigued and nauseas...but i also just got my period so that is a factor...but i normally dont feel this fatigued and sick on a period. what should i do?",
