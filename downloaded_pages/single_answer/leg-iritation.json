            "answer": "Hi! The leg going to sleep feeling can be due to DVT or deep vein thrombosis and clots. This is best diagnosed by duplex ultrasound (color dopplar) or by angiogram. It can also be felt post unaccustomed exercise due to muscle strain. It can also be due to pinched spinal nerves in the lumbo-sacral area or a pinched nerve at the knee joint. A nerve conduction study should be done. A MRI of the lumbar spine should also be able to throw some light. At times it is also due to low sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium in the body. Hence serum levels of these electrolytes should also be checked. Dehydration is another frequent cause.Vit B12 deficiency, peripheral neuropathy of diabetes, hypothyroidism or lupus Lymes, poor circulation are other possibilities.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
