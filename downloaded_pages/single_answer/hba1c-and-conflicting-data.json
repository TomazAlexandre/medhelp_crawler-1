Y Ou need to look t your diet and reduce the sweets and carbs. Maybe you can replace the sweets with things like nuts (not covered in sugar), or small amounts of fruit.you can test your blood sugar after eating a meal (1 1/2 hours).\u00a0\u00a0If your blood sugar is < 120 then\u00a0\u00a0you know that the foods you just ate were suitable.\u00a0\u00a0If your blood sugar is high, then you know you need to change what you ate (reducing carbs / sugars - increasing protein / healthy fats).Exercise for 30 minutes after eating may help control blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0You p probably should consider discussing with your dr about taking metformin.\u00a0\u00a0Further, given your age and normal weight, your dr should keep a fairly close eye on things and if things progress, you could consider insulin or oral meds..",

    "question": "Hi Folks,I am 37, Indian -\u00a0\u00a0non smoker and a very rare drinker. I am 177 cms in height and 84 Kgs in weight. No heredity for diabetes. Normal kidney function and liver enzymes. Very, very high triglicerides (600) (heredity) - normal Cholesterol and LDL, but very low HDL.I am a diagnosed hypertensive - on Telmisartan since the past 4 years - controlled BP of 140/85 - have recently started Rosuvastatin 20 mg/day for my triglycerides.I tend to skip lunch (for weight control) - and have a sweet tooth. On a recent fitness test, I tested 97 on FBS. Since this was on the higher end of the spectrum for (up to 100 is OK) - I tested a couple of times later including FBS, PP and HBA1c. The results are rather conflicting and are worrying me. It'd be nice if the community at Medhelp could, well, help.20.05.15 FBS 9701.06.15 FBS 10310.06.15 FBS 118 and PP (after 1 hour) - 17510.06.15 HBA1C - 5.3 mg/dlMy last physical was 4 years back with FBS of 102.1. Am I pre-diabetic2. Do I need to use another lab for HBA1C - the one I use is very reputed and conforms to level 2 standards for HBA1C3. What next do I do to avoid Type II?",
