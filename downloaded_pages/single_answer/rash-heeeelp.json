            "answer": "Hello,Since the itchy rash has been present for so long and moreover associated with swollen lymph nodes, so it needs to be evaluated. It can be due to atopic dermatitis, eczema, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps and cosmetics.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch. Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I'm a female of 19 years of age. I've had a rash all over my body for seven months now and I just don't know what to do. I first went to my general physician and she looked at my rash and thought that I had scabies so she treated me for that but just in case I was allergic to something she also gave me steroid cream to apply to the affected areas. Three months passed and the rash was still there so I decided to go to a dermatologist. She gave me halobetasol cream and took two biopsies and said that they were \"pretty inconclusive\" and said that the only other thing that she could think of was that it could be eczema even though it's not dry and flaky. Upon that 'revelation' she prescribed me cephalexon to take three times daily for thirty days and advised me to continue applying the halobetasol daily. I have now finished my course of antibiotics and the rash is still there. I also noticed what I think is swollen lymph nodes in the groin area but they aren't really big so I don't know if that is something to worry about.PlEEEEASE HELP! It really itches so bad that it has brought me to tears and makes it difficult to sleep",
