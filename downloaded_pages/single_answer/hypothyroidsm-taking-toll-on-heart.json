            "answer": "A TSH of 150 is quite high and will definitely make you feel ill. It could be several months before some of your symptoms go away. You should start feeling better slowly, but it could take a year to get you a diagnosis, a correct medication dosage, and allow your body to heal.Some of the symptoms (nausea) could be caused by the medicine. It may take time to sort it all out. It might be anxiety (possibly from the Hypothyroid condition) giving you the acid/nausea problems.Diagnosis and treatment is not always simple. It takes testing and fiddling with meds and TIME to stabilize a patient. Some are easy, some are not.Sorry.Hope you start feeling better soon.",

    "question": "I'm 43 year old male. Till last 3 months, every thing was well going. I'm an Cust Support engineer in Medical equipment field. I observed some unusual rise in my tummy size & waight gain (6 Kg). Then, soon, I started feeling tiring... though I was an over-enthusiastuic natured fellow in office. I did a comprehenssive health check up. Found TSH value shot up to 150 (No typo) WBC count & cholestrol in blood was also a bit high. Proteins were found in Urine. No diabetes. Did Ultrasound sonography screen of tummy... No abnormility detected. Chest X-ray normal. PFT normal. But I observed that my BP was shooting up to 145 / 120 with P 120 especially when I'm walking for 10-15 minutes or climbing up. (This is surely abnormal as compared to my previous liftstyle) I already have GOUT. So I have strict diet control too. Consulted Cardiac specialist; performed ECG & 2-D Echo tests. All were normal (Nothing abnormal detected) Consulted endocrinologists.. he prescribed 150 mcg daily for 2 weeks, then 125 mcg next two weeks and then 100 mcg regular for first three months. But I feel now a days very tiring or almost drained out. Even after taking a bath daily my BP shoots up to 135-140 / 110-115 with P 115-110. I get shivering feeling in evenings..and feel like I'm getting fever but the thermometer never measures more than 98.97 deg F. I've developed nausea and some times vomitting & acidity symptoms with taste-less ness on tounge. Could all this be due to HYPOTHYRODISM ? How much time do you think I'll take to cure / control this?Thanks",
