            "answer": "Welcome to the neurology\u00a0\u00a0of medhelp.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for posting eatein. initially the underlying cause is treated like control diabetes, renal dialysis for chronic renal failure related neuropathy. Analgesics don\u2019t relieve neuropathy pain so medicines targeting the nerve cells should be prescribed. Your neurologist can prescribe topiramate, lamotrignine,carbamazepine, local anesthetics like lidocaine and antiarrythmics like mexiletine. Anticonvulsants can cause low white cell counts, dizziness and lidocaine and mexiletene cause nervousness and double vision. Nerve block with lidocaine into the area surrounding the nerve can cause temporary relief of symptoms by blocking the impulses to nervous system. I hope this helps. Please feel free to post a query again.",
