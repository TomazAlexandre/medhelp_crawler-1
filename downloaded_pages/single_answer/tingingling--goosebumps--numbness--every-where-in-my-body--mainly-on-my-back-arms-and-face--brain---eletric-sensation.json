            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!With sour taste in mouth and goose bumps all along and tingling, H pylori infection of stomach should be ruled out by a carbon urea breath test. Treatment is a combination of diet, antibiotics and acid reducing drugs. Consult your doctor.Other causes could be diabetes, thyroid and adrenal gland disorders, vitamin B12 deficiency and a fluctuation in blood pressure. You will need blood tests and BP monitoring for this.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.",
