            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms it sounds like boils or abscess. Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. . Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. Keep the area clean and apply warm compresses and some topical antiseptics. Also wear loose-fitting cotton clothing and use an antibacterial soap or mild soap like dove. Avoid any kind of cosmetics. Topical antibiotics such as Neosporin can also be used.In case the symptoms persist then oral antibiotics may be needed. Please consult a dermatologist in that case. Also get your blood sugar levels done as recurrent boils are found in diabetes.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have been having this issue of having \"pimples\" (not sure if that's right) on my lower butt checks on and off. I clean thoroughly, but perspire depending on the weather and/or pants I'm wearing. Could anybody determine what is actually on my cheek from time to time and what's the best way to combat it?Thanks.",
