    "question": "Hi, I'm 43 years old. I have type 1 diabetes. I also have high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, moderate to low cholesterol levels, and am anemic, all are being treated and are in good control. My problem is I get severe headaches in my forehead area. It comes on very quickly, and is a sherp pain that lasts between 10 to 30 seconds. I usually close my eyes and squint,and bend over until the pain goes away. It usually occurs while I am outside. They seem to be getting more frequent. Could this be stroke related?",
