            "answer": "Hello,There are many possibilities for this kind of pain.These include appendicitis, bladder infection or cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticulitis, urine tract infection, lower ureteric stones,pathology in the epididymis and testes.Pain in the lower abdomen can also be caused by problems arising from the back, upper abdomen (like leaking stomach ulcer draining to the lower abdomen), blood e.g. diabetes, lymphoma, sickle cell disease or totally far away from the abdomen, like emotional worries.The additional symptom of diarrhea is giving an edge to inflammatory bowel disease(Crohn'sdisease and ulcerative colitis).Without physical examination and investigations like ultrasound abdomen and colonoscopy,it is difficult to make a diagnosis.Pls consult a gastroenterologist for confirming a diagnosis after discussing these possibilities.Treatment depends on the same.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing.",
