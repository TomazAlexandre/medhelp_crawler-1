            "answer": "Good luck with the Orlistat and for sure do keep the fat down, because there can be unexpected and unpleasant side effects, as I'm sure you know.In my opinion, while keeping fat in check, is important, it's just as, if not more so, important to limit the simple carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Those are the ones found in sugar, white bread, rice and other starchy, refined, processed foods.The simple carbs are the ones that will spike your blood sugar and in response, your pancreas will produce extra insulin to try to deal with the sugar... eventually, the pancreas can't keep up and either doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't make any.\u00a0\u00a0High simple carb intake can also cause insulin resistance, which is when the pancreas produces insulin, but the cells in the body don't use it properly.\u00a0\u00a0This also can lead to type II diabetes.In place of simple carbs, opt for the complex carbs, such as those found in vegetables and whole grains.\u00a0\u00a0Most vegetables are so low in calories that you don't even have to count them, as long as they don't have heavy or cheesy sauces.In addition to complex carbs, eat plenty of lean protein, which tends to keep you feeling fuller longer.\u00a0\u00a0Protein can be in the form of meat, chicken, fish, low/no fat dairy, eggs, Greek yogurt, nuts and seeds, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Try to get some protein with every meal/snack.",
