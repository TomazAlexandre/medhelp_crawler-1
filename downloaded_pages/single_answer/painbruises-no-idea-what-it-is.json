            "answer": "Hi!Since you have spider veins (bruising), pain in legs and feet comes on and off I think you have deep vein thrombosis of the deep veins of the leg or maybe valvular dysfunction of the deep veins of the legs. This can be diagnosed by color Doppler or by angiogram of the leg veins or by duplex ultrasound.High blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, diabetes and hypothyroidism should be ruled out. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your vascular and medicine specialist for this.Take care!",
