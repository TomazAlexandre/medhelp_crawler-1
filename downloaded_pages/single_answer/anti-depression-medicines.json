            "answer": "He should not be playing around with the dosages of of Prozac or any other medication!\u00a0\u00a0Plus, taking more from time to time will not make him feel any better, that's all in his head.\u00a0\u00a0Prozac has no affect on his highs and lows with blood sugar, only his diabetes medication can even out his blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Messing around with his diabetes medication can cause his sugar to drop too low causing him to go into a diabetic coma.\u00a0\u00a0If he has mood swings, they are not from the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He's playing with fire, I hope you can get him to see this.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and take care.",

    "question": "My husband takes the generic Prozac 40mg a day. Now he is under the impression if he is stressed out he can take more than what is prescribed. Note he takes anti depression meds because of mood swings from his diabetes highs and lows. Also note he refers to this medication as chill pills. I am wondering if his thinking is off on this and is this really helping at all or just a waste of additional medication in his system? Also unfortunately he does this also with other medications he takes for his diabetes as well.",
