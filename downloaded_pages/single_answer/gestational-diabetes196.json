    "question": "I'm 28 wks pregnant and had my glucose tolereance test done two weeks ago. Apparently my sugar was too high. Doc had me monitor for a week and said my fasting sugar is elevated daily (over 100) now they're giving me a pill to take each night. I hate taking meds...especially now that I'm pregnant. :( Anyone else experiencing this?",
