            "answer": "What is a \"sweet pain\". I've never heard pain described as such. Is this some kind of idiom of which I am unaware?Have you had your back examined by a physician?You'll need to see a doctor for complete history and physical examination, and perhaps diagnostic tests like xray and MRI.",

    "question": "Hi everyone,This moment of speaking I am feeling a sweet pain in the whole length of my right leg, especially back of my knee. I don't know how to call it exactly, but is not a very strong pain and I don't know where it comes from, but is like a pain from a nerve. I don't feel mu leg comfortable. The back of my knee is buzzing ( I don't know how to call it bit it's like a bzzz) I have a lot of time that I feel this but it comes and goes but today isn't going and is very strong. I thought it was something with my testicle because it starts there but I dont feel any pain when I touch it. My diabetes is 92. I am really worried of any paralysis. Please help me.",
