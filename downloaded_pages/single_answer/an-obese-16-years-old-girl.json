            "answer": "Hey Hun.. the first thing I would suggest is going to you're doctor and telling him you want to loose weight.. then they will tell you what you should or shouldn't do and probably send you to a nutritionist and check you're thyroid levels and if you have diabetes etc to see if that could be a contributing factor to you being heavy. The next step would be you taking a step back and looking at what you eat everyday... you need to be honest with yourself.\u00a0\u00a0If you eat a lot of junk food, fried food carbs pastas, fast food and drink a lot of soda and juice then that is the issue and you will def need to stop eating that. You can also start going for walks.. no running.. you want to loose a good amount of weight first.\u00a0\u00a0If you have more questions or want to talk you can message Me. I don't go on this forum much :) good luck!!",
