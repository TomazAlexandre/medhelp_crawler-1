            "answer": "Hello,Crawling sensations can be due to parasthesia skin which is due to dysfunctioning of neurons. It can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, neurological causes or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve. If the symptoms persist then get the above mentioned possibilities ruled out from a neurologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I had redness form on my face 1 year ago. Doctors kept diagnosing it as acne rosacea, but I didn't use anything they gave me and after 2 months the redness starting dying down on it's own and then became lighter in color till now it is a pink color in the areas that had been severely red and inflamed. My facial skin has gotten very oily since then, does not itch, but I do feel crawling on face, and the skin has started forming strange lines and shallow dents without the presence of acne. The facial skin also hurts as if someone is cutting my face up sometimes. Dermatologist found demodex mites through skin scraping.Now, I am recently developing new problems:1. eyebrows falling out2. nummular eczema (coin shaped) which started on left foot one month ago and now one month later i am finding new small patches cropping up all over body3.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like my skin is crawling. After I get out of the shower it gets worse.4. getting a crop of small hives usually in the exact same places that appear and disappear (on stomach and back) and usually I've seen them when getting out of the shower. I noticed these hives also a few months ago after using Jergen's self tanner lotion which I think might have been irritating my skin or something because that's when a few strange red bumps showed up on my lower back that disappeared not long after application of the lotion.5. feeling muscle weakness, some twitching, and some small sharp pains that I think may be coming from my nerves or blood vessels.6. I have also noticed in the past year that I am forming many cherry angiomas.Please let me know if anyone knows what is going on with me or has an idea. I would appreciate it and thank you",
