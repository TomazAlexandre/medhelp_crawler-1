            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear that you are suffering from chronic diarrhea for three months. Stage three kidney disease can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms in form of loss of appetite and diarrhea. The cause of chronic kidney disease should be found and managed to halt further progression of the disease.Chronic diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc.Drugs, diabetes, high blood pressure, and parasitic infections should be the first causes to be ruled out. An autoimmune cause should also be investigated. Other than this the above mentioned bowel conditions should be ruled out by consulting a GI doctor.I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health.Hope you get well soon! Good Luck and take care!",
