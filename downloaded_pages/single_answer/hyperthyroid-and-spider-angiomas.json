    "question": "Dear Doc,I have a 6 year history of heavy drinking (half a bottle of wine) a day. In August of 2007 I got pregnant and quit drinking over night. During my pregnancy I developed gestational diabetes which was controlled by diet, no further complication during the pregnancy. Both my parents have type 2 diabetes. After giving birth to my daughter in May of 2008 I developed post partum hyperthyroidism and to control the symptoms I was given beta blockers (propanonol).\u00a0\u00a0A few weeks after the diagnosis I started to get red dots on my hands and palms which was diagnosed as spider angiomas by my dermatologist. I haven't had alcohol since Aug 07. My doctor ordered several blood tests including liver function tests, cbc, pt/inr, amylase, mg, phosphorus, cholesterol, glucose (back to normal), lipase and all came back normal except for the high thyroid levels. Since I kept developing these red spots he also ordered an ultrasound of the gallbladder and liver which didn't show anything abnormal. My thyroid levels are still not in the normal range but are improving a little every month. Nobody seems to be concerned with my spider angiomas except for me. Now my questions.Could these spider angiomas come from my hyperthyroidism?And if so how many are normal?Is it normal to feel tired often although I can't seem to rest?Thank you",
