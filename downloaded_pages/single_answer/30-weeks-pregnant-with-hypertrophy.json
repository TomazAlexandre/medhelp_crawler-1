    "question": "I am 30 weeks pregnant and switching doctors because my OB doctor hasn't been very helpful. I went to pick up my medical records and found that the results of my Echocardiogram stated that I have Sinus Tachycardia and Moderate left ventricular hypertrophy. When I received the results from my doctor she said everything came back normal. Is this something I should be worried about??? I also found that I have gestational diabetes and anemia that hasn't yet been treated. Please help!",
