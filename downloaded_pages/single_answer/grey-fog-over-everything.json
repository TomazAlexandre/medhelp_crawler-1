    "question": "8 years ago when my daughter was 19, she went into a diabetic coma, and had some brain swelling. she has recovered quite well,except 4 her eyes. she can't see very well to the left, and there is a gray fog over everything she says. the dr says it is not diabetes damage, but was due to the brain swelling. they said her optic nerve is pale. the gave a name to the condition as \"myelinolysis cevebval edema\". no one has given any hope about it. is there a cure or anything that can be done??? her life is passing her by. is there a transplant maybe??? her left side is damaged from the stroke as well, but she walks with a cane after months of rehab. she falls quite va lot because she cannot see. ( i call it a stroke). can someone help??she is practically blind.",
