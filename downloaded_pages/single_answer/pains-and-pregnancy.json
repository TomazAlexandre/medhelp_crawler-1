            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, yes since you missed periods, pregnancy is possible. However, since the period came a day early, in your case it looks more like some hormonal imbalance interacting with the hormonal pill. Take a pregnancy test\u2014a serum or blood test for HCG would be more reliable than pregnancy test by test strips.If test is negative, then you need to test for polycystic ovary, thyroid, adrenal gland function, and diabetes. Please consult your gynecologist.Take care!",
