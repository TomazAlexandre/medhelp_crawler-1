            "answer": "Hi,I most definitely think that your goals of exercising and eating better will make a difference! For many people with Type 2 diabetes, changing their diets and increasing their exercise will help insulin sensitivity improve, and thus a need for less medications(and in some cases any at all). So definitely give it your best shot. If you need additional nutritional guidance, diabetes nutritionists are a great resource as well. Be sure to speak with your doctor before beginning any rigorous exercise routines to make sure everything is in good shape for you to start.Good luck and take care.",
