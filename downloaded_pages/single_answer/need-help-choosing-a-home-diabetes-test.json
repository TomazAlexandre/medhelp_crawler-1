    "question": "Hi Everyone,I could really use some help in choosing a test kit for diabetes that I can do at home.\u00a0\u00a0Thinking my son may have pre-diabetes due to certain medication he is on (he has recently gained about 13 pounds due from the side effect).\u00a0\u00a0When I get onto the CVS, Walgreens, etc. websites to view all the different tests, I just get really overwhelmed, like which is a good, reliable one and fairly easy to use as we have never done this before, and we don't want to get an inaccurate reading.\u00a0\u00a0Is the test you do 2 hours after you eat better, or a test before you eat.\u00a0\u00a0So I am kind of lost when it comes to this......and how often do you test yourself?\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any responses and input for this issue.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks......",
