            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0The first thing to try is physiotherapy to correct the bone alignment. Also physiotherapy will strengthen the ligaments and muscles around joints. Check your diabetes status. This also weakens the muscles and bones and causes recurrent infections and neuropathy.Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Back in 1981 at the age of18 I had open knee surgery on both knees for chrondomalacia.In 1998 I had a meniscus repair on the right followed by a least 3 more meniscus repairs to the same knee. A doctor before the first repair noted a tracking problem. In June 2011 I had an ACL reconstruction I developed an infection in the incision was put on antibiotics and septic arthritis developed shortly after.Since then I have had 3 more surgeries the last being Nov. 2012 to remove a hematoma.I am on daily opiate medication which I do not want to be on the rest of my life.I am now 51.I saw an orthopedic surgeon recently and he let me know my thigh bone is out by 5 degrees but offered no solutions except that I cut myself down on my pain medication because I had admitted that I am a recovering alcoholic. It has been well over 10 years now.I have very little arthritis in the knee but the 5 degrees out of my thigh bone is affecting my right ankle and I am starting to feel a tearing along with pain in my left knee as well as a stabbing pain near the outside of my kneecap. I am frustrated and I am not sure what to do.",
