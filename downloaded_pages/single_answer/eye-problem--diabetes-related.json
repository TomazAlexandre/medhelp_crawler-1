    "question": "I have t2 diabetes, controlled with meds and insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Had cataracts removed 1.5 yrs ago and got implants for distance.\u00a0\u00a0All was fine until I started insulin this past May.\u00a0\u00a0Two days after starting it my vision got sort of cloudy with dots that did go away but one floater remains, which is not bothersome.\u00a0\u00a0Since then my 20/20 vision is not what it was, with this sort of jelly fish like cloud that comes and goes.\u00a0\u00a0While I solved my blood sugar problems the insulin did something to my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I've had two rounds of laser treatments which did help but the problem persists.I learned a trad. Chinese med. idea of massaging my ear lobes and finger tips and that worked amazingly well to help my sight!\u00a0\u00a0I am pleased with that, of course.\u00a0\u00a0However my eye specialist says there is swelling behind my right eye and I should consider needles in my eye to hopefully resolve this, no guarantee it'll work.\u00a0\u00a0That idea creeps me out and it's not a one time thing, it could be monthly perhaps forever.I'm looking for a TCM method to reduce this swelling behind my eye.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice is appreciated.",
