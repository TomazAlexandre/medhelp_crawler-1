            "answer": "Emily, I think one of the reasons you have convinced yourself to eat only junk food is because you are uncomfortable with your weight. However, understand that no matter what your weight is this has absolutely nothing to do with how we stay healthy. Eating too m uch junk food can lead to diabetes, High blood pressure, being overweight when you are older, along with vitamin defeciencies as well as other things. Many people can \"LOOK\" healthy but be sicker than an obese person. Maybe this will help you, all thru school I had a cousin that at her biggest & in 12th grade of school weighed 92 lbs. she would consume junk day and night & nothing changed. She went to the doctor fearing she would be diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia but the doctor only said she was exactly where she needed to be.\u00a0\u00a0After she graduated college and was married she became pregnant with her first child and WOW did the weight hit her like bricks, but luckily enuff she was able to lose weight and the older she got she was having to excercise more and more to stay fit especially after 3 kids. Now she has never been an overweight person, but as you know doctors judge by our body frames and height and so on. I would go to a physician , get a good physical and sit down and discuss your eating habits with him. And there are fun ways to learn to eat healthy, but plz be careful dont harm yourself by filling your body with things that it cannot handle and lead to future illnesses. Good luck to you. Research something like fun ways to eat healthy, and just get started.",

    "question": "Hi I'm 20 years old and I've been eating junk food for all these years because I'm really thin. I really want to eat more healthy food but I just can't do it, especially because I really have a problem with experimenting new food. I feel really bad if I don't eat chocolate, lots of cookies, etc. It's really bad cause I hate all fruits, vegetables and healthy stuff. For exemple, at lunch I've to eat food (like rice, chicken, beans) but I eat just a little and like 20 min later I'm already eating cookies until dinner that I eat a sandwich. The problem is also that everynight I'm dancing, I'm a ballerina so when I get home I'm so hungry that I don't wanna eat \"healthy food\" so I don't. But I really want to know how I can stop thinking that just because I'm thin I don't need to be healthy. Does anyone have an advice?",
