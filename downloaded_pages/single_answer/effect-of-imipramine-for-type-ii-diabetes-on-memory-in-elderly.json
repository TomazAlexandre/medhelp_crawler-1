            "answer": "Hello.Imipramine is not actually preferred at this age. It may not hamper the functioning of other drugs like Aricept, but it does have its own effects on the cognitive abilities.You may consider tapering off Imipramine and starting Duloxetine (Cymbalta). It may be difficult since Imipramine has been associated with withdrawal symptoms.Regards",

    "question": "My husband, aged 78, was diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer's five months ago and he now takes 5 mg Aricept in the mornings and 10 mg Namenda mornings and evenings.\u00a0\u00a0He has also been taking 50 mg Imipramine each evening for about 12 years; he takes this not for depression but because he is a mild Type II diabetic and his feet feel as if they are burning when he does not take it.My question is:\u00a0\u00a0might the Imipramine be negatively affecting his memory?\u00a0\u00a0We have seen no improvement with the Aricept and Namenda.\u00a0\u00a0We wonder if he should stop the Imimpramine and start something like Cymbalta, Neurotin, or Lyrica.\u00a0\u00a0Would these be safer?",
