            "answer": "Hi,How are you?It is very difficult to diagnose MS just on the basis of MRI results. They have to be correlated with clinical exam and CSF exam.Many conditions like migraine, diabetes, high BP can produce similar changes in the brain.A cyst in the sinus can cause pain in the eye and headache. Cyst can occur due to allergies so it is a possibility in your case.Hope this helps you.",

    "question": "I began taking birth control about 2 1/2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I began developing headaches on the left side of my head.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor changed my pills, headaches were less painful but about 6 months into the new pill I was getting nauseous and then developed eye pain in my left eye which is an ache above and behind my eye that hurts more when straining and looking to my extreme left of right, some sensitivity to light and flashing lights.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor noticed I had high blood pressure at the time as well (abnormal for me).\u00a0\u00a0They took me off of the pill, the pain went away in a matter of days. They then started on progestin only birth control.\u00a0\u00a0Everything was fine, until one month ago when the headaches and eye pain (flashing lights as well) showed up again.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped taking the pill again, no instant relief.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the eye doctor, everything checked out there. I began stressing out so bad that I was causing myself to have panic attacks (I have these from time to time). My family doctor ordered a blood test, negative for anemia and thyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0I had an MRI one week ago (eye pain and headaches are now gone).\u00a0\u00a0I received a call yesterday in which they told me I possibly have MS (possible lesions), but the only symptoms I have are the eye pain and fatigue (which could be for a number of reasons). The doctor referred me to a neurologist (I haven't been seen yet).\u00a0\u00a0I noticed on my MRI results what looks like a cyst in my left sinus.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any relevance to the headaches and eye pain?\u00a0\u00a0I have a long history of allergies.\u00a0\u00a0I am looking for help.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
