    "question": "For the last week or so I have been experiencing severe bloating and/or swelling. This includes my face, hands, ankles, and stomach. And when I say severe I mean I actually look like I am about 7 months pregnant. Other symptoms I have are gas, lower back pain mostly on the right side, very poor vision lately, headaches, muscle weakness, and I am a type 1 diabetic. I feel that my diabetes probably has nothing to do with my other symptoms because I am very well controlled with an insulin pump. And I know for sure that I am not pregnant. Please...what could be wrong with me? I am in misery!",
