            "answer": "You are young so I understand your frustration...it must be hard to be only 30 years old and not feel well.You list a LOT of symptoms, so its hard to know where to begin.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a doctor and cannot possibly diagnose you.\u00a0\u00a0I will say, however, that 3-5 pounds does NOT qualify as \"weight fluctuation.\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A person's weight will normally vary that much in any one day!What do you take for high blood pressure, and what dose?\u00a0\u00a0 Some meds for hyertension can cause hair loss, but it is also linked to stress.High calcium levels is often associated with parathyroid disease...which you say runs in your family...and you mention being on Synthroid.We can't choose our genetics (at least not yet!) so you may just have to try and live the best life you can given the cards you were dealt.\u00a0\u00a0 Does your primary care physician know you feel this lousy?\u00a0\u00a0 What does he/she say?Are you on Wellbutrin for depression?\u00a0\u00a0Depression causes all kinds of physical symptoms...are you in talking therapy as well?\u00a0\u00a0It might help.Finally...do you get any exercise?\u00a0\u00a0 It's amazing how good moving your body can make you feel.\u00a0\u00a0I know it can be a vicious cycle...you don't feel good, so it's hard to get up and exercise, but sometimes something as simple as a 1/2 hour of walking or even cleaning your kitchen floor (hands and knees) can make a difference.Good luck honey...",

    "question": "My blood calcium has been elevated for over 2 years that I know of. I've felt horrible for a while. It seems over time more and more symptoms get added to the list: high blood pressure, high calcium, normal vit d levels, low/normal pth level, high calcitriol level and an elevated liver enzyme. Hair loss, acne, weight fluctuations(3-5 lbs), frequent urination, depression, hypothyroidism, bone cracking/popping, aches, pains, brain fog, increasing fatigue and a small bump under my chin that comes and goes. I'm on Wellbutrin XL, Synthroid, and\u00a0\u00a0Labetelol. Any\u00a0\u00a0doctors I've seen seemed relatively unconcerned and took the \"wait and see\" approach. I'm 30 years old and I feel 80. I don't want to wait and see. I want to find the problem and fix it. Any ideas? Every possible cancer runs in my family, diabetes, tuberculosis, depression, parathyroid disease-you name it-someone I'm related to has had it and that goes for both sides. I feel like very defeated, like I'm going in circles. I just want to feel better.",
