But there are many other possibilities.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have fibroids?\u00a0\u00a0What is your dr basing this on? Was an ultrasound done?\u00a0\u00a0Or is she simply saying your belly (fundal height) is 6cm more than expected?",

    "question": "Last wednesday my OB said I was measuring 6 weeks ahead. She said it was concerning but she would keep an eye on it. I passed my gestational diabetes test and as far as I've seen there is only 1 baby. I was recently in L&D for contractions and she was picking up a heartbeat on both sides of my belly, although they were only flashes.My next appointment is at the end of the month and not knowing is making me anxious. What could cause me to be measuring so far ahead? Not GD, this is my 3rd baby, and im of normal weight for my height.\u00a0\u00a0Extra fluid?",
