    "question": "Hey I'm 21 years old and I never really drink . Probably once every 4 months type of thing . But I am now starting to realize I shake really bad after I had a drink or two . Not right away but like a few hours later . I shake really bad , my hands , chest , arms , legs everything . I cant stop!! Its starting to scare me because this has never happened before . I'm really confused if I need to seek help on this . I shake for a good 30 mins non stop . I was almost in tears because I didn't know what was going on with me ! To be honest I went on Google and typed in \"shaking after drinking\" but all that pops up is people who have been drinking a lot , In my case i only had 2 small drinks . PLEASE HELP",
