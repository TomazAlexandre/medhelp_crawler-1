            "answer": "I have answered this query under the Type 2 forum. Or rather I have provided you with some things to consider when making your own choices. One thing I suggest you do first is clarify which type you are and what is meant by the \"early stages of diabetes\". Type 1 and Type 2 are very different conditions and both can occur at any age. Pre-diabetes which may be what you mean by early stages is a very specific diagnosis (usually of type 2). What is your A1C? An A1C under 5.7 is normal. Between 5.7 and 6.4 is pre-diabetes and 6.5 and over is diabetes. (again no such thing as early stages).I suggest right now you focus on learning the answers to the above questions first and then go from there. If you want a website with a lot more diabetics of both types send me a PM. On that website the question of marijuana use is often brought up and you can revue other people's opinions as well.The best treatment for diabetes is knowledge.",

    "question": "I have always smoked marijuana all my life. A couple months back I got my consumption legallized. I smoke about 1oz of marijuana / wk all to myself. And today I was diagnoised with early stages of diabetes. The Dr who diagnoised me with diabetes said I need to cut down or go see the Dr who gave me my marijuana recommendation. My question is can I smoke marijuana as a diabetic and still be ok ???",
