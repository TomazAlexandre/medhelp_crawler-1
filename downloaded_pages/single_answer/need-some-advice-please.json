    "question": "Hi I'm 32 years old. Over the past 4 months I have gained 10kg (always been thin size 8)I developed terrible off and on nausea/gagging around the same time as the weight gain and started having trouble sleeping, my periods started coming 3 weekly lasting 3 days day two with very heavy flooding (always been 4weekly last 7 days) I also had pain in my left side some days unable to walk,intermittent bowel probs and bloat.Was tested a couple of months ago for thyroid/diabetes, tests were fine. Was sent for an ultrasound which picked up a small (1.5cm) possible endometrioma. My gyn put me on continuous BCP as I have had endometriosis in the past and told me that will fix ovulation pain/cyst and to watch what I eat for the weight gain. Still felt crappy went back to doc as symptoms got worse, he thinks I have acid reflux causing insomnia/gagging/gas/night cough/wheezing, had a smear test while I was there, made me cry it was that excrutiating, he put that down to endo scarring. Now for the last 7 days I've had non stop periodlike cramps and bleeding even though I'm still on continuous BCP's. I've been getting overwhelming fatigue most afternoons, my bladder has started leaking, my back aches every day and over the last month I haven't been eating much I feel too full and sick when I do. I feel like such a neurotic but I know something isn't right, my bodys going haywire. Should I be concerned about ovarian cancer. I want to go back to the doctor but am sick of them telling me I'm just getting fat and asking me if anything could be making me depressed.Any suggestions would be great",
