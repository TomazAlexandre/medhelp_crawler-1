            "answer": "Olga8, first of all, my deepest condolences to you and your family. I lost my father (sick at home) a few years ago. Don't be too hard on yourself. As a registered nurse, I can tell you that it would be anyone's guess if the TIAs would have progressed to a full blown stroke at that point in time. My grandmother often had TIAs (was morbidly obese and had hypertension and blood clots) but they never hospitalized her for TIAs as really there is nothing differently they did, treatment-wise. They may have run an MRI/MRA scan of her brain or the arteries in the neck. Your mother had a lot of medical problems and did not wish to go to the hospital. (Nor did my dad). I beat myself up, especially being a nurse, blaming myself, but in my heart (and most probably in yours, too), I knew that it was not in my control, that he was in the dying process (he had terminal cancer and his kidneys went into failure). When there are multiple factors such as the diseases and morbid obestiy that your mother had, the organs most likely also sustained damage that they could just not overcome. Know that you were honoring your mother's wishes and that you were a wonderful, caring daughter who was able to provide comfort and care to her in her last hours. I hope this thought will help you in your loss and in your grief.",

    "question": "Hello,Please help me. I am very confused and guilty regarding my mother's death and her stroke.\u00a0\u00a0It all started the 1st week of January with a so called Flu. She started with shivers, etc...\u00a0\u00a0The whole week she was just sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0By Friday she was fine, and then on Saturday she started with TIA's (now I know what they are, before I did not).\u00a0\u00a0She claimed that she could not see, her right side was weird, and she had slurred speech.\u00a0\u00a0During the week her anemia was also low, because she had been to the doctor on Monday. (she had slurred speech during the week also, but we thought it was because of the cold sores on her tongue).\u00a0\u00a0My father and I thought it was all the FLU effects !\u00a0\u00a0She obviously refused to go to the hospital!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I thought her vision was due to her diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Anyways, ok I told her \"Sunday morning we will go to the hospital\".\u00a0\u00a0Saturday night I put her to sleep, and she died at 3:24 a.m., of a cardiac arrest.It was a big shock to my father and myself, but my dad said that everything complicated for her. She was morbid obese, had hypertension, diabetes, and also her lungs gave up on her.My question is, do you think she would of been saved if she would of gone to the hospital on Saturday, or she would of had the massive stroke in the hospital anyways ?\u00a0\u00a0Was she going to be hooked up to them machines, etc....\u00a0\u00a0Do you think that eventually she would of died at the hospital anyways?\u00a0\u00a0 I just feel so guilty because I did not force her to go to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0She even spoke to her Doctor, and why didn't the Doctor tell me SHE IS HAVING A STROKE, TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL!!!!!!",
