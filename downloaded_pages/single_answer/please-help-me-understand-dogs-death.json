            "answer": "I am so sorry about your poor dog's untimely death!Your dog did have a variety of problems.\u00a0\u00a0There is no obvious relationship to bleeding internally and diabetes.There is a possibility that at your dog's age he could have had a blood filled gastrointestinal tumor that ruptured causing a bleed-out.\u00a0\u00a0The diabetic shock may simply have been coincidental.Only your veterinarian would be able to give you a definitive diagnosis, of course, by performing a post-mortum exam.If a post-mortum exam is not possible than a GI tumor that ruptured is the most likely cause.\u00a0\u00a0A hemangiosarcoma, for instance, could have been lying quietly in a patient for many months and since this cancer has no symptoms it would be impossible to know in advance that the tumor is in there, unless routine X-Rays or an abdominal ultrasound had been performed, and the tumor accidentally discovered.\u00a0\u00a0The rupture of these tumors causes internal bleeding and devastating results.\u00a0\u00a0So I don't believe that there is any reason for you to feel guilty.",

    "question": "At 11:45 PM, my husband let our dog out to go to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0He said the dog was actually normally, just really seemed to need to go.\u00a0\u00a0At 1 AM, I woke to the smell of feces. This has happened before, so I went in search of the mess and our dog.\u00a0\u00a0He was laying outside of our bedroom door, very still.\u00a0\u00a0At first, I thought he had already died, but he was still breathing very shallowly and rapidly. He did not respond to my touch or move in any way.\u00a0\u00a0I woke my husband who wrapped him in a towel and took him to a 24-hour emergency clinic.When they arrived at the clinic, his vitals were very poor (low blood pressure, low oxygen saturation, erratic heart rate).\u00a0\u00a0He was administered IV fluids and put on oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0An on-site ultrasound revealed abdominal bleeding, but the doctor didn't see any tumors that would account for the bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0She also didn't see any signs of trauma.Blood work revealed that he most likely had diabetes and was in shock from that.\u00a0\u00a0The combination of the bleeding and the diabetic shock meant that it would have taken 2 - 3 days just to stabilize him and likely upwards of $10,000 in vet bills.\u00a0\u00a0Not only that, but the prognosis even with treatment was not favorable.\u00a0\u00a0She said the best thing would be to put him to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0My husband signed the paperwork, but before they could administer the medications, his heart stopped on its own.Now that I reflect on our day, it did seem he was quieter than usual, but he was moving normally and ate dinner.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't notice any dramatic differences in him. He was never out of my sight (as far as running loose - our backyard is fenced).\u00a0\u00a0The only other thing of note is that he stumbled down the last few stairs when I put him in the garage (where he stays while we are away from home) earlier that day.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't yelp or seem hurt, but now I can't help but wonder if he could have sustained injuries from that fall and that I didn't take him in.\u00a0\u00a0The guilt is overwhelming.",
