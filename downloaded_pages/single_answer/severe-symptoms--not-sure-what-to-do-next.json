    "question": "My question is somewhat detailed and I hope it doesn't appear I'm taking advantage. I realize answers I receive are general and not definitive. I've had tremendous struggle and believe Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a strong possibility.I have Hashimoto's caused hypothyroidism (diagnosed 2003) and am also absolutely positive I have mitral valve prolapse. In my teens an MD found a heart murmur & after follow up with a cardiologist I was mistakenly diagnosed me with Wolf-Parkinson-White-Syndrome. WPWS was later ruled out in 2001 by electrocardiogram (at age 40) but I did not get an echo to detect MVP. Despite this my symptoms shout MVP; orthostatic hypotension (brief after standing), heart skips & flutters, anxiety spells (panic attacks during youth & young adulthood), severe fatigue especially after exercise.My hypothyroidism is well-treated (very sure of this) but symptoms continue and not likely thyroid hormone related but may be aggravated by my thyroid antibodies (I found research: thyroid disease & MVP highly related).The symptoms I continue to experience are orthostatic hypotension (BP slightly high otherwise), severe fatigue, headaches with lots of referred pain to them (feel them throughout my body) and nerve type pains otherwise.I had an MRI which was clear. I've had everything else ruled out as well including, low B12, anemia, systemic autoimmunity, diabetes (although I do have metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver). The only other abnormals on my blood labs are a slightly low phosphorous level and slightly elevated Chloride (both flagged on several tests).Symptoms are so severe I am considering applying for disability because I struggle terribly with work etc... One more interesting aspect to this is the fact that when I turn my head to either side and tilt it back slightly, it feels like I loose blood circulation to my head (have to be careful sleeping) and I have difficulty breathing, lying on my back (I'm 6ft but only weigh about 235lb, so not terribly obese). It also feels like my blood pressure drops and my heart struggles a bit when I bare-down like when you're blowing up a baloon or having a bowel movement, especially when I'm lying flat.Testing suggestion? Suggestions of any kind please?\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks much!",
