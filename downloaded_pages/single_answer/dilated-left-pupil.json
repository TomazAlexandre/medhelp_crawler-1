    "question": "Co worker noticed my left pupil was very dilated last Thursday morning.\u00a0\u00a0 I had no other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Went to ER and they did blood panel to rule out diabetes; CT scan which was normal and MR brain and head w/no contrast and all came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0Pupil was normal by end of day and has remained that way.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 61 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure was normal (I do take blood pressure meds), my cholesterol levels have always been well within the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0I had been taking Adipex-P to lose about 10 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing the emergency room doctor thought could have caused the dilation was somehow I touched the pill, touched my eye (maybe putting in a contact) and the stimulant dilated my pupils.\u00a0\u00a0Is that even plausible?\u00a0\u00a0Also, while there was no sign of a stroke, could this have been a TIA...though I had no other symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0I am seeing a neuro-opthamologist in 10 days, the earliest he could see me.\u00a0\u00a0How worried should I be?\u00a0\u00a0I was travelling when this happened and wondering if I should go to the ER here in LA at UCLA even before my appointment.\u00a0\u00a0I have had irregular heart beats over the past six months...they only last for several seconds and maybe once every couple of weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Had an EKG and echocardiogram which was normal--could this have caused the dilation?",
