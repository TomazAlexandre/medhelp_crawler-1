    "question": "Hi, I am asking this question for my mother, who is 65 yrs old. She has been diagnosed with Neuropathy. The doctor attributes this to the diabetes which she has. But she is also an OCD patient and has been on psychiatric drugs for the past 2 yrs.She has clawed fingers (last 2) on both her hands and muscle wastage on her hands and limbs.1. Doctor is suggesting Ulnar nerve transposition surgery to prevent further degradation of her hands. But says no treatment for her limbs. What time would it take to recover from this surgery, wrt diabetes and age?2.\u00a0\u00a0Could the psychiatric drugs be causing the neuropathy? Would minimizing these drugs help?Any tips or experiences or suggestions would be helpful as the doctors are pressing for a surgery.thanks",
