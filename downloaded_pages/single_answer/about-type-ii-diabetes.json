    "question": "I am 45 year lady. Diabetes for me was detected on onset of 40 years age. I always ask the question that in type II diabetes the insulin production is there but its function is not correct. But all the tablets are used to supress the blood sugar level. But the main problem of insulin functioning remains as it is. Are there any medicines to improve that funciton? are there any medicines to improve pancreatic Beta cells? Please suggest",
