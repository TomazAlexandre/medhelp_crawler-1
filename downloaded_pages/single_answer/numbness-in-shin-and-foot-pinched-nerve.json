            "answer": "Hi,Your symptoms are very suggestive of nerve compression in the lower back. Other causes include peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, B12 deficiency or thyroid dysfunction.I would suggest you to do some back and leg exercises and take OTC B complex supplements. If the symptoms recur then it is better to get a clinical evaluation done.Thanks",
