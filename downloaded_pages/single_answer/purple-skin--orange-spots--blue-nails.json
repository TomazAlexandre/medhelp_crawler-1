            "answer": "Hello,It is difficult confirming a diagnosis but the symptoms can be due to Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. It is a vascular disorder that affects blood flow to the extremities which include the fingers, toes, nose and ears when exposed to temperature changes or stress. This causes blueness and swelling of the skin.I feel that a consultation of a physician will be the best. Other causes of swollen and blue peripheries like diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid also have to be ruled out. Hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Warm regards.",
