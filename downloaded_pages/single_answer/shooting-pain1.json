            "answer": "Hi Kimmie,How are you feeling?Sharp shooting pain in your temple region suggests that either it can be due to nerve compression or nerve irritation or nerve entrapment.Pain, tingling and numbness are signs of neuropathy. Nerve involvement may be single (mono-neuropathy) or multiple (poly-neuropathy).This neuropathy can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.You should be doing HbA1C, ESR, serum protein/immuno-electrophoresis, and vitamin B12, BUN, and creatinine levels.I think you should consult a neurologist and get imaging study done to rule out any nerve compression.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",
