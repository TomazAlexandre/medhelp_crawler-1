            "answer": "Hope this helps your wife and yourself.Once the gallbladder is removed, the bile has lost its storage space and tends to accumulate in the liver, so the result is a reduced bile flow, because the liver does not contract to squirt the bile into the intestine like a healthy gallbladder does. The reduced bile flow usually causes problems such as indigestion, constipation, or diarrhea. When the accumulated bile becomes congested in the liver, it weakens liver functions. This could even lead to depression, which is, according to Chinese medicine, a sign of blocked liver energy. The combined effects of liver congestion and intestinal sluggishness may also cause sleep disorder, insomnia, or bad breath. Furthermore, the reduced bile flow could weaken the spleen and pancreas. In some cases this side effect is so strong that even may result diabetes.This was one of the many reasons I was debating having the surgery.Hope she gets to feeling better! Take care.Moira",
