            "answer": "Hi,Is the toe swollen? Was it recently injured? Or the skin cut?It is possible that this is neuropathic problems from your diabetes, especially if it is not well controlled. But it also could be many other things including bone injuries, gout, skin infections etc. I think it is best if your doctor takes a look at it soon to determine what the problem could be. I am quite limited for this problem because I cannot examine your foot.Best of luck, take care.",
