            "answer": "\"Could i have diabetes\"To answer your question, yes. First off, there is no such thing as a \"blood machine.\" It's apparent you used your husbands home blood glucose meter to obtain the 3.9, 3.9, 4.7 readings, which I'm assuming was in mmol/l. It makes a difference if these figures were preprandial or postprandial. At 3.9 mmol/l lethargy starts to set in. If this was 2-4 hours after a meal (postprandial) you have very dangerous low levels. In any case you need to see a doctor asap to get tested for diabetes.",
