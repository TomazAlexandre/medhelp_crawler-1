    "question": "I have never had a problem driving for hours, anytime of day with tons of sleep to hardly any sleep at all.But, this past summer, I noticed I couldn't stay awake longer than an hour or so, behind the wheel. I would get so tired and even doze off here and there. But, if I let someone else drive, I wouldn't be able to go to sleep in the passenger seat. I have pulled over, drank 5 hour, lots to try and wake myself up. I can go a little longer but, always end up fighting my sleep again shortly after. I have always been a night owl so, I am really good at being up all night and sleeping all day. The driving sleepiness has continued day or night. I am good most days with an hour here and there and sometimes even two hours, other days.. I am ready to fall asleep just ten to thirty minutes into the drive.Prior to all this, I have had some sleep issues that were due to anemia. I had a hysterectomy and that changed. But, every once in awhile I feel like if I don't lie down immediately, I am going to fall and hurt myself by falling out right there. This comes and goes but, is not an everyday or week occurrence. It creeps up on my out of the blue and I have learned to drop what I am doing quickly and nap. Sometimes a good 20 minutes will do it and I am up with no issues, sometimes I will sleep for two days. This happens about twice a month.Can anyone give me ideas....",
