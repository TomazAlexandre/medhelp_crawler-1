            "answer": "What kind of a doctor did you go to? A diabetes specialist would be called an endocronologist-a doctor who specializes in the endocrine system. Did you tell your doctor all of your symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Did they run any tests?\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't sound like diabetes-but it sounds as if something is going on.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a doctor, but a Type I diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetic symptoms are frequent urination, irritability, feeling lethargic, excessive thirst, weight loss-due to the frequent urination. If you fear you might be diabetic you should have a fasting glucose test. The doctor would order bloodwork. Does Type II diabetes run in your family?\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest going to the JDRF website-www.jdrf.org\u00a0\u00a0to help you determine if you have any symptoms of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Or go to the American Diabetes Association website for further information as well.",

    "question": "My question is for anyone who would know about this subject. Anyways, I am about 50 pounds overweight.(I try to lose weight it just doesnt come off) and well I have been sick since the end of march and I have went to the doctors but they said i was fine and nothing was wrong with me, but im just very achey all over, sore throat, constant headache, and im dizzy on top of that, but i am kind of worried that this might be diabetes. I am 18 years of age, and my mother was just thinking that it might. I'm not sure so if anyone out there can answer my question this would be a relief i really need to know. thank you so much--Alexandra**worried and scared**",
