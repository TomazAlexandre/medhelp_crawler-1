            "answer": "The first time I used the HCG injections I went from 224 to 171lbs in less than 50 days. I stayed with the guidelines exactly and it works. But I got back to bad eating habits and gained a lot of it back but only about half of it and did the HCG again and lost it back. Then I had to take steroids for a neck injury and it swelled me up like a balloon and I got back up to 206. I am now type 2 and I am down to the mid 190's. I am starting the HCG diet in a few days and I will keep you posted on my weight loss and GI levels as i go through it. I am currently taking metformin but decreased the dosage in hald because my GI is staying in the normal range. I am also taking IC-5 suppliments.",
