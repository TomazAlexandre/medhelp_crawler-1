            "answer": "The answer is complicated. There are reputable double-blind studies that substantiate the \"worse case\" side effects of statins. These include dementia and loss of memory. Memory is stored in structures that consist of cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0The FDA site has information on these studies. On the other hand, statins to assist in lowering cholesterol levels. So there is a risk-benefit. Surprise.\u00a0\u00a0According to a Scientific American article there is a gene in about 20% of the population. Those with this gene need not worry about their levels. Within the last five years a test has been developed to identify these individuals. Surprise. It isn't administered. Search Scientific American for their articles on cholesterol.",

    "question": "I am a 62 yr old man.Some years back I was on statins for about 5-7 years in a row.Then I developed peripheral neuropathy in my feet which is now moving up my legs.I do not have diabetes though it does run in my mother's side of the family (her father and sister died of diabetes).My A1C level is around 5.6 though my sugar level is around 113. I find the neuropathy very annoying.When I read about statins, I stopped taking them..a few years ago.I recently saw another doctor to check my blood pressure which has been elevated.She prescribed hydrochlorothiazide..and guess what...a Lipitor statin generic. Though afraid to take the statin, I took it for the past 2 weeks and guess what?..I've noticed the numbness in my feet/legs getting worse. I am thinking of dropping it again. I have read some doctors call statins poison..on the internet. Is what they say believable? When I ask my doctor about things like this..I get no response. What should I do? Should I stop taking them again? Thanks.",
