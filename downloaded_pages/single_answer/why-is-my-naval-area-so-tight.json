            "answer": "Hi!Yes, if you have constipation a lot and emotional stress, then there is involuntary contraction of the abdominal muscles. Thus you feel that the naval area is tight. Usually stress, poor eating habits and drinking less water can cause constipation. You could do deep breathing exercises to reduce stress. Dancing is also very stress busting. Also make a conscious effort to add roughage to your diet. Drink 7-8 glasses of water every day.If the symptoms persist consult a doctor to find out the cause for constipation. The various other causes of constipation are diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies.I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health.Hope you get well soon! Good Luck and take care!",

    "question": "I am not pregnant but because I have a involuntary impulse to always clench my stomach (due to dance because they say it's best to clench/tighten your stomach) I can feel my naval area tightening, which never happened before. When I apply pressure with both hands there is no strange bump but it does feel a bit weird. I have recently been having issues with constipation and large emotional stress so could that be the reason this is happening? Has anyone else had this happen with them before?",
