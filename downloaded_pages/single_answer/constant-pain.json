            "answer": "Hello and welcome to the medhelp forum. I can understand you have multiple health issues and it must be distressing. Have you been looked up for electrolyte levels and vitamin B6, \tB12 and D3 levels during your blood workup?\u00a0\u00a0What was done for the lumbar cyst detected on MRI?\u00a0\u00a0This can itself cause backache and compressive symptoms in the lower limbs. The bulging disc on MRI could have healed by itself without surgical intervention by resorption.Since EMG detected a nerve issue in the neck; you need to get an MRI spine done to find the cause for this. It could be bulging or degenerated disc causing nerve root compression or a pinched nerve from bony spurs or other mechanical obstruction. Get a blood sugar work up,\u00a0\u00a0glycosylated hemoglobin, metabolic panel\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0any diabetes post delivery, glycemic control in the last 3 months and end organ damage. hyperpigmentation is associated with pregnancy state or after inflammation. You would require seeing a rheumatologist for an autoimmune work up. Check up with the hospital asking them to furnish your medical records for a specialist referral .Wishing you all the best.",

    "question": "In October 2011, I went to my md for pain in my back under my left shoulder blade.\u00a0\u00a0We started with an xray or my back that showed arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0I had negative results of an MRI of my spine, CAT scan and Ultrasound of my stomach and EMG of hands and wrists. During this testing, I started to feel flu-like body aches. So after my bloodwork came back clear, she diagnosed me with fibromyalga, but none of the meds specifically for fibro worked.\u00a0\u00a0Within the last few months, my pain has gotten worse with burning, achy feet/toes and hands.\u00a0\u00a0It has gone from 2-3 flareups per week, to one every day, some times lasting just about all day.\u00a0\u00a0My md has said it is anxiety that is causing the pain and has given me numberous meds for depression and anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0I did not feel like this was the case and requested an apt to a rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0My md complied, but only to appease me and she still shoved these meds at me.\u00a0\u00a0She insisted I see a certain rheumatologist, but he is not available for a month!\u00a0\u00a0This has ruined my relationship with my md because I feel like she is not listening to me.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot take this pain much longer as it is now interferring with my daily activities.\u00a0\u00a0Should I switch md's in the middle of this?\u00a0\u00a0Will they give me my chart with all my test results and meds I've tried?\u00a0\u00a0Should I make an apt at a different rheumatologist in order to get in to seem him quicker?\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps also see a Neurologist (I hear they take months to get an apt)?\u00a0\u00a0I need answers quick so I can get some kind of relief!\u00a0\u00a0What on earth could this possibly be?PSI do have arthritis in my feet (they found it during an MRI when I had a cyst on the top of my foot) and in my backI smoke 15-20 cigs per dayI am female, 37 yrs oldAn EMG 4 years ago after I had numbness in my hand showed some nerve issue in my neck--went for PT.An MRI 10 years ago showed a slight bulging disc and dengerative disc disease but the recent MRI showed NOTHING!I had a child 2 1/2 years ago and they found I had anemia and gestational diabetes, but my recent blood work tested negative.Since the birth of my child, I have hyperpigmentation on the upper lip and the littlest scratch (doesn't have to break the skin) leaves a dark scar on me.Please HELP!!",
