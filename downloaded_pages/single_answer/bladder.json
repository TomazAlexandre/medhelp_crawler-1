            "answer": "HiAtonic bladder, or flaccid bladder, occurs when the bladder becomes dilated and fails to empty properly. The dilated bladder can be stretched by excess urine buildup, leading to overflow leakage and damage to the bladder walls. Some of the causes are neurogenic, Diabetes, back injuries and multiple sclerosis.Regular catheterization by the patients is used to empty the bladder before overflow leakage or stretching occurs.Some of the other measures are : Cred\u00e9 which is\u00a0\u00a0bladder voiding technique in which the patient manually presses down on the bladder to squeeze the urine out of the bladder. Another technique is valsalva which can also force the urine out of the bladder.Some of the limited surgical options available are:Bladder augmentation : which increases the bladder's storage capacity and hence lengthens the time periods between catheter use.Mitrofanoff procedure:\u00a0\u00a0which creates a passage through the abdominal wall and can make catheterization easier by allowing the patient to do so through the abdomen instead of the urethra.Surgical option of wrapping the bladder in latissimus dorsalis muscle: Here the muscle is transferred using microsurgical methods. It is a major surgery having a success rate of 20-25%.You should ask your doctor about these options and also the effect of botulinum toxin A injections in the bladder muscle which is showing some positive results in atonic bladder.Regards.",

    "question": "I have an Atonic bladder, I self catheterise and also suffer from recurring UTI. I have now been told that the lining of my bladder has gone, I am in constant pain but my consultant is going to give me a temporary lining for my bladder. I always seem to have problems with the bladder, I cant empty my bladder but we dont know why, I have had no trauma to the back. Can anything be done to give me some degree of normal life e.g a new bladder or repair my own bladder. I am 50 years old. I hope you can help me and look forward to receiving a reply. Thankyou. Regards Jan.",
