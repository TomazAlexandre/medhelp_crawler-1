            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question.\u00a0\u00a0Most common form is a peripheral neuropathy and occurred by deterioration in the nerve function at the limbs. It represents with symptoms of loss of sensation (or pins and needles like) in the arms, hands, legs and feet. Since there are many causes of neuropathy, hence treatment involves seeking these conditions out and correcting any underlying problem such as poor sugar control in diabetes in order to get a relief in your symptoms. Unfortunately, there is no permanent cure of neuropathy but symptomatic relief can be provided. Hope this helps.",

The centarl canal demensions are adequate and the neural foramina are patent bilaterally.Mild degenerative changes are noted in the facet joints.L2-L3: Central disc desiccation is seen without loss of disc height. There is a smal synovial cyst, which extends posterior to the right facet joint.The central canal dimensions and neural foramina are adequate.L1-L2: Central disc desiccation seen without other significant abnormality.The bone marrow signal intensity is homogeneous.The Conus Medullaris is identified at the T12-L1 level.I was also diagnosed with with a severe case of shingles which appeared on my lower back and buttocks then going down to my feet.
