    "question": "Hey! I posted symptoms on here saying i was suffering from some of diabetes symptoms awhile ago - but, the thirst has sort of died down, but i still have some of the same symptoms... like one night i had a piece of pizza and then like 3 hours later i was hungry... and it seems like i just started to fade away (get really tired) and then i ate some pasta and felt a little better. I guess i im still thirsty most of the time, I think ive just became use of it? I guess i dont know what yo do?",
