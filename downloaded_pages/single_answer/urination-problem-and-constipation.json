            "answer": "Hi,It seems you have got hemorrhoids/piles which come out when you are straining a lot at the time of passing stools due to the severe constipation you have got. Well, constipation is never a good thing to have as it can lead to so many other problems. Some simple remedies which I can recommend are taking adequate fluids, eating raw vegetables/salads/fruits, drinking a glass of milk while going to bed, making sure you are doing adequate exercise. I think these simple measures are enough to correct the same. However, I\u2019ll also suggest you to get your blood sugar tested as Diabetes mellitus is one of the important causes of severe constipation.I\u2019ll suggest you to consult a Surgeon and get yourself evaluated.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted.Kind Regards.",
