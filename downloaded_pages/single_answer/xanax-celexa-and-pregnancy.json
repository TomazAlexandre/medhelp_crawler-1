            "answer": "I wish I had the answer you are looking for. If you look at the fine print in each of these medications it will say to stop if pregnant because there is not enough experience to prove that it will not be harmful.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, as you say, you need something. You have to come to some reasonable compromise with your doctor about what is best, I can't make that decision or propose a clear answer.",

    "question": "I have tried psychotherapy in many occasions and unfortunately it does not seem to help me. I do know that my grandfather suffered from this disorder and two of my aunts did as well. Could it be genetic ?? They have now prescribed Celexa...Is that safe during pregnancy ?? I know that they rather you not take Xanax during pregnancy, but I think that for me the benefits would outweigh any risk....I know that during pregnancy the best thing would be to be on NO medications. I would literally go insane, and wouldn't that hurt my baby more ?\u00a0\u00a0I wish that the therapy would have helped.....I have tried it in many occasions throughout my life and it did nothing for me. I am so scared to add more medication into my body which may not work...and then have to stop it and go through the withdrawal of it if I do get pregnant. Why don't they treat this disorder as any other...like diabetes or high blood pressure?? They depend on their meds everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I am treated more like an addict then a person with a disororder! Any suggestions on how to talk to my doctor about this situation ??\u00a0\u00a0Does Celexa make you gain weight ?? I know these are so many questions to answer....but I am running out of answers... and time as far as being a mommy goes....Please help !",
