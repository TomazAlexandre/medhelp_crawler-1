            "answer": "Definitely have your wife follow instructioms from her cardiologist! ! That is not something you ever want to risk. Also, going a week with out it,\u00a0\u00a0then uunder going surgery, in my eyes,\u00a0\u00a0could cause her to possibly have issues with her heart during surgery. Surgery alone poses a possible risk for anyone,\u00a0\u00a0but that risk goes up when there are other health issues. She will be put to sleep, slowing her heart rate down. It is just too much of a risk. I would speak with the Dr wanting to do surgery,\u00a0\u00a0at again tell him the cardiologist is totally against it, and ask if there are any other options, as far as, medication before or during surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Any Dr would be crazy to perform surgery on someone with heart issues, and this is not even a primary physIcian, so he Is not fully aware of her hEalth history.",

    "question": "My wife fell and broke her arm in at least three places that I know of. She is 56 years old and she is diabetic. She also has a mechanical aortic heart valve and is on warfarin. The orthopedic doctor wants to surgically repair her elbow but says she needs to stop her warfarin for one week before her surgery. Our primary care doctor who is a cardiologist recommends against the surgery and says the risks(Infection, no warfarin, heart valve, diabetes) outweigh the benefits of surgery. Who do we believe? Thank You.",
