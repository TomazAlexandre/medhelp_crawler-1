            "answer": "Hello!Usually the skin around the vagina in women is darker than elsewhere on the body. It is perfectly normal. There are two conditions that can cause excessive darkening like acanthosis nigrans and haemochromatosis.It causes dark brown areas of skin mostly under the arms, vulva etc.It may be associated with diabetes, obesity and PCOD etc.Haemochromatosis is caused due to altered iron metabolism. If you think that you have any of these conditions mentioned above it is best to consult a doctor. I do hope it helps.Take care and regards!",
