            "answer": "My cholesterol levels sky-rocketed before I was dx'd with hypoT and Hashi's, also.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor also insisted that I go on cholesterol med and I refused because it seems that once on those meds, they never want to let you come off them.Hypothyroidism can cause cholesterol levels to go high, but my triglycerides weren't as high as yours.\u00a0\u00a0I think that has to be a decision YOU make based on how you feel.My cholesterol levels, including triglycerides all began coming down after a few months on synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0I'm\u00a0\u00a0now on both levothyroxine and cytomel and my cholesterol levels are all in the normal range......\u00a0\u00a0 BUT - just because it worked out that way for me, doesn't mean it will work that way for you.I also went through a stress test with flying colors, echocardiogram showed small leak in one valve but not to worry about at this point.\u00a0\u00a0Cardiologist suggested that I try red yeast rice to keep cholesterol in line ---- pcp did NOT like that (of course, he wanted to Rx Crestor), but I went with the red yeast rice.\u00a0\u00a0I take it only a couple of times a week.\u00a0\u00a0Levels will be checked again in a couple of months.......I am also not diabetic; however, suspecting \"pre-diabetes\".\u00a0\u00a0Good luck with whatever you decide.",

    "question": "I am 63 year old male, type 2 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Recently diagnosed as hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Recent blood work shows A1C at 5.8, cholesterol within normal limits except for slightly low HDL.\u00a0\u00a0Triglycerides 370.\u00a0\u00a0Here's my question:I have learned by my own research that hypothyroid can cause high triglycerides.\u00a0\u00a0Doc wants me to take synthroid (sp?) AND medicine to control triglycerides.Is it a feasible course of action to work on the thyroid normalization first, THEN add the triglyceride medication, or is beginning both a better way to go?\u00a0\u00a0Seems that if the thyroid is taken care of there is a reasonable chance for the trig's to decrease.\u00a0\u00a0I have *never* had trig's this high.Have also lately had PVC, which can possibly be due to hypothyroid, right?\u00a0\u00a0Nuclear stress test is completely normal, except for the irregular beat.\u00a0\u00a0No evidence of CAD.Is my position on medication feasible?",
