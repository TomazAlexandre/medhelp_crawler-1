            "answer": "If the actual thick vessel is what is hurting you, then you should see your doctor urgently so that the doctor can examine you and give you her diagnosis.With regard to the pain with urination this is highly like to be because of the urinary infection and even a possibility of kidney stones travelling down.\u00a0\u00a0Kidney stones can be as small as a grain of sand.Because the doctor did find blood in your urine specimen, you really need a referral to a urologist.\u00a0\u00a0Even when the infection has cleared and the blood has gone, you need an investigation to make sure that there is no problem with your prostate gland.To help ease the pain with urinating, you can try drinking a mugful of water with a teaspoonful of Bicarbonate of Soda.\u00a0\u00a0You can have a drink of this 1 every hour for 3 hours only.\u00a0\u00a0This will neutralise the acidic urine that is likely to be causing the pain.Because you are in so much pain when you urinate, I suggest that you urinate into a clean glass jar and observe the urine for any signs of sediment or sand.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately kidney stones do not cause any problems at all and you wouldn't know that you had one unless you had imaging done.\u00a0\u00a0They only cause lots of problems though when they do start to move.Diabetes should not stop you from having sex with your wife.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately having diabetes, the nerves can get damaged (neuropathy) from not controlling the sugar levels properly and this in turn will cause lack of sensations where you would like to have it when performing sexual acts.Losing libido can be caused by other issues and you should speak to your doctor about this.\u00a0\u00a0It may be that your hormone levels are too low and\u00a0\u00a0your doctor can take a blood test to check your hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0If it is found that your testosterone levels are too low, your doctor can prescribe a testosterone gel that you apply to parts of your body (not the genitals) to bring your levels up again.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, do not attempt to have any sex until you are completely well again.Bear in mind too, that should you experience not being able to urinate properly or dribbling again, make an urgent appoint to see your doctor and ask to be referred to the urologist for further investigation.\u00a0\u00a0These types of symptoms usually indicate that there is a problem with the prostate and that it could be enlarged.Because you have diabetes, do not neglect any urinary issues.I know that at this moment in time it is very painful for you to urinate, but do make sure that you drink plenty of water.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking the water will help to clear up the infection.\u00a0\u00a0You need to drink at least 2 litres of water a day - this is what is usually recommended, but your doctor or urologist may advise you to drink more, so always follow the advise you are given by the medical profession.You can contact your doctor's surgery urgently and let the doctor know of your immediate problem if this has worsened since you saw her.If you find that you are not able to urinate at all when you have an urge to urinate and notice that your belly starts to expand, go to the ER straight away.Wishing you a speedy recovery.",

    "question": "A couple of days ago i had sex with my wife after 2 1/2 years due to the fact that i was diagnosed with diabetes which led to my sexual appertite dramatically dropping. However when my wife and i became intermit i becme over excited and got to the point of ejaculation but did not release any fluid. A couple of days went by and i started to have pain in the penis area, at first not bad but it took 2 days for me to not be able to urinate properly (dribble) and causes me great discomfort. I went to see a local doctor and she told me i had an infection, noticed a bit of blood in my urine test and gave cepalexin 500gram medication which i am to take 2 pils for times a day, 2 hours apart till the perscription is done ( which i recieved yesterday ) i have however noticed a thick vessel protruding slightly from the top of my shaft to about 3-4mm down the shaft. The pain is unbearable and i need to urinate at least every 1/2 hour. I am desperate for some guidance! Can anyone help me?",
