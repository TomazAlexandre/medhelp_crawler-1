    "question": "Hey ladies,Hope y'all r doin ok. I am 36 weeks and 5 days tomor. I go to my high risk dr two hrs away. Welllll, I had a NST on monday. He was very non responsive. Sooo got sent to ultrasound right then he got a 6/8 on his BPP bio physical profile. It is an ultrasound they measure his fluid, movement and his practice breathing. So he wasn't doin the breathing part, so my dr called next morning said go to hospital right away he didn't pass the test. So I go in to labor and delivery. Do anotherrr NST he only had one exceleration. Then another BPP got 6/8 againnn. Still no breathing. By that time im nervous, worried all night. They only let me go cus the NST barely passed the test. So then had to go in again today. the NST was ok, and by the lastttt second he got a 8/8 but this time he wasn't moving. I am almost 37 weeks and he's 7 lbs 9 oz alreaddddy. The plan was to induce me 37-38 weeks possibly 39 depending on the numbers. Well his tests are soooo inconsistent I have a feeling they MAYYY induce tomorrow. As I said I have to travel 2 hrs. Im going to bring babys and my stuff to be prepared just in caseee. They r doing another NST there tomorrow. And see how my numbers are. They aren't aware of everything happeneing with the inconsistent tests here so what do y'all think?? Do you think there is a chance ill be induced. I have high blood pressure and jusssst got put on diabetes meds last week. My morning #s r lil high. And also my weight im a big girl. Let me know what your opinions are. IM FREAKED OUTTT. His head is looooow. Lots of pressure. He's checkin my cervix too tomorrow",
