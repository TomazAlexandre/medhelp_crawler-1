            "answer": "What I have to say isn't written in stone and should only be taken as a warning.With that said, I have had the pain you are describing, and an ECG, along with a simple blood test, showed it was a heart attack.I also have CHF, along with ESRD(GFR of 8%), and my heart is weak and enlarged.\u00a0\u00a0My EF is 20%, and next week I'll have a BiV/ICD installed.\u00a0\u00a0So, I feel that I've learned a few things about the heart and kidneys, with everything I've gone through.You don't say whether you're female or male, but the back pain is indicative of a female heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0They don't know why, but when a female suffers a heart attack, most of the time the pain is described as having someone sinking an axe in the middle of the back of the person experiencing the pain.Instead of lying down to take a nap, you should be calling 911 and getting to the nearest ER, ASAP.\u00a0\u00a0So, if it happens again have yourself checked by a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You are fortunate you awoke from your nap.You need to know that each time you suffer a heart attack, that your heart is damaged.\u00a0\u00a0Even though the pain went away on it's own, it doesn't matter, there is damage done to the heart.\u00a0\u00a0Also, with that type of problem, you could suffer sudden death, and it doesn't have to be that way.\u00a0\u00a0There are many treatments for the disorder, including a BiV/ICD that can either restart your heart, if needed, or keep it beating at a normal pace.So, please, next time don't lay down, get on the phone and call for help.I hope the best for you.",
