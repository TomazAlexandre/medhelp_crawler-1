            "answer": "Hello,What you are having is premature ejaculation. Premature or early ejaculation can be caused by both psychological (in most of the cases) and pathological factors. Psychological factors are hesitation, anxiety, guilty feelings during masturbations. Pathological causes include abnormal hormone level, reflex activity of ejaculatory system, diabetes, thyroid problems etc.At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors with your partner. You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved.In case the symptoms persist then get an evaluation done from a urologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
