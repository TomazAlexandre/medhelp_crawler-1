            "answer": "No, your husbands diabetes is not the reason for yeast infections nor can it cause it.Does your husband use a condom? If so, condoms can promote yeast infections in two different ways. First, a lot of condoms come packaged with a lubricant that contains nonoxynol-9, a spermicide that may kill the HIV virus. Several recent studies have shown that nonoxynol-9 is linked to yeast infections. If you suspect this is your problem, try using a condom that doesn't have a spermicidal lubricant, and use a different spermicide or additional barrier protection. Condoms can also cause yeast infections if you are allergic to latex, although this is less common. If this is the case, don't give up hope on practicing safer sex. You may want to try some of the newer plastic (polyurethane) condoms for boys or girls.",
