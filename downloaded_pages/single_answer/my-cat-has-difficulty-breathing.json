    "question": "My cat is about 10 years old and overweight. She has been experiencing some difficulty with her breathing. Sometimes she starts coughing and it almost sounds like i can her fluid there..like pneumonia or something. She does this a couple times a day and i'm concerned. It also looks like she has extra weight under her neck and i wonder if something is choking her..could it be allergies? Any help would be appreciated..i will be taking her back soon for another check-up but was hoping for some answers here as well. Thanks",
