I have aches and pains at different parts of my body at different times. I get acid reflux and have problems with digestion. I had ear, nose and throat problems as a child. I have muscle spasms, twitches, anxiety, butterflies/nerves on edge constantly. I feel I want to vomit especially in crowded rooms even after a few bites. I get overheated and sweat, palpitations, nausea, diarrhea and constipation at times and on different days. I lack concentration and balance and also spatial awareness at times. I get dry hands, feel thirsty. I get chronic tiredness especially after exercise and walking, standing or sitting for long periods. I have and diagnosed with ezcema, allergies, but also know I have arthritis (arthritic knee lump). My dad and brother both have diabetes. I have difficulty speaking, swallowing at times when my muscles just stop. Can you help at all with diagnosis?",
