            "answer": "Hi!Since you have a history of DVT, have purple patches and bruises, you probably have wide spread DVT, clots etc in major vessels of the leg. You need a dopplar study to find out the extent of involvement. High blood pressure, heart problems, kidney and liver dysfunction, and diabetes should be ruled out. Deep vein thrombosis is treatable, both medically and surgically. Stockings (tight compression) to press the lower extremity to aid circulation and medicines help many. If you take these medicines and wear the stockings, the pain will reduce considerably. Do not walk for prolonged time. Do not stand at one place for a long time. If you need to, then keep moving your legs. Avoid weight gain and eat healthy.The other possibility is pinched nerves in lower back. This can be diagnosed by MRI and nerve conduction studies.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
