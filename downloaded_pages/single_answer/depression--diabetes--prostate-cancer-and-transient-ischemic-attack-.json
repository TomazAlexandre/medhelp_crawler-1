            "answer": "Have you talked to his doctor about any possible chemical or brain changes that may have been caused by the mini-stroke? Depression is common after strokes and some his anti-depression meds may need to be changed now. It seems that this needs to be addressed before any other health issues can be helped. I would encourage you to call his doctor and tell him that your dad is not helping himself and that his behavior is dangerous to his other conditions and ask him to evaluate whether the depression meds need to be changed. Then of course, he needs to be seen by his doctor.As for changing his diet, perhaps one of you kids could do some grocery shopping for him, only buying things that you think would be healthy. If something is going on in his brain that is affecting his emotions and his energy levels, he may not be able to think clearly or to have the energy to help himself, and one of you may need to take charge of at least his grocery shopping to do the thinking for him. If healthy foods are all that are available at mealtimes, he is more likely to eat them. Someone could also perhaps prepare some healthy meals for him and freeze them for him to take out to eat.The not caring seems to be more of a symptom of depression than anything, and I would really approach his doctor about that first of all.",

    "question": "My father had been diagnosed with diabetes about 5 years ago (I'm not sure if it's type 1 or type 2). He's been on medications for depression and anxiety for about 25 years. Last September he suffered a transient ischemic attack (or a mini-stroke). A few months ago he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and has just completed radiation treatment. He also has high blood pressure. He's 68 years old and lives by himself, and since the mini-stroke he just seems not to care about anything. His house is a disaster, all he seems to want to do is eat and sleep. He has not altered his diet or lifestyle to aid in his recovery. I feel that there's only so much my sister and I can do for him, and we seem to be at our wits end. I need advice on how to help him, as it's becoming harder and more frustrating to help someone who does not seem to want to help himself.",
