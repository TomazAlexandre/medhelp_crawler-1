    "question": "I have had a stabbing pain in my upper left abdomen for over a week.\u00a0\u00a0I seems to happen more when I move - as in leaning forward or backward while sitting. I have extensive diabetic neuropathy and wonder if it is related to that. I don't have an appendix and it doesn't seem to be gall bladder.\u00a0\u00a0Don't want to pay for a bunch of tests if it will be another, \"just something related to the diabetes or lupus\" and nothing to be done for it.. Any ideas?",
