            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include psychological issues such as stress, depression, neurogenic disorders, peyronie's disease, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. You may consider getting this evaluated by a urologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "Hello doctor,My problem is that when I go to the toilet to pass a bowel movement, I ejaculate. There is no pain, pleasure or any pelvic floor contractions. This usually happens after I am aroused and a few hours later pass a stool. How can I stop this, I do not want to ejaculate, it is incredibly frustrating. I do kegal exercises but it doesn\u2019t help. Is there anything I can do to improve the reabsorbtion of the prostate fluids after arousal, the lymph system surroundings? Is there sperm contacted in this type of ejaculation. What else can I do to stop this?Thank you for your time and advice.",
