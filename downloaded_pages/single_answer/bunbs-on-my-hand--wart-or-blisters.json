            "answer": "Hi!Pinkish brown (orange like) or skin colored raised patches with moist surface can be HPV infection. It can also be an allergic reaction to any chemical, contact dermatitis or eczema. Other possibilities are dermatitis herpetiformis, chronic bullous dermatosis, cutaneous radiation syndrome (following a radiation--maybe for cancers or X-rays or CT scans), and Epidermolysis Bullosa. Diabetes, psoriasis, and hypothyroidism are the other possibilities. You need to see a doctor for confirmed diagnosis. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have two whitey orangey lumps on my hand, both on the palm, and they both appeared one morning. I initially thought they could be warts, but they don't have a rough surface or the cauliflower like show, which are the descriptions i found on the internet.I think they are filled with fluid, but look like no blister I've had before. Any ideas on what they could be?",
