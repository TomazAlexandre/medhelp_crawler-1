    "question": "I am 8 weeks post pineal cyst resection for 4th cranial nerve palsy. I had a supracerebellar infratentorial sitting craniotomy. Very grateful that I have correction of vertical double vision.\u00a0\u00a0Recovery somewhat complicated with a seizure, ataxia, and diabetes insipidus.\u00a0\u00a0After brief rehab ataxia resolved, DI resolved with DDAVP given only a few times.\u00a0\u00a0I feel great with no headaches and only fatigue/stamina issues and some transient issues getting my words out with overexertion.\u00a0\u00a0I have noticed that I have an area of blurring in my eyes that was not there pre-op.\u00a0\u00a0This seems worse in the mornings but I do notice it throughout the day as well.\u00a0\u00a0I was on steroids post-op and tapered off with no problems.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to explain but I notice the blurring in both eyes.\u00a0\u00a0When I look at an Amsler grid I notice paracentral scotomas on the outer half of the chart with bowing out of the outside lines.\u00a0\u00a0This seems somewhat transient and more \"defined\" at times.\u00a0\u00a0I am\u00a0\u00a0so grateful for the correction of my double vision and although the recovery was difficult (pneumocephalus, seizue, DI, ataxia) I would do it all over again. I saw 2 neuro-oph. who both diagnosed dorsal midbrain syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0My question is probably stupid but should I even mention this issue to my neurosurgeon?\u00a0\u00a0could this be swelling?\u00a0\u00a0I had several post-op scans that did not show any problems.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to say when this started because initially after the surgery I still had the double vision some days, with blurring and focus issues on other days.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't really start reading until a few weeks ago.Again I am so happy with my results that I don't want to seem like I am complaining or bringing up a new issue.\u00a0\u00a0I am anxious to return to work ASAP and don't want to hold up my progress.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
