            "answer": "Yes, you are at risk.\u00a0\u00a0My mother lost her first child to it, but went on to have a healthly baby next (me), so don't get too worried.\u00a0\u00a0I also developed preeclampsia with my pregnancy, but careful monitoring and deciding to induce 2 weeks early ended with my very healthy son.\u00a0\u00a0First, your doctor should be monitoring your blood pressure (if this is difficult, use the blood pressure 'self-test' at the pharmacies).\u00a0\u00a0If your BP is regularly high, make sure you see your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0If you are swelling, put your self on bed-rest; as much as possible, elevate your feet - and I MEAN at every opportunity. If you are overweight, consider the possibility of gestational diabetes (this was my prob). Controlling my blood sugar and the steps I said above went a long way to having a pretty good preganancy.\u00a0\u00a0It was only in the last week or so my BP shot up; then I was confined to bed rest (doctor's orders!\u00a0\u00a0and incredibly boring after a day or so. only out of bed for the bathroom....).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, educate yourself and take steps to monitor yourself and ease the strain on your body. Good luck to you!",

    "question": "Two years ago I lost my first baby to Preeclampsia. During this time I had an excessive amount of swelling. I am currently 5 months with my second child and the excessive swelling has returned. So my question is: Is the excessive swelling that is occurring now a sign that I may be at risk for preeclampsia once again?",
