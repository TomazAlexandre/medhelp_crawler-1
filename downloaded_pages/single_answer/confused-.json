            "answer": "Hi!If you have a scab and foul smell around your vaginal area, then this can be due to fungal or bacterial infection or due to bacterial vaginosis. STTI/STD can start even months after asexual contact, so if you have been sexually active, and had unprotected sex, then possibility needs to be ruled out.A foul smelling discharge from vagina can be due to bacterial vaginosis, candidia infection, or STDs like trichomoniasis etc. It can also be due to inflammation of the cervix or cervicitis. Foreign body in vagina like lodged condom, forgotten tampon can also be the cause. Diabetes too can increase the chances of vaginal infections and foul smelling discharge. You will need to consult a gynecologist to get the vaginal discharge tested through swab tests and PAP smears. It is difficult to find the cause on net. Correct treatment will follow correct diagnosis. Take care!",
