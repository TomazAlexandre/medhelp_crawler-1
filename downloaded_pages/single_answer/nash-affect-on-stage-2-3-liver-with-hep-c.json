            "answer": "You are doing the right things by dieting and losing weight. We like Sugarbusters and South Beach, because of the lower carb issues. We also use insulin sensitizers like pioglitazone and metformin to get the fat out of the liver before we re treat someone like you. You may want to ask your MD about that. Good luck and congrats on the weight loss!DTD",
