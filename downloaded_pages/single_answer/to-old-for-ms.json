            "answer": "Hi Debbie!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Yes, MS begins any time between 20-50 years of age, and usually symptoms are often too minute and go unnoticed. So, it is possible that you have a mild form of MS that went undetected.Muscle weakness can be true type as seen in muscular dystrophy, inflammatory myopathy, or neuro-muscular myopathy (myasthenia gravis). It can also be a perceived muscular weakness as seen in chronic fatigue syndrome, electrolyte imbalance, hypothyroidism, low iron, diabetes and dehydration. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lupus, and Lyme\u2019s can also cause muscle weakness. So these conditions should be looked for. Please consult your doctor regarding these possibilities. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
