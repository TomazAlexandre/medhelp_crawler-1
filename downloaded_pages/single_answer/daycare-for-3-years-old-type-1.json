            "answer": "Dear galosh,i know what you mean, a friend of mine has a diabetic child in the first grade and they have to send him to a special school in the city that has nurses familiar with diabetes. They had to go through a special day care as well. Part of it is because even though juvenile diabetes affects children the most it is still a rare thing. Type one diabetes can present itself up to age thirty so it isn't always young juveniles that get it. i would contact the local school district to where you are moving for advice as they would be the most in the know of such needs. i wish you well, bret",
