            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Tinnitus (ringing in ear) and certain neurological disorders such as paresthesia (caused by diabetes, pinched nerves, Lyme\u2019s, lupus, thyroid disorders etc) and central neuropathic pain are similar in many ways. So, yes, you can suffer from tinnitus and pain and/or numbness at the same time or one may precede the other. This is because the same part of central nervous system controls the impulses from the auditory nervous system and somatosensory systems. Changes in the brain or these systems can cause a cross-connection (just a term used to simplify the system) between the two seemingly unrelated systems of the body.So you need to check for diabetes, autoimmune diseases and thyroid disorders. Other possibilities are vasovagal attacks and transient ischemic attacks (less likely as symptoms persist for 2-3 days). Please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hey all,I found this site while Googling my symptoms. I have read a few pages regarding some of the same symptoms but they didn't appear to be helpful. I'm going to give it a shot on here.I'm 31 years old and have always considered myself a healthy man. I don't exercise on a daily basis but that's partly due to my body structure. I am 5'11 and 140lbs. I've always been skinny so I have always had the mindset that I don't need to exercise. I'm am well aware that has been the dumbest outlook on my health so I am now trying to start exercise regularly.About 2-3 months ago I start to notice that my left side would start to get numb. At first I tried to just ignore it, mainly because I wasn't feeling any direct pain. The episodes would last within 24 hours and happen so randomly (every 3-9 days it would happen) with no episode ever lasting more than 2-3 days max. Here are all of my complaints:- numbess on whole left side- intermittent ringing in ears- anxiety (as doctor is stating)My wife (married 2.5 years) grew concerned enough to overrule me and force me to see a doctor. I don't like going to doctors so it was a difficult step. My PCP had no idea so he referred me to a neurologist. The neurologist ordered an MRI of the brain in December and kept throwing out MS symptoms. My wife was ecstatic to hear that (as you can only imagine). He brought me back in to state that there didn't appear to be anything abnormal (it was a closed MRI machine). He then did bloodwork this past month, only to tell me that my blood also appears to be fine and he is ruling out MS, Lupis, B12 deficiency, and/or a chemical imbalance.I went back to my PCP this week and he prescribed\u00a0\u00a0me with Buspirone (anxiety) and Zaleplon (sleep) medicine. Just to see if that helps. I will being those medications tonight.I don't make a lot of money and it's difficult to keep going to the doctor when I feel like he's just throwings darts everywhere and doesn't appear to be finding a solution. Don't get me wrong, I understand that it can be extremely hard to diagnosis certain illness/disases so please don't think I am disrepecting doctors or there procedures. If you can offer any type of advice it would be appreciative. I would consider myself a fun-natured person and have an extrmely positive outlook on life. My wife is expected to deliver our first child in April and want this to be the last thing she needs to deal with.Thanks for listening:) and open to your ideas/thoughts/opinions",
