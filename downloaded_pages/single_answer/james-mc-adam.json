Eating too much sugar will cause a variety of health issues, like unusual mood and behavior patterns. Your partner needs to see his doctor for re-evaluation and possible adjustments to his diabetes medication. Also, a check for bipolar disorder as it causes mood swings alternating rapidly between depression and euphoria. Good luck",
