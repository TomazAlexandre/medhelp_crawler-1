            "answer": "Hi there!How are you? By a big stomach do you mean you want to decrease your waist size or decrease your diet? Stomach ulcers, severe acidity, gastroesophageal reflux disease can all result in increased food cravings. Diabetes mellitus, worm infestations and hyperthyroidism are other conditions which can make one hungry several times a day. If you have increased appetite you may need to discuss the above mentioned possibilities with your doctor. If you want to lose belly fat reduce your caloric requirement. Start your day by drinking lemon juice in warm water. Have fruits with lots of vitamin C in breakfast that will help you cut fats as vitamin C is a fat burner. Fats have double the calories of proteins and carbohydrates. Reduce the consumption of saturated fats like cheese, butter, cream, lard, red meat. You can take lean meat, olive oil, and grilled fish. Consume whole foods like whole cereals, lentils, nuts, fruits, vegetables and eggs which are rich in essential minerals, macronutrients and vitamins. Exercise daily for 30-40 minutes like walking or aerobic exercise. You can try doing some stomach crunches or sit ups for a toned stomach. A calculative and disciplined approach will definitely prove useful.Take care and good luck!",
