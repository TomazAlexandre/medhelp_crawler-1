    "question": "hi, ever since I was diagnosed with lupus and had a hysterectomy and type 1 diabetes I have no desire for intercourse or to be touched. It hurts soooo much when my husband penetrates that the skin tears inside and I bleed and can hardly wipe even after that. I've tried ky jelly to no avail. I can't take hormones because of the lupus. ANY IDEAS?????? Thanks",
