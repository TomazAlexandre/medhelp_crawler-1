            "answer": "It appears all beta blockers can cause hyperkalemia (higher than normal potassium level).\u00a0\u00a0Hyperkalemia secondary to beta-adrenergic receptor blockade can occur in 1% to 5% of patients and is more likely to occur in non-cardio-selective beta-blockers versus cardio-selective beta-blockers.\u00a0\u00a0Underlying cause can be excessive potassium intake, disturbed cellular uptake of potassium, or impaired renal excretion of potassium.My system is periodically tested to monitor renal excretion of potassium as well as liver functionality.\u00a0\u00a0An ACE inhibitor as well as a beta blocker can raise potassium to an abnormal level.Hyperkalemia has been reported in 1.3% (serum potassium greater than 6.0 mEq/mL) to 10% (greater than 5.3 mEq/mL) of patients. This case report describes hyperkalemia in a 72-year-old female with diabetes and underlying chronic renal failure receiving metoprolol. Chronically, potassium balance is maintained by the kidney. In acute situations, such as a larger than normal potassium load, both the kidney and the body's cells react to maintain normal potassium levels.",
