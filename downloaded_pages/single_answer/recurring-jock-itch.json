            "answer": "Hello,Various reasons for recurrent or persistent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance (again possible as only one drug- Lamisil is being used), co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Treatment resistance can be overcome by applying a cream with a combination of antifungals (Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1% and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%). Get your blood sugar tested, fasting, 2 hours after food and if these are high then glycosylated hemoglobin to see overall sugar status in last 3 months.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "For about 3 years now I have had a recurring rash/infection on my inner thigh. By all appearances and symptoms it is jock itch, for the first year it kept occurring it would go away after one full tube of Lamisil. It has steadily become more resistant to anti-fungals. Last time it took a prescription strength topical and oral medication course, on top of 2 tubes of Lamisil to \"cure\" it. It does not occur in the winter, and I follow all(except not being overweight) recommendations to prevent jock itch, but every time it starts to get more moist out, the cycle begins to occur again.Is there something else this could be besides jock itch? Is there anything at all to do to further prevent this infection? Anyone had a similar condition?",
