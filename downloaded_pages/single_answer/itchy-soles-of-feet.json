            "answer": "Hi,As a diabetic, is your blood sugar level well controlled?Are you complying with lifestyle and diet modifications?I suggest that you take extra care of your feet. Is the skin of the foot dry? Is there any visible abrasion, wound, rash or discolorations in the area ? Use a mild and light cream over the area to moisturize it. Inspect the area if there are any cuts or bruising. If there are any open wounds, a prompt consult with a physician is necessary and in cases like this do not apply anything on the foot.For intact and healthy skin, moisturize the skin with Vitamin E and other mild and unscented moisturizing creams that may be available OTC. You may ask your physician for any medications which will help alleviate the itchiness (eg antihistamines).Here is a url which may guide you on how to take care of your feet :http://www.diabetes.org/type-2-diabetes/foot-care.jsp",
