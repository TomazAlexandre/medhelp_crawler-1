    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I hope someone here can offer some insight.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 36, overweight - previously tested negative for diabetes (a year or so ago) and had a clear endoscopy a few years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I've recently had new symptoms, about 25 minutes after I eat something really sweet or a large amount of food I get extremely lightheaded, have never passed out, and then I immediately need to use the bathroom - almost like after you've taken a laxative.\u00a0\u00a0I've noticed this lightheadedness is not constant, it seems to come on more if I haven't eaten in a while.\u00a0\u00a0I had a clear cardiac workup recently because of a complicated pregnancy last year.\u00a0\u00a0I also had an incident where I was out walking, drank some cold water on an empty stomach and had the same lightheadedness?\u00a0\u00a0Any advice please?",
