            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease which presents with varying degrees of weakness of the muscles. This can be controlled with medical therapy such as anticholinesterase agents (neostigmine and pyridostigmine) and immunosuppressive drugs (prednisone, cyclosporine, and azathioprine). Anticholinesterase agents help improve neuromuscular transmission and increase muscle strength while immunosuppressive drugs improve muscle strength by suppressing the production of abnormal antibodies. Treatment depends on the severity of the weakness, which muscles are affected, and the individual's age and other associated medical problems such as diabetes. Talk to your doctor about this to clear any anxiety. Take care and best regards.",

    "question": "I have Myasthenia Gravis and type 2 diabetes. My doctor has prescribed Cyclosporine. Most people with MG that I have spoken to have been prescribed Celcept.\u00a0\u00a0My creatinine level is elevated to 1.6. What do you feel would be the reason my doctor would keep me on Cyclosporine\u00a0\u00a0instead of switching me to Celcept. The elevation of my creatinine is interfering with my current diabetes treatment.Thank you",
