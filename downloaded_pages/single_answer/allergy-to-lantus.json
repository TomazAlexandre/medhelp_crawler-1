    "question": "My 87 year old mother has developed a rash over all parts of her body. These itch and will bleed when she scratches them. They are getting progressively worse. Her family medical doctor has said it is due to bacteria on her skin. She has been treated with triamcinolone and he has reduced her Effexor thinking that is a likely cause. I was wondering however if Lantus could be the culprit since this seems to have gotten worse since she was switched to that.",
