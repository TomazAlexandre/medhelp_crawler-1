            "answer": "Hi!Generalized feeling of a burning sensation can be due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies (as in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s and lupus), pinched nerves, or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. In females above 40 years it can be a symptom of menopause or premenopause. Yes, shingles too is a possibility. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
