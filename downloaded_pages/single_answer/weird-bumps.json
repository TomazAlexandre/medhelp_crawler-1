            "answer": "Stop taking anything. You definitely have an allergy. Slowly ingest anything, wait for 1-20 mins. If anything appears, thats the allergen. Also if you have been on antibiotics you may have antibiotic poisoning. It takes up to 2 yrs to get your gut FLORA back into rhythm and to rid antibiotics. Use only natural antibiotic treatments before any conventional antibiotic. There is alot of natural alternatives. Please seek an natural ND dr. Allergys are life threatening . good luck",

    "question": "I developed these weird bumps on my Left hand over the last week. At first I thought it was just a Bee sting as, there was only one bump but, over the week two more appeared close by. Now there are more popping up. Some come and go as the day goes on but, three of them are sore and one scabbed as I picked at it (Not realising). I have looked up Scabies but it is only on my Left hand and only on my fingers at the moment.I really cannot afford to go to the doctor for him to tell me it's just something I can treat by myself.I do work with Very Young Children and use Chemicals throughout the day, sometimes without gloves. I also have had two Bugs one was diarrhea and the other was gassy and made you want to vomit ( I didn't Vomit). I did get these from the Creche I work at.They look like someone has pricked me with a needle a few times and a blood blister has formed but they are only the size of a needle prick.Any advice would help. Type 2 Diabetes runs in my Family and Asthma and I do have Very Mild Eczema when I am stressed or have dry skin.I do currently also have about 4 Warts on the opposite hand.",
