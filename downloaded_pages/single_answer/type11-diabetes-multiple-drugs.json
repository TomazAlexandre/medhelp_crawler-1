            "answer": "Are you seeing an endocrinologist or just a regular PCP? Endos are best qualified to manage diabetes medication. I would ask the doctor who prescribed the meds how you should take them. Also let him know you are quite low when you get up, especially if that 64 is typical. If you are 64 on awakening, you might have been lower during the night which is dangerous.How are your numbers two hours after all your meals? If they are high, then it might be time to start insulin. 7.3 is a bit high. If you have been type 2 for many years, eventually your body stops producing enough insulin on its own.",
