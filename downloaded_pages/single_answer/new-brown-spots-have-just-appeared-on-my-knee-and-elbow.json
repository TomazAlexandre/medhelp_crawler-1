    "question": "I have just noticed that I have a dark brown spot on my left elbow just above the joint that I first tried to wash off. It has been there about a week and doesn't hurt or cause any discomfort other than just worrying me as to where it came from and what caused it. The other spot is on my right knee and is about the size of a quarter. It is only about 2 days old as well. I am a little concerned as to what these spots are and what caused them. I have researched the net and only found a couple of cases like mine. I did go to my local doctor and he ran blood tests for addisons, diabetes, and possible other causes but no way to be certain without a byopsy, he said. Well, if anyone else has had a small brown to black spot pop up on their elbow or knee I'd like to know and what have you done about it. Also, if anyone has any advice as to what do I do now or next??? Concerned and WorriedThis discussion is related to/posts/show/244927.",
