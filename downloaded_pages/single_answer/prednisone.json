            "answer": "Hi!As a rule, steroids should help in any auto-immune disease, but there are exceptions. Like in diabetes, they increase blood glucose levels further. Thyroid antibodies may decrease, but may not treat Grave\u2019s. In Grave\u2019s they do not have any role except to treat redness of the eyes and post surgical inflammation. So, while steroids may control progression of GCA, they are unlikely to cause harm in other conditions. However, please do discuss with your treating doctor as he/she has to find the best way to treat all your conditions. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 52 yr old woman that has been diagnosed with Celiac, Graves, Diabetes, Ulcerative Colits and just recently Polymyalgia Rheumatica. My question is as I am now having to take prednisone to stop the risk of GCA I am worried as to how this will affect the other problems I have. I know it makes the blood sugars worse and I have to watch what I eat even more than usual but does it make things worse for my Graves. I have been on and off carbimazole for 10 years the last lot I had was 3 years ago. Will the prednisone suppress the immune system so that the thyroid antibodies will decrease? Thanks",
