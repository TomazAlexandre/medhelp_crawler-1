    "question": "I would like to find some cardio things to help my heart be more efficient.I am 61 years old, 5'5\", 220 lbs. and I have major arthritis in my left hip. I also have 10 fused disks. I am cane dependent. I can't walk more than a tenth of a mile without a brief rest. Pulse is 85-85 resting, BP is 70/110. I have no diabetes, my cholesterol is decent.I get out of breath fairly easily, but have no COPD. I have a mild valve-related murmur. However I have no plaque according to an angiogram I had last year. (False alarm heart attack scare due to chest pain.)Can anyone help me? Oh, I also have two artificial knees as well as all the hardware in my back. I'm not very flexible.",
