            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. If your liver enzymes are showing a progressive rise over time and are not showing any improvement it could be due to fatty liver changes. Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. This can progress to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. So, prevention or cure is by avoiding alcohol and treating diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hello Dr.I am trying to figure out why my liver enzymes are through the roof and all other tests are normal.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last year; I've had an ultrasound of the liver and surrounding organs, many different blood tests recently 12 vials, CT scan of the abdomen and liver.\u00a0\u00a0The drs say it could be a fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0I had been taking medication for rosata for many years; so I stopped using that and changed to a topical solution.\u00a0\u00a0The numbers haven't gone down.I do take valrex on occation when needed.\u00a0\u00a0I do take a womans vitamin everyday.\u00a0\u00a0Could these affect the count?History:\u00a0\u00a02005 my enzyme levels were normal.\u00a0\u00a02009 they started to rise and the last year the ast is at 182 far higher than it should.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am normally very active and have a high energy level but lately this has changed where i'm more fatigued and the whites in my eyes are showing a sign of yellowing.\u00a0\u00a0Starting in June through 2 weeks ago I had severe hot and cold flashes every hour on the hour.\u00a0\u00a0I was conserned and very uncomforatble with these and considered going to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0All my drs thought it may be pre-metapause.\u00a0\u00a0The reason I don't is back in July my gastro gave me an antibotic for the flashes and because I thought I could have an infection of some kind.\u00a0\u00a0I was having a pain in my lower left back.\u00a0\u00a0It went away after taking the antiboitics and the flashes stopped for about 2 weeks and then returned.\u00a0\u00a0So recently, I was thinking maybe a bladder or kidney infection but my doctor wouldn't treat with medication.\u00a0\u00a0It was unbearable so I took an antibotic that I had at my house for 5 days to see if\u00a0\u00a0it would help.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time I started taking Milk Thissal for Liver function.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure which one of these helped but the hot and cold flashes diminished and finally are gone.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still fatigued and the last blood test came back high again.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So I'm worried.Other things that could have caused something to trigger this?\u00a0\u00a0I have considered everything and don't know where to continue looking.I did go on a cruise in june of 2010,\u00a0\u00a0I had a colanocopy and a scope may 2011,\u00a0\u00a0I am allergic to latex and had a mirena put in 4years ago so I considering removing it, I am also highly lactose intolorant and it seems digestion has gotten much worse over the last 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0I had mono when I was a kid.This is where I'm at right now;\u00a0\u00a0I've spoke to my MD, my gyno, gastro and I am going to a liver specialist in February, which seems a long way off.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned about this dr wanting to do a biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0I have considered doing a liver cleanse and I am waiting for the package to come in.\u00a0\u00a0My Doctor said he didn't want me to do this until we find out what's happening.\u00a0\u00a0I can understand this but I would much rather try to cleanse the liver and see if the levels are still out of wack before doing a surgery. Do you agree?I am trying to eat healthy and drinking minimum alcohol, if any.\u00a0\u00a0Zumba 2-3 times a week to reduce weight.\u00a0\u00a0My dr said to loose about 20lb.\u00a0\u00a0Which isn't that much overweight to be causing such a high count but I'm trying.\u00a0\u00a0What are your recommendations?\u00a0\u00a06 more weeks is way too long to wait and do nothing.Sorry, I've written a book now.\u00a0\u00a0 I hope you can understand where I'm and give me some advise.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time!\u00a0\u00a0Kalena",
