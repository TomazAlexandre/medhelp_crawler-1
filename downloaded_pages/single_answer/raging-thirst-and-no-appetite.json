            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!This looks like diabetes insipidus which is a rare disease due to imbalance of the water cycle in the body. It can cause raging thirst, loss of appetite, poor sweating, fever, and generally causes a lot of urination. However if the water intake in not much or if te kidney is involved, then the urine output can decrease. Please consult an internal medicine specialist or talk to your doctor regarding this.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm going to see a doctor tomorrow (but I don't know how that will help, they rarely do much about anything - hopefully they will).I've been internet searching thirst and I can only come up with diabetes, but I've been frequently tested for diabetes, each time it came up with nothing.Does anyone recognise this collection of symptoms?- Raging constant thirst that can't be quenched- Slight temperature (38-39 centigrade)- No appetite, but can still force down some food with no rejection- Mild headaches- Dry mouth- Excessive sweating- Very little urination- On and off nauseaNormally a person would say \"you have flu or a cold\" but I lack some symptoms of these. I have plenty of energy, I don't feel tired or anything. My mind is a little out of focus but I think that's just the headache. I have not produced any more mucus than usual, and I don't have any cough or sore throat (except when it gets dry at night).I am female and 20 years old, and I am usually healthy in every way and don't have any outstanding medical problems.As I said, I will still be seeing a doctor tomorrow but perhaps someone here might be able to shed some light on this strange problem?",
