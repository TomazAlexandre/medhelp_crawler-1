    "question": "Can anyone tell me about living without a vena cava. I have many problems Atrial Fibulation, Deep vein Trombosis, diabetics and arthritis and I am always so worried because I am so short of breath all the time it's so bad that when I walk around I literally vomit. Now I am told that my vena cava was blocked for so long with a clot that it's all dried out so it does not work so they can't do any tests through the groin of my leg because of that. So if anyone can help me I would appreciate it.",
