            "answer": "Hello,Your situation is extremely concerning.\u00a0\u00a0Continued high blood sugars, in addition to causing the boils you are experiencing can also cause damage to the fine capilaries in your skin, killing them.\u00a0\u00a0The black spots could be signs of poor blood flow.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like something you need a Dr. to look at.Continued high blood sugars puts you at risk for many additional and life threatening complications.\u00a0\u00a0Getting it down is so important.\u00a0\u00a0Normal blood sugars are in the 80s to low 100s. Your blood sugar is 3 x normal.Do you have access to a Dr?\u00a0\u00a0You should be asking for help.\u00a0\u00a0Which country are you in?\u00a0\u00a0If the US, some other members may be able to offer advice on low cost services.With such high blood sugars I'd say that insulin would be the best treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Regular N and R insulins are available over the counter in most countries and are not expensive.\u00a0\u00a0Needles, though not recommended, can be reused as long as they are used only by you and careful technique is adopted to prevent contamination.However, insulin needs to be used with much care (ideally under experienced medical supervision), and you need to be able to test blood sugars to tell if it is working and to make sure you don't have lows.Two excellent books - maybe from your library - are \"using insulin\" by John Walsh and \"Think Like a Pancreas'.\u00a0\u00a0Another useful book is by Dr. Richard Bernstein and is called \"Diabetes Solution\" (get the 2011 editiion).Regarding diet, a low carb diet is very important to help reduce blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0This can be hard on a\u00a0\u00a0low budget.\u00a0\u00a0However, I'd say that eggs could be a mainstay. Meat and non-starchy veges could be a mainstay.\u00a0\u00a0Use local and in-season vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0If you are eating less carb then you need more fat.\u00a0\u00a0The cheaper cuts of meat are more fatty, but if you can cook them slowly they should be ok.Exercise after eating - 30 minutes after each meal, could also help bring blood sugars down, if you are able.Best wishes.\u00a0\u00a0Let us know how you go.",

    "question": "I am a diabetic with high blood glucose. My blood sugars are still running from 200 to 300. My insurance doesn't pay for my meds so I take the samples. I am a diabetic who's prone to having very large boils. I found out I was diabetic after having my first boil lance. Recently, my eating habits have changed because of the cost of food I usually eat in the afternoon or I drink protein shakes. I been practicing good hygiene by changing soaps, towels, and rags every time I bath. I have a big red spot under my right arm that itches and causes me a lot of pain. I put ointment on it at night with aloe vera and Medicated Powder during the day since I can't use deodorant. I'm trying to figure out what is this big red spot and could it have something to do with the skin infection? When I was giving a shot of antibiotics for the boils I notice I was getting black spots all over my skin. I'm thinking it's my diabetes affecting my skin. Does anyone have any helpful suggestions?",
