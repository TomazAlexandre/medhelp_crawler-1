But my BG's were still too high in the mornings so doctor had me increase to a 3rd Met tablet. After about 3 days of taking 3 tabs a day I started feeling nauseated, slight dizziness, diarrhea, and a little jittery.I kept a close check on my BG's and they were perfect. After two hours from eating it was 118. After getting up in the morning it was now down from 170 to 135. I was ecstatic.But this darn nauseous feeling just hung in there, wouldn't go away no matter what I did.I experimented a little. Went back to two tabs a day and it stopped. Started back up and the sickness came back. Now today I have my regular two tabs at night, one-half one hour after bfast, and my last half tablet with dinner. Most of my stomach upsetting has disappeared. It comes back a little here and there. It also helped to take some stomach relief like Maalox with them for me.The docs should have told you, but you can search the internet on side affects from Metformin, you'll find that stomach issues are actually quite common. The only way is to experiment when taking them or ask the doctor to change to a different kind of diabetes medicine. There are a few.",
