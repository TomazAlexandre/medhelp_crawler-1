            "answer": "Hi!If you have mild percussion myotonia then this can be due to several causes like muscular dystrophies. However, this finding alone is not diagnostic. You will need nerve conduction studies, EMGs, serum electrolyte level, and testing for peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s or lupus. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
