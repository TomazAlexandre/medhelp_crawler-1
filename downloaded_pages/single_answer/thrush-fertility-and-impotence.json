            "answer": "Two years is a long time to go with a thrush infection. Has your partner seen a doctor for other treatment options? You might have better luck visiting a dermatologist or urologist. Thrush typically does not cause infertility problems. However, given the length and severity of your partner's infection - the risk of infertility might be something the two of you should bring up to the doctor. It is unlikely that your partner will have to remove his foreskin if he receives appropriate treatment for the thrush.All the best..",

    "question": "My partner suffers badly with thrush from almost 2 years. It starts because of me so I know that he don\u2019t cheat on me. He is 31 years old and he has diabetes and his sugary blood keep thrush \u201calive\u201d. He went to a doctor and they tried pills first but it help only a little bit. The foreskin look really bad and my partner think its dead and the only way to sort this out is to cut it off. But my partner avoids this all the time. This thrush affects his libido and our sex life very much. We have sex only once in 6-8 months. I\u2019m thinking about starting a family but I\u2019m not sure if this will be possible. So the question what I\u2019ve is:Can these thrush cause problems with fertility? (I know diabetes can but I was pregnant with my partner on beginning of our relationship but I had miscarriage)Is it possible that this can cause a problem with impotence? Now or in future?Thank you for help. It\u2019s not easy to talk about it, it\u2019s so upsetting. I want to be with him but I need to know all these before I will start hoping to have a kids.",
