It may or may not be related to the surgery.I would suggest you to get your blood sugar levels checked as diabetes can cause skin numbness.A thorough clinical examination will help in making the exact diagnosis. Take care!",

    "question": "Last May I had surgery following a ruptured fallopian tube that caused a fair amount of internal bleeding. When I awoke from surgery there was a small (roughly 3x3 inch) spot of skin on my shoulder where the skin had gone numb and tingled with pain beneath the surface. While still in the hospital, I stretched my leg out and immediately felt a pain in my right inner thigh and went to rub it only to find that it too was painful underneath but the skin on top had gone numb. Doctors chalked it up to post-surgery recovery but feeling has never come back.Now it's been over a year and I ecently started experiencing some tenderness on a small spot of skin on my stomach and now it's gone numb. Neither myself nor my doctor can figure out what's wrong and I'm desperate to solve the mystery before anything else I don't want to go numb ( :/ ) goes numb.",
