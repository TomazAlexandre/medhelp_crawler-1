            "answer": "Hello,It is tough to be diagnosed with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If it is type 1 then it won't go away, even with healthy eating and exercise / weight loss - though these will definitely make it easier to manage.If it is Type 2, then weight loss and avoiding sweets and lots of carbs, and regular exercise can reverse the symptoms.Best thing to start with would be to start exercising at least 30 minutes a day.\u00a0\u00a0This can be brisk walking / slow jogging or whatever you enjoy.Then you need to strictly limit sodas and sweets, and eat only small serves of things like bread and pasta, and rice.\u00a0\u00a0You can replace these with veges.\u00a0\u00a0Can your parents help?\u00a0\u00a0maybe your whole family could approach this as a chance to start a more healthy lifestyle, which would surely make it easier for you.If you do need to test your sugars it is not fun, but I swear you get used to it and it won't be too bad.\u00a0\u00a0most important thing is for you to be healthy.Best to you!",
