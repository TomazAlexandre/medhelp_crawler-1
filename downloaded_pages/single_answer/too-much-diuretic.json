            "answer": "If I were you, I'd ask (strongly) that the doctor adjust the dosage of Furosemide to a more tolerable level for your body and then monitor the results.I was in the hospital twice with impaired breathing.\u00a0\u00a0Both times five pounds of fluid was drained.\u00a0\u00a0A NURSE (not a doctor) told me to take in less fluids in the course of a day to prevent future fluid build-up.I have complained on a couple of occasions that I feel the hydrochlorothiazide (for HBP and water retention) is not doing the job.\u00a0\u00a0I am convinced that I take in more liquid than I excrete.BTW:\u00a0\u00a0I have come to the conclusion that meds ending in -lol (in your case Carvedilol; in my case Metoprolol; in my husband's case Atenolol) raise blood sugar numbers.\u00a0\u00a0It would be wise for you to be checked regularly for diabetes.Good luck.",

    "question": "About 4 years ago I found that I had CHF caused by A-Fib.\u00a0\u00a0My a-Fib is constant, it's just always irregular.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have periods in which I feel the A-Fib come on.The A-Fib started a vicious cycle, it caused me to retain fluid which then inhibited my heart even more, which caused me to retain more fluid.My EF was under 20%.\u00a0\u00a0They got the fluid out of me in the hospital over 8 days and put me on Wafarin, Carvedilol, Enalapril, and 80mg of Furosemide once a day.A year later my EF was 35%.\u00a0\u00a0The next year 50%, and this year 55%.I am still on the same medication as I was when I first left the hopspital.\u00a0\u00a0One issue that I have is I sweat when I work and get dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0I told my cardiologist, but he didn't seem so concerned.\u00a0\u00a0I told him that sometimes I get very lightheaded and dizzy and my pee is dark, so he said not to take my Furosemide that day.\u00a0\u00a0But that day is too late, I think I should not take the pill the day before when I know I will be working hard and sweating.I also question whether 80mg is too much?\u00a0\u00a0That's what was prescribed when I was in bad shape, so if my EF is now 55% and my A-Fib \"looks much better than before\" according to the cardiologist looking at the EKG, then shouldn't I be on less Furosemide?",
