            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. Bilateral hand pain could be due to carpal tunnel syndrome since you are a young adult. Do you do some repetitive activity with both your hands like using fine machinery and typing? There is pain in both the wrists and hands, tingling and numbness in the thumb, index finger, middle finger and thumb side of the ring finger. Compression of median nerve in the carpal tunnel can also occur in association with other conditions like diabetes, hypothyroidism, alcoholism and rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis itself can cause pain in the hands. You should get an autoimmune panel of tests to check for RA factor. Consult a rheumatologist for evaluation and appropriate therapy. Take care.",
