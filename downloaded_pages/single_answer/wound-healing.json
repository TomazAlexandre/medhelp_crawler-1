            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I am sorry to hear about your wound. Generally such non-healing wounds could be due to underlying infection, low supply of oxygen to the wound that is reducing the healing process, underlying diabetes, or due to underlying dermatitis.Wounds heal slower in smokers or alcoholics who have been drinking for a long time. I know you have marginal diabetes but bacteria do not need much sugar to thrive on. Also diabetes leads peripheral neuropathy, atherosclerosis etc which make wound healing troublesome.You need a culture sensitivity of wound scraping to know what antibiotics will suit the infection. If there is underlying dermatitis, then this needs to be taken care of. Wound debridement would be required along with plastic repair. If there is severe atherosclerosis preventing blood supply to wound, then this needs to be diagnosed by angiograms. Also too tight skin being stitched up can break open the wound when there is pressure on the wound.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "In Sept 08, I dropped a grinder , still running, on my left ankle. It hit a vein. It wan't long but it was deep. I had stitches on Sat. ON a Mon a week later, stitches were removed. Played golf on Sat. it all fell apart. Wound became infected.Wound healed for the most part and in Jan after playing golf in Bermuda, the would become reinfected. I went to Urgent Care, who said it wasn't infected it was dermatitis. My Dr. said they were nuts and put me on a Zpac. Half way thru it I broke out in a rash. Ended up at an ER.\u00a0\u00a0ER said infection healed but I was reacting to the Z-Pac. I am now on my 4th round of steroids. When I go\u00a0\u00a0off the wound and entire ankle turn red, sore and hurts like ......\u00a0\u00a0I am becomeing depressed and seriously worried about my health. I am marginally diabetic but just starting. I have been to 2 ER's; an orthopeadic that specializes in diabetic care, 2 allergists and my family Dr. - I keep getting worse.Suggestions - many thanks.Mick",
