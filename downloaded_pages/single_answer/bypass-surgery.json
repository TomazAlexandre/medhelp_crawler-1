            "answer": "Well, possibly the general anesthetic has muddled his thinking (does he appear reasonably alert and sharp?\u00a0\u00a0close to his same old self?).Else I'd of thought he would be much improved physically (compared to pre-surgery), about 48 hours afterwards but I gather that is not the case here.\u00a0\u00a0As you say, his health was quite poor to start so perhaps the surgery was a notable shock to his system (I'm guessing:\u00a0\u00a0in that case extend 48 hrs to a couple of weeks).\u00a0\u00a0And perhaps something else is going on.You (and he) should know that the heart bypass surgery only propped up his heart's capability, though that's very desireable in the short term.If he was out of shape and overweight before surgery, losing weight now in a slow but steady manner to get himself down to a low normal healthy BMI range without losing muscle tone is very desireable as that will help clear out his other arteries throughout his body.\u00a0\u00a0And that will reduce the load on his heart as he'll have less body mass to lug around, less body mass for his heart to pump blood through, and more open arteries for the blood to pass through [3 things that combine to mean a lower burden on his heart which ought to substantially boost his capabilities imo]..",

    "question": "My 54 year old husband underwent triple bypass surgery last Tuesday morning.\u00a0\u00a0He has diabetes with neuropathy in his feet and also had elevated kidney functions prior to surgery.\u00a0\u00a0The surgeon says the surgery was a success, but he is so weak he sleeps all day and cannot stand up, much less walk.\u00a0\u00a0I have to hand feed him because he is too weak to even hold a spoon. They now are talking about extended inpatient rehab.\u00a0\u00a0How common is this and what should I expect for an outcome? He is at Emory, which is supposed to be one of the best hospitals, but I get no real answers.",
