    "question": "My husband's symptoms for past 4 months include:\u00a0\u00a0puffy face, night sweats (mostly head), high blood pressure (never a problem before), times of feeling like his head will pop, interrupted sleep patterns, 3 x had broken blood vessels in eyes, swollen anklesHe saw the endocrinologist today and we await the results of the blood work.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor is considering Cushings or something having to do with growth hormone.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't seem to have the other classic symptoms of either.Is it possible that the stress of relocating to another state, being in an office environment for work that is requiring 10 hours a day work, sending our \"baby\" off to college thus becoming empty nesters, and having a wedding (son) coming up could cause his cortisol levels to rise and cause such sypmtoms (what I wanted to ask the Dr today but he is the brillian type that is difficult to talk to)......just wondering if anyone else has experienced such symptoms and what is done about it.Thank you.",
