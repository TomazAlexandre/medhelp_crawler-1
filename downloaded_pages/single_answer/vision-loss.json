    "question": "A month ago I woke up (good vision - no glasses) having lost the top peripheral vision in one eye. Went to opthalmologist and he saw no reason for it, just said there was swelling across blood vessel and that caused it. Around three weeks later I woke up to loss of vision in that same eye. It looks like a tv that is losing its picture, no sharp edges. Went back to the doctor and he said there is edema in the eye, the distance test shows no vision and that the cause is not from diabetes. I am 61 and he says I am too young for some of the diagnosises. He is sending me to a neuro-opthalmologist but that appointment is weeks away. No other tests have been done but I have a great amount of pressure in my head and am always having to unpop my ears. The doctor says the vision loss is permanent. Is this always the case? I have been given no medicine and no other tests.",
