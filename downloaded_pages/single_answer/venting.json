    "question": "My husband and I are 60. We've been married 42 years. Do the math... we were babies when we got married. I was a virgin and he had some sexual experience when we met. I always thought that I had a higher sex drive than he does, but for the first few years, it wasn't a problem.Now, he has diabetes and had a quad bypass a few years ago. He takes Metformin, and other drugs for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. He has spent most of the past 3 years unemployed... First it was the normal seasonal lay-off for his job, then he broke his heel and had to have two surgeries on it, once healed of that he went back to work, but now it is seasonal lay-off time again! He is the John Wayne type... don't complain, don't talk about it, just get thru it.\u00a0\u00a0I know he has depression, but since admitting it would make him feel \"weak\" he won't admit it. All of this to say: he has no sex drive. We've had sex maybe 3 times in the past two years. And, of course, I can't get him to talk about it! I'm frustrated... sexually and emotionally.These were supposed to be our \"golden years\"... We had to grow up fast because we married and had a child at 18. The years after our kids grew up were supposed to be happy and carefree. We were supposed to have the best sex of our lives once I was thru menopause. Instead, we have NO sex.",
