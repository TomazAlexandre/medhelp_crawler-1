            "answer": "Hi,Since your CT scan is clear the chances of MS as of now seem quite less. Your symptoms could be due to peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes, thyroid dysfunction or B 12 deficiency. The possibility of nerve impingement in the thigh, calves and wrists also cannot be ruled out. It is good that you are getting a neurological evaluation done and let us know if you have more questions.Thanks",

My BP still is running 140/100 not much change. But Norvasc I started having sensation in both the calves and thigh. And sometime sensation in hand fingers. Not sure what is causing what? ?????Now I am all worried that the symptoms are MS? Most searches lead to tingling of hand and feet to MS so I am very scared. Any ideas???
