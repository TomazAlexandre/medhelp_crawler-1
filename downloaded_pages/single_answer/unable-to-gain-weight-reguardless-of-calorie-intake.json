    "question": "I have a friend who has always been small. Recently she has noticed that she has been loosing weight no matter how many calories she takes in. She has tried Boost and Ensure and some protein supplements with no effect. She used to run races but has not done so in a year. She works cleaning/painting but does not do any aerobic or gym workout. Her BMI is 19 which is normal but her body fat is 4%. doctors have told her since she is not over weight, not to worry! She is not bulemic or anorexic. She feels no one is taking her seriously and there IS something wrong with her. They have not offered to do any testing on her other than her blood count. Do you think she should continue to seek a doctor who will investigate--ie. hyperthyroidism, malabsorption, diabetes, etc?",
