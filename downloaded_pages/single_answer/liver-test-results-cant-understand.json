    "question": "I had a Dr.'s appointment last week and the lab sent me back the results today. I haven't heard from the Doctor but I noticed that some of my liver tests were abnormal. I was addicted to vicodin and alcohol for three years and I was wondering if it caught up to me.* I have dark,tea colored urine in the morning or when I wake up from a nap.* I have consistant ruq painMy Results are:*bilirubin- 1.4\u00a0\u00a0H\u00a0\u00a0(RR is 0.2-1.2) ....how excessive is this abnormality in numbers?*Albumin-5.3 H (RR is 3.6-5.1)...I heard low levels of Albumin are indicitive of liver disease so could these numbers be indicative of dehydration?*A/G Ration- 2.2 H (RR is 1.0-2.1)How significant are these numbers in terms of a relation to any sort of serious liver disease?I do not have another appointment until next month and I was wondering if these numbers are cause for immediate concern. I am assumeing that if they were, my Dr. would have at least taken the time to explain these numbers with me but I am not sure.I also have an ALKALINE PHOSPHATE of 63 (RR is 40-115) ,\u00a0\u00a0an\u00a0\u00a0ALT of 18 (RR is 9-60) and an AST of 16 (RR is 10-40).All other tests were normal but\u00a0\u00a0I am at a VERY HIGH RISK for diabetes as well (according to the results).Can someone help me with this?",
