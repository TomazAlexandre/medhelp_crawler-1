I was jaundice.\u00a0\u00a0Eating intensified the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually started vomiting & fever.\u00a0\u00a0They did surgery immediately after transporting me to Vanderbilt.\u00a0\u00a0In hospital for 5 days after surgery, pain in upper abd continued.\u00a0\u00a0CT showed chronic pancreatitis (moderate calcium deposits in pancreas).\u00a0\u00a0Have been on liquid oxycodone prescribed every 4 hours/5ml-5mg, along with zophran for nauseau, and hyoscyamine before meals (espophogeal spasms).\u00a0\u00a0Pain is getting worse, vomiting more often, down to 96 lbs (4'10\") and still losing, started out at 192lbs.
