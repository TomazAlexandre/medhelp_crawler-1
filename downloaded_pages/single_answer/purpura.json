            "answer": "Hi,Purpura is defined as superficial hemorrhage into the skin, up to 1 cm in diameter. Lidex is a steroid preparation which helps in itching and inflammation of various skin conditions. You said on stopping of Lidex application, you found re-appearance of purpura.It suggests that the etiology for purpura is not defined. You need to seek etiology of purpura with help of Dermatologist and Hematologist and decide regarding further management.I think you need to be on steroid application for long, to effectively curb the inflammatory process in your skin.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",
