    "question": "Does anyone have any thoughts on this? I had a brain MRI in May, and a thoracic MRI last week. Both of them were said to be normal, although after looking over the brain one, my neurologist wrote down \"ataxia\" and \"myelopathy\" on my papers. (I don't know that he's seen the thoracic MRI yet, but the lab tech at the center said it was normal.) I've looked over the scans myself and can't find too much of anything out of the ordinary.But that doesn't tell me why I keep tottering to the side and losing my balance. Or why my hands close themselves. (I guess that would be the ataxia, but what's causing it?) My fingers have started shaking a lot. When I'm really nervous or upset, my hands even start jumping up and down on a table and smacking it, and sometimes my whole body convulses briefly. The balance problems have been a huge problems for a few years, and getting worse. I walk with a cane. I'm mid 30's. Sometimes my right leg stiffens up, but that's not causing the balance problems, which will happen anyway. (It feels like my upper body gets pushed to the side--usually the left--and I have to take several steps to righten myself.) I also have extreme reflexes, which my doctor discovered, and is recent. (A loud noise will make me scream.) Sometimes when I'm holding something, my hand closes around it really tightly and grips it.I'm frustrated that the scans don't show anything, because it leaves me with no understanding. I mean, it's just really weird. Does anyone out there have any thoughts on what this could be? I'm going to gen. doc. tomorrow, but I'm afraid he still won't know what it is!Thanks!",
