I have in the past, and in some cases it proved to be a good decision. If anything it can't hurt, and you may get other choices.I wish your family the best,Bob :)",

    "question": "my father has had diabetes for many years now, we found out about the same time he has hepatitis c, also liver cancer. 3 tumors in his liver and 2 in his stomach. he has an umbilical hernia that started leaking. he lost 27 pounds on fluid in the matter of 5 hours. when he went to the er the night it started to leak, his actual liver doctor told the oncall staff that there was nothing he could do cause he couldnt go threw the surgery cause he wouldnt make it. the last couple months ive seen my dad go threw so much stuff. like a week before he started noticing the umbilical hernia he had a colenoscopy. and a day later his stomach was huge and his balls(sorry) were the size of grape fruits. they gave him diaretics to get rid of the fluid. the last couple of months i feel like the doctors are doing nothing. he is still working, which i might add he does flooring for a living so hes lifting heavy objects and get up and down all day. should i enforce to find a new doctor? can they do anything more then his doctors havent? im at a loss for what to do..my parents dont really tell me much. but the little i do know, i feel they should be doing more then they have.",
