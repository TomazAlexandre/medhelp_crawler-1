            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.The change in medication to insulin would be make if your blood glucose is not brought under control by the oral medication. Blood glucose that is not controlled is dangerous to your health and can lead to severe, life altering complications. Taking insulin requires that you monitor your blood glucose and your diet.I can't tell you what the cost of insulin would be in the Phillippines, I am sorry. If insulin is prescribed, I recommend speaking with your doctor about cost concerns. There may be assistance available that your doctor can help you with.The use of insulin should not affect your job. However, it can depend on the employer.Cathy",
