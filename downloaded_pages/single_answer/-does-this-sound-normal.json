            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. The symptoms may not be continuous/ regular with diabetes. Other possibilities that may need to be considered include stress/ anxiety, hormonal/ endocrine imbalances, neurological issues, micronutrient deficiencies, infections/ inflammation, food intolerance, metabolic issues, drug/ medication side effect etc. I would suggest having this evaluated by a primary care physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I am not\u00a0\u00a0asking for a diagnosis, just some guidance for my doctors appointment.My symptoms came on suddenly a few weeks ago and it has been progressing oddly.- I am generally very tired despite getting a full 8+ hours of sleep I am run down.- At times I have extreme thirst, but not all the time which seems odd, but in these spats I will easily drink 5-10 glasses in an hour, and spend the rest of the day going to the bathroom.- I have been eating a TON! and am losing weight, sometimes signficantly as in 5 pounds in a two day period and then other times slowly. I can put some weight back on, but it comes off very easily.- If I eat a carb loaded meal I get really sick after and have to go lie down due to shakiness and an upset stomach.I am a very active person. I run, swim, and play tennis regularly and go to the gym at least 5 times a week, but with these symptoms I have had to cut back on all activities severely since I am so tired and will feel really ill and weak after a hard workout.If I had diabetes these symptoms would be pretty regular, sometimes they seem very sporadic and I cannot seem to get a handle on them, other than the eating too many carbs makes me sick thing.",
