            "answer": "Diabetes can cause liver enzymes to go up.A normal blood sugar 2 hours after eating is 140-160.\u00a0\u00a0Even if it goes up to 180 two hours after eating, it would be okay.\u00a0\u00a0Not perfect, but okay.\u00a0\u00a0After that, it should start going down.\u00a0\u00a0So a blood sugar should never be higher than 200 no matter what you ate....because your pancreas should produce enough insulin to take care of it.Make sure your doctor treats it because insulin resistance and diabetes lower SVR.\u00a0\u00a0If your blood sugar remains high, it will increase the insulin resistance. Also, ask him to send you to see a dietician or diabetes educator who can teach you about diet.",
