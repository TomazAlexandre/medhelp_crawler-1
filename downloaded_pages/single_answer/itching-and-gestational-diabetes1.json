    "question": "Hi,I'm 37 weeks pregnant and have extreme itching. I've had my PUPPS test done and waiting for results. I've been itching for about 2 weeks and it's unbearable. Today I took a blood glucose level test from my mom's machine and I had 197mg/dl. she mentioned that I have diabetes, i informed my GYN immediately and i'm going in to see her. My question is, how come my glucose level is high now, but nothing showed up when i was tested at 28 weeks, and what causes the itching?thanks",
