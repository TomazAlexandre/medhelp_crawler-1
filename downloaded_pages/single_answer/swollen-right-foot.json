    "question": "I wanted to know if you could give a heads up on what is going on with husband. My husband is 38 years old and was diagnosed with MS about 7 years ago, he has had so many different things appear in the last 7 years and one thing thats a bother to me and him is that his right leg is very stiff and to top it of with his right foot and ankle swell up to look or have a shape of a football. The doctors have given him meds that wont help. They have done xrays,doublers,checked his heart and still no findings. I was wondering if you could lend me some advice or even tell me what I can do. I am so afarid that one of this days he is going to break his ankle and I dont know it. He draggs his foot to get around. He is pretty much done with his walking due to his foot and ankle being stiff and swollen.",
