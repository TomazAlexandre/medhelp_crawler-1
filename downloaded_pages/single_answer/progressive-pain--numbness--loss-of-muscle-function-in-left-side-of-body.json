    "question": "I am 33yr old male, type-1 diabetic (very well controlled), 6'4\" tall 195lbs, healthy, good diet, in shape, athletic.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past two years I've had pain in the left side of my body that has spread to different areas and has progressed to feel like there is now some numbness and loss of muscle function.\u00a0\u00a0I am educated on diabetes and this has never felt like symptoms relating to it. I know how to identfiy neuropathic symptoms of diabetes and this does not feel as such. Started with pain left knee in front of patella, x-ray showed nothing. Knee pain gets worse with exercise. Pain now on the top right side of left foot, gets worse with normal push-off while walking. Pain in left big toe (feels like \"turf-toe\" syndrom and in constant). Pain also now in right side of upper left ankle/lower shin, feels like a bruise but none is there and it is constant. Constant and worsening pain in left hamstring, feels like a normal hamstring would feel when tight with lactic acid build-up after exercise, but actually worsens with exercise and is constant. Pain along ulnar nerve area of left arm, running up from elbow through upper arm and shoulder, into chest, neck, jaw, face and ear (good example - when pushing down on something with a flat hand while doing tricep pushups or crushing garlic, etc. pain is pronounced - feels like loss of circulation). These pains do not \"feel\" isolated, they feel connected, and they feel like they could be muscle-skeletal issues. It feels like the left side of my body is aging and breaking down while the right side remains fine (no similar issues in right side). In the past two years, I've had a normal echo, a stress echo, and a chest CT with iodine (is that what they inject that makes the chest feel warm?), all of which came back normal.This discussion is related to/posts/show/656983.",
