            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Your symptoms could be due to carpel tunnel syndrome. In this the median nerve is compressed at the wrist in a place called the carpel tunnel. Symptoms begin with numbness and tingling of the first three or two fingers from the thumb side. Nerve conduction studies are quite diagnostic. Treatment is usually by splints and steroid injections. Surgery may be required in some cases. This condition is common in those who use the key board, mouse etc a lot\u2014like in computers or in typing jobs.Other possibilities are Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, clots in the blood vessels (can be detected by duplex ultrasounds or color dopplars), Buerger\u2019s disease if you are a smoker, hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue syndrome, adrenal gland problems and diabetes.Since you also have pain in chest radiating backwards to scapula region, TOS, Scalene Myofascial Pain Syndrome, cardiac abnormalities too could be the cause. Liver, gall bladder and pancreatic function toot should be assessed.Hence EKG, ECHO, color dopplar, nerve conduction studies, blood testes etc should all be carried out.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
