            "answer": "Her weight is above the 95th percentile and her height is just under the 50th percentile for her age. It is great you know that it is recommend increasing children's physical activities (play, dance, sports) to lose weight and she is very active. There have been studies showing the longer the length of time a child sit in front of the TV, the greater the weight gain. Limit time in front of the TV or non-active-video games. Suggest limiting high sugar drinks/snacks and try replacing with milk/yogurt or fruit/popcorn/cheese. The calorie intake for a growing 9 year old is approximately 2000 calories a day that are eaten three meals and snacks between meals. Additional suggestions: cook only low fat meats (chicken, fish, loin of pork) or non-meat sources (soy products, nuts), low fat vegetarian combinations (rice & beans, pasta & beans, low fat cheese & pasta), fat free or low fat dairy products (skim milk, 1% milk, low fat cheese, low fat yogurts, low fat soy milk/yogurt), use plant oils, non trans-fat margarines, and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. Eat daily high fiber breads and cereals (oatmeal) and limit \u2018junk\u2019 foods. Another factor of her weight gain maybe gaining of lean muscle mass. If she is doing muscle training in gymnast and cheerleader, weight will increase due to muscle weights more than fat in our bodies. Suggest using a measuring tape instead of the scale.",

    "question": "My now 9 year old daughter started gaining weight uncontrollably at 5 years old. In one school year she gained 20 lbs. She is VERY active and always has been. When I say active she is a competitive gymnast (4 hours a week), competitive allstar cheerleader (4 hours a week) and dances (1 hour a week) along with playing outside and wants to play soccor and softball but she's so busy now we can't fit it in. So in no way is she a couch potato or inactive. I have taken her to her doctor a few times about this situation and he has tested her for diabetes and has tested her thyroid and all that is fine. She drinks water she eats like any normal child but gains weight at a rapid pace. In the past year everytime she eats she has stomach aches and has to go to the bathroom and she goes shes not constipated. I don't know what to do she can't be more active and she doesn't over eat. It breaks my heart to see her struggle with her weight at such a young age and now she is starting to get out of breath when she is doing her activities. Please help!",
