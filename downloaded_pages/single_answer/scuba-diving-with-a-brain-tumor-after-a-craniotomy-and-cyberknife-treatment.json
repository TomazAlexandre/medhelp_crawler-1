    "question": "Aloha Doctors,I am a 27 year old female living on Maui.\u00a0In 2009 I was diagnosed with Diabetes Insipitus which lead to a head\u00a0\u00a0MRI and the discovery of a tumor.\u00a0\u00a0In March I had a crainiotomy toremove a benign tumor from my hypothalamus.\u00a0 The surgery was unsuccessful due tothe fact the tumor is highly vascularized however a sample was obtained and the tumor was determined to be a Hemangioblastoma. Then in June I underwent Cyber Knife radiation on the bottom halfof the tumor and\u00a0 most likely will undergo round 2 of treatment in\u00a0 December.I was lucky enough to not have any side effects from\u00a0 treatment and I\u2019m feelinggreat!\u00a0 Any thoughts on when I can return to\u00a0 diving?\u00a0 I\u2019ve got my doctorsstumped and I can\u2019t wait to get\u00a0 back in the water!Many thanks,Hailey",
