            "answer": "An M-mode echo gives many false-negative and false-positive results, but it can identify MVP with at least 2 mm of midsystolic prolapse or 3 mm of holosystolic or late-systolic movement of the leaflets, which are posterior to the line connecting the valve's opening and the closure points. Your MVP may not meet the parameters for a dx.Or a less sensitive echo: Two-dimensional echo is less sensitive than M-mode echo, detecting only 50% of patients with M-mode echo and auscultatory findings, but it is more specific for MVP than M-mode echo.Or your first test was with sound signals using a stethoscope. Approximately 10-20% of patients with auscultatory evidence of mitral valve prolapse\u00a0\u00a0have \"false negative\" echocardiograms.I had an echo and doppler echo that showed blood flow in color and the backflow (regurgitation) in a diferrent color in real time.\u00a0\u00a0I saw the functioning of my valves on the echo monitor, and it is very obvious any back flow that MVP would have, so I don't know how it could be missed.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know the state-of-art for the technologyu 10 years ago, and that may have some bearing.Recently, the AHA, AAC have reversed their original position that individuals with a valve disorder need medication.",

    "question": "About 8-10 years ago was diagnosed with mvp/ moderate,\u00a0\u00a0after finding diabetes, HBP and fluid retention. Have had several tests that supposedly confirmed this. At the time of diagnosis, had care of my elderly mother and experienced fluttering/palpatation mostly at night.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr. I was seeing then ( Internal med ) even remarked that I should keep my BP and Fluid retention in check so as not to end up with valve replacement.\u00a0\u00a0Fast forward to now and a change in med care to a PA. She orderd an Echo in order to determine where i stand now and if i can skip pre-meds for Dental work. The results came back negative as to even having MVP. When she called with the results, said \" Well, you don't have it now , if you ever had it.\"\u00a0\u00a0I have since read on another board, that test results can vary and while you never get over it, the condition can also not show up in the test.\u00a0\u00a0At one point I did see a Cardiologist, was not put on any meds but think he concured with the original diagnosis or at least it was never suggested there had been any change from the first tests.I now take a lot of vitaming & herbs including Fish Oil and C0q10.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone ever used these or other things that would change the situation ?PJNow, i have no idea what to do.\u00a0\u00a0I have not had symptoms for several years, since that situation was resolved.",
