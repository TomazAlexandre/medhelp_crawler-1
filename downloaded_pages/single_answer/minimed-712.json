            "answer": "We can't allow the posting of personal e-mails on this forum in order to sell supplies such as this, but I would suggest that you contact the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (www.jdrf.org) and ask to be put in touch with the nearest local chapter. While they cannot help you sell the pump because of legal endorsement reasons, they certainly can put you in contact with other people through their own local activities, and you can by word of mouth after meeting other people perhaps find a buyer. But the selling of it must be done personally and not through the organization.Another option is to contact your own endocrinologist and ask him if it is OK for you to perhaps post a notice about the item along with your contact info in case one of his patients is interested. He again may have legal reasons for not being able to do this, but it is worth asking.The best way is to get involved with the local JDRF chapter and to ask around as you meet other type 1 people or parents of type 1 children. Personal contact is the most likely way to find a buyer.",
