            "answer": "Hi,Dry mouth can be a symptom of diabetes if it is also accompanied by increased thirst and frequent urination. You will need blood\u00a0\u00a0testing to determine if your sugars are elevated, as this is how the diagnosis is always made.If you are concerned please see your doctor soon to have some tests done. It may not be diabetes, but something else entirely.Take care.",
