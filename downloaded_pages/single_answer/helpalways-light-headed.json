            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Nausea, dizziness, headaches, burning in the chest is quite suggestive of GERD or gastroesophageal reflux disease.This occurs due to regurgitation of acidic stomach contents in the esophagus. I would suggest you to eat a soft bland diet for few days. Completely avoid fatty fried food, drink loads of water and eat fresh fruits and vegetables.You can also take OTC antacids before meals. Hopefully your symptoms will resolve.Do keep us posted!",
