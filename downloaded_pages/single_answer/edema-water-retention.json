    "question": "Okay. I'll give these forum another shot and hopefully come up with some possible answers. Previously, I posted in hear failure forums and undiagnosed diseases. I'm 45 yr old male who's been dealing with some chronic gastro issues and generalized pitting edema throughout my body but most notably in the lower legs.The edema seems to get worse when the gastric issues are flaring but I'm not sure if the conditions are actually related or just coincidental.In terms of the gi issues, I've been diagnosed with erosive gastritis, a patch of colitis noted during colonoscopy and slowed gastric emptying.I've been checked for heart, liver and kidney issues as well as thyroid condition, diabetes and most of the conditions that could causes a generalized edema like mine but everything has come back normal. I'm normally on thin side but due to the edema look pretty bloated at this point, especially in my abdomen, which is swollen, distended and tender. I'm not taking any medsThe edema is actually causing me far more discomfort than the gi issues and is more of a concern to me. Anyone ever hear of a similar condition or symptoms? My docs are stumped and I am getting pretty frustrated about the whole thing and feel exhausted most days.",
