    "question": "I, recently, had a Glucose Tolerance Test due to fluctuating fasting glucose and weight issues, but the worst symptom is tiredness/afternoon crash.The results of the GTT were as follows:Fasting:\u00a0\u00a0971 hr:\u00a0\u00a01652 hr:\u00a0\u00a01243 hr:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a048 L4 hr:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a056 LOver the past 5 years, my fasting glucose levels have ranged from around 97 or 98 all the way up to 125, but never over 125.\u00a0\u00a0My A1c has ranged from 5.5 to 5.8 over the same period and my doctor has said I'm pre-diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin levels have only been measured a couple of times.\u00a0\u00a0The last time it was measured blood glucose was 125, with insulin at 8.1.\u00a0\u00a0Blood glucose was considered to be in pre-diabetic range, while insulin level was considered to be normal.Now that I've had the GTT, my doctor says instead of pre-diabetes, I have Reactive Hypoglycemia... Because of the pre-diabetes diagnosis, I have tried to follow a diabetic diet for some time to prevent full blown diabetes; however, since having this test, I find myself starving and getting weak/shakey within a short period of eating, no matter what kind of food I eat.I also have Hashimoto's/hypothyroidism.",
