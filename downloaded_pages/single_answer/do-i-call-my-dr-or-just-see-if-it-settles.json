    "question": "I am a 30 year old mother of 3. I have type 2 diabetes and have had the disease for almost 7 years now, my cholesterol is not the greatest but most meds for that give me side effects and discomfort in the stomach, I am trying to put cigarettes down and have actually wen t from a pack and a half to 6 cigarettes total on a bad day! Lately I have been having some odd feeling like as if the breath were knocked out of me, my heart rate is in the 120's often and my arms tingle at times. I'm sure this is giving me anxiety however heart history on both parents side is HORRIBLE! With in 1 year I had an Uncle die of a heart attack, my dad had a heart attack and needed stints (49 yrs), his other brother 2 months after him had a heart attack and needed bypass surgery. On my mother's side in the same year an aunt has a heart attack and needs bypass surgery as well.. The kicker is my Dr recently did blood work on me and my sugar is fine but my triglycerides are 3000! I am trying to decide if I should just give it time or if I should go back to the Dr soon. Open for suggestions! I have quit eating beef this past year and have lost 30lbs and am now 170 & 5'2 which I know is not good, I am cutting fried foods out, cooking fish more often and have bought an exercise bike but what else can I do? What should I do? Pretty scared!",
