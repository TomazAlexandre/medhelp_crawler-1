    "question": "I am 33 years old and two or three days before the start of mentration, I become severely depressed.\u00a0\u00a0All I do is lay in bed and cry. I complicate suicide during these days.\u00a0\u00a0After one or two days after I start, it goes away.\u00a0\u00a0I have mild depression which is well controlled with Effexor XR 75mg, but that doesn't do anything to during the days prior to the cycle.\u00a0\u00a0I am typically your all around carefree lady until the nightmare starts once a month, then my life unravels. I am really tired of this and would like to have my life back.\u00a0\u00a0I also have type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Could someone please give me some answers. I've tried talking to my Dr. and i'm told I'm depressed and the Effexor will help. Nothing helps during these bleak times.\u00a0\u00a0Is Birth Control an answer, or should I be looking into other possibilites?\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks!!",
