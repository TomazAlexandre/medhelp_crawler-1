            "answer": "Hello,There are many causes for such symptoms. Important ones are unrealistic sexual expectations which make sex a task rather than a pleasure, negative feelings about non performance, neurological causes which causes difficulty in ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation due to diabetes, damage or injury to the prostate such as due to prostate surgery and certain medications.You need to consult a urologist and get your urine culture, PSA, prostate examination and ultrasound or maybe cystoscopy done. All these possibilities also need to be ruled out one by one. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",
