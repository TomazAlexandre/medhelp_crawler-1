            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure if I can offer any new information, but I have PCOS and though I haven't been treated much because of insurance issues, I have done research and had one surgery to remove a 10 cm mass of cysts.\u00a0\u00a0I have read that a woman can still become pregnant with PCOS with certain treatments they have available.\u00a0\u00a0Your daughter has to talk to the doctor and tell him that she wants to become pregnant; that way they can give he the appropriate treatment because there's other treatments like the birth control pill that will obviously prevent her from getting pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that I have had PCOS since I was 15 or so because that's when my periods stopped coming.\u00a0\u00a0Then I did gain a lot of weight and grew more hair.\u00a0\u00a0It was hard to lose the weight but I got on the low carb diet because you lose weight rapidly and that made me get my period again.\u00a0\u00a0When I was 21 I got pregnant!\u00a0\u00a0After I gave birth I stopped getting my period again and it's been almost 4 years now without it.\u00a0\u00a0I gained a lot of weight again and I'm dealing with excessive hair growth once more.\u00a0\u00a0It's not as easy for me to excercise because I have disc problems.\u00a0\u00a0Your daughter is in good shape though so I don't know what she can do to get her period back, but I'm sure the doctors have options for her.\u00a0\u00a0She probably will start to gain weight, but if she keeps exercising, it should help keep it under control.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you and your daughter.\u00a0\u00a0Have her talk to her doctor and keep researching.\u00a0\u00a0Diet and exercise help a lot and your daughter is already ahead of the game.",
