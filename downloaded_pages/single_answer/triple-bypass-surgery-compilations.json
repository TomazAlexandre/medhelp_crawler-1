    "question": "My mother just had triple bypass surgery for the second time yesterday. apparently there was some serious scar tissue and the surgery lasted approx. 10 hours. she is diabetic and takes insulin daily. as well as she is prone to staff infections- she was just in the hospital 2 weeks ago for surgery on her foot(diabetes related). My question is this---they were not able to close her chest in surgery due to the swelling and blood loss. It\u00a0\u00a0is very touch and go at this point and they do not know when the swelling will go down enough to close. She is under heavy sedation and in critical condition. We are trying to prepare ourselves for this and the hospital staff are being very guarded in there assessment. I am trying to get and idea of mortality rate with this procedure (based that this is the 2nd one with complications and she is diabetic). I know the info here is limited, but any statistics would be great.Thanks-Jim",
