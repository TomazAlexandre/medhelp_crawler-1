            "answer": "Go to whole foods or health food store and buy \"essential enzymes\" diabetics medication and what she eats sits in her stomach and ferments. The medication and I am sure the dialysis blocks absortion of sugars and other stuff so the food just sits there and rots. It makes her throw up. My husband is diabetic and we figured this out with him. I also have him taking Iodine supplements, his diabetes has improved dramatically. If she doesn't have heart disease or high blood pressure she might be able to take the iodine.\u00a0\u00a0Go get the enzyme supplements.\u00a0\u00a0Take before or with a meal.\u00a0\u00a0Get them in the form you can break open the capsule and spread the powder over her food, you can't taste the enzyme. Best of luck. My prayers are with you both.",

    "question": "My aunt has had diabetes since the age of 15. Recently she has become a dialysis patient. She goes in every other day for her treatment. For the past 2 months or so, she gets really bad stomach pain that she cries all the time she stays in bed and doesn't eat for days sometimes because anything that does manage to go down come right back up in a matter of seconds sometimes a minute. This happens about 3 or 5 times a month... And it is really starting to worry me because i know it isn't normal. We have taken her to the ER a number of times and they give her medicine but there's only so much it can do, until it happens again. She never had a problem until she started receiving dialysis. Please someone help!",
