            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Electric shock like feeling can be due to side effects of certain medications. So if you are on any drug, ask your doctor and stop this drug and see if it helps. It can also be due to fibromyalgia, Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. A pinched nerve can also be the cause. Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi I am a 22 year old athlete playing an extremely fast paced field sport.. when I was 18 I experienced what can only be described as an electric shock like sensation around the back of my left leg (hamstring area). This was then followed by a pain and stiffness for the next two weeks. Obviously this led me to believe I had pulled or torn my hamstring but after returning training the same sensation occurred again only this time in my right leg followed by the same symptoms. I received numerous physio sessions including an ultrasound which proved no tears to either hamstring. I ask the question if any one can diagnose this problem for me as it has restricted me playing to my full capacity for the past four years.. ps the sensation occurs when sprinting 80-100%. Thanks",
