    "question": "5 years ago i had cavenous sinus thrombosis and got diabetes insipidus as a result. i am on warfarin for life and desmopressin. I was in hospital for 8 weeks and had double vision for about the same length of time. My head still has clots but is 90% clear. When i first came out and my vision went back to normal for a time my prescription improved. Over the last 2/3 years it has got worse and each time i go to the opticians they seem concerned. They do field tests which i struggle with, but i think this is more that the test is so close, and when i look at the screen instead of being a plain backgroud appears sort of wavy/swirly. Last time specsavers sent me to the doctors, the doctors were unconcerned by the change. I've just been again and once again they are referring me to the doctors. I have not seen the doctor yet. Over the last 2/3 years my prescription has changed by about +2/3 in both eyes and the other measurements have increased as well. Why do my eyes keep changing ????? am i going blind ???? what should i do/say when i see the doctor ???? i also have had trouble over the last few years where i see blue sparks/flickers, this happened on time when i was rubbing my eye and happened ever since. Also when im in bed and i have my left eye shut and i move it or touch it i get like white flash at the top or bottom of my eye. I am so worried !!!!!!",
