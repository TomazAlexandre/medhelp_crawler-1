            "answer": "Sounds like myclonic jerks or even myclonic seizures. I had this from vitamin B12 deficiency and magnesium deficiency. If you take diabetes drug metformin, this is a listed cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. Magnesium deficiency is common with fibromyalgia. There may be other reasons but it could really be that simple as an essential nutrient deficiency.",

    "question": "Lately I have noticed that some weird things are happening. Well let me back up to go forward. I am 51 I have diabetes , fibromyalgia, and diastolic heart failure. I have recently noticed that out of no where my hand will raise up and flop back down. Today I was on the sleeping in a chair and was kinda laying there fading in and out when a violent jerk hit me and threw me to the floor. I had done when fading off to sleep for some time not as bad as it is right now. I have begun to have them while awake it's awful and it happens all the time so far I have been able to keep it under wraps but it's getting more difficult. Does anyone have any idea's, or helpful hints on how to maybe control it?",
