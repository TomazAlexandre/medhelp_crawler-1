            "answer": "Hi!Vibrations or electric current like feeling can be due to side effects of certain medications. So if you are on any drug, ask your doctor and stop this drug and see if it helps. It can also be due to fibromyalgia, Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. A pinched nerve can also be the cause. Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
