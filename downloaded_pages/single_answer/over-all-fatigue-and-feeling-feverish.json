            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation, it would be very difficult to comment on the situation. The muscle pain and fatigue could be related to diabetes or hepatitis C or both, aside a number on unrelated conditions like a simple flu, infections, muscle degeneration, myopathies, neuropathies etc. It would be difficult to suggest something till we have a cause at hand. It would be best to discuss this in detail with your doctor.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "I am 53 year old male with type two diabetes, and hep c, both diagnosed within the last 18 months. For pretty much the last year i have experienced muscle aches, especially in my legs, periods of feeling like i have fever, but don't have a temperature, low energy, and just generally feeling crappy. My doctor has tried several different anti-biotics but nothing seems to get me well. I don't have health insurance, so this experimental, what if, deal is getting very expensive. It seems that once i start to feel a little better, within a day or two of that i begin to get stomach pain, and intestinal flu like symptoms, which is then always followed by this warm feeling, with no energy condition. Do you have any suggestions?",
