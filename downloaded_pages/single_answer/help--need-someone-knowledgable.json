    "question": "I have a bulging disc at T8, and one at L4-5. Also in my MRI ist states I have superior endplate depression at T-8. I have read that this can be indication of auto-immune diseases, but it didn't say what diseases, or explain what end-plate depression is. Any clarification would be helpful. I do know that I have degenerative osteo-arthritis, fibromyalgia, and type 2 diabetes. Is there something else to worry about?",
