    "question": "Recently my mother had applied for a Health Isnurance Policy and itwas rejected stating that the ECG (one of the basics one) revealedAnterior Wall Ischaemia. i am not sure what this means and wanted to checkwhat I should do for this. My mother has always been very healthy andactive and we have no record of diabetes/heart attacks etc. Since she is60 years old it can also be a possibility that the insurance companyrejected it since it was not a very profitable case for them. Either wayswhat should we be doing next. What is Anterior Wall Ischaemia all aboutand how serious is the problem. Please advice and send reply to nirupama_vora***@****many thanks",
