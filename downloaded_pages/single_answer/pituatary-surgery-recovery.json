            "answer": "It is normal to have fluid that maybe blood-tinged from the nose 2-3 weeks after the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0If it becomes thick and/or foul-smelling, there could be a problem.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like the surgery affected her olfactory bulb (regulates smell and taste) and the pituitary's regulation. Being it has been four months since the surgery, this is not normal.\u00a0\u00a0This could be permanent damage.What does the NS think?I do know this kind of surgery is VERY delicate and given the age of your mother recovery time could be a longer road.",
