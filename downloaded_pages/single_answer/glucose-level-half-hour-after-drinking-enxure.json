            "answer": "Stress causes adrenalin to be produced, and when adrenalin is high, glucose levels rise. So this could be the explanation. The a1c test will be the best test for how well your pancreas is doing its job, for it shows the AVERAGE glucose levels from the past 3 months rather than one isolated glucose level at a specific time. That will show for sure how well your body is maintaining its glucose.While 204 is abnormally high, it may be a result of the sugary drink or stress or both. However, may I make a recommendation that if your body truly doesn't respond well to sugary drinks, you may want to make some changes in your diet? Avoiding high-glycemic index foods and drinks is just healthy for all people, but especially for people whose glucose levels show that their bodies aren't responding quickly to them.",
