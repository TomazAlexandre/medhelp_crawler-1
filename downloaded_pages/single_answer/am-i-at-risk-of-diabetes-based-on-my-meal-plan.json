    "question": "Hi, my dad was diagnosed with type II diabetes at a pretty young age (mid 30s I believe). I try to eat healthy but acknowledge that my meal plan may be a bit too sweet, so I wanted to run it past you to see if I'm putting myself in extreme risk.===========I follow a fairly routine meal plan:Morning, 2 fresh pre-packaged meals: each contain one scoop of white rice, an fried egg, and a little bag of chicken (not much).Midday green smoothie: 500 mL of 25% fruit juice, combined with two large handfuls of leafy green vegetables. One apple and one pear added in.Late day beans: 1 cup of kidney beans and 1 cup of black beans. Sometimes I substitute one of these for white beans or pinto beans when I have them (both of those are more expensive where I live).I also buy a single doughnut from the local convenience store to help me get through the end of the day when I'm mentally exhausted (which is most days, I tend to work a lot)===========I'm 6'3\" tall and weigh about 158 pounds. It's been a while since I checked my body fat, I think this time last year I was at about the same weight and hovering around 13-14%.Why the 25% juice? I live in Thailand right now and 100% juice is over my budget (costs three times as much as the 25%). With the amount of leafy greens I put into the smoothie, the juice is needed to make it palatable. I would rate the sweetness about a 6-7 out of 10 in terms of taste.I know brown rice is preferred over white, but every time I've tried skipping the prepackaged meals, I end up either skipping the meal altogether, or finding an even worse substitute. I know it's not a good excuse, and if the white rice is a killer then I might have to revisit how to get it out of the equation.I appreciate any feedback you have for me, thank you",
