            "answer": "A lot of things can cause double vision (certain medications, brain injuries, anxiety, blood pressure, diabetes, eye sight issues, etc). It is a good idea to speak to your doctor about this. You might also want to get an eye exam as well. An aneurysm or other brain-related cause would likely have caused other symptoms.",

    "question": "Today whilst driving my car my vision suddenly started to go, eventually it was double vision. Closing one eye allowed me to safely park the car and let the problem hopefully run its course. I have not recently suffered any head injuries, nor any strokes (Male aged 51, fairly fit) The sudden 'double vision' has happened previously though this one scared me more since I was in the middle of driving the car. It appears that there may be a history of 'anurisms' in the family but this was only recently disclosed. I didnt suffere any tingling, nor breathing difficulties, or any other strange feelings. It was just double vision making me try to squint my eyes, rub my eyes or any thing that might resolve the vision problem. I wear glasses, however this is just for reading. Can anyone please suggest what might have caused this sudden and temporary double vision affecting both my eyes",
