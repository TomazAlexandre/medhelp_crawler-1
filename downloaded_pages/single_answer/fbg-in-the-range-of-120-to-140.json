    "question": "In Dec and again in June my A1c was 6.2.\u00a0\u00a0So my doctor says I do not have diabetes.In June I started checking my FBG. They started out around 116 and now have become over 125 every morning. Sometimes as high as 140.\u00a0\u00a0But my after meal BG is usually between 125 and 145.I've been on a low carb diet since June 1st and my fasting numbers are getting worse instead of better.Does anyone know why my FBG would be so high but I still do not have spikes after eating?Is this considered diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Should I try to get my doctor to treat me for diabetes or should I be looking for another cause?",
