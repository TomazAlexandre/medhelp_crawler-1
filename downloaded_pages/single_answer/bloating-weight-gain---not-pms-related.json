            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The weight gain can be due to water retention. Water retention occurs as in low protein in blood, kidney problems, heart problems, pressure on the dorsal aorta, severe anemia, deep vein thrombosis, liver diseases etc. It could be due to hypothyroidism too. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "For the past month, I have had severe bloating/weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0My stomach is so bloated that it hurts to touch -- not an awful pain, but more of a discomfort, as though my bladder were full (which it is not). My weight has jumped up 10 lbs, and for someone who runs 8 miles a day, I don't see how that is possible. I have followed Weight Watchers for years and while it worked for quite some time, it suddenly seems to not matter at all with regard to my problem.I went to my ob/gyn the other day and she ruled out ovarian cysts, but had no other recommendations.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried increasing my fiber intake, drinking more water, taking a diuretic, etc. and nothing has worked.Is this something I should be concerned about and should I see out another doctor?\u00a0\u00a0I'm so uncomfortable all the time. Are there any other remedies I should try at home?",
