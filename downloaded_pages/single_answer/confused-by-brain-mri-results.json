            "answer": "Hi!Scattered foci of increased T2 signals indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Though they are of no immediate threat, all these causes, and the presence of ischemic changes can be a risk factor for future stroke. Hence, prevention methods should include a healthy lifestyle, and a combination of diet, exercise, and medicines.Other than this, you must also treat the bulging discs with conservative treatments such as hot and cold compress, stretching exercises, back low impact exercises, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, specially designed corsets, spinal manipulation and traction and epidural injections. Please discuss with your treating doctors. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hey all,I've been having right arm weakness lately in addition to the right arm tingling and weakness from my 3 bulging cervical discs.\u00a0\u00a0My doc suspected a CNS disorder and ordered a brain MRI with and without contrast.\u00a0\u00a0I got the results and pasted them below.Impression:\"Two small focal areas of cortical restricted diffusion and T2 signal left parietal lobe for which short term followup is recommended.\"Cortical Grey Matter:\"There are two small focal areas of very peripheral cortical restricted diffusion in the left inferior parietal region.\u00a0\u00a0This has corresponding T2 hyperintense signal in 2 adjacent inferior parietal gyri.\u00a0\u00a0There is some T2 hyperintense signal which extends along the white matter.\u00a0\u00a0Differiential considerations include a demyelinating process and or possible superficial venous infarct.\u00a0\u00a0The cortical location favors venous infarct.Paranasal Sinuses:\"There is minimal mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses.\"My doctor said he thinks MS is unlikely because of the location of the lesions, but he's going to get more opinions before we meet to discuss the results.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any thoughts?Thanks!",
