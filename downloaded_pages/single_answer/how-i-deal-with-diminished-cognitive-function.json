    "question": "Over the last couple of years, my cognitive function has somehow progressively diminished. I used to be pretty sharp, with excellent recall. These days I sometimes struggle to remember something that happened maybe just a day before. This seems to get better or worse. The cognitive function seems to be on the decline. I am confused at times, struggle to remember things, can't think as clearly, or as quickly as I used to.What confuses the situation for me is the slew of other things that I am afflicted with - which makes it hard for the doctors (or me) to decide what is really going on. Could be just old age. But it could be one or more of these other things. I had pretty severe stress / anxiety disorder growing up, and have lived with stress / anxiety / depression all my life. I have been diagnosed with sleep apnea, and excessive daytime sleepiness disorder. I am on meds for depression, blood pressure, and diabetes. I am overweight.I get completely lost trying to figure out how to deal with this. Is there some angle of pursuit that might help with any of this? Or is this something I just might have to live with? Sometimes it feels like the doctors don't really know what to make of this. The psychiatrist and the neurologist seem to want to just have the other person deal with it.Can anyone offer some advice on how to approach this here? Some perspective?",
