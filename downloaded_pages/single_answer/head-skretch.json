            "answer": "Hello,You need not get a biopsy done unless and until there is any complication with the scratch. As a scratch\u00a0\u00a0heals, it is normal to experience some redness, swelling, itching, minor skin irritation or oozing of tissue fluid, or small lumps in the skin near the area. At first, the skin over the scratch will feel thick and hard. After a period of two to six months, the swelling and irritation will go down and the scar tissue will soften and begin to blend into the surrounding tissue.Delayed wound healing can occur in vitamin C and vit K deficiency, diabetes, p-rotein deficiency, immunocompromised states and if the person is taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressants. Take some vitamin C supplements and get your blood sugar levels done.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
