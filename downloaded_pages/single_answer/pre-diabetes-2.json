            "answer": "The reading of 83 and 93 may not be high, it depends on when they were taken. The HgA1C is a test of your glucose level over a 90 day period.\u00a0\u00a0The HgA1C reading of 6.0% (108 mg/dl) is still not very high.\u00a0\u00a0I am 66 and a diabetic and my HgA1C last week was 5.7% (102 mg/dl).\u00a0\u00a0The time to get the most accurate reading is two hours after a meal.\u00a0\u00a0Your reading should ideally be around 160-170 range.\u00a0\u00a0Your eating and exercise programs is excellent and you appear to be doing everything right.Check with your doctor but he'll probably tell you to keep up the good work.Good luck and I hope this helps.Millard",

    "question": "I am 64 y/o white male, generally in good health. I am slender (BMI=23.8) and follow a relatively low carbohydrate diet (about 150g per day). I follow a strict exercise program. 5 days a week I run for an hour each day (6-7 miles a day) and 2 days a week I workout with pretty heavy weights. Recently I got the following test results:Date: May 7, 2013 Glucose: 83 mg/dl, HgA1C: 6.0%Date: Oct 29, 2013 Glucose: 93 mg/dl, HgA1C: 6.0%Do I have a pre-diabetes condition?Can the high HgA1C be due to the high intensity exercise program? (I heard that strenuous exercise increase the blood sugar)What do I need to change in order to reduce the HgA1C ?(My father had diabetes but he was able to control it by a strict diet)",
