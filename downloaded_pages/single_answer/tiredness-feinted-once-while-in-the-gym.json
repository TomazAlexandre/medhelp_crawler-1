If not, these would also lead to excessive heat generation and fainting.You can get yourself examined by a physician and cardiologist for further evaluation.You need to consult physician for evaluation regarding diabetes, heat stroke etc. and Cardiologist for evaluation of any cardiac disorder causing dizziness and fainting.Keep me informed if you have nay queries.Bye.",

    "question": "Hey, i'm 17 years old and started going to the gym when i was about 15, i used to go like 2 or 3 times a week, but in the last year or so, its gone down to about once every fortnight or so. But in the Summer for the first time i felt really feint when i was working out, and it wasn't like i was overdoing it or anything, i kept going on and eventually feinted (was a bit embarrassing). Now, often when i go to the gym i feel feint and tired after only about 30 minutes (i normally do a mixture of weights and cardio). I can tell when its coming on because i normally start yawning.I'm really not sure whats causing it, it might be my diet, or i guess i'm not getting enough sugar before sessions, but other people don't have anymore sugar than i do, and their fine. I swim sometimes and i can go swimming for 2 hours no problem, and i can go running outside and not have any problem. It is pretty hot in my school gym (no air conditioning) and i do feel like i'm overheating a bit, but again everyone else doesn't seem to experience this problem.If anyone has any advice or anything, please help :)",
