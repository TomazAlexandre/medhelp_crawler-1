            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin without any rash can be due to dermatitis, hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods . Since you have undergone gall baldder surgery, so it can be due to dermatitis or hives. Even the liver function tests need to be evaluated. Till that time, take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing and take some oral antihistaminic like Benadryl.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
