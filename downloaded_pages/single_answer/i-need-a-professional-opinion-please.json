            "answer": "HiSkin tags are benign skin growths and yes they may appear on the genitals too and in other areas of the body. They may range from tiny ones to large ones. They may readily fall off and may not require any immediate intervention. As for treating skin tags :\"There are several effective medical ways to remove a skin tag, including removing with scissors, freezing (using liquid nitrogen), and burning (using medical electric cautery at the physician's office).Usually small tags may be removed easily without anesthesia while larger growths may require some local anesthesia (injected lidocaine) prior to removal. Application of a topical anesthesia cream prior to the procedure may be desirable in areas where there are a large number of tags.\"Source:http://www.medicinenet.com/skin_tag/page2.htmFor the genitals, you may require anesthesia for their removal. You may ask your dermatologist about this. If these are small tags then they may fall off in time and may not need any of these above procedures.",

    "question": "Is it possible to get skin tags on your labia? I can't imagine that they are warts because they look nothing like any of the pictures I've looked up. I've seen pictures of cases both mild and extreme... and they don't look a thing like what I have! Then, I found out about \"skin tags\" which I never heard of... but they looked almost exactly like what I have! It also said that you're more likely to have skin tags if obesity and diabetes runs in your family... and those illness do run in my family. However, I know skin tags are more common in other places, and I don't even know if it's possible for them to appear on your labia... so please let me know! If they don't, what other bumps do appear on your labia that aren't warts or herpes? Your thoughts would be very much appreciated...This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/241699\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/241699</a>.",
