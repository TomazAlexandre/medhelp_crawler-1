            "answer": "Hello,Frequent urination in adults can be due to many causes. The primary cause which needs to be excluded is diabetes. Diabetes not only causes frequent urination but also numbness and tingling sensations.I would advise you to get a fasting blood sugar and Hb A1 C test done.If dibetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome, stroke and other neurological diseases, urinary incontinence, bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction .Please consult a urologist in that case. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "For years I have had a feeling like I need to urinate even when I only produce a small amount of urine.\u00a0\u00a0I have had UTIs and this does not feel like the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0No pain just pressure, tickling sensation, in what seems like the urethra.\u00a0\u00a0A few things trigger it I think.\u00a0\u00a0Coffee,tea, alchohol and just maybe it starts a day after intercourse.\u00a0\u00a0I don't drink that much of the trigger drinks.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe two or three cups of coffee per day.\u00a0\u00a0I think my mother may have had a similar thing and she is now incontinent.\u00a0\u00a0I do not leak urine and have started Kegels again.\u00a0\u00a0When I do urinate a normal amount, it seems to come out at a normal flow then down to a trickle.\u00a0\u00a0If I continue to sit on the toilet I can continue to squeeze out more urine. Do you think all of this is related to one cause.\u00a0\u00a0I had my urine tested at the gyno the last time I had this really bad and tested negative for infection.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't feel like something serious because it does get better but is terribly annoying. Thank you.This discussion is related to/posts/show/1123782.",
