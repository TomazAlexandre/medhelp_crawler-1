    "question": "My 20 year old son was just diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. His TSH was low and his Total T3 was 2000.(The highest his doctor said she had ever seen.) They have started him on 20 mg. methimazole 3 times a day and 10 mg. propranolol 3 times a day. He is also a Type 1 diabetic using an insulin pump. What can we expect as his course of treatment and are there any additional complications that may occur with his diabetes?",
