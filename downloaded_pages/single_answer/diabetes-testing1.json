    "question": "I was diagnosed with diabetes about a month ago, but they never tested me for type 1 or 2. I finally have my fasting glucose down to 81 with help from Janumet and Lantus. My problem is my blood sugar still spikes to the 270+ range 2 hours after eating. I am following the diet they gave me religiously and watch my carb and sugar intake faithfully. My question is, is this typical of type 1 or 2, and can they still test me even though I'm on insulin?",
