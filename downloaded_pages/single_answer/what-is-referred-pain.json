            "answer": "Hi!The numbness could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar nerve at the elbow level. Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause numbness and pain of little and ring finger. Please consult a neurologist. Take care!",

    "question": "For the first time in 3 months today seem's that my left and right but always left has stopped hurting (touch wood) but there is till tenderness and slightly puffy on inside of elbow I guess funny bone. Can also feel a little stiff . Although when I saw doctor earlier on this month and he felt the area of elbow both sides were sore more so the outer at that time. Just wondering if this could be the trouble I have been having with wrist including little, ring but nearly all finger's just tingly and a spongy feeling. If I'm thinking that it's really elbow and wrist pain as such. What would this mean for my elbow?",
