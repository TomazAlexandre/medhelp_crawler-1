The exact cause of granuloma annulare is unknown but is occasionally associated with diabetes mellitus and other diseases, though most often when lesions are numerous or generalized.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am currently waiting 3 more weeks to see a dermatologist and my GP diagnosed me with Granuloma Annulare- I have found some info online that has cited that Topamax (which I take for migraines) might be the culprit. Have you heard of Topamax causing this before and if I have one spot on my foot, is it likely to spread to other places soon on my body? Thanks!!",
