            "answer": "Hi there!A twitch is an uncontrollable movement in a muscle group. A twitch can occur in a specific muscle group which is stimulated by a single nerve. Muscle spasms involve a muscle that contracts and does not relax. Muscle twitching can be caused by stress, anxiety, medications used for psychiatric illness, antiasthma medications etc.Muscle twitching could possibly be secondary to nerve damage or weak muscles. Muscle spasms are caused due to several conditions like electrolyte imbalances, nerve irritation, diabetes, anemia and kidney diseases. It is best to get yourself evaluated. A complete clinical examination is very important for diagnosis. Treatment will depend on the cause. Hope it helps.Best wishes!",

    "question": "I have been having random muscle/organ ( im not sure what it is) spasms and twitching throughout my body for some time now. It doesn't last long and isnt painful either.Lately instead of these spasms being in my arms or legs, its been in my digestive area. In particular mid to lower abdomin and also right behind my rib cage where my galbladder/liver is.Any idea what it is? How do I tell the difference if its tied to nerves, muscles, or organs?",
