            "answer": "I would want to have a CT scan of your brain.\u00a0\u00a0See if there is something that is making you lose consciousness. The fact that your hands and feet were numb makes me think of MS. I would have this checked out ASAP, insurance or not! This could be a huge deal! Good luck and take care of yourself.",

    "question": "I'm a long haul trucker, or was a long haul trucker, as I'm now unemployed due to an incident on thursday. I was traveling on I380 in Iowa when all of a sudden I could not inhale another breath. It was as if something closed off my airway. I signaled to pull to the right and began braking then lost consiounes. Thank the lord noone was hurt as I plowed into the median. I regained consiousness moments later and felt relatively normal. A slight headach and numb extremities which persisted for about 15-20 min. I have type two diabetes, but checked blood and was only at 129, normal for me. Was checked by EMTs good blood pressure and pulse rate. This is not the first time this has happened, only first time while driving. Was checked out other times and nothing was found. Seems to happen avery few years or so. Yes, I've been checked for sleep apnea and results were normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have no insurance so can't afford a lot of tests that may answer nothing. My doctor has no clue, some say he's not very good, but he is only one I have. I need answers before I can work again. Please any insight would be welcome.",
