            "answer": "So, I have a few questions for you what has your doctor said to you about your weight? and has it ever been suggested for you to see a nutritionist? The second question is one that should be considered... The weight that your body is carying and what could possibly be an unhealthy diet could be contributing to this... My number one suggestion is that you speak to your doctor about this. You could have the begining of something going on and you never want to wait until it is too late. Regardless, I would take a good look at the kinds of foods you are eating when this occurs... Activities you were doing... Your stress level on a 1-10 scale... Keep a journal and show it to your doctor. If the need to go to a nutritionist is there you are already on your way to keeping the journal that most want you to keep... Good luck. And really talk about this with your doctor if it is a major concern.",

    "question": "Hopefully I am in the right forum.Age: 25Height: 5'11''Weight: 425^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ I don't feel or look 425, but that's what the scale says.I have a problem with anal seepage. I am very embarassed about it and do not know how to approach a doctor about this problem. And wheather to visit my general practice doctor first or go directly to a specialist.I go #2 and wipe as usual but some days it feels as if more keeps coming out (even after I pushed and nothing came out) with every wipe. Other days I very little and get the job done. Regardless of how much I wipe, I can shower immediatly after (washing back there) and 30+minutes later it seems like I forgot to wipe or something.I love sodas and energy drinks, sometimes I quit 3 weeks at a time because I feel maybe that's the problem. Sometimes the problem stops or becomes minimal while other times it doesn't help.I am constantly tired (sleepy), irritable, and experience body aches (muscle not joints). While other days I am happy, patient, and ache free. But yet the problem persists. I do notice sometimes I get irritable/irrate, I go #2 even if I do not have the urge and I calm down. But like I said I don't even feel like I have to go #2 and I feel that way.Now I know I am not the only person out there with this problem.Do eating habits and drinking sodas/energy drinks cause/contribute to this problem?Does my weight cause/contribute to this problem?Could/does stress cause/contribute to this problem?I have had blood testing for diabetes (8hr fasting test) and have been informed that I am not even close to being pre-diabetic. Normal blood pressure, normal (lower than most) cholesterol, good and bad fats are in normal range, blood sugars are good. My doctor says I have better blood work than she does and for 425 she's actually shocked that I am not diabetic.It smells like I pooped myself and sometimes it actually seeps through my cloths. On really bad occasions it will show up on a chair. It's all seepage.Help someone. Please.",
