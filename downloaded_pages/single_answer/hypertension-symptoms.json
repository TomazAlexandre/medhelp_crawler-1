            "answer": "First, the obvious. You need to lose weight, stop smoking and get active if your doctor says it's OK. Also, you ARE hypertensive, in fact you are at stage 2 hypertension when you get over 160/100 so you definately have some issues.The tingling is not really a symptom of high BP, but can ge a result of it. For instance, HBP can affect your kidneys and cause diabetes which could cause the tingling you are experiencing. HBP has an affect on so many systems in your body that it may well be the trigger of an underlying conditon. What did your doctor say and has he prescribed anything to lower your BP?Let us know.Jon",
