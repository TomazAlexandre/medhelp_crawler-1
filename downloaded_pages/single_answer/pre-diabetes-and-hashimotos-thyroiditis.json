            "answer": "Hi,I am sorry you are now feeling so unwell after a great period of weight loss on your own.As far as I know, levothyroxine itself as a medication does not CAUSE diabetes or raise blood sugars, assuming that your thyroid blood tests are in a desired range. Abnormal thyroid hormone levels themselves can cause some problems with blood sugars, so if the DOSE of the levothyroxine is not quite right, it may contribute to the blood sugar problem. But the medication itself is unlikely to do this.Hypothyroidism does mess with your metabolism for a while, even after your hormone levels start becoming normal again, so it may take a while before you start feeling back to normal, and are able to lose weight as you had before. Also keep in mind that after a certain period of weight loss many people reach a bit if a \"ledge\" where it becomes hard to lose further weight without some changes to their regimen.Burning in your lower legs would be uncommon as a side effects from the Metformin, but I strongly suggest speaking with your doctor about it soon to ensure this is not the issue, and also to find out the cause. Some people with only mild diabetes can have neuropathy as well.Take care and hang in there.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed as being pre-diabetic after a fasting blood sugar of 106 and a HGA1C at 6.5. I have been treating this with diet alone for the past year and after losing 20 pounds I had reduced the HGA1C to 6.1 and fasting BS under 99. I began having symptoms of hypothyroidism and the doctor tested me. My TSH level was 4.5 and my anti-microsomal antibodies showed a level of 632. The doctor said I had Hashimotos Thyroiditis and put me on .50 of Levthyroxine. When I went\u00a0\u00a0back for a 3 month checkup she increased the Levthyroxine to .75 Since I have been taking this medication my blood sugars are way out of wack. My doctor put me on 500 mg of Metformin once per day when the AC1 test came back at 6.4 . Since starting the Metformin\u00a0\u00a0when I test periodically during the day it has been as high as 156 4 hours after a meal and between 108 and 130 upon waking. My question is...could the Levthyroxine be making me become diabetic? I have never had these high of levels and I am eating better than ever, exercising and not able to lose a pound!! Also since starting the Metformin my legs below the knees burn constantly. Could this be a side effect of the medication? I have felt terrible since starting both of these drugs. Help!",
