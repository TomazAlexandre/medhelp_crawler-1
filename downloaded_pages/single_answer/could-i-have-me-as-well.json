            "answer": "Hi there!Pain killers, stress management, antidepressants form the mainstay of treatment in fibromyalgia. Are you on any antidepressants? Paxil, Loratab like any other antidepressant leads to weight gain. There are very few differences between fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. There are only few differences like in CFS there is low-grade fever and sore throat, the onset of Fibromyalgia is traced to a physical or emotional trauma. The pain of Fibromyalgia gets better with heat and gentle massage, while the pain of CFS does not. Whatever be the diagnosis the treatment of both these conditions is mainly pain relief, antidepressants and life style changes. You need to take your weight gain very seriously and start changing your lifestyle as soon as possible. Seek medical help for your health problems which are making you immobile. If these antidepressants are leading to weight gain then discuss with your doctor about dose reduction or any alternative therapy. For weight reduction reduce the consumption of saturated fats like cheese, butter, cream, lard, red meat. You can take lean meat, olive oil, and grilled fish. Consume whole foods like whole cereals, lentils, nuts, fruits, vegetables and eggs which are rich in essential minerals, macronutrients and vitamins. Exercise daily for 30-40 minutes. It will help in burning your calories and alleviating depressive symptoms if any. Consult a doctor and start a multivitamin/mineral supplement as nutritional deficiencies can also cause body aches and muscle .The other treatment options are cognitive behavior therapy, psychotherapy, physiotherapy etc. These all can help you cope up with fibromyalgia and lead a better quality of life. I sincerely hope it helps.",
