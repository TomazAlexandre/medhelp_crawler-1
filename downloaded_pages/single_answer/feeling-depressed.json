            "answer": "I think during pregnancy being able to handle even slight stress can be nearly impossible due to all these damn hormones. Not to say what your experiencing isn't a big deal but I think our hormones make it so much worse during pregnancy. Stress isn't good for either mom or baby so try and find a pregnacy support group in your community. Your doctor should be able to help you find one. Sometimes just talking to other women can make a world of a differnce! Good luck",
