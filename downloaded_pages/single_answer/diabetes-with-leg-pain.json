            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Her symptoms could be most likely suggestive of diabetic neuropathy although without being able to examine you I can not be precise on diagnosis. Symptoms may start with numbness, tingling, or pain in the legs and proceed to weakness & wasting of the muscles of the legs. Sometimes these symptoms could be severe & sudden as well. In addition, if she is suffering continuous weakness and notice reduced strength of muscle bulk in leg, please arrange an appointment with a neurologist right away. Neurologist would like to clinically examine her and order some investigations like nerve conduction studies or electromyography to reach at probable diagnosis here. Hope this helps.",
