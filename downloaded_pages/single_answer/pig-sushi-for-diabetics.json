    "question": "Oink, oink.New Scientist 10 April 2010 p 7 discussed a new treatment for diabetics from a company known as Living Cell Technologies in New Zealand.It involves insertion of living pig cells into the human body surrounded by a coat of seaweed. Actually, transplantation of pig cells that produce insulin has been fooled with for at least three decades.\u00a0\u00a0Previously, such cells were implanted surrounded by a semipermeable plastic membrane, which eventually failed. The problem is the human body senses the cells as \"non-self\" and a dangerous reaction takes place that destroys the cells and endangers the body. LCT's treatments surgically imploant pig islets that are coated with alginate, a substance found in seaweed that prevenjts the immune-system cells from recognizing trhe alien islets. The complete unit is known as the \"Diabecell\". Not too catchy.New Zealand health authories have approved phase II human trials of the implants.",
