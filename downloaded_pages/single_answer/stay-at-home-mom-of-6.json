            "answer": "Hi,How are you? MRSA infections can be contagious from person to person and there are two major ways people become infected: physical contact with someone who is either infected/carrier of MRSA or physically contact MRSA on any objects such as door handles, floors, sinks, or towels that have been touched by a MRSA-infected person/carrier. The presence of cuts, abrasions, or other skin flaws such as psoriasis\u00a0\u00a0and people with depressed immune systems (infants, the elderly, or HIV-infected individuals) or those with chronic diseases (diabetes or cancer) are high risk. If you have children and one is medically fragile, exposure to MRSA may not be a good idea. Take care and best regards.",
