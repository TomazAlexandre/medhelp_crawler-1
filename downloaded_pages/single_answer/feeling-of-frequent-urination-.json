    "question": "For about two weeks I have a had a feeling of needing to urinate frequently, sometimes with very mild pain felt in the penis. I vistited my MD and he tested my urine (results were fine, no infection, no blood, sugar was ok) and checked my lower back and abs for pain (none). I do sleep though the night and my stream is good. No feeling of \"sitting on a ball\".\u00a0\u00a0He ruled our prostate issues and said it was likely and irritated bladder from supplements or stress. The sensation is not constant and only makes me feel like I need to urinate, even if I recently went. In fact, when I really need to go (like first thing in morning) the feeling is muted compared with how I normally felt. Is this related to too many orgasims - PC muscle issues? I have no issues regarding sex- it been fine . no premature ejuaculations etc. I can have sex with no pain but is it possible I damaged somthing down there?",
