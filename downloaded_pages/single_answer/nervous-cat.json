            "answer": "I viewed the two videos on youtube.\u00a0\u00a0I think that there are a few possibilities.1. She could have geriatric vestibulitis which is a problem with balance and the inner ear.2. She could have diabetes, which causes in some cases a voracious appetite and can cause ataxia (problem with balance)3.\u00a0\u00a0She could have an atypical seizure disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Seizures can be caused by trauma to the head, a metabolic disease, a brain lesion, or can be idiopathic, which just means that a cause cannot be found.4.\u00a0\u00a0She could have Cushing's syndrome, which though uncommon can occur in cats. It can also\u00a0\u00a0a voracious appetite, and if caused by a pituitary tumor can cause some unusual behaviors.There are other causes also.Daisy really needs to be seen be a vet.\u00a0\u00a0Bloodwork and urinalysis, as well as other diagnostic tests should be performed to rule metabolic diseases, diabetes, endocrine disorders and infectious diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Her ears should be checked because one cause of vestibulitis is ear infection.\u00a0\u00a0Blood pressures should also be checked to rule out hypertension, etc, etc...\u00a0\u00a0 Please bring your vet a copy of your video's.\u00a0\u00a0They are important diagnostic tools and may help your vet, especially if Daisy doesn't act unusual at the office visit.Most of the diseases I have mentioned do have effective treatments, and for those in which there is no cure, almost all can be controlled with medication.Since this is so unusual I am curious as to the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Could you please post again when you have an update?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",

    "question": "Hello,I have an 8 year old cat that has just in the past two or three weeks started to act really odd. First, she is more vocal. She has always been a little bit heavy but her appetite has gone way up as well. Also, she is acting really nervous and startled when there seems to be no cause or trigger. It is difficult to describe, but out of nowhere she will look (always to the left) behind her as if something is there, often spinning around even losing her balance or running into things. Finally, just in the past week, she has started sleeping in the litter box. We have a cat budda litter box with the dome on top and we will often hear her in there while she has one of her spasms. This is particularly troubling to us because she has litter in her fur and we are afraid she is spreading bacteria. We tried putting a pet taxi next to the litter box so that she would have somewhere to rest and feel safe but it has not worked yet.Here are two links to youtube videos showing the behavior I mentioned...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2LtHGkj8yY&feature=relatedhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGHgVyyBvZAThanks for any help. My husband and becoming more concerned and worried by the day.Kayla",
