            "answer": "It could be related to the depo shot you are having.\u00a0\u00a0If it is then there is nothing you can do till it wears off.You probably want to speak to your doctor about this.When you say you've never had an orgasm, is that because you read that orgasms can lead to diabetes (your post is a little confusing)?\u00a0\u00a0If so, that's the biggest load of rubbish that I have ever heard.\u00a0\u00a0If that's the case then close to 100% of people should be diabetic according to that.",

    "question": "I'm on the birth control shot. I don't really have a period just spotting. Sometimes during sex i have white discharge, but whenever I masterbate(sp?) or sometimes just urinating I have brown discharge. It's unfortunate to say I have never had an orgasm yet, and I've read that it could contribute to diabetes. I'm starting to think that it's part of the problem. What can I do?",
