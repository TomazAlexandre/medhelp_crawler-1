            "answer": "Your numbers appear to be normal. Was your two hour test after consuming a meal, sugary liquid, or test liquid, or continued fasting? I can't say the 178 is good or bad since no reference was given.If you wish peace of mind then go get an HgbA1c test. This test will measure the average glucose in your blood over the past three months. Google hba1c and read before you commit.How often should you get tested? Guidelines vary slightly between countries. Canada recommends the A1c every 3 months. The U. S. suggests every 6 months may be acceptable if your blood sugars are stable and within target guidelines for blood sugar levels, usually 70 - 120.Please check with your doctor.",
