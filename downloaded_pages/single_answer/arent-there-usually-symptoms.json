    "question": "I have been diagnosised with diab. 11/12/04.3 weeks before tested in normal[101]range.then on 11/12 was very ill could not keep anything down for 3 days,in ER gluclose count was 1147-1200.I had not shown any symptoms of diab. prior nor then either.AS the level droped I lost all the feeling in my right foot and most of the left.it took a lot to get under control to start,now it is almost too much.I'm not on insulin and the current glucutrol of5mg 2x is keeping fasting at 60-65and 100-120 the rest of the day.What I have read about the bone disease I have form an exposure to aluminum phosphide in'91 white phosphorus poisoning,causes a form of diab.kenetic? something like that.any help like treatment of the bone disease would be much appreciated.When Ihad some help of a couple of Phd's they got me into some research that read almost word for word what I have been through to date.It was UK or German,i've not been able to find it since,or anything about treatment.I was also diagnosised with swelling inside the left ventrical of the heart in July and told it is untreatable.It is also likely caused by the toxins from the bone disease.That's as short as I could make it hopefully ont too short.",
