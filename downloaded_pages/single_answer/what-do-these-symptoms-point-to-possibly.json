            "answer": "\"my sugar levels are not good for my age.\"You know this by testing with a home glucose meter, or you were tested at a doctor's office, or guessing? Would also help to know the glucose levels; fasting, preprandial and postprandial. You do have certain diabetes symptoms; itchy skin, nausea, fatigue/lack of energy, unusual weight gain. Do you also experience dry mouth, an increase in thirst and appetite, dry mouth, frequent urination, or blurry vision?Drugs can definitely cause scary symptoms that mimic anxiety, so can diabetes, allergies, heart disease, and a load of other things. First and foremost, get checked out by a doctor and explain what has been going on. Don't hesitate to tell the doctor about the drugs or any supplement you are taking - they really need to know so they can best help you. Good luck.",

    "question": "I am a 29 year old male. About 2 weeks ago I started noticing what felt like bugs (fleas) jumping on my skin. There are no bugs to be seen or even there as my wife, who sleeps beside me, hasn't noticed anything. This symptom has taken a backseat now to other more serious symptoms, namely constant nausea and what I would call 'anxiety' (although when this anxiety happens I still know everything is ok but my body is acting abnormal despite this). This anxiety is often accompanied by me feeling like I can't think normally. The worst part is that now (about three days into all of these symptoms) I am very fatigued and lack energy. Also, I have, over the past 3 months or so, gained some weight in my stomach and chest. However that could be from lack of excercise. Also, my sugar levels are not good for my age. Thanks for any suggestions or help.",
