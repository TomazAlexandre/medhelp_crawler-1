            "answer": "Probably a lot....however, in the end, it is our responsibility to modify our own lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0That often means cooking things \"from scratch\"...you know the old fashioned way instead of depending on dinner from a box...or worse...a drive thru eatery.It also means not being a couch potato watching TV 24/7, instead of doing things that burn calories...like house & yard work, washing (and maybe waxing) the car instead of driving it through a car wash or a detailer's shop.\u00a0\u00a0Getting out and walking....weather isn't a deciding factor, most of the time...we have malls to walk in if the weather is too hot (as here in TX) or too cold (as it gets up North).Like I said, they are a contributor...however, in the end, it is still our responsibility to take care of our own health...and that means eating healthy and getting some form of exercise.Consider that the food company's are supplying what we, as consumers, demand... quick and easy.\u00a0\u00a0High fat/high carb food because it tastes better and double servings (based on what a diabetic or even a normal person SHOULD eat) that we scarf down instead of bringing it home, in a doggy bag.",

    "question": "With diabetes, how responsible do you think the food industry is when it comes to free radicals or hydrogenated oils affecting our cells abilities to process glucose or carbohydrates? Also, does it makes sense to think that one might not absorb as much of the sugars produced by carbohydrates if they perhaps follow a higher carb meal or snack with a fiber supplement or similar product such as citricil say?M.
