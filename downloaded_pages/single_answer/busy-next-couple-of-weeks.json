    "question": "Found out today at my 34 week appointment (even though I'll be 35 weeks friday) my baby is officially head down and in so excited! We go in for an ultrasound next friday to get an idea on size since I have gestational diabetes. Then the following tuesday is our 36 week appointment where we'll get a cervical check to see where we're at (and the strep b test) and get a induction date set for 39 weeks because of insurance issues. I'm excited to know we're almost done!",
