            "answer": "Hi!From your question alone I can see that you are quite aware of the various causes behind redness at penis head. Since you have undergone circumcision, typical balanitis or inflammation of head (glans penis) and under foreskin area is ruled out. However, a urethral infection or balanitis like infection can still affect the penile head. This is usually accompanied by pain, irritation, foul smelling discharge and discomfort, but initially you may only see redness. This balanitis like redness can be caused by infection (bacterial, fungal or STD), soaps, uncontrolled diabetes, and poor hygiene.So a swab test may be required to rule out all STD and non-STD related causes. Since urine could also be a source of infection, you may need a urine test. The redness on glans could also be due to silent prostatitis. This can be ruled out by semen analysis for infection. If it is infection, then it will need to be treated with appropriate antibiotic or anti-fungal.Eczema and allergy is a less likely cause since there is no itching. However, since you do suffer from eczema, and maybe you are under treatment, then you may not feel the itch. So, if infection is ruled out, you can talk to your doctor and apply a steroid and an emollient cream. If it is infection, a steroid cream should not be used as it can worsen the symptoms.As you have pointed out, it may be caused by masturbation or injury by frequent rubbing of glans against clothes. You could wear loose fitting clothes, apply a moisturizing lotion, avoid masturbation for a few days and follow good personal hygiene for a few days and see if it helps. Meanwhile try and consult an urologist or your family doctor. You will need a few tests to find the exact cause.\u00a0\u00a0I have basically rationalized the various possibilities and the steps you could take to reach the final diagnosis. You will need to consult your doctor for the needful. Good Luck and take care!",

    "question": "Over the past few days I've had a reddened area on my penis (foreskin, I am circumcised). It appears to be slightly swollen, and from what I can see there is one or more very small bumps. I do not know if this is an STD, or some type of contact dermatitis or eczema from friction, caused by sex, clothing or masturbation. I do have eczema on my hands and legs, and have extremely sensitive skin.I have attached 3 pictures to my profile.Thank you",
