            "answer": "Dear Mommy,As you may know, none of us here is a medical professional; we all are experienced with Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations on your pregnancy *and* on your children!\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is a tough condition, and your having maintained such good control during your pregnancies is something you can feel very proud of -- as I'm sure you're very proud of your children.Perhaps others can share their personal experiences with multiple pregnancies & c-sections.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure if your OB doctor speciaizes in high risk pregnancies, particularly women with diabete, but if not perhaps you can find one who does.\u00a0\u00a0Many things about diabetes are \"bigger deals\" to docs who are not specialists and who are less equipped & knowledgeable about our particular situations.I did a bit of Internet research but so far have not found anything that speaks directly to your question.\u00a0\u00a0Clearly, a person of faith is guided in life's decisions by their faith.\u00a0\u00a0Your clergy may be able to give you specific guidance on what accommodations are (not) allowable if you are facing potential danger to yourself or your baby.As a sister-diabetic, I'd encourage you to get a 2nd opinion from an OB who works with high risk pregnancies like those of diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0My understanding is that all diabetic pregnancies are considered high risk and yet with a good team and a motivated mom-to-be many there are many good results - and your own experiences attest to that.\u00a0\u00a0Your children need their mommy and they need their mommy to be healthy enough to raise them well.\u00a0\u00a0Talk with your docs, your hubby, and your clergy to find the balance that will work well for you & your family long term.I hope you'll hear from other volunteers and readers who have experience, too.",

    "question": "We are having our 4th baby/csection. I am on the insulin pump for almost 4 years. However, my doctor keeps asking me abouttube tying. Is it really dangerous for diabetics to have morecsections? He is saying age (35) is a factor and this next onecould be the one to offset some type of complications (as he hasseen it before in others.) I have had no complications and greatpregnancies. My faith won't allow tube tying, and he just won't let this go. Pls advise. I currently see a Maternal Fetal OBalong with my Endo. My Endo. really does not have a problem with this. Thanks",
