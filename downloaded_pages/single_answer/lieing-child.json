            "answer": "Hello,I do not blame you for not being content to wait for a month, sounds like you are dealing with some very unpleasant and worrisome behaviors. I am so glad you have made an appointment with a psychiatrist, however I would recommend you also make an appointment with a pediatric psychologist or health psychologist (often to be found working in hospitals or hospital satellite clinics). The issue of adherence (following treatment recommendations) is a very common one among children with diabetes, and a psychologist who is familiar with the issues this disease brings to a family would be your best bet. Kids with chronic illness are also at higher risk for emotional problems as well. It sounds like both individual therapy and parent guidance are indicated.A psychologist can assist you in developing a behavior management plan, helping your son learn coping strategies, and provide important emotional support to him (and you). Psychologists also regularly deal with toileting issues, specifically with assisting children in developing and maintaining healthy elimination habits. Psychiatrists and psychologists regularly work together as a part of a child's team. You may wish to contact the psychiatrist for a recommendation of a trusted psychologist.Best WishesRebecca Resnik",

    "question": "What do you to with an ADHD, Type 1 diabetic 9 year old child that lies about everything to parents and teachers?\u00a0\u00a0He lies about homework, eating his required food, hiding it, peeing and poohing in his pants. This child has a lot of issues, he lies to the teachers about doing his homework, he lies to his father that he doesn't have any homework.\u00a0\u00a0He hides homework on the bus, under every piece of furniture in the house, he hides it at school, the teachers have no idea where it goes after they give it to him.\u00a0\u00a0If he gets home with it, he hides it under things if his Dad does not get to it first.Concerning his diabetes, he uses it as a crutch all the time. He hides his food if it is not a sweet snack and even then hides those at times.\u00a0\u00a0He frequently cries wolf, that he is low and he is not anywhere close.\u00a0\u00a0He will do something bad at school and come home and tell on his brother for something and not mention that he was in trouble and we find out later by phone call or letter from principal.About every other day he dirties or wets his pants.\u00a0\u00a0Usually this is because he is so obsessive with whatever he is doing that he will not stop to go to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0When he does go to the bathroom, he makes a mess worse than you would expect a 2 year old to make.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes in an effort to hide that he has done either of these, he hides the underwear in his dresser drawers.WE have an appointment with pshychiatrist, but it is a month away yet, and we need some answers now.\u00a0\u00a0Things are progressing downhill everyday.",
