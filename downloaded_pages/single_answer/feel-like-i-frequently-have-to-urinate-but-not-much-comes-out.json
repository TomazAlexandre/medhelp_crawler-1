            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Frequent urge to urinate can occur due to infections, STD, kidney stones, excess intake of water, enlarged prostrate, cystitis, diabetes etc.Do you have any other symptoms like burning sensation, discharge etc? Has your intake for fluid increased in the recent past?I would advise you to get a STD panel done, urine analysis with ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis.Also get a check of blood sugars done. DRE of the prostrate would help in making diagnosis of enlarged prostrate. Consult your doctor with the reports for further assistance.All the best.",

    "question": "Quite often I feel as if I have to go to the bathroom, but then when I make an attempt very little comes out.\u00a0\u00a0This mainly happens at night when I try and sleep, but sometimes it happens in the day as well.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 30 year old male that eats pretty healthy and exercises fairly consistently, but for a few years of my life I did quite a bit of ecstasy, not sure if this may have caused any damage to my prostate.\u00a0\u00a0When I drink a lot of water I am able to urinate with no problem, but when I feel as if my system is pretty dry / dehydrated, I still feel a slight need to urinate often.\u00a0\u00a0Any idea what might be causing this?Thanks,Morgan",
