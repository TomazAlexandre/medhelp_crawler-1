            "answer": "Hello,Frequent urination in adults can be due to many causes. The primary cause which needs to be excluded is diabetes. Diabetes not only causes frequent urination but also numbness and tingling sensations.I would advise you to get a fasting blood sugar and Hb A1 C test done.If diabetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland),interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome, stroke and other neurological diseases, urinary incontinence, bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction .Please consult a urologist in that case.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
