    "question": "I have had intestinal problems all my life, with various diagnoses. 10-12 years ago, I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. I've been on meds. all this time. Two weeks ago, I was told I don't have it and could stop the Asacol. My ovary has been scanned with neg. results. The pain I have is in the RLQ. It does not move, as gas does. It is always in the same spot. It occurs daily, numerous times, and is sharp in nature. Some days I have a poor appetite and feel very bloated. A recent blood count showed mild anemia. I will add that I have Type I diabetes, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, B12 deficiency, and am feeling exhausted. Any suggestions will be welcomed.",
