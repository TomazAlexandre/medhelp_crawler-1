    "question": "Okay this may seem a little long but I'm in need of some help. Last year (2011) I started having the feeling of having to pee all the time. I went to my ob/gyn and since I didn't have a UTI or bladder infection they gave me Vesicare to try which helped. When I told them it was helping they sent me to see a urologist. I told him everything that was going. Which is I'm perfectly fine during the day but when I get ready for bed or I'm sitting in the car on a long road trip I have the constent feeling of having to urinate. He told me it sounded like I have an over active bladder and gave me a prescription for Vesicare. For the longest time the medication was working until about 6-7 months ago when I ended up with back to back UTI's. Ever since I had the UTI's the Vesicare quit working. I am to a point where I'm not sleeping properly. For example I can try to fall asleep around 10pm but I will end up being awake until 3am or later all because I'm up and down going to the bathroom. It is really starting to get annoying and causing problems with my family. If anybody has any ideas what could be going on I would really appreciate.",
