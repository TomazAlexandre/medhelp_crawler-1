            "answer": "Hi,I am not sure if I have already answered your post.How old are you?Is there any history of heart problems in the family?Do you have any underlying disease condition like asthma or diabetes?Are you going through a lot lately?I feel that you are highly anxious about this.I suggest that you get a baseline assessment by your primary physician. One thing I am considering here is you must be under a lot of anxiety lately ( does this apply?).When one is anxious,there is a tendency to hyperventilate or breathe rapidly.This may cause palpitations , numbness and tingling sensations in the extremities.So try to relax more.Observe your symptoms.For persistent chest pains do not hesitate to bring yourself to the ER.",
