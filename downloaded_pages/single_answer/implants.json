            "answer": "Hi!Dental implants are usually made of titanium. The success of these implants depends on the skill of your doctor and on the nature, amount and quality of jaw bone available. Stability of the implant is another factor. Risk of failure is higher in those who smoke or have diabetes or poor oral hygiene.Dental implants often lead to peri-implantitis, which is an inflammatory condition of the mucosa and/or bone around the implant. Allergy to titanium is rare but is a possibility.Do discuss this with your dentist. Take care!",
