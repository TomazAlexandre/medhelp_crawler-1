    "question": "I am traveling in Kiev, Ukraine and have notices over the last 48 hours a tingling pain in my forehead and face as well as my right arm and hands. Slight pins and needles. I have no chest pains yet, but am concerned because I am far from home and will not return to the state till 3 weeks from now. I have been doing a lot of walking, but exercise regularly anyway. I had a hard time sleeping last night due to this. I have not had a feeling like this in the past. Any advice?Thanks, Frank",
