            "answer": "Hi,The main problem is that many of the other oral diabetes agents are not indicated when there are abnormal liver tests because they can make it worse. Some may still be able to be used with caution, but many doctors will not want to prescribe them, so you are left with insulin. This may not be permanent and you may be switched back to oral meds after your liver tests normalize in future.In either case, the important thing is to get your sugars controlled again without doing your liver any harm, so whatever does this best is the agent for you.Take care.",
