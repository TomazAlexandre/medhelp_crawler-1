            "answer": "Hi, the pain described by you could be due to gastroenteritis, which is infection of the intestines. Amoebiasis is another infection, which can cause similar symptoms. Other common causes are constipation and indigestion. Diabetes Mellitus and Hypothyroidism could cause the symptoms described by you. A simple blood test could help detect diabetes and hypothyroidism. Consult your primary care physician for these tests. Regards.",

    "question": "I've spent ten years under enormous stress keeping a child alive. In the process (we kept her alive) but we lost everything we own. I worked 100 hour weeks for 5 years and made $19,000 a month and we were still poor as dirt. We have nothing and are just now starting back up.I take Tizanadine at night for muscle spasms and rest. I take 300mg Trazadone at night. I have severe chronic pain with several herniated discs and a right QL spasm and a right Lat spasm. I also take Ritalin once a day in the morning.My throat is tender on *some* mornings so tender touching it makes my whole neck have a painfull shock. I have small bald spots on the back of my head.I have an urgent bowel movement every moment right when I get up.I've stopped Gluten 100%, Dairy 95%, Sugar 95%.My stomach hurts after eating. I usually can eat 1 meal or 2 a day tops.I get hot flashes, my legs can sweat. My feet sweat a lot (they never used to until I had 3 epidural cortisone injections at once about 2 years ago now).I eat as close as I can to a whole foods diet and still my symptoms (intestinally) haven't improved. I do have more energy and a lot less pain.I've been under enormous stress and I still am. My wife is very angry and takes it out on me all the time.Ideas? I'm age 39 weight 155 pounds and prior to 5 months ago was in amazing fitness besides the sweating.Need some help and ideas. I had blood work done and it said I had kind of high cortisol.Everything else is perfect. I've never drank, smoked had any kind of illegal drug. I don't take caffeine.I'm so lost I'm not sure where to turn and I cannot get in to see an endocrinologist for almost 2 more months.Thanks!",
