    "question": "I have had UTI about 10 times this year and a yeast infection about 4 times.I went to a physician, who told me that I should take cranberry pills and drink cranberry juice. I also was given pills for yeast infection.Last week, my UTI got so bad that the pain was almost unbearable and I was urinating almost completely blood. My urine had some specimen in it. I went to the Emergency Room as soon as I noticed the blood. I was unable to get off the toilet - I urinated little amounts of blood about every ten seconds. After about 3 hours in the ER the doctor told me it was a reoccurring bacteria and should be gone in 3 days. I was told to take a medication twice a day for 7 days. It was been 8 days, I took all the medication and the pain has gone down, but it is still very uncomfortable - and I still have a burning sensation when I urinate (no more blood though).Please tell me what else I can do - or should do. I took all my medication, cranberry pills and juice, and make sure to urinate immediately after sexual intercourse. I dont know why these infections keep coming - and the doctor said they would be gone by now.",
