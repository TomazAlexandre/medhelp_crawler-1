            "answer": "Dear JudyIt seems like you had tests done to rule out medical conditions that may be causing your symptoms. I am not sure whether you had your thyroids checked or not because abnormalities in thyroids can cause those symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0People with depression can have sad mood, fatigue, changes in weight, disturbances in sleep, loss of interest in life and even suicidal ideations. Without adequate evaluation, it is hard to recommend any kind of treatment. If your fear of dying is effecting your functioning, you may need\u00a0\u00a0 to consider evaluation by a trained mental health professional. I wish you good luckSincerelyHFHS-M.D.",
