            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Since you have kidney pain, kidney problems could be the cause of the swelling. Please refer to an urologist (seek another opinion if this one is not listening) and get a complete panel of kidney function tests done.The water retention could also be due to low protein in blood, heart problems, pressure on the dorsal aorta, severe anemia, deep vein thrombosis, liver diseases etc. It could be due to hypothyroidism too. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You can refer to this link for a complete list of possible causes for ankle, leg and feet swelling: http://en.diagnosispro.com/differential_diagnosis-for/bilateral-leg-edema-swelling/39352-154.htmlHope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
