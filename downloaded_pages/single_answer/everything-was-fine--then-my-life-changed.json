    "question": "So here is the story. I guess it really isn\u2019t and issue, just more of a rant and my story. I am posting this because it indeed does feel like it helps sharing with fellow sufferers, and maybe I can shine some light on somebody else\u2019s situation.In February I experienced a sudden onset of double vision in one eye (right). After visiting the ophthalmologist, he said everything was fine except the corneal graphing. Well he referred me to a specialist of the cornea but the appointment was a week away. Way too long for me to wait without answers so I went to the hospital because nobody would listen, and just wanted to check for tumors, or any other surprises. CT scan came back normal, and doctor told me to follow up with my ophthalmologist.Well I did long story short he diagnosed me with keratoconus. (An unusual bulging of the cornea), prescribed me new lenses, and hard contracts and that was it. Never really got any questions answered, just in and out goodbye.Well I wasn\u2019t satisfied considering I made the mistake of googling double vision, and it came up with a huge amount of terrible diseases, illnesses and etc. All of which were generally unrelated to keratoconus, as keratoconus is a refractive problem and not a neurological problem.This is where the anxiety, panic attacks, and all kinds of craziness happens. After googling my eye symptoms, I was convinced I had diseases such as MS, Diabetes, Thyroid problem, cancer, kidney disease...etc. Every time I googled something, I would get more terrified because I started experiencing some neuro symptoms.First it started out with elevated heart rate, tingling, tremors, then all of a sudden out of nowhere came a tingling sensation that went from both toes up through my body into my head. I felt like I was going to have a heart attack or something and went promptly to the hospital. There, blood pressure was 150/100 \u2018ish, heart rate around 120+ and a constant state of fear. Doctor told me I suffered a panic attack as my symptoms went back to normal after being admitted, and talking with a doctor.After that moment, I started noticing additional symptoms. Random tingling in areas of my legs (shins specifically), shoulder blades, goose bump shills shooting though my body. Then those went away, and I started feeling twitching in various parts of my body. Once again I googled symptoms, and with twitching came the dreaded ALS fear. This made it even worse since I started to have more twitching, fear, pain in muscles, cramping in legs, back, neck...etc. I was convinced I had ALS. Then Diabetes because of the tingling, and thyroid problem because of the vision...and so on.Well as you can see the pattern continues. New symptoms, new self diagnosis and so on. I went to the doctor, told them each symptom, and it always comes back down the stress/anxiety. But for some reason I am never convinced. I always have a fear of some terrible disease, and I always am in search for new answers online. I only get nothing but additional fear thrown into my head.Today, 4 months after my initial eye problem, I still suffer. Mild tremors in my limbs at times, shooting pains here and there, random tingling, burning, itching skin, eye twitching, mild headaches, constipation and so on.I guess reason why I am posting this is because I myself can relate now to tons of people who suffer. Nobody I know really experiences this, so I have nobody to really turn to. Here I sit at work, just trying to keep me off Google. I try hard to just ignore it but sometimes I still succumb to the urge. I am a 27 year old male, who used to have a normal laid back life until recently. I used to make fun of people who had these issues. I always thought it was made up. But now I want to say this is indeed real, and it does make your life very difficult. Slowly I am getting better, and I am not taking any medication. Just long deep breaths, soothing tea, no caffeine, the usual help remedies. Days go by without issues, but sometimes days come where things cant get any worse.Sorry for the long post. Its just something I wanted to share. Maybe somebody here can shine some light on my situation. I am relatively new to this experience, so I am always up to more help. Thanks for reading, and God bless.",
