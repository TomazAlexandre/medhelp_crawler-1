            "answer": "There is always a chance of pregnancy when you are sexually active. And yes you tested to soon. Usually you test 14 days after you would have conceived which should be around the first day of your missed period. So I would test again if its been 2 weeks or longer since your encounter.Its also very important to remember to take your birth control correctly so that your chances of pregnancy decrease. A good way is to set an alarm on your phone for the same time everyday.",

I took a pregnancy test a week after i could have concievd, but i feel it was to early even tho i was haveing theses symptoms a little bit, now their worse.
