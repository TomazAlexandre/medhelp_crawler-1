            "answer": "It sounds like you have cut back on the amount of calories you consume daily, good or bad foods. You did not state your weight or height so I am not sure what actual calorie requirements you need daily. A general recommendation for females is 1600-1800 calories per day and consume that amount over 3 meals or 5-6 small meals a day. If you are skipping meals, the body may feel sick due to low sugar levels. Consuming food through meals daily keeps the blood sugar mainly even so you may not feel sick. If you are still concerned, suggest seeing a doctor to get checked. Thank you for your question.",
