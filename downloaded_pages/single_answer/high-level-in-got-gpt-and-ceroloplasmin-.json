            "answer": "Hi!High ceruloplasmin levels are seen in primary biliary cirrhosis, psychiatric disorders like OCD and schizophrenia, rheumatoid arthritis, lymphoma, leukemia, in acute and chronic infections.Your SGOT levels are normal\u2014a slight increase is of no consequence. Causes of increased AST (SGOT) and ALT OR SGPT (both are collectively called transaminases) include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia and thyroid disease, can also cause liver transaminase elevations. Most liver diseases are characterized by greater SGPT elevations than SGOT elevations except cirrhosis and alcohol abuse. ALT also rises in bile duct obstruction due to stone or tumor. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
