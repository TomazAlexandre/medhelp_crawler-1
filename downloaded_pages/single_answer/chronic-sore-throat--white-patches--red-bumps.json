    "question": "Hi, I've felt ill for months now. I'm a 39 y.o. female with no previous health concerns. I've had swollen lymph nodes, chronic sore throat with some dark red & white looking patches near my tonsils,(the white stuff, or patch dosen't scrape off- I've tried), small, sore, red bumps in the same area. Tonsils look like they may have pus pockets or something. Tongue feels sore sometimes. I've had numerous colds, or what I think it was, in the last few months. I'm almost always congested, blowing my nose to breathe or coughing up phlem, or dry coughing, especially at night when I try to sleep. I have to breathe through my mouth when I sleep, but not always when I'm up. I was checked for numerous things in the past couple months, including thyroid problems, diabetes, strep throat- all neg. My white blood cell count was elevated for awhile (absolute neutrohils), but the last cbc showed everything was o.k. Why do I have all these symptoms then? I've had plenty of other symptoms not mentioned, including sore lower back, odd aches & pains, fatigue, etc. I don't have a fever. My Dr. dosen't seem to think it's any major concern! I guess the main thing I'm concerned about at the moment are the throat issues, as it's chronic & keeps me awake alot, when I should be sleeping! Anyone have any ideas as to what might be going on? I greatly appreciate it! ~ Jenny\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0P.S- I was diagnosed with high blood pressure 2 months ago, but the last time I went to the Dr. a couple weeks ago, it was fine, but fast pulse. Don't know if that's related . Thanks for reading/responding!",
