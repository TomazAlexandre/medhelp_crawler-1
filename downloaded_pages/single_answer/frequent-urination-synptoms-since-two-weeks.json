            "answer": "Dear george_roger,Thanks for posting your query.Your symptoms could possibly be related to prostatitis or overactive bladder. If they persist, I would suggest that an ultrasound of kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) region and an assessment of the prostate gland and the residual volume be done. Additionally, a urine culture is also needed. If the symptoms are because of prostatitis, your local doctor can put you on antibiotics (based on culture reports) and anti-inflammatory drugs for couple of weeks. If it's because of an overactive bladder, it is better to switch over to solifenacin instead of ditropan. Since this is a prescription drug, I would suggest that you consult your physician about the same. He will be able to evaluate you and prescribe appropriate therapy.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Thank you for using MedHelp's \"Ask an Expert\" Service, where we feature some of world's renowned medical experts in their fields.

    "question": "Dear Doc,I'm about 42 yrs old. I have been having frequent urination (more than 7 or 8 times per day) since two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I had been to my PCP last week who ran some routine tests - which included urine, blood tests (which included general counts, liver, kidney, etc). and also checked my prostrate physically.\u00a0\u00a0According to him, all those came back normal and urine was clear too, and no diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He has put me on \"Ditropan\" extended release tablet 1 per day but asked me to check back after 1 week of taking those.\u00a0\u00a0I am still having the frequency symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It also aggravates when i get anxious or think about it or get nervous.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes,\u00a0\u00a0these frequent intervals happen throughout the day but sometimes it happens only in the evenings.\u00a0\u00a0Also, so far,\u00a0\u00a0in the last two weeks, I have had to wake up on two of the nights to the bathroom.Please advise me what it is?\u00a0\u00a0And what should i do?\u00a0\u00a0Should i consult a urologist?\u00a0\u00a0It is very discomforting and am unable to properly work or be normal at home.Appreciate your responses.Thanks and RegardsRoger",
