    "question": "I am a 21 yr old male 6'0 250 lbs (powerlifter). Im now starting to do more cardio than lifting and trying to get my weight down. I had some pretty high cholesterol numbers total was 233, and triglycerides were around 300. I know I need to get my butt going and Im doing that. Im just nervous about having a heart attack I know that is rare at my age. I had a normal EKG about 8 months ago, normal blood work a month ago except for cholesterol, and a full cardio workup chest xray and blood work, 3 ekgs a year ago after a little scare when my heart rate jumped up and did not want to come back down during a work out.The last two days ive felt this funny feeling in my chest, it honestly feels more like a muscle or joint pain because its like a quick pain i cant point to that comes and goes, think its because i sleep on my side. sometimes it feels like it shoots to\u00a0\u00a0my left underarm bicep but its gone pretty quick. notice it more when i slouch too.Today I did a pretty intense cardio workout, im pretty out of shape right now too, and my heart rate got up to about 180, after a minute dropped to 156, and then continued to come down quickly till 120. then about 20 minutes later i was floating around high 90's low 100's. now im just doing work and im high 80's low 90's. i do have quite a bit of health anxiety as well.With all those tests except for cholesterol and my age do I really need to worry about a heart attack? Or should i just focus on getting my weight down and keep exercising (Ive really increased my cardio lately and never have chest pain while working out).",
