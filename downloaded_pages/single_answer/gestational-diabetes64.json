            "answer": "Hi,Firstly know that diabetes is not your fault.\u00a0\u00a0It can happen to anyone, based on your physiology, not what you eat.So now, you will need to pay attention to food and I suggest you eat lower carb.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not true that your baby needs carbs to grow, it needs your blood sugar to be stable for optimal growth.If diet alone cannot manage this, they will put you on insulin.\u00a0\u00a0that is not a bad thing, and not as scarey as it sounds, because this will allow you to have a healthy baby.Hugs.\u00a0\u00a0Please ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0I've had 2 diabetic pregnancies and have 2 wonderful daughters as a result.",
