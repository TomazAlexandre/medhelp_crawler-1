    "question": "Hi everyone,I've been in hiding for a while -- trying to just live life. Funny thing is, I'm stressed beyond all reason and my body has been very kind to me. Not bad for someone whose sx are \"all a result of stress\". :)I do have one symptom that I've been experiencing that I can't explain.I get really bad nerve pain in my arms and back after eating. It's that electric nerve pain where even air on your skin is excruciating. Does anyone else experience that?Dr Google says its diabetes 2, but drs have ruled that out and I have zip as far as risk factors.I seem to recall reading some obscure comment somewhere that it could be related to the heat increase in your system from carb/sugar intake...not like diabetes, but more of a paresthesia brought on by heat intolerance, like one would get from exercise or a fever. But that sounds kind of far-fetched...Any ideas?Thanks!",
