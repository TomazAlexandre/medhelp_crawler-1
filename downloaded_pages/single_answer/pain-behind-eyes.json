    "question": "Important Info:\u00a0\u00a0Type I Diabetes for 21 years. Back in July, I had what I considered a boil beside my left eye and while doing gardening (bent over), I noticed what appeared to be fluid under the skin beneath my left eye.\u00a0\u00a0A few days later I started having pain behind my left eye and I noticed I was very sensitive to light.\u00a0\u00a0I also had post nasal drip which my doctor thought I had a sinus infection and treated me for such, although the cat scan proved it was not a sinus infection.\u00a0\u00a0I did go to the opthamologist's office and saw an MD who looked behind my eyes and found nothing.\u00a0\u00a0However within a month the pain went away.Within the last week, I have been experiencing the same type of pain behind both eyes, with little sensitivity to light and post nasal drip.\u00a0\u00a0The pain mostly comes when I move my eyes around.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because I have Diabetes, I always get depressed when I encounter symptoms that will not go away and often get consumed by them.\u00a0\u00a0I find that pain relievers are not really helping.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried everything, even tried Excedrin Migraine last night and some Claritin this morning.\u00a0\u00a0However, the pain is still there.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts?",
