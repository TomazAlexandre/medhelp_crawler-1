            "answer": "Hi,You are suffering from balanitis, which is an inflammation of the glans penis. It usually involves the prepuce or the foreskin also and is known as balanaposthitis. The commonest underlying cause is a poor personal hygiene and the accumulation of the smegma resulting in irritation/inflammation. Diabetes is one of the common causes of balanitis and hence will suggest you to get the blood sugar done. One of the known complications is phimosis. The treatment consists of soaking the glans in warm water and cleaning it regularly. Application of local steroid or antibacterial creams does help. Please do consult a dermatologist/surgeon for the same. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
