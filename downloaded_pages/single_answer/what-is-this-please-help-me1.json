            "answer": "Many women who have irregular menses have a condition called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). Here is some general information from my website:www.integrativefertilitymd.comPCOS can affect 5% of all women and common symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, increased growth of hair on the body, loss of hair on the head, acne, and weight gain. Based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM sponsored Consensus Workshop Group, PCOS is diagnosed in women who meet two of the three following criteria: ovarian dysfunction (not ovulating regularly), hyperandrogenism (increased male type hormones on lab testing or clinically increased hair growth), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries which show multiple small cysts on ultrasound). PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose tolerance test.At the very least, you should see your gynecologist and have your thyroid checked called a TSH.\u00a0\u00a0After evaluation and examination, they may have to induce the start of your period through using a progestin.If you are also an athlete, or anorectic, or have an eating disorder, this can also cause irregular periods.I suggest seeing a gynecologist.",
