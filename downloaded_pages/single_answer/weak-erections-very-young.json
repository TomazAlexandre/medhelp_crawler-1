            "answer": "Hi,If you still had an erection after the incident where you had accidentally hit your penis against the pubic bone, then possibly there was no penile fracture or any damage to the penile tissues. However, since you\u2019re not having an erection for the past sometime and not able to sustain it, you need to be further investigated for the same. It could possibly be due to one of the chronic diseases like Hypertension or Diabetes mellitus etc. However, psychological causes are one of the commonest causing the same. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "Hey guys, I am posting because in about the last year I have had several issues related to ED. My erections fade away without physical stimulation, my libido is very low and I rarely get erections spontaneously or in the morning. When I was younger I remember I would get erections just by thinking about sex and my erections were strong. I did masturbate when I was younger maybe 1-2 a day sometimes... is this a possible cause?The only penis trauma I suffered was when my penis slipped out of my girlfriend and hit her pubic bone. I heard a 'cracking' sound but there was no pain and no bruising so it was not a penile fracture. The symptoms did not start straight after this accident so it i'm not sure if it is the cause. I may be wrong since it was quite a while ago. No sensation, faster ejaculation and a weak PC muscle is also something I am experiencing which I did not have before.I have been to several urologists but they did not diagnose me with anything, even though I have insisted on having an ultrasound. Do you think it is ligament damage? Tissue damage? Nerve damage? Maybe low testosterone (am I not too young?) Sexual exhaustion from masturbation? Please let me know if you have had similar problems this is currently a big problem in my life. I have another urology appointment on tuesday i'll see how it goes.Thank you for readingPS: I am healthy... don't smoke, I exercise... only thing is that I feel tired most of the time but I think it's because of this problem.",
