Granuloma annulare is a chronic disease consisting of a rash with reddish bumps arranged in a circle or ring. It is mostly found in healthy individuals. Mostly it is found in normal individuals. Occasionally, it may be associated with diabetes or thyroid disease. It has also been associated with auto-immune diseases like SLE. Usually it is asymptomatic but due to cosmetic disfigurement topical or oral steroids may be needed. Please discuss this with your dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
