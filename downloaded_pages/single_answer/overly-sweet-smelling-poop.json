    "question": "I'm an alcoholic, I've drank heavy for the past 10 years or so (34 now), but I've had a full blood (including liver) work up about 2 years ago, all came back clean/healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past 6 months or so I've noticed a sharp contrast to the smell of my poop.\u00a0\u00a0It's smelly, no doubt, but the change is in the smell.Its sweet smelling.\u00a0\u00a0I know that sounds weird, but it smells sweet.\u00a0\u00a0My stools smell like overpowering sweetness.Sickly sweet.It only happens when I drink, (3-4 times a week, 12- 15 drinks per event) or the next day.\u00a0\u00a0I know it's drinking related, but I guess my question is:\u00a0\u00a0\"How bad am I?\"\u00a0\u00a0I know sweet smelling urine is a sign of diabetes, so I had my doctor run a full blood work up about 2 years ago (not because of the poop smell now, but an unrelated matter at the time (trouble peeing, especially at night)).\u00a0\u00a0I'm scared to ask for it again.I realize my life choices are leading me into an early grave, but I guess my question is this:\"How ****** am I, and how bad is it?\"",
