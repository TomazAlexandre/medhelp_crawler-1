            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin without any rash can be due to hives, contact dermatitis, allergies or internal diseases like diabetes, iron deficiency anemia , thyroid diseases etc. Wash the areas several times with fresh water. Do not use any cosmetic products at the sites. You can apply some calamine lotion at the rash as it will help in soothing the skin. You can take some OTC oral antihistamine medications like Benadryl or Claritin and see if it helps.For mild-moderate symptoms a weak steroid may be used whilst more severe cases require a higher-potency steroid. But they are available under prescription and should be taken only after consulting a dermatologist.If the symptoms persist then get an evaluation done from a dermatologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
