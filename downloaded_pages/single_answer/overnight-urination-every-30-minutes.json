            "answer": "Hi,There may be several causes for the nocturia and frequency experienced by you.By drinking a lot, do you mean the consumption of alcohol?Do you also have the frequency continuing in the daytime?Some common causes of frequency and nocturia include:Diabetes mellitus,Benign prostatic hypertrophy, andchronic UTIs.If you have additional symptoms like penile discomfort and spraying, especially toward the end of urination, you would want to have tests done to diagnose involvement of the prostate gland.If you have had any significant weight loss in the past few months, diabetes would be one of the probable differentials.If you have had any UTIs that have been diagnosed in the recent past and may have been inadequately treated, a chronic UTI or prostatitis are possibilities.Avoiding prostate-irritants, such as caffeine, alcohol, citrus fruits, and spicy foods, may help alleviate symptoms mildly.The awareness of a feeling of urine collecting does point to the possibility of infection having caused damage to the bladder lining, so the basic investigation you can start with would be a urinalysis.Fix an appointment with your urologist at the earliest to investigate the cause of the problem.Do keep us posted on your doubts and progress.Regards",

    "question": "For quite some time now I have had a problem entirely new to me - I wake\u00a0\u00a0up 3-5 hours after ive gone to sleep needing to urinate. The problem, other than the irritation of being woken up by my bladder, is that after the first awakening i then i have to keep getting up for the rest of the night/early morning to urinate every 20-30 minutes! I will lay back down after the first time and then i slowly begin to feel a wierd sensation like i can almost feel the urine collecting again drop by drop in my bladder, then i have to get up again to release a small trickle of urine. the urge is greater than the amount i am excreting. this continues until i have to wake up in the morning. There is no pain or burning when urinating and no real discomfort other than the intense feeling in the bladder itself. i do drink a lot at night before bed but this is still wierd. i do not have a particularly great thirst, no pain in my bladder or that area. Why am i feeling the actualy sensation of urine collecting in my bladder as if dripping? then the need to release it even tho its just a small amount? i am 34 and no major known health problems and before this started about a year ago i had excellent bladder control and no bladder issues, i could sleep 10 hours without needing to use the bathroom.",
