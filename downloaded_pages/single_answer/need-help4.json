            "answer": "Hi!First of all get T3, T4, and TSH done to see if your thyroid is under control. Often uncontrolled thyroid problems are the cause of tiredness and whole body ache.If this is ruled out then you need to be tested for anemia, diabetes, vita D and B12 deficiency, and hormonal imbalance due to menopause.\u00a0\u00a0Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
