            "answer": "The first line of action is attacking the bacteria. If the antibiotics are not working long term then you should look to see if you have a gum disease. Visit a periodontist to find out. Gum disease is usually caused by plaque on the teeth. Dental appliances that don't fit well, dental caries, and yeast infections can also cause bad breath. Xerostomia (dry mouth) may also be a culprit as you may not have the saliva to help neutralize the acids produced by plaque and to help wash away dead cells that accumulate on the toungue. If these are not the case you should ask the doctor if it is a symptom of some other disease such as respiratory tract infection, diabetes, chronic acid reflux, and liver or kidney problems.",
