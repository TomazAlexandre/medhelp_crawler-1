    "question": "Here is the short version of my story.About three years ago I had an MRI done of my back and brain. They were looking for MS. Instead they found Chiari malformation. My main symptom at the time was numbness in my arms and legs and fatigue. Chiari fit since I also had neck and shoulder pain. I had decompression surgery in 2011. The neck pain has gone away and for some time there was an increase in energy, a slight increase. Initially the numbness went away too. But the numbness has come back and is pretty constant now. Since then I have been tested for Neuropathy, we found none, 2013. About a year ago they found severe sleep apnea and I have been on cpap since July 2013. They say it is working, but I can't tell, except the Zombie like fatigue went away. In January 2014, the zombie like fatigue came back along with nausea. They did all sorts of blood work including thyroid. My liver function was elevated enough to cause them to check out why, but not freak out. The liver panel came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0But gallstones were found. Also in Oct 2013 I was in the ER with chest pain. Which they called heartburn, I have had for years. I was permanently put on Prilosec. As a solution to the nausea, they increased my prilosec. In March 2014 I had my gallbladder removed and that got rid of some abdomonal pain. Nausea, fatigue and chest pain stayed. The fatigue is overwhelming at times. I was given prescription Aleve for chest pain, which my doctor called costocondritis. About three weeks ago I was put on Wellbutrin for depression, since nothing else seems to fit and I have a family history of it. My energy level has not changed. I follow up with my doctor next week for the depression. I was also put on 50,000 IUs of Vitamin D the beginning of march. I am tired of feeling this way. I wake up tired every morning despite sleeping 8 hours with cpap. Some days are better than others and I manage to be somewhat productive. Bu somedays, it is so overwhelming I just want to sleep. I'm at a loss, I just want feel better or at least have answers. I want to have ideas to brainstorm with my doctor next week.",
