            "answer": "Yes, many people struggle with high numbers until they get on the right regimen. I doubt that the Lantus has made your numbers rise, but they might just be rising on their own because you need to be controlled with insulin. Good for you for getting your numbers down by changing your diet. My guess is you need an increase in your Lantus dose and to start on a bolus insulin (before meals) as well; this is the standard of care.\u00a0\u00a0I assume you mean you are taking 10 units of Lantus, and that is a low dose for a type 2. Some people have better results with Levimir, the other long-acting insulin. Also, I'm not sure why you are taking your Lantus in the afternoon; it is usually prescribed at bedtime which helps more with morning numbers. I suggest you see an endo, not a regular doctor as they are much better at treating diabetes, especially insulin dependent.",

    "question": "My glucose in the mornings are very high (135-165).\u00a0\u00a0Before I go to bed they are 78 - 99.\u00a0\u00a0I have nothing to eat between these times.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor prescriped me Lantus SolarStar to try to get the fasting numbers down.\u00a0\u00a0I am to take this in the afternoon beginning at 10mg.\u00a0\u00a0 I am also taking Janumet 500mg twice a day. Unfortunately, the introduction of Lantus has caused my glucose morning levels to rise beyond 351+, and the remaining of the day it has not been below 244. I am now frantic, as it has never been this high.\u00a0\u00a0I have a diary of all foods, where I see the spikes.\u00a0\u00a0I was able to see that the introduction of Protein in my diet completely reduced the number from 220 to 117 in less than 2 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0By the next morning, the levels were back to 200+.\u00a0\u00a0This is not working for me.\u00a0\u00a0I have a lot of energy and am constantly busy: walking, active, exercise work, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any hope to getting this under control?",
