            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Generally bad odor is due to infection, mainly by E coli. This can be diagnosed by urine culture. Strong fruity odor is due to uncontrolled diabetes. Interestingly urine odor changes in menopause too. Urinary bladder infection and kidney infections do produce strong smelling urine.Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly. I am sorry to say that this is a problem that cannot be rectified without some tests. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "For the past 3-4 months, I have been experiencing a strong odor when I urinate.\u00a0\u00a0At first I thought it was a yeast infection, but ruled that out, I believe.\u00a0\u00a0I also have more fatigue, although I am in menopause.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 42, a smoker and do drink occasionally.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr. put me on some light hormones about 6 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0A very low dose estrogen and same for progestrone.\u00a0\u00a0That took care of my hot flashes and didn't seem to have any other side affects.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been taking them for about a month now due to financial issues, which are also the reason I am reluctant to go to the Dr. My father died about 2 years ago of a rare kidney disease and I have had a few kidney infections that were secondary, one which hospitalized me.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time.",
