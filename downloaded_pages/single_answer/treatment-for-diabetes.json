            "answer": "Have you ever seen the commercial by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency \"This is your brain on drugs.\"That sums up my opinion of the protocol \"Home Remedy for Diabetes\".I do not believe Medhelp is not an appropriate site for directing people to a site that promotes quackery. You know, quack-quack. If it looks like a duck, it walks like a duck, it is a duck.There are dietary and exercise protocols that can help with certain people, but this is a flim-flam operation. The only thing missing from his formula is eye-of-newt, dragon-tail powder and four liters of cat urine.Modern medicine has come a very long way in the evaluation and treatment of diabetes. There is certainly a place in the treatment protocols for special diets, especially during early stages of the disease. I have read some very interesting books on this subject, and there are many things that merit a further look-see.Diabetes, however is a progressive life-threatening illness, and best dealt with using modern protocols that have been subjected to double-blind studies.Hopefully this will assist you in getting the above \"clarified\".",
