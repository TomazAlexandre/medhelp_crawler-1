            "answer": "The FDA has recently declared that the fenofibrate may not lower a patient's risk of having a heart attack or stroke. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid trial found no significant difference in the risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiac event between the group treated with fenofibrate plus simvastatin compared with simvastatin alone. Therefore it is may be reasonable not to add fenofibrate, although it should be noted that your lipid targets depend on your medical history and overall risk factor profile.Many of the tests that you quote, while available, have not yet found a definite role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and remain of more theoretical than practical use. The cornerstones of lipid testing remain: total cholesterol (TC), LDL, HDL, and triglycerides.",

    "question": "I'm a 60-year old woman, non smoker, 5'2\", 109 lbs; occasionally drink a glass of white wine; lifelong exerciser 3-4 days per week.\u00a0\u00a0My medications are Lotrel 5/20, Spironolactone 25 mg. (I was on HCTZ, however, it caused me to have a skin reaction from the sun so my doctor switched me to Spironolactone), Simvastatin 10 mg. and Synthroid 50 mcg.\u00a0\u00a0Grandmother had angina; sister has CAD partly due to poor lifestyle (very high triglycerides & cholesterol, poor diet, lack of exercise).\u00a0\u00a0My doctor gave me a new sophisticated blood test and based on those results he wants to add 150 mg Lipofen to my regimen.\u00a0\u00a0Here are those results:TC 209, LDL-C 101, HDL-C 72, Triglycerides 115, Non-HDL-C 137, Apo B 100, LDL-P 1206, sdLDL 37, %sdLDL 37, Apo A-I 200, HDL-P 50.6, HDL2 17, ApoB:ApoA-I Ratio .50, Lp(a) Mass 15, Lp-PLA 133, NT-proBNP 27, Apolipoprotein E Genotype 3/4, Insulin 3, Free Fatty Acid .37, Glucose 92, Uric Acid 4.6, Homocysteine 8, 25-H Vit D 40, CRP 0.9 .I'm hesitant to add another drug at this point especially since my triglycerides and HDL are in the optimal range.\u00a0\u00a0Do you feel adding Lipofen is the best course of treatment?\u00a0\u00a0I would like to trying increasing my Simvastatin dose to 20 mg instead to see if that helps.\u00a0\u00a0What would you recommend? Thank you.",
