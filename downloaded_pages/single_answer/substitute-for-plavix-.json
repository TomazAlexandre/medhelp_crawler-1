    "question": "Hi,My father had a stroke in May 2005 and since then, he has to take Plavix every day. He is also on medication for diabetes. He has had difficulty talking after the medication for the stroke started. About six months ago (near the end of 2007), he started developing severe Psoriasis all over his body. His left elbow joint is swollen becauseof the psoriasis. My question is: if this is caused by Plavix, is there anything else he can take for blooding thinning but without this severe side effect? Thanks.Best,Miao",
