            "answer": "Sorry to hear that health care providers kick you out without addressing your issues and have accused you.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't tell you if it is insulinoma or not, you would have to get that tested.\u00a0\u00a0Insulinoma is a rare tumour on the pancreas which stimulates the pancrease to continuous secreting insulin for you, therefore you do get low.\u00a0\u00a0you might want to get some tests done such as a CT or MRT to confirm it.Something on the side, do you eat enough carbohydrates during the day?, if you don't eat enough carbohydrates or didn't eat for a long time, you will experience symptoms of low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0i would not recommend you to leave it to your normal body response, when you are low, most of the times your body can't save you.\u00a0\u00a0it is recommended to have simple sugar (15 grams) such as 3/4 of juice, regular pop, 1 tablespoon of honey, 3 packets of sugar dissolved in water, 6 lifesavers, 3-5 glucose tablets.\u00a0\u00a0After 15 minutes of consuming 15 grams of simple carb, then you would test your blood sugar, if it is 4 and above, then you would eat a small snack such as half sandwich with cheese, or peanut butter (if it is far away from your meal times) to help keep your sugar level up.",

    "question": "i cannot do anything without developing hypoglycemia, as soon as i get up and move my sugar starts dropping and the only way to get it back up is by eating carbs of some sort, i have tried not eating and all of the normal body responses that are suposed to raise my sugar do not work- i do not have adrenal failure as i have been tested - i also have type 2 diabetes and am not on any medication but the diabetes is fairly well controlled in that my blood sugar rarely gets high, i have no heart failure , no liver problems nothing to cause my hypoglycemia except, that i am making too much insulin, my doctor wont even tolerate a conversation about it and says it is impossible, i\u00a0\u00a0recently went to the er of a local teaching hospital and they tested my c peptide which was twice of normal while i had a blood sugar of 108, which kept dropping and dropping while i was there, until finally when i left i had to eat as my sugar had dropped to 53. my doctor accused me of injecting myself with insulin to cause my hypoglycemia, i told her the c peptide being high proves its the body making the insulin and not ficticious, she said thats not what it means and i dont know what i am talking about, and questioned me at length as to where i am getting the insulin from, what a (&$#% ! now i also had an endo who kicked me out of her practice because she said she did not believe i was getting hypoglycemia at all, even when i brought in my meter and it was checked against two of her meters she still called me a liar. i dont know what to do i thought the c peptide wouldprove the point but they just dont get it and i spend everyday in hell because i am miserable because my heart is always pounding and i am weak and just ill, i hate this because they wont listen and send me for testing i have lived two years like this, i have seen every doctor i can find, do you think this could be insulinoma?",
