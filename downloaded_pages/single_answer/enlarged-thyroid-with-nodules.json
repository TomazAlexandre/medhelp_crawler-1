            "answer": "You NEED to be pushing for these tests and you need to find out if thyroid disease such as Hashimoto's is causing this. If so, thyroid hormone can help. It has shrunk my nodules to pencil points. It has made me feel MUCH better and more energized. Of course, it takes time to get the thyroid levels right. I am still tired, but my naps are 20 minutes, not 2-3 hours. I still am in the adjusting process and will most likely be getting a medication increase soon.What is your TSH? Many labs use the old reference range. Ideal TSH should be 1.1. That is why my docs missed my thyroid disease, because they used my TSH to check my thyroid, and it was a 2.74, which was normal to them. WRong!!!I have Hashimoto's. In the early stages of Hashi, our bodies swing from hypo to hyper, so TSH may also swing from low to high. When we swing, we go from hot to cold, tired to wired, constipated to diarrhea, depression to anxiety.These are the blood tests you need:TSHFT3FT4TGab\u00a0\u00a0and TPOab tests to see if antibodies are attacking your thryoid and making it swell.Request to see an endocrinologist, one who knows THYROID and not just diabetes.Post your labs when you get them.:) Tamra",

    "question": "I have an enlarged thyroid with nodules. It seems to be getting larger lately. I have been experiencing hot flashes. I have asked my PCP for a script for an ultrasound in order to check the size of the nodules. They were stable at last check and neither hot nor cold per NM Tyroid Scan. My TSH has always been on the low end of normal. I am 40 yo female, overweight (cannot seeem to lose), the only hormone I take is Depo-Provera. I sufer from extreme fatigue, hot/cold flashes, excessive daytime yawning. Now the hot flashes have begun to wake me in the night, before I only had them after drinking a hot liquid (particularly coffee). How hard should I push my PCP for testing? It has been 2 weeks since I asked for the Tyroid US.",
