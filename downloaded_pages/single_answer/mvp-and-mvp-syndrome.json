            "answer": "About 8 years ago, then under the care of\u00a0\u00a0a different DR. ( Internal Med ) , I had at least 2 tests that indicated Mitral Valve Regurgetation but took no meds. Just warned about possible future valve surgery. At the time I was experiencing a stressful situation and felt the infrequent palpatations resulted from that, tho i had at a much earlier date been advised of a heart murmer.I have Diabetes, HBP, Fibromyalgia, IBS, Diffuse Osteoprosis and Hypothyroid & have Bladder problems.Am controlling Diabetes with diet/exercise and Diovan for HBP. & Levoxyl for Thyroid.Fast forward to the present, having had in this last year, tests done that were reported negative as to MVR/MVP .\u00a0\u00a0Last night i had for about 2 hrs.\u00a0\u00a0fast, erratic heart beats accompanied by mild aching in my neck, head , face. I took Baby asperin, rested and it seemed to settle down with time. Have never had a spell like this bf.I am wondering if this could come from HBP ? or perhaps sleeping with my head at anodd angle causing a restriction?This morning things seem to be ok. except for being tired -- which I was the day befor and may be from just not getting the needed sleep last night.\u00a0\u00a0Been having trouble sleeping for the last 3 mos due to back/ body pain ( suspect Fibro ).I am seeing an ARNP, who I like but I wonder if\u00a0\u00a0I should be seeing someone in Internal Med. or an Endocirnologist.?",

    "question": "If you have mvp and need valve surgery you symptoms will go away, however, if you have mvp syndrome and have surgery, which would be rare, your symptoms will still be there because they are coimng from an imbalance of the central nervous system.\u00a0\u00a0This is aomcplex disorder that many doctors just don't understand and many don't beleive in the syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0This is unfortuate because millions of people suffering.\u00a0\u00a0We have over 50,000 on our mailing list.BonnieSociety for MVPSThis discussion is related to/posts/show/250838.",
