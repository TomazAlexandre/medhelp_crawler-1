    "question": "My husband is 43 years old. He currently takes meds for High blood pressure, and diabetes. For about a year now, the left side of his belly has grown with time, and so has the pain. He recently started taking Colace, and it hasnt changed anything. He doesnt have regular bowel movements, and has lost feeling in the anal area. Last week he had a CT Scan, and nothing showed up. Now he is very uncomfortable, and it hurts to even walk. Any help or advise would be greatly appreciated.",
