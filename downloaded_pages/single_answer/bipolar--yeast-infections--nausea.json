He/she will order one or more of the following tests:\u25cf OGTT [Oral Glucose Tolerance Test] - patient drinks sugary liquid, glucose [blood sugar] is measured at variable time intervals\u25cf FPG [Fasting Plasma Gucose] - Patient fasts for 8-10 hrs then blood is drawn and measured\u25cf A1c [Glycated Hemoglobin A1c] - Current gold standard, measures glucose over past 2-3 month periodIf irregularities appear doctor may check your thyroid and/or pancreas too. Good luck",

    "question": "So there are three main issues going on with me right now. Firstly, I was diagnosed with Bipolar II diorder about a year ago. I am currently on Lithium Bicarbonate and Abilify as treatment, which seems to help, but the Lithium causes severe nausea, and I still have a lot of problems with motivation and fatigue (I am ALWAYS tired).Secondly, I have been having reoccurring yeast infections for around 2 years now. My first occured when I was in GA, a climate more humid than I was used to, so that could be accounted for. About a year later it happened again, so I did my research and limited myself to cotton underwear only, made very sure to stay clean and dry, and I always urinated immidiately after intercourse. Despite these measures, I have found myself getting yeast infections about every other month, usually a week or so before my menstrual cycle. It's getting old.Finally, I recently did an experiment with myself in which I stopped taking my bipolar medications. In addition to the expected results, I also noticed that about 2 weeks after going without, I was experiencing severe nausea, especially in the mornings, usually resulting in dry heaves or vomiting bile. I have re-continued my use of medication, and the Lithium has made this effect much more severe. I highly doubt (and hope) that I am not pregnant, as I have recently transitioned to the Implanon as my form of birth control, and I couldn't really mess that up like I could with the pill.My concern is this - all three symptoms: mood changes, yeast infections, and nausea - all say that they could be caused or contributed to by blood sugar irregularities. Does this mean that I may be diabetic? Is it worth looking into? If so, how do I find out?Thanks! .",
