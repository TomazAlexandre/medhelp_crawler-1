            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!If all other causes like infection, stone and STD (if there is a history) have been ruled out, then you must look at allergy to soaps, shampoos, undergarments etc. Also at times the burning etc is due to dehydration. Taking plenty of water and other fluids will help. Also diabetes should be ruled out.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
