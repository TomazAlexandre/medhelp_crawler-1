    "question": "I had my thyroid removed in 2006 because it had become enlarged and made swallowing difficult. Put on Levothyroxin 112 mcg and Calcitriol. Just this month doctor increased dosage to 125 mcg. Ever since my surgery I get cramps or Charlie horses, I don't really know how to describe it when I flex my arms. Is this a result of thyroid removal? If so, any thoughts on treatment. Am I missing a vitamin or mineral? Also, I don't know if this is related, because I had the nodules on my thyroid so many years before removal (probably 20+), but during that time I started having numbness in my toes, starting with the outside corners of my big toes. Now the entire outside of my big toes, my entire second toes and one side of each of my third toes are numb. My sugar levels are fine. Not quite sure what to make of this. Thank you.",
