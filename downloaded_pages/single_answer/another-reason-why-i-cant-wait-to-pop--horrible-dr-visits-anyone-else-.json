    "question": "So yesterday was my husbands only day off andI we had plans to do lots of thing but I had a Dr appt with the diabetes specialist. That ruined our whole day!!! My appt was at 1 and since its so far away we left at 12. I wasn't passed into a room till 2:30 and that was only to monitor the baby's heart, then sent back to the waiting room. This place also has not bathroom and if you need to go you have to go look for one that's open in another floor so I had to wait bc the one on that floor was out of order and I didn't want to go searching for one as I thought I was almost next, wrong!!! I didn't see the Dr till 4:25 and it was only for the quickest ultrasound I've ever had!!! She seriously seriously took 5 min and said \"OK come back next week\" . with?? O_o . by that time I'm contracting every 10 min idk why so we leave get home at 7 and by then I was in so much pain I just ate , drank Tylenol, and fell asleep. That was horrible smh",
