How about the presence of other co-morbid illnesses such as diabetes? If prescription medication and therapy is not helping, follow-up with your doctor is recommended for proper management. You can also try alternative medicine such as acupuncture. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I originally injured my shoulder. While rehabilitating\u00a0\u00a0the shoulder I was doing push ups on a counter top. I could not finish the 1st set of 10 before my arm started to hurt. The next day I had a knot in my upper back, extreme forearm pain and numb fingers. I was told that it was the arm over compensating for the weaken shoulder, treated with pain killers and anti-inflammatory medications. After pain was tolerable I had ultrasound on forearm. With symptoms continuing I had an EMG test which showed Ulnar nerve restriction at the elbow. Orthopedic Surgeon said it can't be Ulnar nerve because numbness radiates among all fingers. It was recommended\u00a0\u00a0that I get message therapy to minimize knot in my back and that would relieve the numbness and forearm pain. Message therapy didn't work so I had trigger point shots in the knot. That helped a little but I still have knot, sore forearm, and numb fingers. I also have daily if not hourly short burst of pain similar to an electric shock that goes from knot through forearm. My doctors are perplexed by symptoms and all symptoms increase with activity. Its been 10 months since my exasperation of symptoms when I tried to do the counter top push ups, with no real relief of symptoms. I was a very active middle aged male running 10-20 miles a week. Now it's a good day if I don't drop my car keys or spend the evening with ice or moist heat on my shoulder,arm, and hand. Any suggestions on diagnosis or relieving the symptoms would be much appreciated. Please help!",
