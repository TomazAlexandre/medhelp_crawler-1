    "question": "I am a 24-year-old married woman and my husband and I were virgins when we got married.\u00a0\u00a0For the last couple of years I have been having recurring yeast infections.\u00a0\u00a0We do enjoy oral sex at some point almost every time we have sex.\u00a0\u00a0I always wash afterward with warm water and no chemicals, but I seem to keep getting the yeast infections.\u00a0\u00a0The biggest problem, though, is that the Monostat cream burns even more than the yeast infection itself.\u00a0\u00a0It itches and burns so bad that I have to shower to get it off only minutes after I've applied it.\u00a0\u00a0This makes it difficult to even treat the infection.I'm not sure what to do...if you have any suggestions, please let me know.\u00a0\u00a0I am otherwise very healthy and active...no diabetes or other health problems.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a different cream that won't burn and itch so bad?\u00a0\u00a0Are there any natural remedies that actually work? Why does the Monostat burn so much?Thank you for your time!",
