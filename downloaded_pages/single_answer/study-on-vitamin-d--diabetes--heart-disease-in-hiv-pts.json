    "question": "At the recent CROI conference, an interesting study on vitamin D was presented that I'd like to share with the Forum. It would seem these findings might be extrapolated from the HIV+ population to the general population, certainly similar studies need to be performed in other patient populations.Paper # 827Vitamin D3 Supplementation Decreases the Risk of Diabetes Mellitus among Patients with HIV InfectionG Guaraldi1, S Zona1, Gabriella Orlando*1, F Carli1, G Ligabue1, C Stentarelli1, M Menozzi1, E Garlassi1, C Giovanardi1, and P Tebas21Univ of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy and 2Univ of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USBackground: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), insulin resistance, and hypovitaminosis D are common among individuals living with HIV. Low vitamin D has been associated with insulin resistance and DM in the general population and more recently in the HIV-infected population. Our objective was to examine whether use of vitamin D3 (Cholecalciferol) supplementation could prevent the development of DM among patients with HIV infection.Methods: We conducted a retrospective study among patients enrolled in the Modena cohort, an ongoing, multi-center, prospective cohort of HIV-infected individuals in care at the Metabolic Clinic of the University of Modena, Italy. All patients seen more than once, without baseline DM were included in this analysis. Incident DM was diagnosed if the fasting plasma glucose was \u2265126 mg/dL in a subsequent visit, or the patient\u2019s primary care provider had initiated treatment for DM between visits. Individuals were classified as receiving vitamin D3 supplementation if they reported consistently supplementing their vitamin D intake with 30,000 IU weekly as recommended during each clinic visit. Adjusted hazard ratios of incident DM were estimated using multivariable Cox regression model.Results: A total of 1574 patients meet the entry criteria: 65% were male, with a median (IQR) age of 44 years (40 to 48), a nadir CD4 177 cells/\u00b5L (72 to 273), current CD4 509 cells/\u00b5L (367 to 687), 61% undetectable HIV RNA, duration of HIV infection 174 months (118 to 232); 232 (14.7%) of them reported consistent vitamin D3 supplementation. The median follow-up was 2.4 years (1.3 to 3.5). There were 74 cases of incident DM, 2 among individuals supplementing vitamin D3 (0.37 events per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 72 among the 1342 subjects not using vitamin D (2.16 events per 100 patient-years of follow-up) (p = 0.003). Baseline homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HR 1.05, 95%CI 1.02 to 1.08); age (HR 1.08, 95%CI 1.05 to 1.12), baseline vitamin D (HR 0.96, 95%CI 0.93 to 0.99), and vitamin D supplementation (HR 0.17, 95%CI 0.04 to 0.72) were independently associated with DM in a model that also evaluated gender, current and nadir CD4 cell count, body mass index, girth circumference, triglycerides, and HIV undetectability.Conclusions: The data from this retrospective cohort study suggest that vitamin D3 supplementation decreased the risk of DM in patients with HIV infection. Vitamin D supplementation may prevent or delay the onset of DM and decrease the incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients with HIV infection. Prospective controlled trials will be needed to confirm this observation.",
