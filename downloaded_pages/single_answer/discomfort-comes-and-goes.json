            "answer": "Hello,Such burning or vibrating sensations on tip of penis can be due to an allergic reaction (say to body lotions, condoms, soaps etc) or it can be a skin condition like eczema, dermatitis etc or it can be a fungal infection. Other than that it can be a simple bacterial infection or balanitis or parasthesia skin. If you are sexually active get a complete STD panel done. Otherwise get your blood sugar levels and vitamin B 12 levels also done as diabetes and vitamin B 12 deficiency can also cause such crawling sensations.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "(48 y/o male)For the last few months I have had symptoms that come and go. It started with a constant burning sensation in the penis tip with some occassional feelings as if the tip is asleep (like when your arm falls asleep)or vibrating. No redness, no sores, no dischgarge. All STD tests negative.\u00a0\u00a0 The burning sensation occasionally extends up as if in the entire length of the urethra. Sometimes have trouble fully emptying baldder like I have to really strain to get it all out. Dribbling at end of urination is frequent. Sometimes have aching/sore feeling in testicles or area just behind them. These symptoms last for a few days to a week then subside for 2-4 days then return again. Usually have no trouble with initial erections. However, maintaining them is becoming a problem. Bowel movements seem to aggravate symptoms occassionally.\u00a0\u00a0Last time I went to Doctor, he seemed to be focused on std and not prostate issues. I just hate wasting a doctor visit!",
