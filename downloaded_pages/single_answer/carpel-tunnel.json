            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The nerve innervating (supplying) the thumb, the index finger and the middle fingers is the median nerve. This can get compressed in the wrist, leading to numbness of these areas leading to a condition called Carpel Tunnel Syndrome. The nerve can get compressed due to obesity, Diabetes Mellitus, hypothyroidism, arthritis and trauma. It is more common in the later months of pregnancy. Treating the root cause will help to resolve this issue. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I suddenly developed CT over a week ago. Its been coming and going for a few years. When I paint or do rep. it flairs up. But this past 2 weeks I haven't been doing anything. It only happens at night. I do wear wrist braces at night and it does help. My question is why would it just happen?would some imflammation in my body be causing this? would there be another problem that can cause this. I was having a numbing tingle feeling at the tips of my toes, the three in the middle.like they fell asleep. But it was\u00a0\u00a0only the tips and the three in the middle. weird. but that kind of went away and now the problem is my Carp. Tun. Thanks",
