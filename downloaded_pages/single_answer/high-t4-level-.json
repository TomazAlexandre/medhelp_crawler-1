            "answer": "Hi Milly and welcome. Okay the proper tests to run are TSH, Free T4 and Free T3. The total t4 is outdated and not used any longer. The free's will actually show your active hormone levels. If your T4 is high then you definately need the free t3 done to see if you are converting properly.The next dosage level down from 100 mcg is 88mcg? I don't understand this dr's thinking and I would definately question him. My OLD endo that i fired actually made this same mistake until I called him out on it.Are you seeing a thyroid specialist?\u00a0\u00a0An endo doesn't mean they specialize in thyroid, because a lot of them specialize in diabetes and only know basics of thyroid. Same with primary care drs....they are only taught few basics.I suffered way too long myself until I took the plunge and found a new dr (endo) who is awesome! I wasted 2 1/2 yrs and kept getting sicker.Let us know how you do.By the way, what were your exact lab results last time???\u00a0\u00a0always get copies of your lab reports so you can post them here with the ranges, for us to look at.",

    "question": "I am a 38 year old female, post thyroidectomy about 10 years ago. I am on synthroid. they have never been able to really level off my medicine. in november 2008 i had my level check and TSH level and T4 was high dr change me from .125mcg to .100mcg because i had complaints of sweating, insomia, etc.. when he changed my dose i felt good from about a few months , last month had blood repeated my tsh was normal my t4 was a little high. i have the same symptoms again not sleeping and sweating thru the night i called him yesterday and told him about the symptoms and he is now changing the dose to .75mcg.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if tis is correct. i never had such a low dosage of synthroid. I dont think he realizes that i also have a problem of infertilty, my fsh level is very high , i will tell him on Monday but i dont if the the two are connected. is this dosage correct?\u00a0\u00a0She he be lowering it? i am confused? i have been suffering from anxiety,chest palaptions etc.. when my levels are off. can anyone answer me on this. is the T4 total supposed to be lowered when the results come up high? i really need help.suffering way to long... always have a high T4 and normal TSH level.",
