            "answer": "HI ThereThe big question is what is the reason your mother is declining surgery? Did she have a bad experience? Does she not trust or like her gynecologic oncologist? Should she have a second opinion?Surgery is an essential part of therapy for ovarian cancer.So just as when a person declines appropriate therapy for anything (infection, heart disease, diabetes etc), the first intervention is to be sure she is fully informed . Understand why she is making that choice. And if she fully understands and has been adequately counseled, then it becomes an issue of personal autonomy in decision making.That may be very hard on family members.thank you for your question . I hope everything sorts out.take care",
