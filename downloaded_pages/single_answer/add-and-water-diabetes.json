    "question": "So i have been taking adderal for about 2 years now, and i know a side effect is dry mouth.\u00a0\u00a0I therefore drink alot of fluids during the day, more than the usual person.\u00a0\u00a0I always need to have a drink with me or I become extremely uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been urinating alot, and sometimes to the point where I think i might not make it to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0I told my doctor about my urinating problem, and he basically dismissed me saying i was too young for a bladder issue, im 25.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway I was doing research on bladder things and I read about nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\u00a0\u00a0it can be caused in adults by a reaction to medication.\u00a0\u00a0I was just wondering if anyone else has had similar problems or has any advice, or suggestions on how to get this under control?\u00a0\u00a0thanks so much",
