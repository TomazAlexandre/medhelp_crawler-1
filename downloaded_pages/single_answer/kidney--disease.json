    "question": "I had a urine test done last week because I been having a little pain. Currently taking peginterferon and copegus for hepatitis c treatment. Been on it for 7 months now. Anyway my urine test showed, cloudy, glucose 150, trace of protein and hemoglobin. Urobilinogen was elevated. A few crystals and rbc was 3-5. My sister had a kidney transplant 11 years ago due to scarring of kidneys. My father, my 2 sisters and I have always had red blood cells in urine. They never could find out why. Is any of this due to my medications?",
