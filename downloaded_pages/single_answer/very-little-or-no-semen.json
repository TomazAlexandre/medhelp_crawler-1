    "question": "I am 30 years old and just recently have been able to produce very little or no semen. I have no problem with getting an erection and I have no pain in that area. I find this strange because a month ago I didn't have this problem and I have no clue what the problem could be. I am diabetic and have been since I was 11 so I am wondering if that could be playing a roll. If anyone has gone through this or has any idea of what the problem could be please let me know your advice.Thanks.",
