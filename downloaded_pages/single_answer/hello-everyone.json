    "question": "I see there are no discussions so I thought I'd try and start one up. I have been diagnosed with PCOS since I was twelve and was put on birth control to regulate (and start) my periods. I took myself off of them years ago and have very irregular periods and can sometimes go two years without one. I'm 26 now and have just started taking Metformin to help regulate me and to help my husband and I get pregnant. It has only been a month and a half since I started it but last week I got some very light bleeding only when I wiped and it was on and off for three days then disappeared. This is very odd for me since I usually have very heavy periods. Since then I am still having light cramps, bloating, back aches, hot flashes, a sudden onset of runny nose and scratchy throat. It feels as though I'm supposed to start my period but nothing since that bleeding. I know about implantation bleeding and many of my symptoms can be pregnancy symptoms but I may just be hoping too much. Can I really be pregnant this soon?!Does anyone have any success stories on Metformin??",
