They've ordered blood tests (checking for celiac disease,diabetes, red blood cells, etc.) and xrays to check the stomach and organs ( spleen, gall bladdder) and gave us a new medication to relax the muscle spasms in the intestines.... hope we figure it out.",

    "question": "To be brief, he has pain in the whole stomach, constant, bad enough to miss lots of school, for a month now. Nothing has helped as yet so far. The 6 doctor visits has resulted in no help. They tried Ranotodine, Immodium, Bella Donna Phenobarb, and one that relaxes the stomach lining from spasms. The latter helped the pain but made him so very dizzy that the Dr. took him off of it. They say it's stress but that's not it at all (I know my kid!)\u00a0\u00a0We are now supposed to see a Therapist. He has some nausea (seems to come with the pain only) he has a great appetite, had diarrhea and constipation at the start of all this but not for the past 2 weeks.. This all started the moment he ate some Salsa at school. Since then, he was on liquids for a few days to clear the stomach. My idea was to try\u00a0\u00a0lactose free, it's been 6 days, no change at all. Next, supposed to try eliminating High Fructose... I'd like to eliminate Gluten instead. The Dr. tells me the only IBS speacialist for children is in Portland ( 5 hours away) and she is very reisistant to my insistant that it's medical, not stress related...I'm very disheartened to see from all of the comments on here that this could take months to figure out.",
