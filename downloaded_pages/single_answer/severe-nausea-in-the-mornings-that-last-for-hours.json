    "question": "For 1 week now, every morning i wake up, i get SEVERE nausea. Funny thing is, i dont throw up! i cant throw up! even though i have eaten 2-3 meals + snacks the day before, i dont throw up, even though i get a strong sensation to do so. I also get mild cold sweats, but thats it. No headache,fever, runny nose or anything like that just nausea and mild sweets. It lasts up until early afternoon then goes away like nothing. Honestly i feel like i could run to the moon and back during the nights.I doubt its my eating patterns since ive been eating anything, everything, any-time i want since im skinny all my life.Funny thing is i got severe anxiety the night before this started to happen. It was about another issue that has been cleared up since.So i initially thought it was anxiety causing these issues, but after my anxiety went away, i kept getting nausea, even on weekends when i know i dont have work.Doctor initially told me to try over-the-counter Mylanta. It barely does much, if anything at all. When i went back he gave me Zofran. Zofran helped a tiny bit, but didnt make me feel well enough to get to work. Now im on Trimethoprim for a urinary tract infection. None of these drugs are helping and i dont want to be a guinea pig that tries every drug known to man to get better. Oh, i also got a ultrasound of my abdomen and it was all fine.So what could it be? The sick feeling is definitely coming from my upper stomach where my intestines are. It feels like the food in there isnt moving or is stuck, so that maybe causing the nausea.Any help will be appreciated, i need to get back to work before i get fired!thanks!",
