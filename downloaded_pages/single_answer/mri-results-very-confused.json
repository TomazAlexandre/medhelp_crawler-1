            "answer": "The white matter foci are very non-specific findings. If you read through here and/or search, it comes up a lot - they can happen from headaches (migraines), high blood pressure and all sorts of stuff and yes, that includes MS.At this point, you need more testing to rule things in or out. The neuro may have just attributed the foci to the migraines and just called it normal (frustrating, huh) so concentrated on the vitamin D.\u00a0\u00a0Hence you have learned the lesson to get a copy of everything. It could be the migraines - but you may want to get other tests to rule other stuff out just to make you feel better.Parotids are salivary glands - not sure what is going on there but maybe an infection or something?I would see another neuro too. I hope all goes well.",

    "question": "I am a 40 yr old female with PMH of fibromyalgia. I have had a lot of strange neuro symptoms the last few months: numbness, tingling, memory loss, migraines, blurred vision, severe depression, personality changes, etc... Was referred to a neurologist. Neuro exam quoted as \"normal\". Labs and MRI brain and c-spine orderd. Phone call from nurse two weeks later: Vit D was very low at 8.2. Was started on 50,000u 3x week for that. Was told that can cause a lot of \"weird neuro stuff\". Was told MRI was \"fine\". No follow-up appt ordered. Follow up with primary physician. Saw PCP the next week. He ordered MRI images and reports from the hospital. He is very concerned about MRI results. Wants me to see another neurologist. Here is what the brain MRI showed: \"Small punctate foci of abnormal signal in the deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres- most likely minimal old small vessel ischemic changes. Were not present on previous study in 2001. Two small 5mm diameter rounded structures are noted in the right and left parotid glands and most likely represent small lymph nodes. These are unchanged from previous study.\" I am only 40, have no history of hypertension, diabetes, CAD, etc. What does all this mean and should I be concerned for anything like MS or something like that?? I am very worried and confused. HELP!!!",
