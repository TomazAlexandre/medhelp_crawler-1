            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!There are many possible causes. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Some have been tested where as others need to be. Some of the conditions which can cause similar symptoms are:o\tDiabeteso\tMigraineso\tMultiple sclerosiso\tSeizureso\tStrokeo\tTransient ischemic attack (TIA)o\tUnderactive thyroido\tRaynaud's phenomenono\tAbnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your bodyo\tA lack of vitamin B12 or other vitamino\tCertain medicationso\tToxic action on nerves, such as that from\u201dRefer: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003206.htm You can read more about this on this link.Like the carpal tunnel there is tarsal tunnel syndrome which can cause numbness on foot. Siatica too is a possibility. However you are right about all this not causing confusion. Alzhiermer\u2019s is also a possibility. Also get the liver function tests done.Hope this helps.

    "question": "My wife has been having I call them episodes were she gets dizzy confused memory loss and numbness on her left side. When it first happened they were very strong. I took her to the hospital ER thinking she was having a stroke. She had a CAT scan, EKG, MRI, Ultra sound of her heart. Test came back negative for stroke (Thank God) they thought possible mild case of MS multiple sclerosis, did a spinal tap. more blood test... Test came back negative (Thank God). Neorlogist said go back to our regular family Doctor... He has no idea. The numbness is on the top of the left foot and that is almost constant. Her \"episodes come and go but she is not able to live a normal life the doctors have not given us any medicine and because she has had a history of stress and depression he has pointed at that to be the answer. I found massaging her leg helped the numbness so I took her to a chiropractor but the sciatic nerve is flared up so now she has pain. but there was no pain when this first started nor does that explain the dizziness confusion and memory loss. Anyone got any ideas I have even tryed accupuncture but that is really expensive.",
