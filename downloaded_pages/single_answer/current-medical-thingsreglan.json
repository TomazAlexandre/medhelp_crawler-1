    "question": "I have had abdominal sonograms, endosopies, colonoscopies, Small Bowel Series, HIDA Scan, and Abominal Pelvic MRI w/ contrast, and a Gastric Emptying Scan.The endoscopy revealed GERD, but I seem to be over that now. The only other thing that showed up was an abnormal Gastric Emptying Scan. After 90 minutes, my stomach had only emptied 30%, when at least 50% is normal. I am a 25 year old male. I am 5'10, and weigh about 145lbs.This is what I told my Gastro. doctor today.Symptoms 2 weeks ago-Flatulence throughout the day-Soft stool (not diahrrea, but stool too soft too often)-Rectal spasms-Hungry all thoughout the day (even if I just ate)-Off-balance/Fatigue-feeling-I've been drinking Ensure Plus which is specially formulated to maintain or gain weight, and I've been having to try my hardest just to stop weight lossThis Week-I am getting a full feeling and some pain in the stomach area, it feels like the food is staying in there too long.*So, both weeks seem to be different. The doctor wrote me a prescription for Reglan 10mg. I have seen online that Reglan is the devil, and another doctor had previously told me I shouldn't use it. What do you guys think?",
