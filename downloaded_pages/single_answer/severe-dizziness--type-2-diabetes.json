    "question": "My mother (65 yrs old), is a type 2 diabetic. She has been doing well on tablets but suddenly has been experiencing severe dizziness especially in the mornings for a few months now. All tests done at the hospital including a blood flow test are normal.The doctor she has been seeing for about a year has not made any adjustment to her tablets and cannot offer any suggestions. A second opinion from another doctor diagnosed her as experiencing a mild stroke and added metformin to her list of tablets which she refused to take because she said they make her worse.Please help....I am highly stressed out over this.Thank you.",
