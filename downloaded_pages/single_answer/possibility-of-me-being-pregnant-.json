    "question": "Hi, so um last night/this morning one of my friends came over and we had some extremely hardcore sex. We didn't use a condom and he ejaculate well not exactly inside of me but close enough. I'm a teenager and so I know we were suppose to use a condom. At an early age I was told I couldn't have kids due to complications with diabetes. So there still is a 50/50 change that I can get pregnant... I honestly don't know what to do. I haven't had a period since maybe the beginning of October and I haven't had sex since last year up until yesterday/today.",
