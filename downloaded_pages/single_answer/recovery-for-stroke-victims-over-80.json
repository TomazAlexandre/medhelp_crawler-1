    "question": "Is full recovery less common after 80? My mom had TPA within 3 hours. Hospitals in Lexington KY are mediocre at best.After 2 1/2 weeks, the only improvement has been a weak squeeze in the right hand. She is unable to move her right hand or leg apart from the delayed squeeze. She spends 20 minutes in the standing box. She is unable to transfer to the bed. Her speech involves one word answers.She had her stroke on May 11th. That Friday she was sent to\u00a0\u00a0a certain rehab center close to the airport. They want to keep her until June 10th and feel she needs 24/7 care so she needs to go to a nursing home. Do patients in nursing homes ever get better? It is hard to hire a caregiver who has to lift dead weight and change diapers.Do elderly stroke victims recover? Do they want to exert their aching bones during therapy? Would any improvements occur in a nursing home?",
