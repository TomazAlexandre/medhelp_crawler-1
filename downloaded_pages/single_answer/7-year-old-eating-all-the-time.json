            "answer": "The fact that she isn't thirsty tends to indicate that her glucose levels are not high, for thirst is the primary symptom to look for. I would recommend that you just continue her healthy meals and have chopped veggies handy for those snacks if she is hungry. If her weight is above normal, then you may have to adjust her portions or feed her small amounts throughout the day in order to keep her from getting hungry and overeating at a big meal.",
