            "answer": "Yeast and Trich are different organisms, so one infection should not\u00a0\u00a0be related to the other.\u00a0\u00a0Unless possibly something like a chronic yeast infection lowers your resistance to Trich, which I'm not aware of, and even if it did, there still has to be a source of the Trich infection.\u00a0\u00a0It's not part of the normal flora of the body like yeast is.Z-pack (azithromycin) will treat neither yeast nor Trich, so I'm not sure why you both took that?Needless to say, I'm confused as well.",

    "question": "My girlfriend confronted me with a pap smear result stating she tested positive for Trichomonas. She'd originally thought she had a bad yeast infection. I have type 2 diabetes and have had problems with yeast infections related to high blood sugar. Is it possible that the Trich result and my yeast infection could be related? A year ago in the beginning of our relationship we had a similar problem which we were both given a z-pack even though I tested positive for nothing. Needless to say I am confused.",
