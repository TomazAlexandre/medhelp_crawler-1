            "answer": "hi...the main reason for numbnesss,,pins and needles sensation is due to the high blood glucose levels in the body over an extended period of time that may causes damage to the peripheral nerves....it is also called peripheral nueropathy...Although diabetic peripheral neuropathy can occur in many places in the body, the most common symptoms are abnormal sensations in the toes and feet, including:Sharp, shooting painsBurningTinglingA feeling of being pricked with pinsThrobbingNumbness (not able to properly feel pain, heat, or cold)Diabetic peripheral neuropathy increases the risk for foot ulcers and amputation. Due to nerve damage in their feet and toes, people with diabetes who have diabetic peripheral neuropathy often do not notice minor cuts, sores, or blisters in these areas. If left untreated, these small wounds can easily become infected, lead to gangrene, and may eventually require amputation of the affected area...so my advice is to u is consult ur endocrinologist....avoid eating sweets...follow diabetic diet....gud luck",
