            "answer": "Hi!You have probably given your glycosylated or HbAc1 reading. 6.2 is actually good diabetes control. However, this gives no idea about hypertension. You may have a good diabetes control but your BP may or may not be in control. For this you need to keep a record of your morning evening BP in the initial days, and then a biweekly BP record. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!",
