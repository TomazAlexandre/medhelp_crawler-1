            "answer": "Unfortunately, Type 2 diabetes does progress. You are doing everything you possibly can and your numbers are now rising too high so it is time to see your doctor or an endo and make some changes. Sometimes a simple change or addition of an oral medication may help, but it is also quite possible you now need insulin. Type 2 is a condition of insulin resistance, but over time the beta cells do stop producing sufficient insulin and exogenous insulin is required. This does not mean you have failed! It sounds like you have done very well for 11 years on watching your blood sugar. Insulin use will allow you to manage your blood sugars and eat with a bit more flexibility. It is an adjustment and I suggest the book Using Insulin by John Walsh if your doctor does indeed prescribe insulin.",
