            "answer": "Children of this age are subject to a condition called Extraordinary Daytime Urinary Frequency Stndrome, also called Pollakiuruia. It is not indicative of any underlying medical problem, and usually is associated with stress. It resolves spontaneously. Now, frequent urination during the daytime can also be symptomatic of urinary tract infection, diabetes, etc., so it's best not to assume it's EDUFS and have it checked medically. Her collection of symptoms don't suggest an eating disorder, but rather a fear of dying of an allergic reaction. It might be best to obtain a pediatric mental health evaluation. She can be helped to correct some cognitive distortions, and the therapist can work with you to develop a behavioral program. Such cognitive-behavioral treatment is the recommended form of treatment for such fears. By the way, is there a family history of anxiety disorders? Such conditions have a strong biological component, and children with a positive family history are more susceptible to developing an anxiety disorder than children without such a family history.",
