            "answer": "Dear ndl1945,Many thanks for posting the question.Though have not examined you, still i will try my best to resolve your query.All the symptoms described by you will require a proper neurological examination to know the signs also,so that both can be co-related and arrive to a better conclusion.The diagnosis of autonomic disorder may stand correct, i really can't comment as i have not examined you.There is no harm in taking the alpha lipoic acid medicine.We may supplement it with Vit B-12 and other nerve regenerators for a better effect.We will have to wait, till the neurologist sees you.Feel free to ask more/discuss more before you visit the neurologist as that you can be more specific in asking your doubts.Regards",

    "question": "In mid-September I began to experience a numbing sensation in my right foot, and then the same sensation beginning the palm of my right hand and extending to my fingers.\u00a0\u00a0Not long after, experienced the same sequence of events with my left foot and hand.\u00a0\u00a0No pain, no tingling \u2013 just a numbness.Over the past couple of months, the situation has steadily worsened to the extent that it\u2019s now affecting my ability to walk and to use my fingers for simple everyday tasks.\u00a0\u00a0The fingers \u201cfeel\u201d swollen, and appear swollen and the pads of fingertips are smooth and no longer provide any traction for picking up an object, buttoning a garment, zipping a zipper, etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feet the same at balls of feet, toes and heels.\u00a0\u00a0Tried a diuretic in that the sensation felt like edema.\u00a0\u00a0Did not alleviate the problem.When I look at my face in the mirror, it appears there has been a slackening of my right eyelid and right cheek.\u00a0\u00a0Also, overall, it seems my right side had been a bit more severely affected than my left.\u00a0\u00a0Also experiencing a blotchy facial rash that peals like a patch of dry skin or a sunburn might.So far, I am told blood work has ruled out:\u00a0\u00a0diabetes, scleroderma, raynauds, lyme disease, osteoarthritis, MS.\u00a0\u00a0Disc problem has been ruled out because this has presented on both sides of my body instead of just one.One physician said I have advanced autonomic disorder and recommended 600 mg of alpha lipoic acid.\u00a0\u00a0The other has recommended a\u00a0\u00a0consultation with a neurologist, which I have had scheduled for next week.\u00a0\u00a0Any further testing may have to wait until January, as I\u2019m told it could run into the thousand dollar range.If any of this sounds familiar, or if you have any recommendations on following up with my neurologists appointment, I\u2019d appreciate you sharing your thoughts.",
