            "answer": "The teen years are a hard time to be \"different\".\u00a0\u00a0Yes, she needs counseling.\u00a0\u00a0She also needs to be taught that she is the one responsible for her health.\u00a0\u00a0All teens go thru rebellious phases.\u00a0\u00a0She needs to understand that in her case it could be deadly.\u00a0\u00a0She is not alone. There are a lot of us out here!\u00a0\u00a0Is her doctor a specialist??\u00a0\u00a0a GP?\u00a0\u00a0a Pediatrician?\u00a0\u00a0She needs a doctor who specializes in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you can find one who also specializes in teenagers, that would be even better.\u00a0\u00a0Tell your daughter that a 15 year old is still a child.\u00a0\u00a0If the mother/father doesn't learn the foods to encourage and how much she should be eating,\u00a0\u00a0they are contributing to their daughters bad health. Parents and child together should attend education classes.\u00a0\u00a0The education will probably not do any good until she gets some counseling.\u00a0\u00a0You are one smart Grandma.\u00a0\u00a0Don't give up.",

    "question": "My granddaughter is 13 & had diabetes since she was 2.\u00a0\u00a0Her parents have never manged to keep her blood sugar under control, mainly through lack of discipline, and over the years there has been a history of many highs and lows in blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0All her grandparents are very concerned for her health.\u00a0\u00a0I do not live near them and only get to see them once in a while but over the last couple of years I have become deeply concerned.\u00a0\u00a0My granddaughter is showing serious signs of depression which everyone is mistaking for \"the age\" she is.\u00a0\u00a0My main concern is that now she refuses to eat very much.\u00a0\u00a0Her carbs are mostly high sugar content, very little protein mostly cheese, and no vegetables or fruits or whole grains to speak of.\u00a0\u00a0To me she is starving to get attention, literally.She had a hypoglycemic episode while I was in their home this past weekend; she woke at 4 am with much confusion passed out and her blood sugar was extremely low (I didn't find out the number).\u00a0\u00a0After administering glucogin they wanted to send her off to school!Apparently she has had at least 3 more such episodes in the past month.I encouraged them later in the day to call their doctor and get a referral to a child psychologist because this is just too big a problem now to ignore.About six weeks ago I attended one of their appointments with her dietitian and was told that diabetics are not to be treated differently any longer and that the hope is that they would \"choose\" the right foods.\u00a0\u00a0I was appalled.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter seems unaware of all of the education she has had regarding nutrition and seems unwilling to get help regarding same.It seems I am turning into a nagging grandma and yet I feel I have to; I am so concerned for my granddaughter.\u00a0\u00a0Am I on the right track and if not what kind of things would be helpful?",
