    "question": "My sister in-law is Asian and about 45 years old. She has diabetes. In recent years, she has swollen due to fluid build up in the body. Doctors suspect liver disease. She was once cured before. But the condition is coming back again. She has become pale and yellow. Is that liver disease or kidney disease? Is there a chance for cure? Will she get better? I can post her blood tests if some doctors can have a look. Thanks a lot.",
