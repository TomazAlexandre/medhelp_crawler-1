            "answer": "Hi, Thanks for the job you do, my son is a police officer and I know you all are under respected !Do you take shots or pills to control your sugar? I know for myself ( I'm on insulin) the signs of a low sugar are dizziness, sweating and I even have heart palpitations when my sugar is dropping too low. Some people even have shakiness. The most important thing is to try to eat at about the same time each and ALWAYS carry something sweet with you in case of emergencies !! Keep a candy bar in your glove box. Some people told me to keep the little packs of honey that you might get at a fast food place, that seems to bring immediate relief. Good Luck to you, Diabetes is a very fickle disease, but can be managed.",
