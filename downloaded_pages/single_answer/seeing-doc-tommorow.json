            "answer": "Hi again Abeybaby,I know you know we're all volunteers and not medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0For the benefit of others who may read this Q&A for the first time, I'll restate that we're all volunteers with lots of experience with Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0None of us is a medical professional.You're doing GREAT things to help stave off diabetes!\u00a0\u00a0Losing weight and becoming physically active are two major lifestyle changes that will help you avoid, delay diabetes AND will help you to feel great on a regular basis.I can think of nothing additional in the way of testing for you.\u00a0\u00a0The a1c gives an a good picture of a person's *average* blood sugar over a period of about 3 months... with the average weighted a bit more heavily toward more recent days/weeks.As you know, a person who has these readings:70, 130, 120, 80, 100 will have an average of 100.A person with these readings will also have an average of 10050, 200, 50, 100, 100A person with that second set of readings would likely experience some symptoms that the first person wouldn't, because of the *variation* in the readings.\u00a0\u00a0When you feel shaky, it's a good idea to test.\u00a0\u00a0If you feel odd in any way, it's a good idea to test, to either treat the blood sugar situation (too high or too low) or to simply rule out blood sugar as a cause.Even a non-diabetic will have variations in their blood glucose, so when you see your doc ask about the range s/he would like you to achieve with your home test.\u00a0\u00a0Also ask for periodic a1c tests. Diabetics are encouraged to get an a1c every 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0Ask you doc how often you should get one.Do take a moment to reward yourself in some kind & healthy way for the FABulous lifestyle changes you've already achieved! Keep up the good work!",

    "question": "Hello and tks again for taking questions. I am seeing a dr tommorow and will ask to see an endocronologist asap for preventing or at least deferring diabetis for as long as possible. I have done a fasting glucose 6 months ago and a A1C test and now take daily readings which appear to be normal just feeling shaky at times due to hypoglycemia ...What other tests can I take to confirm a diagnosis or a potential problem? I have since lost 12 pounds since we took my readings and now at perfect weight levels. I will probably try to loose 5 pounds more and renew an excercise regimen. What kinds of questions might I ask, what tests might I take, and what else can I do while discussing with the dr?Tks very much. I don't want diabetis and I am determined to fight hard to avoid it!! I just need some guidance now.",
