            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.The American Diabetes Association has a great website with a lot of information that may be helpful for you.\u00a0\u00a0Also, medhelp has a lot of resources as well as communities where you can meet/talk with other people who have type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You should ask your doctor where he or she wants your blood sugars to be.\u00a0\u00a0Typically, you want to keep your bloodsugars as close to normal as possible- this means a fasting blood sugar of less than 100mg/dl. Non fasting blood sugars should be less than 180 mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0However, target ranges are individualized and you should really discuss this with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.Bridget",
