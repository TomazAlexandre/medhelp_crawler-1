    "question": "Hi, I am 30 years old and I just had a baby 5 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have been getting nausea off and on since the pregnancy and it seems to be getting a little bit worse.\u00a0\u00a0I will drink water and eat something when I feel nausea and that doesn't seem to help much.\u00a0\u00a0I have been irritable and emotional.\u00a0\u00a0I have a doctors appointment on Sep. 13, which is about 3 weeks away.\u00a0\u00a0I scheduled it because of spotting and light bleed that I keep having.\u00a0\u00a0I also have had signs of yeast infections.\u00a0\u00a0A friend of mine suggested that maybe the nausea was due to low blood sugar, so I have been looking that up today and have found that my symptoms could be diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if I need to see a doctor sooner than in 3 weeks or if my symptoms are more like something minor that can wait 3 weeks to be checked out.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, Joy",
