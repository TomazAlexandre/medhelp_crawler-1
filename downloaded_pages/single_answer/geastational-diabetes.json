            "answer": "hey,i would talk to the doctor about that. sounds like he or she was quite vague about things. and i know how it is when you're at the doctors and you hear new things. you dont think of questions on the spot.the doctor told me my numbers were high for the 1 hour glucose test and sent me to a dietian. i test for one meal a day and follow the diet as well. but they never said i have gestational diabetes either. so i'm the 'just in case' plan of action. and i dont like eating six times a day either. when i'm really not feeling like eating i just eat something that has the 30 carbs in it, like a banana. a short and sweet snack.personally i would keep on the diet for the entire pregnancy. you know, 'just in case' better to adjust your eating and hope for an average size baby than to eat when you're hungry and have a big baby. baby likes snacks anyway, even when you aren't feeling that appetite bell.hang in there! at least its only for the duration of the pregnancy and not an every day issue we face.good luck",
