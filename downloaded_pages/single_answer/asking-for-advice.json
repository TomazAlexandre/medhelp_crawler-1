            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!There are two things you must definitely look at. One is diabetes and the other is hypothyroidism. Weird taste in mouth and nausea could be due to GERD or acid reflux. Anemia too can cause tiredness. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.There are many cancer markers in the blood. Many labs run a cancer screening test. You can talk to your doctor regarding this.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "for the past 4 years now, i've been feeling different. At nite i get nauseaded, and have hot and cold flashed through out the day and nite. the first year it wasen't too bad but through out the years it got worse. Today as i write this it's been 3,4 months now and i find its gotten worst. Im always sweating, i have this weird taste in my mouth, i get nauseaded and im always tired and i feel weak. I am not pregnant, and im scared to go see a doctor because im scared of what the results might be. 2 years ago my dad was diagnost with cancer he too wasen't feeling well he was tired all the time and just feeling under the weather. im feeling the same way he's feeling and im not liking this. What kind of test do they run to find out if u have cancer and should i take theses symptoms seriously??",
