    "question": "I was recently told i\"m pre-diabetic. I'm a 54-year old overweight woman. I also recently developed additional symptoms: severe edema in feet/ankles/calves (sudden onset three weeks ago), constant (and loud!) ear ringing, blurry vision, dizziness, wheezing (high-pitched, whistling sounds) and headache. The edema becomes so bad it's hard to walk. Could this be related to the pre-diabetes?",
