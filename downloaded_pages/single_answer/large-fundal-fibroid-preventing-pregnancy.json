            "answer": "Now my doctor is afraid to do the surgery, because I have diabetes...he is afraid there will be complications. I understand that I am too old to conceive due to having this large fundal fibroid. I understand that once the fibroid is removed, my uterus will be too thin to carry a baby to term...Now I have to decide whether or not to have the surgery. My doctor thinks I'll be going thru menopause, but I was tested and am not in menopause. I believe I have at least a year before I go into menopause based on family history. Right now we're monitoring it, but if it grows, or I have heavy bleeding or pain, then it must be removed. If it grows it risks turning into cancer. So, I'm having it tested next month, April. After I have my colonoscopy.",

    "question": "I want to conceive, but am having an issue with a large fundal fibroid. One doctor recommended a super-cervical hysterectomy, but that would lose any option of trying to conceive. I am trying to find a doctor who would remove just the fibroid, so that I would have the option to try to conceive. I want to know would it still be safe for me to have an abdominal myomectomy, and have the option of trying to conceive? I am 51 years old now, and have diabetes. My uterus has enlarged to 19.9 x 14.0 cm, due to the fibroid. Appearance consistent with a large fundal myoma extending just above the umbilicus measures 11.0 x 10.1 x 11.3 cm. Endometrial echo is suboptimally delineated due to displacement, and measures 6 mm in thickness.\u00a0\u00a0There is no evidence of free fluid in the pelvis.If possible, I would like the fibroid removed without damaging of my uterus. I want to know if this is possible? Can someone give me some idea if this is at all possible?\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, my insurance will cover this. Please get back to me.",
