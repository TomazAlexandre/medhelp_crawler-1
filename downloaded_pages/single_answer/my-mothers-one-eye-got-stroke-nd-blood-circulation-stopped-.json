            "answer": "A \"stroke in the eye\" is not a medical term but something used to help non-medical people understand something. Most likely she had either a \"central retinal artery\" occlusion or a \"central retinal vein occlusion\"\u00a0\u00a0You might look on the billing slips for a diagnosis. It is impossible to tell you how much vision might recover but if good vision has not returned in a week the prognosis is not good.\u00a0\u00a0These are often caused by the same things as strokes: diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity, irregular heart rhythm especially atrial fibrillation, abnormal blood thickness. She needs to be evaluated carefully by her personal physician to rule any and all of these and those present treated immediately as the second good eye is at risk also. You need to confirm this with her ophthalmologists.",
