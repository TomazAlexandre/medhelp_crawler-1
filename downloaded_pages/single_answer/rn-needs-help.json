    "question": "I'm 25 years old, I have a blood disorder called monochylomicronemia, my trigs are like 8,000. It has caused me to have pancreatitis about 12 times, a decreased liver functions and an\u00a0\u00a0enlarged liver.\u00a0\u00a0I was very ill in Oct, I was on TPN, in ICU, had a necrosed area to my panceas. My heart was doing all kinds of crazy tachy arrythmias. 3 weeks later I went home and recovered, but when I first got out I had my period for like 2 weeks. I was so hot and thirsty all the time, especially when I'd sleep. It's still occuring, I have irregular rhythms everday that make me\u00a0\u00a0a little short of breath. I barely ever get periods, I was regular before, now maybe 3 times since last oct. and I get soooooo hot and thirsty while sleeping. I wake up roasting and uncontrolably thirsty, and then I pee alot. I'm thinking either a horman imbalance of some kind or diabetesis. What do you think",
