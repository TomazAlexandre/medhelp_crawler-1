    "question": "I have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a couple of years ago. I am taking Victoza shots every morning and my diabetes usually runs under the 100s. A while ago my right hand has been falling asleep and I try to exercise daily for 30 minutes. But just recently I wake up and now it is not only falling asleep but full of pain. I have never had it hurt like this constantly unless I take Naproxen and that helps take the pain away for a few hours. But I mostly wake up with this strong pain in my hand even in the middle of the night.When I put my hand under scalding hot water it makes my hand feel real good.What do you think:?Angela",
