            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since you have PCOS, chances of insulin resistance developing are high. This can in turn increase the blood sugar level and cause symptoms of diabetes such as increased thirst, hunger and urination. There are various approaches to treat a polycystic ovary. First of all insulin resistance has to be checked and corrected by a dose of metformin. Then regular check ups have to be scheduled and you put on low dose birth control pills to regularize the cycles first. Once this is corrected, regular ultrasounds will be done to assess the status of the ovum and accordingly drugs prescribed. At times laproscopy is done and cysts punctured. Diet and weight control are also important part of therapy and you need to be under a good nutrition expert.Please consult your gynecologist for this or preferably an infertility center is you also want a second child. Usually such centers can treat this by a combined approach of a gynecologist and a diabetologist.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

I was at first concerned i was preganant even though I have had regular periods. I have taken a number of pregnancy tests and they were all negative. A couple of people have told me that my symptoms could also point to diabetes. What could be going on?",
