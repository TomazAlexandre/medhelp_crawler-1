            "answer": "Hello.Diabetes affects blood flow to the penis, which affects erection. Many men with diabetes find they need more direct and intense stimulation than provided by p-v. Erections may take longer, and even come and go. If you can both accept this and stop worrying about it, you can begin to explore ways to be sexual that are mutually pleasurable and don\u2019t require an erect penis.You\u2019ll need to be more specific about what you mean by \u201chim wanting to please me.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what you mean by this. Are you perhaps thinking that he should \u201cgive\u201d you an orgasm? Realize that no matter how long his erection lasts, you may not have an orgasm during p-v sex because it often doesn\u2019t provide effective clitoral stimulation. The more pressure you put on him to \u201cplease\u201d you, the more anxiety you\u2019ll create, and this will be counter-productive. You might find it helpful to reassure him that he doesn\u2019t need an erection for the two of you to enjoy your sexuality together and also for the two of you to talk about what kinds of activities you\u2019d like to try. Best of luck. Dr. J",
