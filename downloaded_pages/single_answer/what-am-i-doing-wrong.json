            "answer": "Hi,I commend you on your active lifestyle, it seems that this is a good priority for you. YOu certainly could use less sugar in your drinks(and I encourage that)\u00a0\u00a0as this does contribute in your diet. I would also encourage you to try to limit your drinks to one per day. Keep in mind also that carbohydrates as a group, not only sweet things, affect blood sugars.You may not be doing any one thing wrong as the cause. There are many individuals with abnormalities in their glucose metabolism who have very little family history and are not overweight.\u00a0\u00a0The fasting glucose is not a perfect test but the fact that you had repeat values that were not quite normal makes me think there may be some abnormality there.In future consider doing a 2 hour glucose tolerance test as this can give some additional information regarding glucose handling. It is not as common, but you may have too little insulin(instead of insulin resistance) as the cause.However all of this should be determined after further testing of your glucoses).Keep active as you are and try to cut back on the added sugar and alcohol. Every little bit you can do will help.Take care.",
