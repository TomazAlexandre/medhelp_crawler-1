From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be an arthritis related, circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0Besides it occurs due to anxiety, clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes, due to injury to a nerve, pressure on spinal or peripheral nerves (neuropathy), vitamin deficiency etc. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first.
