Do you feel hopeless about your relationship with food?Copyright \u00a9 2000-2010 Food Addicts in Recovery AnonymousAre you asking what is a healthy intake of sugar when you ask what is the norm for sugar intake? There is no 'norm' for sugar intake.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to the twentieth century, people were eating very little sugar, and the norm that existed\u00a0\u00a0100 year ago (or even 50 years ago) is far less than the huge amounts that people are eating today. In any case, whatever the norm is, if you are a sugar addict, then NO amount of sugar is healthy. Even if you are not a sugar addict, the norm today is not healthy. It will promote diabetes, obesity and mood disorders.Please be assured that sugar intake norms are not based on what is the most healthy but what is the most profitable for the food industry.Please check out my website: http://addictionsunplugged.com/2011/03/30/are-you-a-food-addict/ for more information, also.",
