            "answer": "It's a complicated story, and I can not make a diagnosis on the internet but here are some thoughts. Your weight gain of muscle may have nothing to do with your effexor, just your catching up with yourself developmentally, and maybe because no longer taking prednisone.Your psychological symptoms still sound like depression so I would recommend that you stop looking for help just from your medication, and start some psychotherapy to get yourself on track with your life, which will get rid of your depression.Some of your other symptoms may be related to your dose of effexor, and you might ask your doctor about tapering off the medication altogether as a trial, but only if you start psychotherapy at the same time.",

    "question": "Hello,I think there might be an underlying cause to many of my symptoms (listed below), but I don't know what. I'm a 24 year old male. I'm 5'9'' and weigh about 140 lbs. However, before I started effexor two years ago, I weighed about 100 lbs and was the same height. I gained about 40 lbs after being on the drug for 6 months. I started taking 75mg then gradually increased to 375mg before going back to 300mg. My BMI was 14.8. The real kicker is that almost all (if not all) of the 40 lbs I gained came on as muscle! (I am currently taking 300 mg of effexor with 50 mg of Wellbutrin).(This is not at all common! Most people just put on fat!)Here are my symptoms: fatigue, depression, anxiety, lethargy, constipation (IBS supposedly), putrid gas, muscle weakness, weak immune system, growth hormone count of .04ng/ml (nanograms/millilter) [on the low end but not \"deficient\"--The 'normal' range is between .01-.97 ng/mL], some symptoms of rickets (large dent or groove on top of skull and mild genu valgum), very low motivation, confusion, lack of focus, and sensitivity to medication (I need less and it works faster, with the exception of effexor).Somethings to consider: I was prescribed prednisone frequently when I was younger for asthma. I haven't taken any prednisone since I was 16 or 17. I also took inhaled steriods for intermittent periods of time and I would frequently use a nebulizor and an albuterol inhaler. There is no family history of any disease or mental illness in my family except for type II Diabetes and Asthma on my Dad's side. I'm a vegan, but I'm conscious about my nutrition, so I doubt I'm deficient in anything nutrition-wise and my blood tests, though not extensive, would seem to agree. Even my sisters, who were shorter than me, weighed more than me and were at a normal weight, and my Dad was not a skinny guy either, so it's unlikely that my previously low weight was due to typical genetic variance.Anyone have a clue of what I got?",
