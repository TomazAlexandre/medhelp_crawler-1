            "answer": "Hi,Overall I encourage everyone, not only those with Type 2 diabetes, to avoid sweets, candies and extra sugar. Alcohol can be consumed in moderate amounts usually without too many adverse effects. More specifically in Type 2 diabetes, sweets etc can and do raise blod sugars as well as add weight, so they are best consumed in small amounts only.Take care.",
