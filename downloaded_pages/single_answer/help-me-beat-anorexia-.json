            "answer": "Hi!I am really sorry to hear what you are going through. You do have an eating disorder. However, you could also be having problems other than eating disorder like anemia, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. Get this ruled out. To be able to complete any programs that will help you lose weight and overcome this vicious cycle of anorexia and bulima would need lots of patience and faith. Apart from seeing your therapist and learning behavior techniques to overcome these problems you could also do yoga to strengthen your mind. Also, if you cannot involve your family, maybe you could involve your psychiatrist, college/school counselor or some family friend. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
