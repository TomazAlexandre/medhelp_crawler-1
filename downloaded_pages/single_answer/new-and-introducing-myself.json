            "answer": "Hi!Well, even if you had gastric band surgery and are not eating healthy and exercising as per your body\u2019s need, you can gain weight. To maintain a healthy weight there should be a balance between the calorie intake and the calories burnt. To lose weight, you should burn more calories than what you take in. You should consult a dietician and access your calorie needs according to your body structure, height, waist etc. The dietician can help you prepare a diet chart and give your food and portion options.\u00a0\u00a0Then you need to consult a trainer to find out what exercises you can do (in view of your MS) to burn more calories than your requirement. This you need to slowly build up into your routine. Also, you need to find out whether you have anemia or electrolyte imbalance (this can cause weight gain by water retention). Diabetes and hypothyroidism too can cause weight increase and hence should be investigated for. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
