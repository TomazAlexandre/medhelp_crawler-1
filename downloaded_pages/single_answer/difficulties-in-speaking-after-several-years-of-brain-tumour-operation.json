            "answer": "Dear Vijay-Thank you very much for your question.\u00a0\u00a0I must preface my answer by stating that it is important that you recognize that my impression is based entirely on the information you have provided in your posting and is by no means a substitute for an office visit with a neurologist or neurosuregeon.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosis is contingent on detailed history and physical exam and as such, the following information should be considered solely for educational purposes.To summarize the key points from your father's history, he is a 68 year-old male with a history of left parietal astrocytoma who has undergone chemotherapy and radiotherapy for his tumor.\u00a0\u00a0Since his tumor has been diagnosed, he has developed some kidney problems and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0For about one month, he has developed problems with his speech, predominantly with word pronunciation, word recall, reading problems, and comprehension.\u00a0\u00a0He has had some brain imaging that revealed a chronic bleed with in the left frontal region without edema.\u00a0\u00a0There is no hypermetabolic area of the brain to active tumor growth per the PET scan and his carotid doppler was unremarkable.Although your neurosurgeon may have explained some of the following already, please allow me to elaborate on some of my thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0It is first important to understand that the brain is a unique organ in that each individual part of the brain is responsible for something different and a patient's clinical picture generally reflects that part of the brain involved.\u00a0\u00a0Problems with language generally tell me that there is a problem in the left frontal and/or temporal lobes, although this may vary slightly from patient to patient.What you describe with your father is what we neurologists call an aphasia-i.e. difficulty with language.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like your father is experiencing what we would call a \"mixed aphasia\"-i.e. a problem with expressive language as well as receptive language.\u00a0\u00a0You allude to more severe impairment of English than his native tongue which is something we often see in people that have injured a component of their brain responsible for language.\u00a0\u00a0In the vast majority of patients, the left part of the brain is responsible for language, specifically the left temporal and frontal lobes.\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the bleed in your father's frontal lobe, depending on location (I cannot view your films), may be in part responsible for the language problems he is experiencing, specifically with respect to his expression.\u00a0\u00a0Just posterior to that part of the frontal lobe is a portion of the temporal lobe (just adjacent to the parietal lobe) that\u00a0\u00a0is involved in comprehension.\u00a0\u00a0Although you do not describe any direct injury to this part of the brain, depending on the parietal tumor location, injury to this area could have been sustained either inadvertently from the radiation or do to regional scarring from the tumor.\u00a0\u00a0Similar deficits in language can also be seen in patients who have stroke, although this is usually easily diagnosed through imaging studies (MRI, in particular).Problems with memory are likely secondary to a number of factors.\u00a0\u00a0Again, memory loss may be a side-effect of both chemotherapy and radiation.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, your father has recently developed diabetes and renal problems.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, if the kidneys are unable to filter out all of the toxins in the blood, a condition known as uremia can result causing confusion and sometimes impaired memory- a generalized states known as an encephalopathy.\u00a0\u00a0A similar state can occur in the context of poorly controlled blood sugars.At this point, my recommendation to you would be to continue to follow with a neurologist as well as a neurosurgeon who can best treat the memory decline.\u00a0\u00a0I agree that Nootrpil (AKA piracetam) and Aricept (AKA donepezil) are appropriate in your father's case.\u00a0\u00a0Vitamin E may also be appropriate although you should consult your physician.\u00a0\u00a0As far as the language difficuty, there are no medications that will likely fix that.\u00a0\u00a0Speech therapy is likely appropriate and may yield some benefit.\u00a0\u00a0I think that PT and OT is also a good idea.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know where you are receiving treatment or where you live, but large academic centers such as the Cleveland Clinic have well-established programs for managing patients in your father's situation.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that this information was helpful to you.Good luck with your father, and have a happy and healthy holiday.Sincerely,JBT, MD",

    "question": "Dear Doctor,My father (68yrs) was operated for brain tumour in 1999 (left parietal astrosytoma), part of tumour was removed. He was diagnosed with this problem as his right leg would suddenly go to sleep and he'd not be able to control it. He also underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy which ended mid 2000. He was also on Mazetol 200mg until mid 07.He was normal for some years but gradually developed problems. He can't balance his body properly, drags his right leg little while walking and has problem moving it, for safety walks with support.His memory has weakened a lot, he has developed other problems such as related to kidney (increase of urea) and diabetes and is on a strict renal-diabetic diet now, takes insulin.*Major Problem: He has started finding it difficult to speak since about last month. He is unable to pronounce words correctly and sometimes pronounces words like a child.His capability of understanding things has weakened. He reads individual words in the newspaper but is unable to understand the\u00a0\u00a0sentence. He understands his mother tongue slightly better than english. He can't recall the right words to say. Sometimes he reads time wrongly, reads words wrongly (e.g. read 'thursday' as 'tuesday').We did Positron Emission Tomography in nov, report reads:\u00a0\u00a0PET CT findings are suggestive of a small ? subacute to chronic bleed in the left frontal region with surrounding edema. No area of abnormal FDG uptake in the brain parenchyma.Carotid doppler test - normal.Neurosurgeon concluded - no growth in tumour, there was a bleeding.For memory, neurologist suggested (a) Nootropil 1200mg each twice a day (b) Aricep 5mg, once before bed time. Also suggested Physio/occupational therapy.Main concern: why is my father finding it difficult to speak, what are the treatment options?We'd really appreciate any information which would allow us to understand my father's condition better and help us to get him good treatment.thanks,vijay",
