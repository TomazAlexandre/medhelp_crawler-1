            "answer": "Hello,It looks like you are having some spinal cord or disc problem because numbness often results from nerve compression or injury. The erectile dysfunction may be related to this. Other causes which need to be ruled out are medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, spinal cord injury, nerve damage, or neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease). My sincere advice would be to consult a urologist/ neurologist.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
