    "question": "I underwent a total knee replacement operation on 17-12-2007. My progress for one month thereafter was quite good. I was able to walk without a walker and used to do the walking and stairclimbing exercise regularly. There was a sudden cold wave a few days ago and temoeratures dropped to a level to which I was not accustomed Four days ago I was getting up from the bed and suddenly the strength in my leg muscles appeared to have gove gone. I did not fall but collapsed on the floor. My surgeon examined the operated legs and declared that nothing is wrong with the operated knees. I am having mild diasbetes [ pp sugar being 129 [ with daily dose of anti-diabetes tablets] My haemoglobine is 11.40 [ I am a woman and my age is 75 years] Even after rest I am still not able to walk without a walker. What could be the problem?NAlini Keskar",
