            "answer": "My first symptoms were over 4 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I was just recently (2 months ago) FINALLY diagnosed with Fibro. after having every conceivable test run!\u00a0\u00a0I have been poked, prodded and pinched for 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0So, with that being said...The very first thing I noticed was that I was just unable to \"recover\" from yard work.\u00a0\u00a0I have never been a sedintary person and about one year to one and half years after my third child was born, I noticed that raking, gardening, mowing would just KILL me!\u00a0\u00a0My muscles would ache for three to four days like someone had taken a stick to me!\u00a0\u00a0I thought at first that I was just out of shape and that other factors were involved - (I was a heavy drinker and had diabetes and didn't really get a lot of sleep!)\u00a0\u00a0So - I chaulked it up to unhealthy living.\u00a0\u00a0Then it just started progressing....My sleep pattern became very weird and I would awaken after 8 hours of sleep and feel like I had not slept.\u00a0\u00a0My neck and shoulders ached ALL the TIME!\u00a0\u00a0 This went on for until 2005.\u00a0\u00a0I started having extreme pain in my right side and usually one to two weeks out of the month - my knees (more over, the BACK of my knees)\u00a0\u00a0would just ache and burn something awful.\u00a0\u00a0I was still drinking pretty heavily at the time so again - I thought it was something else.\u00a0\u00a0I had my gallbladder removed in Feb of 2006 but the pain was still there.\u00a0\u00a0I finally got sober in April of 2006 but the muscle pain stayed with me!\u00a0\u00a0The sleep problems have stayed with me as well.\u00a0\u00a0I have unspecific muscle pain all over my body at this point.\u00a0\u00a0Some days it is in the upper region, some days it is my lower limbs only, some days its BOTH.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I am just about to come down with the flu about 80% of the time.\u00a0\u00a0Tired, achy, sore, fatigued.\u00a0\u00a0It takes around one to two weeks for me to \"recover\" from any kind of hard physical labor and sex even makes me \"flare\" up!\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing wrong with my joints.\u00a0\u00a0I have no inflammation\u00a0\u00a0(as is the case with fibromyalgia)\u00a0\u00a0As to when I sought medical treatment....well, I've been to about 20 doctors over the course of 4years.\u00a0\u00a0The Rhuematologist prescribed Lyrica.\u00a0\u00a0Have yet to try it...very scared of it.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe someone on this posting forum will have some advice.Hope all goes well..",
