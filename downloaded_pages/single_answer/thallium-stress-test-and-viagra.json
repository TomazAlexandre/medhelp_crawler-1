            "answer": "Viagra is a medication that also causes a drop in the patient's blood pressure. It is important for patients to ask on an individual basis whether it is a medication that they can safely take with their other medications. If you are taking a nitroglycerin preparation, Viagra is NOT allowed. Do not use Viagra within 24 hours of the test. Nitro-glycerine (sometimes given during a stress test) may interact with Viagra, resulting in a dangerous drop in blood pressure.Patients who are taking medications for lung problems, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure and Persantine may need to alter their medications. A complete set of written instructions will be given to patients when the test is scheduled",
