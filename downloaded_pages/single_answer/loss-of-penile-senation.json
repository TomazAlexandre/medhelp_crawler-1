    "question": "I'm am 24-years old, and about 4 years ago I noticed that I had lost sensation in the shaft of my penis. The strange thing was the way it happened: I was lying down in bed, I woke up, and suddenly the sensation was gone. I could still get an erection and orgasm just fine, but I couldn't really feel anything during masturbation or intercourse.I went to see both a urologist and neurologist, and the results showed nothing was wrong with me psychically.Also, about a year ago, I noticed that there was a loss of the relaxing sensation you get when urinating. There was a decrease of the sensation of pleasure in the pit of my stomach when sexually stimulated. It has also affected how hard I laugh, if that makes any sense,About 6 weeks ago I went back to the urologist for a second opinion, and the results were the same. He gave me some Viagra, but it hasn't helped me get any of the feeling back, so he suggested that I see a psychiatrist to make sure that my problem isn't all in my head.I don't smoke or do any recreational drugs, and I didn't start drinking at this point, nor do I have diabetes or take any medications.Does anyone have any suggestions on what could be wrong with me?",
