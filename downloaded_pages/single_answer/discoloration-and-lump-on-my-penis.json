            "answer": "Hello,Leukoplakia a rare lesion more frequently arising in individuals with diabetes and apart from that balanitis obliterans xerotica and lichen sclerosus also need to be ruled out. Lichen sclerosis appears as white,dry plaques on the glans, foreskin or shaft of the penis.Balanitis xerotica is a severe form of lichen sclerosis.In my opinion a clinical examination by a dermatologist will help in confirming a diagnosis as treatment depends on the same. I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I noticed a slight discoloration on the head of my penis.\u00a0\u00a0My normal skin tone is a light brown/tan and this spot on my glans is a lighter color with a little pink tint.\u00a0\u00a0I felt the spot and found that it is hard.\u00a0\u00a0It feels as if there is a small pea sized mass underneath this discoloration.\u00a0\u00a0I have done some looking online and think that it could be leukoplakia of the glans penis.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound right?\u00a0\u00a0There is no pain or discomfort associated with it.\u00a0\u00a0I have noticed the coloring for a while now but never felt for a mass before today.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 20 year old white male with a neonatal circumcision and everything that I have read is saying that penile cancer is very rare in the U.S. so I am hoping that I either caught it early or it is simply not cancer.",
