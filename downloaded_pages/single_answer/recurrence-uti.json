            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Recurrent cystitis can occur in case of immuno-compromised conditions like diabetes, old age, interstitial cystitis, atypical organism and fungal cystitis etc. Get a cystoscopy done to clarify with the cause.Doxycycline is a antibacterial agent, and even if it shows that bacteria are resistant to tetracyclines it does not mean that this drug will help the bacteria grow further. There is no harm in using doxycyclne for prostatitis.Also organisms in your urine culture are resistant to tetracyclines, but not the organisms causing prostatitis.Use doxycycline course and if symptoms still persist get a cystoscopy done.All the best.",
