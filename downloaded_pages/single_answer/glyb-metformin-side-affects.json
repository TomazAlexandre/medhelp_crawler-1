            "answer": "Are you taking the Glybmetformin for diabetes or weight loss?Have you discussed with your doctor about lowering the dose?Or stopping the medication entirely to see if your symptoms go away?Glyburide, for example, can cause stomach problems. Also Metformin if not taken with food. If you feel everything started around the time you switched meds its time to talk with your doctor\"I was border type II diabetic\"What are you now?What is your A1c test results?Do you test your glucose at home? How often?Are you at normal weight for your age and height?Do you perform physical exercise 5 times a week?You didn't give us much information to work with to suggest anything one way or the other.\"very bad discomfort in my back under my ribs...even feels sore...acid reflux.\"Could be your kidneys. Excess sodium in your diet will cause kidney issues. Acid reflux is when stomach gases [food or liquid] backs up into your esophagus [your lower chest]. AF feels like someone is standing on your sternum [chest bone].Bottom line, write everything down and go over each issue with your doctor one by one.",
