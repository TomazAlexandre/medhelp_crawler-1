            "answer": "Hello,This burning sensation can be due to parasthesia skin. Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol? Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I don't know if this forum is still available. All the posts I've seen are from years ago. Here is my question:\u00a0\u00a0I have a 3 year old MacBook Pro laptop. I primarily use the tracking pad and may be on my computer for several hours. Even with short use, my finger tips on the hand I use become very hot and painful feeling. I will also get some tingling and almost carpal tunnel like symptoms in my wrist.\u00a0\u00a0If I am on the keyboard much-my left hand fingertips have this sensation as well.\u00a0\u00a0They feel as if my fingertips have been burned. This feeling will continue for sometime after I am on the computer. I have gone on-line and have seen others blog about the same symptoms-related to Apple computers. One person said the keypad is constructed of nickel, and it may be an allergy to nickel. This wouldn't totally explain why my left fingertips would do this because I only use them on the keypad. I have put a film like you use on cellphone screens on top of the keypad, and I still have the problem. What could this be, and could it give me some permanent damage. I know I should hook a mouse up to it and avoid the trackpad-but I would still like to know what is causing this. Thank you for the help. Nativeco",
