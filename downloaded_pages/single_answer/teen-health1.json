HOWEVER, sometimes the yeast will grow quite crazy and that will cause problems-the itching, swelling, discharge, smell and pain associated with a yeast infection.Why the yeast grows so much is for different reasons. Some women are more prone to it, no rhyme or reason. Sometimes, if a woman a course of antibiotics that kills good bacteria in the vagina it could leave room for the yeast to grow. This is actually a pretty common cause of yeast infections. Also there are some medical reasons, one example is undiagnosed or ignored diabetes can cause yeast infections.There are quite a few causes for it, so a one off isn't too much to worry about. However, if you keep getting reoccurring yeast infections you really should talk to a gyn/doctor. Also, keep in mind that a bacterial infection can sometimes act like a yeast infection so if you are ever unsure with what is causing the symptoms talk to a doctor.",
