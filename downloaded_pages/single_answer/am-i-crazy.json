            "answer": "It is true that ECG and blood work will only show up positive if there is active ischemia or damage the heart muscle itself. However, a functional study such as a stress test is often used to assist in determining whether or not there is any compromised areas of perfusion of the heart. If these tests are negative, it is unlikely that your chest pain is cardiac in etiology.\u00a0\u00a0However, there can be false negative results. If you have a high number of risk factors (hypertension, family history, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) and your chest pain sounds typical of angina, the gold standard would be a diagnostic coronary angiogram. However, this is often left at the discretion of your physician as there are considerable risks given this is an invasive procedure. A thorough history and physical is the key to helping decide whether or not this should be pursued.",
