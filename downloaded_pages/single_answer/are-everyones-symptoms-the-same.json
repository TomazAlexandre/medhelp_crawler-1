            "answer": "Concerned,Sorry it's taken a few days to provide an answer.\u00a0\u00a0We're volunteers here and not medical professionals, so while we have a lot of experience with diabetes, do check out what you read with your doc.I hope that you will contact your physician soon and get a complete physical along with screen blood/urine tests.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the symptoms you describe (thirst, urination) are associated with elevated blood sugar, but thirst can be a marker of other things, too.\u00a0\u00a0If a person drinks a gallon or more water a day, it is also necessary to excrete the excess ... thru urine .. in order to maintain fluid balances.There can be imbalances not related to diabetes that contribute to your symptoms.The tingling & numbness are sometimes symptoms of low blood sugar and can also indicate other things -- a pinches nerve, musculo-skeletal misalignment, etc.I suppose that the bottom line here is that your set of symptoms is worth discussing with your doctor, as you continue to keep good records of what you're experiencing when.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
