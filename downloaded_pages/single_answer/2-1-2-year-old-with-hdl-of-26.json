            "answer": "There is not a lot of research data regarding HDL in very young children and their future risk.\u00a0\u00a0The government does recommend screening children for cholesterol issues at age 2 if one of the parents has a history of heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0However, some studies show that low HDL in young children is more common than previously thought, and that link to future heart disease is not clear.\u00a0\u00a0You're right that this is likely genetic, but there is not much data to suggest that trying to raise the HDL will have any impact on the child's future cardiovascular health.\u00a0\u00a0My best advice is to stay in close contact with your physician and, if you feel more comfortable, visit a pediatric cardiologist who specializes in lipid disorders.",

    "question": "My 2 1/2 year old son has an HDL of 26 and slightly elevated triglycerides. This is with a perfect diet and taking fish oil. He gets plenty of exercise and is not overweight. We have checked it twice over a six month period. The second time really just to make sure it wasn't a mistake. He was breastfeed for over two years and my understanding is that even a six month old bf has an average HDL of 55.\u00a0\u00a0His pediatrician isn't worried about it and didn't want to run any additional testing for another year. I ordered through a testing company online and ruled out thyroid problems, anemia, kidney and liver problems as well as diabetes. That is as far as I can get on my own. The pediatrician will check his levels again in a year but from everything I am reading this is probably genetic.? Not sure where to go from here. Any ideas?",
