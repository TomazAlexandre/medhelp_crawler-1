            "answer": "Hi,Have yourself examined by a doctor. The size of the left and right testis is not exactly the same and one may fall lower than the other. It is unlikely that you could produce the cremasteric reflex on yourself, what you feel during running may be simply the muscles contracting against the jarring produced by the step. An investigation of the nerve supply by examining other related nerves would be done. Risk factors for nerve damage like diabetes would also be discussed with you.",

    "question": "Ever so often I experience a numbness feeling in my right testicle. It happens when I'm sitting down or when my right testicle\u00a0\u00a0constricts. It also hangs a bit higher and more forward. Its an uncomfortable feeling but no severe pain.\u00a0\u00a0I think there may be a slight testicle torsion since i may have twisted it giving my self an exam a while back. I am also a little concerned with the left one because there is hardly a cremasteric reflex when i do an activity like running. What would a doctor be able to do about my testicle problem?",
