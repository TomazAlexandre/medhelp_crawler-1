            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your wife\u2019s medical problems. She has uncontrolled diabetes with probably metabolic acidosis due to improper kidney functioning (renal tubular acidosis). Any chronic illness in the body can raise ESR. In diabetes there is chronic inflammation of blood vessels, gut, renal tubules etc. This raises the WBC. Your wife needs complete diabetes management program which consists of drugs, diet and exercise. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
