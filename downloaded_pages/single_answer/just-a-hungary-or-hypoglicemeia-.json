            "answer": "This doesn't seem like a hypoglycemia, which is usually associated with diabetics. But if there are mood changes and anxiety associated with lack of food or low sugar level, I would keep snacks around the house (I love the little packs of almonds from Trader Joe). So whenever you get hungry, rather than getting irritable, have a snack until you are able to buy/cook something.Diabetes is usually serious, and the blood work would show you to be a pre-diabetic years before you turn to a diabetic. so don't worry too much. Look at your HDL level and triglyceride level to see if they are normal in the lab results.",
