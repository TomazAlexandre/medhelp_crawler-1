            "answer": "Hi!The thyroid tests and vitamin B 12 tests are all within normal limits. This means you neither have a thyroid problem nor vitamin B 12 deficiency. If the tests were done due to fatigue, and other such symptoms then you also need to rule out electrolyte imbalance, diabetes, and iron deficiency. Take care!",
