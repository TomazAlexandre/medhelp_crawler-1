            "answer": "Hi!Delay in periods is not a known side effect of Claritin. However, if you have been unwell in the recent past then poor health can cause a delay in periods. This may be one cause of delay. Other causes can be pregnancy, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary, anemia, diabetes, adrenal gland problems or hormonal imbalance. Please take a pregnancy test and see. If this is negative and you do not get your periods then please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
