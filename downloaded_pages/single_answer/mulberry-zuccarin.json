            "answer": "I searched the iNet for Mulberry Zuccarin clinical trials and came up blank. I did, however, come across several web sites with juicy marketing campaigns making nonfactual claims of lowering glucose levels. I am not a strong believer of manufacturers who tout unknown studies, researches, or clinical trials. I especially shun away from those that fail to name or provide link/s so I can read for myself, how, what and where they were conducted? And who's to say if they were conducted only on rats/mice and not humans? And to link their product to hundreds of years of Chinese or Japanese or Asian usage draws a red flag. It might make a tasty tea but hundreds of years ago diabetes was unknown.Have you discussed your diabetes progression with our Endocrinologist to find why its progressing and what you can do to arrest the progression? Diabetes will progress if you depend solely on medication alone to lower your glucose [blood sugar] levels.Changing lifestyle habits can go a long way in controlling type 2 diabetes. Proper nutrition is one key; restrict & avoid refined sugars, refrain from eating \u201csimple\u201d carbohydrates, starches, and foods made with white flour. Practice and adhere to weight control, do some sort of exercise daily, practice stress management, and get adequate sleep. These are all important in managing diabetes, the most important, along with proper nutrition, is physical activity.",
