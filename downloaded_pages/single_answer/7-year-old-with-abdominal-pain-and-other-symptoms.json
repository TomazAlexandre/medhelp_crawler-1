            "answer": "HiThanks for the post! I am sorry to hear about your daughter.Your daughter could be suffering from tapeworm infestation, resulting in anemia and generalized swelling. Nausea and abdominal pain too is common in tapeworm infestation. A stool examination should definitely be done. She could also be suffering from glomerulonephritis (kidney infection) or nephritic syndrome. Is her blood pressure high? She could also be having hypothyroidism. If she is not keeping well then please take her to ER and discuss this with the doctor there. Try and get an earlier referral or atleast get stool examined and check for anemia.Get other tests for kidney function done.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
