            "answer": "Hi!Erythromelalgia, or Mitchell's disease is a rare neurovascular l pain disorder in which peripheral blood vessels in lower limbs and hands get blocked on and off, become red or hyperemic and inflamed. While usually it the primary type due to a defective gene, there can be secondary erythromelalgia due to autoimmune disorders, small fiber peripheral neuropathy (this can be due to nutritional deficiency, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme disease, Lupus, vasculitis, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, Celiac disease, amyloidosis, Fabry disease, HIVand alcoholism (the latter two usually in adults), hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol), essential thrombocytosis, and mushroom or mercury poisoning.I am sorry to say but there is no cure for this. Treatment is mostly symptomatic. At times certain things are found to rigger the response. So on a bad day you could log in what all she did, where she went, food she ate etc and see whether heat, any food, cold, any type of perfume etc triggers the symptoms. Avoiding these can take care of a lot of symptoms. Eliminating the causes one by one also helps identify whether the disease is secondary to any cause. If a cause is identified, treating the cause will help relieve the symptoms. Other than that treatment is aimed at giving relief to the symptoms. Some drugs are undergoing clinical trials for their safety and efficacy in Erythromelalgia. Do discuss this with your doctor. I hope your daughter will recover soon! Take care!",
