    "question": "Hello,About three weeks ago i fell asleep, and a few minutes later i wokeup with an intense tingly sensation shooting down my arms and legs. My heart raced and eventually started palpitating (fluttering uncontrollably). I was very nauseous, I got the chills (cold sweats) and was shaking violently periodically. I went into the ER and they thought it was a panic attack. A few days later i went to lay down and a less intense period happened with the nausea, confusion and a racing heart. I wore a heart monitor as well as having blood work done. I don't have diabetes, hypothyroidism, etc, and the heart monitor showed i had two periods of a heart rate near 200 bpm. I thought maybe it was acid reflux because it's worst when i lay down but it's not only when i lay down, I've also been taking acid reflux medication and it hasn't helped. Tachycardia, confusion, nausea, and a tingly numbness are my symptoms. I need some guidance for when i see the cardiologist, any ideas? By the way, I'm 20 years old and heart disease runs in my family, however the blood tests show good cholesterol levels.Thanks,Andrew",
