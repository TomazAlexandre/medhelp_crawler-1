            "answer": "Hi, understand your anxiety. The symptom described by you could be due to neuropathy. It is a disorder of the nerves which causes numbness, tingling, unusual sensations and sometimes pain. Diabetes Mellitus can cause neuropathy. Other causes like vitamin deficiencies, alcohol consumption and certain medications can cause neuropathy. . Another cause could be an entity called restless leg syndrome, where there is an odd sensation in the legs during sleep causing the individual to move, which relieves the sensation. These disorders can cause inadequate sleep leading to fatigue and daytime sleepiness. Other causes for leg cramps are injury, repetitive activity and dehydration. So, I would advise you to consult your primary care physician for further evaluation. He may then ask for blood tests and a sleep study called polysomnography for further evaluation. Regards.",

    "question": "I'm 17 and for a few years now I've been having, occassionally, some severe cramps in my legs - mainly at night. Sometimes I flexed my foot and it would suddenly sieze up, but I learnt to deal with it. I thought it was magnesium definiency so took some supplements - I don't think they helped. When I lie down I could sometimes feel my leg muscles twitching involuntarily.But recently, I had a really strange sensation in my legs. Like a tingling, ripplin feeling coupled with the sensation that there were 'bugs' crawling under the skin. My legs felt like they'd had blood flow restricted to them or something, and that I needed to get the 'rubber band' off - I got pins and needles and my legs go the sort of fatigue as when felt you'd gone walking for hours, when, in reality, I done nothing of the sort. I feel no numbness though. But my feet feel cold, from the inside and when I touch them they feel normal temperature.Then the pain amounted one night to become full-blown cramps,all through my calfs and thighs. It lasted for a few hours and now, they're back to before the sever cramps, still feeling uncomfortable with a hollow sort of pain.I don't know what i should do, the cramps are preventing me from sleeping and painkillers aren't helping. The 'dead' sensation has now spread to my right arm. It doesnt stop me from moving normally, just makes my limbs ache dimly during the day, but I'm scared of going to bed now cause I know the cramps will await me.Please, could anyone suggest what the cause may be and what I could do about it. It's really worrying me. I don't want to find out I have some sort of neuorlogical conditon, especially being this young.",
