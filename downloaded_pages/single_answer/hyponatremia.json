            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Prolonged sweating, infections, drinking too much water, diabetes insipidus, adrenal gland dysfunction, kidney and liver problems, prolonged diarrhea,or vomiting, certain medications etc can all cause low sodium in the blood. This is a serious issue and needs to be investigated. You need to consult a doctor and run tests to find the cause.Treatment is to increase fluid\u2014not water\u2014intake. So drink clear soups, lemonade, juices, oral rehydration solutions etc. However, do this with caution and after ruling out kidney problems.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "There isn't a topic of this so I post it here..This Monday I went to the ER because I was sweating like crazy, dizzy, a little confused, abdomen bloated all of a sudden, legs and back felt heavy and weak.They said I have polydipsia and hyponatremia (Na+ was 127) and discharged me Tuesday evening.They told me to eat protein, drink Gatorade stuff and limit water intake to 8 cups a day.It's Thursday and I haven't recovered fully. I still have the same symptoms except they are mild to moderate, and I am AFRAID to drink even a sip of anything to be honest because once I do, I feel lightheaded and dizzy and weak and I dread the Monday incident.I haven't been drinking anything much until now despite desperately thirsty moments. I wonder if it's also bad to under-drink for my case... I tried to eat more meat, drink soups that have high Sodium content and all that, although it's really hard since I lost my appetite/nauseous, but I say again, the symptoms are still there, and it's really hard for me to take care of myself: walk, cook, go to work, etc. and I've been in bed or sleeping a lot recently..By the way I'm 22, and I have UTI, for which I can't take antibiotics since I'm allergic to most of them. I want to get rid of this too by drinking lot of fluids, but first I got to rid of hyponatremia stuff.Should I go back to the Urgent Care and talk to doctor about this? My mom tells me never go to hospital again because she thinks I can just heal by myself by eating a lot and those visits cost her $$, but I don't think she understands my current health status. (I don't live with her currently)Any advice/suggestions/comments would help. Thanks!",
