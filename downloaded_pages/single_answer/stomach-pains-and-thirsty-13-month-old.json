    "question": "I have a 13 month old little boy who is always thirsty, He throws a fit if I can't get his water to him fast enough. The past couple of weeks he hasn't been sleeping as well as he did, He wakes up in the middle of the night screaming. I am pretty sure it is his belly that is aching because he curls right up in a ball. He just wants me to lay him on my chest and rub his back until he finally falls asleep again. Neither I nor his father has diabetes but it does run in my family both my grandparents have it and one of my aunts has it. Would this be an onset of diabetes?",
