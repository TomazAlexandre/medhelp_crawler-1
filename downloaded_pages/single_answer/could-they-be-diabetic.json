            "answer": "I totally understand your worries. Please know that it is possible to have false readings-- we tested my younger daughter, who does not have diabetes, because she had been really thirsty for awhile, and because of her diabetic older sister, we worried. Her reading was high, so there was a big panic and the doctor wanted her in immediately.... and it turned out that she had some peach juice on her hand that made the reading high. She was fine.That said, you need to take both your children in to the doctor to have their blood sugar tested officially. Don't worry, just get them checked out. They may be totally fine. If not, you'll need to get the right help right away-- and then they'll be fine, really.",

    "question": "I am a Diabetic I am 25 I was Dignosed when I was 13. I am on a insillin pump which I have been on since I was 18. I have 2 children. A 5 year old and a 3 year old. Yesterday we noticed that my 5 year old was drinking a lot. So I checked her blood sugar last night. Like an hour after they ate some chocolate ice cream. It was high. Like around 325 and my 3 year old was high too...230. I gave them water and I checked the 5 year old about an hour after that and hers was 116. So this morning I checked them both and my 5 year old was 119 and my 3 year old was 121. I am really scared that they are getting this ****. I need help!",
