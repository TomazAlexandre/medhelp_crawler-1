            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum, from your history it is quite possible that you are allergic to peanuts. Peanuts are one of the most common food allergen known. The common existing food allergens are Peanut flour, peanut butter, powdered egg white etc. But in your case it is quite evident that you are allergic to peanut.Other concurrent triggering factors are acid reflux, medication, malnutrition, oral candidiasis, anxiety, dry mouth, diabetes, thyroid etc.As allergic reactions are IgE mediated, blood tests will show increase in these levels secondary to a food allergy. Avoid further exposure to such food.I suggest you to consult skin specialist/ immunologist for further line of management. Take care and regards.",
