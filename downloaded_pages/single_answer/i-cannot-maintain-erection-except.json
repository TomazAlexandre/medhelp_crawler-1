            "answer": "Hi Nick.I'm assuming you're also not having firm erections when you awake in the morning? What you describe is impeded blood flow to your penis. The flow of blood into the chambers of your penis is what creates erection. Anything that impedes this will affect erection. When you constricted the base, you enabled the blood to stay there, thus creating erection. Online erotic stores sell **** rings which fit around the base of your penis and are much safer (they have a quick release) and more effective than a hair tie. You might wish to experiment with these to see if they help. Check out these sites:www.goodvibrations.comwww.libida.comDiabetes can affect blood flow. Please don't be embarassed about this. You have a medical condition. It doesn't mean you can't have a great sex life or that you're somehow \"lacking\" in any way. Like any challenge, you need to approach it with a positive attitude.I suggest you see a urologist for testing and diagnosis. Viagra is a powerful drug which can increase blood flow, but each person's medical history must be taken into account before prescribing Viagra or one of the other similar drugs. Do see a urologist for a diagnosis and to discuss your options. Best of luck to you. Dr. J",
