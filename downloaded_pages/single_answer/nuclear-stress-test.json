    "question": "My doctor wants me to have a nuclear stress test which calls for a radioactive dye to be injected.The reason being that I have on going hypertension. I also have diabetes and am taking Glipizide.I do not like the idea of the radioactive dye. I am not having any heart problems I have had a chestx-ray and a echo-cardiogram which both showed no problems. Do you think the risk outweigh the benefits for this test? Thanks",
