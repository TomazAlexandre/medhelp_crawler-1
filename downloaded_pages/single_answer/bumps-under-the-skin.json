            "answer": "Hi,You are right in consulting a doctor - do let us know what has been advised.This could be folliculitis, dermatitis, or ingrown hair. In most individuals there are outbreaks of folliculitis from time to time.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months.Let us know if you need any other information and consult a skin specialist if the lesion is persistent.Regards.",

    "question": "ok here is the problem for about one month now i have pain in my pubic area now i saw something unusual it was a bump in the skin and no pubic hair grows around it and near the bump there were 2 small black holes(i think its called sinus) it was about 1 mm or less deep first (i thought a tick went under my skin because it was black but when i tried to pull it i cant be pulled then i thought ill just wait for it to die or something) and when i pinch it sometimes pus comes out which smelled really bad. Then very recently the bump was a bit painful so i pinched it with a tweezers and it bleed and 2 days later there was a black line i thought of pulling it to release the pus inside it then in my amazement it was not blood clot that was dark line it(bump) was filled with pubic hair that made the black line that was under the skin when i finished pulling it i got like 6-7 strands out of it now the pain is gone but the 2 small holes(i think you call it sinus) is still there with little pus coming out when i pinch it(it didnt change at all) now the bump is smaller and the pain is little to none.-anyway did i do the right thing and now i think of going to the doctor for a check up (i know a bit too late hehe)-and what do you call this disorder?",
