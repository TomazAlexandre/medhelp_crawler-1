            "answer": "There is no way to tell if your right eye (RE) can be helped. You would need to get 2 or 3\u00a0\u00a0different opinions from the best eye MD ophthalmologists you can travel to. At least one should be a retina specialist.Your life is not spoiled. Presumably you have one eye left that meets your needs of reading and getting around. The first thing you need to do is also ask these doctors about the health of your good eye and what you can do to keep it healthy all your life. That means protecting it from injury, eye disease and living a very healthy life to protect it from diseases that affect the eye like diabetes. so don't smoke, exercise, don't drink alcohol excessively, eat a great diet and be very careful to avoid things that might injury your good eye even mowing yard and using power tools.Work on your outlook on life. Some people are born blind, some without arms or legs, people are injured and lose their sight or become paralyzed and go through life in a wheel chair. Yet many find purpose and meaning in life and are upbeat and an inspiration to others.\u00a0\u00a0 Read some inspirational books for instance Helen Keller's life. Even if you cannot be made to see better in the \"bad\" eye you are so much better off than many others.",
