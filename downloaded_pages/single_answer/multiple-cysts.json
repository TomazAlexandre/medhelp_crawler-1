            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since there are multiple cysts there is definitely tendon injury and repetitive injury to joints. Chances of arthritis too are there. Since you have repeated bacterial and fungal infection get your blood sugar level tested. Diabetes too can precipitate all these\u00a0\u00a0problems.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "About a two years ago I started to feel generally unwell. Then about a year ago I began having throbbing pain in my left wrist and left foot and found a lump on both. I went to the doctor and he said they were ganglion cysts. Since then, I have developed one on almost every finger of my right hand as well as one on my right ankle. That brings me to a total of 7 cysts. I believe I have another one on my right knee but have not verified that.Within the past year I have had multiple bacterial and fungal infections and have been sick with the flu 4 times. The year before that I was sick 6 times.My doc cannot find anything wrong with me and we have hit a wall on where to go next. What, if anything, can I do?",
