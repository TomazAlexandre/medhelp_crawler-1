            "answer": "Hi, infections and inflammations are the main reasons for increased protein levels. In serum protein electrophoresis broad diffuse spikes indicate a more generalized infection or inflammation. More specifically if the beta segment is raised is raised\u00a0\u00a0then it may be due to causes like iron deficiency anemia. Since your ESR has returned to normal, your doctor may not have asked for a retest. Regards.",

    "question": "3 years ago I had bad fever and had high ESR rate, the hematologist thought ER doc was silly for ordering ESR when I had fever and sinus infection (sinusitis) . I was checked for autoimmune disease, liver, kidney, diabetes, protein, cbc and had ct scan. All were normal. However my hematologist ordered\u00a0\u00a0Serum Protein Electrophoresis and showed I had these results below. He said he was not concerned by result. I feel fine, no pain, etc..I am only 31. I stumbled on test results while cleaning and became obsessed with High result. After fever and infection was gone, my ESR returned to normal but I never tested for SPEP test again.Here are the readings Doctor:Serum Protein Electrophoresistotal protein 8.0 (5.7-8.2)albumin 4.11 (2.37-4.57)alpha 1 - 0.39 (0.24-0.56)apha 2- 1.11 (0.54-1.13)beta 1.07 (high) (0.52-0.98) increased beta fraction, no monoclonal or polyclonal gammopathy seengamma 1.31 (.055-1.57)a/g ratio 1.1 (1.1-2.5)monocional region 0.0protein electroporesis interp.
