            "answer": "I am totally puzzled by the pilocarpine prescription - that seems to be a very unusual thing to do for someone your age who has had no surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect that you may be ill due to some unknown cause and the eye and visual symptoms may just be another symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0If eye exams keep looking normal then perhaps the workup should be directed more toward your other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It is possible when some doctor is able to make you feel better, then your eyes and vision may settle down as well.\u00a0\u00a0Your case is complex, I have no data on you, and basically I can't be much more help.MJK MD",

    "question": "Over the past few months I've developed seeing visual halos, glare, and star bursts (Been to three Ophthalmologists, and they all say my eyes are healthy). Also my pupils are slightly larger than normal. (Was recently prescribed 0.5% Pilocarpine Drops, it made my vision extremely blurred, caused acute iritis, and made my vision extremely blurry).In addition to those symptoms I've been feeling fatigued, lethargic, depressed, an increased sensitivity to cold (mostly in my hands), and my face seems to be puffy all the time. Also, my skin is very dry and my hands are light red in color. Sometimes I have a hard time recalling names, addresses, etc.I was checked for diabetes 2 months ago, but the results came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0Any other suggestions for what may be causing these symptoms? (I'm a 20 year old male, if that helps at all).",
