    "question": "Hello Everyone, I am a 36 year old female with type II diabetes... About two weeks ago I had minor procedure done under light sedation which then they put me under general... After waking up from the procedure I\u00a0\u00a0was anxious and the following morning I woke up with a full blow panic attack. I had to go to the ER and they gave me Ativan IV to calm me down and sent me home... I continued on with anxiety for about a week. On the first day of the second week I had a small panic attack. The second day I felt good except that I woke up with twitching under my neck. I didnt think much of it cause I figured it would go away, I probably slept on that side all night. But I noticed the twitch all day and I look in the mirror and I see my skin moving... I was so scared because I had remembered that six months ago I had a twitch like that on my lip.. But back at that time I figure that twicth was probably normal... As I started to panic more I noticed that I had more twitching going on. On one side but by the end of the day I felt all kinds of things going on like twitching and electrical twitches and I felt the muscle under my chin moving like a wave and also my twitching on my tounge as I was getting more anxious... I drank some benadryl to help me sleep and when I woke up I felt my whole body moving like little pulses all over my face my feet legs and I had a HUGE panic attack because I was hoping those twitches would stop... Well, I noticed that the more I'm anxious or panicking the more twitching the less panicking the less twitching. Twitching is all over the body... Now... I had tested positive for two bands on the western blot 41 and\u00a0\u00a023. The test itself came back equivocal... I do not remember being bitten by a tick ever... But it was possible as I would go hiking with my husband and didnt know anything about ticks. I believe that if I was exposed to a tick bite it was about 10 - 12 years ago... Does anyone think that my twitching problem has any connection to lyme disease, als, ms, my diabetes or stress and anxiety... Haven't had any other test done yet as I am trying to make appts with nuerologist and an infectious disease doctor...Sorry for writing so long but I just want to give a clear picture here... I appreciate any suggestions, advice and or comments...Barb",
