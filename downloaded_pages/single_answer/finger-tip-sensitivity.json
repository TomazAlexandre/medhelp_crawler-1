            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!What you have is probably glove-and-stocking neuropathy. There are many causes of this nerve disorder including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated.Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
