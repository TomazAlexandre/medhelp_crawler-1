    "question": "So for the past 11 years ive had very bad anxiety attacks and about 2 years ago i was diagnosed with hypocondria but lately my stomach has this very uncomfottable feeling and when i get this i feel like im going to hurl and i feel weak and my stomach makes awkward and loud noises and i get freaked out which most deffinetly adds to the stress but why do i feel this way and why does my stomach make the noises even though ive eaten and everything seems fine? i have this everyday and sometimes it gets so bad i cant do anything with friends or even family and forget about driving. Also when i get this i get burps you can call them and\u00a0\u00a0its very weird because when i feel the urge to burp nothing comes up except the acid. my life has changed so much because of this and i dont know what to do anymore all the docotrs say im ok but i know for a fact this is most definetly not normal. thanks",
