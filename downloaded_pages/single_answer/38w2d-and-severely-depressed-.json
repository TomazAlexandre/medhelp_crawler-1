    "question": "Im 38 weeks and 2 days today... with my first pregnancy I hwd delivered my daughter already by now... my health has been up and down my whole pregnancy... started with chronic hypertension (high blood pressure), then morning sickness that still hasnt gone away, then 3 UTI's, and another infection, low blood pressure, bleeding, allergies, gestational diabetes, chronic hip pain that was told its SPD, and I have since sunken into depression. I know she will come when she is ready (or the doctor's induce- which is 5 days away) but I don't know how much I can take. I am extremely uncomfortable and just find myself crying all day long everyday. I cant handle crying for another 5 days... I just feel soo defeated and want to crawl into a hole and sleep until I'm not pregnant anymore.",
