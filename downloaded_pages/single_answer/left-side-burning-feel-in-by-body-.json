            "answer": "Hi!Since most of the symptoms involve the left side of your body you could having some neurological problem involving one half of your body. There is a chance that you have compression of the spinal nerves in the upper cervical spine region. This can happen due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, herniated disc, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. A MRI of the cervical spine and nerve conduction studies may be required.Other possibilities are peripheral neuropathies (as in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s and lupus), or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome.Please discuss this with your treating doctors. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
