            "answer": "Hi!Well, hypnosis per se may not be able to help, but cognitive behavior therapy which helps you analyze your thought process and act in the correct manner can help you overcome binge eating. Meditation and yoga also strengthen your mind and help you curb the urge to eat. You can also take help of a food diary or a friend who can divert your attention away from food. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
