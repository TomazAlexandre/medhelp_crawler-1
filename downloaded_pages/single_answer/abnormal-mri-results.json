            "answer": "Hello and welcome to the medhelp forum. T2 flair lesions could be due to decreased blood flow in the small vessels in brain. these happen with risk factors like hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol. These causes appear less likely since you are only 26 years of age. Patients suffering from migraine headaches may also have these changes due to vascular changes. Consult a neurologist for a detailed check up. These headaches and visual disturbances could be due to migraines related aura. Wish you all the best.",

    "question": "I need help interpreting my MRI results. The exact wording is \"There is a small 5mm high FLAIR signal abnormality in the medial aspect of the right corona radiata....There is a mild mucosal high T2 signal in the posterior right ethmoid region\" There were no other significant findings, and I am aware that the ethmoid part is sinus disease. This MRI was taken in 2009 while I was pregnant and no follow up has been done since. The only current neurological problems I am having is the occasional headache and vision disturbances including fading, blurring, and \"floaters.\" Thanks for the help",
