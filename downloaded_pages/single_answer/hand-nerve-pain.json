            "answer": "Hi there. The cause for this numbness could be a compressed nerve; pinched nerve also causes numbness or tingling. The common causes for pain and numbness in the hand are carpal tunnel syndrome and a pinched nerve in the neck due to herniated disc or a bony spur. With carpal tunnel syndrome however, the first two fingers are affected, loss of grip strength etc. entrapment of the ulnar nerve at the wrist due to ganglion cyst, lipoma, etc is another possibility. Other causes of nerve compression are arthritis, alcoholism, diabetes, thyroid problems etc. thoracic outlet syndrome needs to be checked. Hope this helps. Take care.",
