            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling?I say you definitely need an immediate consult with a neurologist.Are there any other associated symptoms like palpitaions,chest pains, loss of consciousness, doubling of vision, numbness or stiffness of extremities?Have you any personal or family history of heart attack, diabetes or stroke?Several differentials may be pointed out here: A migraine with aura, a partial seizure, an absence seizure, a transient ischemic attack.I do not want to add further anxiety but a thorough physical and neurological examination and a mental status exam are needed to help point to a probable diagnosis. Your neurologist may request for an EEG or brain scans to determine the cause.Coagulation factor levels and evaluation of peripheral blood vessels may help.Do keep us posted.",
