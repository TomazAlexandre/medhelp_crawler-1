Then rub with a pumice stone and apply some moisturizer. During the day, hydrate and protect feet with a protective and moisturizing cream. At night, repair them with creams formulated from glycolic acid\u2014a must for improving skin texture and tone. You can wear socks after applying the cream also.

    "question": "Subconsciously while sitting down I cross my legs and start ripping the skin of my feet off. And it comes off oh so easily. I don't know if i have dry feet or something, but it just goes, maybe 3 layers of skin come off. I draw blood easily by doing it, and it hurts like nuts. It may be a bi-product of the stress rowing puts on the skin on the feet, but I'm doubtful.",
