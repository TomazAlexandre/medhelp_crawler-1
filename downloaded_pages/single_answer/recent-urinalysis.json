            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Urine analysis is done to confirm the diagnosis of infection or stones in the urinary tract or diabetes or hyp[ertension. There are two types of urine analysis: macroscopic and microscopic.Macroscopic urinalysis is the direct visual observation of the urine, noting its quantity, color, clarity or cloudiness, etc. Normal urine is typically light yellow and clear without any cloudiness. Obvious abnormalities in the color, clarity, and cloudiness may suggest possibility of an infection, dehydration, blood in the urine (hematuria), liver disease, breakdown of muscle or red blood cells in the body. Certain medications may also change the color of urine. Very foamy urine may represent large amounts of protein in the urine (proteinuria).Microscopic examination is performed through the microscope at high power tofurther identify any cells, bacteria and clumps of cells or debris called casts and crystals.In your case, turbidity suggests change in consistency of urine, indicating proteinuria or infection causing cloudiness.Consult a urologist for further assistance and treatment.Best.",
