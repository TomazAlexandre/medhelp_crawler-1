            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.I understand your concern regarding this new study that came out with this information.\u00a0\u00a0The study did show an increased mortality risk for thinner,\u00a0\u00a0normal weight people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes as compared with their overweight counterparts.\u00a0\u00a0However,\u00a0\u00a0there were other factors that could have contributed to this finding.First,\u00a0\u00a0I am a nurse,\u00a0\u00a0not a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I will try and give you some information, but I always tell patientss to discuss their concerns with their doctor- your doctor knows you personally where I can give you only some general info.The data that was collected for those recent findings was collected going back about 20 years or so.\u00a0\u00a0A lot has changed in diagnosing/ managing diabetes since then.\u00a0\u00a0This is before patients were testing their blood sugars at home.\u00a0\u00a0The only blood sugars that were being done were in the doctors offices and blood sugars were not as tightly controlled as we know that they should be now.\u00a0\u00a0Also,\u00a0\u00a0other possible causes of death were not addressed.\u00a0\u00a0For example,\u00a0\u00a0some of theses patients may have been diagnosed with diabetes but may also have cancer,\u00a0\u00a0COPD,\u00a0\u00a0or other long term illnesses.Finally,\u00a0\u00a0being of normal weight does not necessarily mean normal BMI or mean that\u00a0\u00a0a person is physically fit.\u00a0\u00a0Patients who were of normal weight were often overlooked in screening for diabetes years ago simply because they were not overweight.\u00a0\u00a0These patients possibly went longer with elevated blood sugars before being diagnosed.Regardless of all these variables,\u00a0\u00a0we now know that maintaining a healthy weight (including BMI), controlling blood sugars and keeping them as close to normal as possible,\u00a0\u00a0and early detection and treatment for diabetes are all factors that improve outcomes for diabetic patients.\u00a0\u00a0You sound like you are doing a great job managing your blood sugars and that is key foryour health.\u00a0\u00a0I hope I helped a little bit.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.Bridget",

    "question": "Hello,I've been hearing a lot about how skinny type 2 diabetics are facing higher mortality rates than their overweight counterparts. Is this true? Are there specific things surrounding as to why?\u00a0\u00a0As of now I only weigh 145 pounds standing at 5 feet and 6 inches with a size 28 inch waist. These were my exact conditions when I was diagnosed. I don't really have any weight to lose. I am able to keep my blood sugar levels normal through diet and exercise, my A1cs are typically below 5.6%, my blood pressure is below 130/80 and my cholesterol levels are healthy. Am I still at a higher risk?",
