This can be hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol or hormonal imbalance, and thyroid issues. If no problem is found then the weight gain can mainly be attributed dietary inputs and lack of exercise. For this consultation with a dietician and targeted exercises will help.Take care and good luck.",

    "question": "HiI am new here. PLEASE PLEASE HELP!!!!\u00a0\u00a0I had a C-section operation January 2012, over a year ago, to remove a 30cm cysts and my left ovaries. I have recovered fairly well but my stomach is still big. I have become obsessed with healthy eating (not diets) and exercising but have not seen any results. In fact, I have gone from size 10 immediately after my operation, to size 16 within a year. I am very sorry to read about the women experiencing post operative complications. It makes my issues seem very trivial, but I am an actress and it has severely affected my job and is starting to affect my finances.Thank you",
