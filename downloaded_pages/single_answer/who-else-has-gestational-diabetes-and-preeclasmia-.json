            "answer": "I had preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome I delivered my baby girl last Friday at 28 weeks she will be in the NICU for awhile they gave me two steroid shots to develop her lungs it's very scary but the only way to correct preeclampsia is to deliver your baby. They may put you on magnesium if your preeclampsia is severe enough it is really miserable but very dangerous to have preeclampsia.. good luck hun I wish you and your baby the best",
