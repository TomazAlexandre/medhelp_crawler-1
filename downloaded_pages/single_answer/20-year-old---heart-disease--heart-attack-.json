            "answer": "Hi, as you are able to exercise normally its unlikely that the chest pain is due to a cardiac cause. Cardiac pain or chest pain can be felt as a tightness and worsens with activity or exercise.Do you have a family history of cardiac disease? And in addition you do not have any risk factors. The sensation could be due to anxiety. Try to relax and de stress and see if it helps with your symptoms. Take care. Regards.",
