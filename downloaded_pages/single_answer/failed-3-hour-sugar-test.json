            "answer": "My friend who had a baby in December was borderline gestational diabetic, like barely failed, and they put her on the diabetic diet for the duration of her pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I am thinking they'll likely do the same to you - sorry to say.\u00a0\u00a0She basically ate sugar-free stuff and had to check her blood sugar throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0Lovely, huh?\u00a0\u00a0She couldn't have sweets and they had her on a strict eating schedule - certain times for meals and snacks - to make sure she was eating at the proper times - some foods like celery she could eat as much as she wanted - other foods like almonds or nuts were limited to just a few per serving.\u00a0\u00a0She logged all of her food intake and what time she ate at.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like a lot of work, I know, but you are doing it for the good of you and the baby - and it's not forever.\u00a0\u00a0Also, she had a normal vaginal birth so don't worry about that.\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry you are about to have to face this, too, but plenty of women have gone through it, so you'll be OK! :-)\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to you!",

    "question": "Hi everyone~I just took my 3 hour blood glucose test on Monday after failing the 1 hour test.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse just called and said I failed 2 out of the 3 hour samples.\u00a0\u00a0So I failed it.\u00a0\u00a0Does this mean I definitely have gestational diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I'll find out tomorrow where to go from here because I have a doctors appt., but in the mean time, what is ok to eat?\u00a0\u00a0Also, do doctors usually try to section gestational diabetics based on that alone or should it affect me having a vaginal birth?",
