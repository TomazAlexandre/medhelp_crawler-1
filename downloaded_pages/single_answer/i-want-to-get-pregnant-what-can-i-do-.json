            "answer": "Sorry to hear you are having troubles with weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0First, as an RN who works in OB/GYN, I think the most important thing that you can do is find a practitioner/physician who can help you with finding out about your diabetes situation.\u00a0\u00a0If you are insulin resistance, then you are correct about having diabetes type 2 and possibly DO need to be on the Glucophage, but you need to know the correct dosage, etc to take it correctly.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the time, if it is not a mechanical issue (fallopian tube blockage, low sperm count), this can help balance out the blood sugars in the body, which will help your body to able to get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0If you have this condition, you most definitely will need to watch and control your blood sugars after you get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Does your fiance have insurance and can he get you on his?\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure you are frustrated about not having access to a doctor/nurse practitioner who can help you with this.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a clinic that you can go to to help with getting your blood sugars under control?\u00a0\u00a0The thing with diabetes is that when your blood sugars are high and your body cannot utilize that sugar (insulin resistance), your body is telling you that you're still hungry, hence the weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0As far as your weight, I think that it is more realistic to have balance and portion control.\u00a0\u00a0If there is any questions you have and I can answer them, I would be happy to.Melissa RNP",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was a Sophomore in high school.... and I'm going to turn 25 this October :(My weight is very bad.. I'm up to 350 now. I have cut out sodas and I am drinking tea, water and milk. I don't really eat that much during the day... I'm just not hungry!I guess what my question is... what am I supposed to be avoiding? Do I count calories? Stay away from carbs? No one ever told me...I just got some more Glucophage... after being off of them for 2+ years. I'm going to start taking them again.I also have insulin resistance (believe it is called type2 diabetes?)I want to get pregnant so bad... my Fiance and I have been trying for 3 years.I have no job or income, so it is pretty much impossible for me to see a doctor.",
