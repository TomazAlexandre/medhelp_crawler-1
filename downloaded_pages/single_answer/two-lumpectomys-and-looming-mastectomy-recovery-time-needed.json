            "answer": "Hi,Did your doctor give you some reason of the timing of the mastectomy being within one month of the last lumpectomy?Well with the high blood presure, diabetes, and her age - it would be most essential that your grandmother is in good health prior to the surgery, so that she takes the surgical procedure well and also the post operative healing is satisfactory.No definite statistics are available about this as of now. But a consensus betwen you and your treating doctor is generally what decides about the timing of the surgery.You could discuss your fears with him/her and see if he agrres to the idea of postponing the surgery a little.Do let us know what her doctor tells you.Hope this helps.Good luck.",

    "question": "Dear Forum Member\u2019s,My grandmother is a 78 year old type II diabetic with high blood pressure. She has undergone 2 lumpectomies in the past 3 months, with the last on Nov 30th, 2007. She now complains of being easily fatigued and of trouble breathing. Her surgeon says that she must have a mastectomy within a month of the last lumpectomy, so it\u2019s been due for a few days now.The pathology report reads as follows:BREAST, LEFT; RE-EXCISSION:-\tA FEW RESIDUAL FOCI OF DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS), MICROPAPILLARY TYPE WITHHIGH NUCLEAR GRADE, APOCRINE FEATURE AND MODERATE NECROSIS. THE DCIS IS PRESENT IN 2 OF 47 SLIDES AND INVOLVES THE SAHVED POSTERIOR MARGIN IN ONE OF TWO SLIDES.-\tNO INVASIVE CARCINOMA IS INDENTIFIED-\tTHE NON-NEOPASTIC BREAST TISSUE SHOWS PREVIOUS BIOPSY SITE CHANGES, FOCALFIBROADENOMATOID CHANGES AND A FFEW MICROCALCIFICATIONS.MY QUESTION:Is it really urgent that she have the mastectomy now? What if she has it a month from now? I think she needs another month to rest and recover from the previous procedures and stress. What will the statistics be like? Where do I find statistics for someone in her situation?Any and all general advice and opinions are welcome! Thanks and a happy new year to all!Gene",
