            "answer": "Hello,you can possibly get pregnant with high blood sugars, however the risk of birth defects and miscarriage is very high.If the pregnancy test is negative it is very unlikely that you are pregnant.Having blood sugars in the range of 290 - 300 all the time is very bad for your health (and I assume you need to be well to look after your children).\u00a0\u00a0You are at very high risk for complications.\u00a0\u00a0Please look after yourself better for the sake of your children.Please talk to your Dr about how to better manage your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Are you taking insulin?\u00a0\u00a0A low carb diet will also be more beneficial to helping control blood sugars.Please ask more questions if you wnat and we'll do our best to respond.If you don't want more children please also talk to your Dr about birth control or IUD.",
