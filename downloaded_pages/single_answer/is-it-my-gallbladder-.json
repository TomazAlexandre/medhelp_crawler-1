            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Hope diabetes has been ruled out. As, diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy and affect the digestive system, leading to problems with digestion and elimination. Besides good glycemic control, medications such as cisapride a prokinetic agent are given to promote emptying. If gallbladder ejection fraction is below 35% is considered to be gallbladder dyskinesia. Since it is 58, this can ruled out. Begin with good lifestyle measures to control your symptoms. Exercise regularly. Take frequent small meals. Avoid those foods which are high in oil content. Eliminate alcohol, stop smoking and avoid caffeinated beverages and spicy food.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "i am a 46 yr old women and have been suffering for a year or longer with, bloating, I look 5 months pregnat. I have gained over 25 pounds and keep gaining. I suffer from horrible gas, constipation diahria, pains in my stomache right shoulder middle of my back , and chest pains.\u00a0\u00a0Im tired , grouchy and just plan miserable 24 /7. I have been to the Er and had a ekg , it came back fine. My gastro Dr has did\u00a0\u00a0a colonoscopy , pill endoscopy, and down my throat endoscopy. Nothing on any of these test. Ive had a stomache emptying test, it came bake that my stomache was slow emptying. So put me on meds for that. I have taken so many different meds for reflux, stomache bacteria, constipation etc. Nothing works. So last week I insisted that they do a hida scan, because Er Dr recomended it. So I got my results last night, The nurse said my injection rate was a 58, which I thought was a little high but she said its fine, but they said the scan showed reflux of the stomache from biliary diskinesia. So now she daid they might change my reflux medicine. I already take dexaliant , which is supose to be the best on the market according to every Dr who has seen me. Im frustrated and dont know where to turn. I was wondering if anyone has any answer for me.",
