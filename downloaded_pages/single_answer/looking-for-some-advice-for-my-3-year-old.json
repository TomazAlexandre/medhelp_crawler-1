    "question": "My son had a urine test done this morning (not for diabetes) and it showed Ketones in his urine. Since diabetes is prevalent in my family, I tested his blood sugar, and it was 9.8 (177). This was about 20-30 minutes after he ate 1/2 a pop tart. Should we be concerned, or just write it off as being high from the pop tart?",
