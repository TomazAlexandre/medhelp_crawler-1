            "answer": "Hi there!Erectile dysfunction can develop in young adults due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors. One could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, I would suggest seeing your primary care physician for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi guys, so i started dating my boyfriend almost a month ago and our relationship is great. We have stable communication, a good understanding of eachother and it's going good.We did tell eachother about our sexual history before engaging in any sexual ourselves. My boyfriend (19) has only been with one person and that was back in November when he also lost his virginity. I (22) have been having sex since 18. So when we attempted to have sex the first time he didn't seem nervous, he didn't seem intimated or anything but he couldn't keep an erection for longer than 30-60 seconds. So we didn't end up having sex. We tried again a few days ago and same thing happened. We performed oral sex on eachother and there was enough fore play . He just can't keep an erection for that long at all. His self esteem is pretty bad because of it and he thinks he going to go to the doctor and see what's going on. He does have a hernia that he surgery on but no other medical problems. What could this be? He's only 19.",
