            "answer": "Hi.There are many causes of night sweats, including infections, idiopathic hyperhidrosis, and some medications.Has your blood glucose level been determined? Hypoglycemia can also present with night sweats, as do some endocrinologic disorders such as hyperthyroidism.An autonomic neuropathy is also possible and can be secondary to diabetes, autoimmune disease, surgical or traumatic injury to nerves, etc.You should talk about this to your physician.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I am a 29yo male in Fairly health condition. In November 2004 following a car accident. I sustained Herniated Disc L3-4, L4-5, and L5-S1 which I had surgery on in Sept. 2005. I suffer from severe nerve damage as a result of this as well I have 9 bulging disc and 8 spurs though out my upper spine, which isn\u2019t severe enough to have surgery as of yet. The only medicines that I take daily are Lexapro for depression and Motrin for pain as needed.About a month ago, I started suffering with sever night sweats then chills, no fever accompanied with this, as well as wheezing in my chest, and coughing up mucus upon waking up daily. I have had blood test, MRI, CT Scans, TB Test, Chest X-Rays, and have even had a Heart Cath. Nothing is showing up. The night sweats wake me up with drenching cloths, linens, and have even woken my wife up. They do not happen nightly but about 4 times a week. I haven\u2019t been bitten by anything other then the dreaded North Caroline Fire Ants as far as I know. During these episodes I sleep on average of about 3 hours per night which is causing problems with my job, driving safety, as well as causing problems with my marriage. If it\u2019s linked to the Nerve damage at least that\u2019s something I can learn to deal with, but if not I\u2019d really like to know of something I can suggest to my Doctor that it could be, maybe something he\u2019s not looking for. Any Suggestions will be wonderful at this point in my life.",
