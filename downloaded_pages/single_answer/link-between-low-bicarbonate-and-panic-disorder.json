    "question": "I have very recently begun experiencing panic attacks, and on a relatively frequent and sometimes prolonged basis.\u00a0\u00a0Bloodwork done a month ago, and blood work reconfirmed today, indicates consistently low serum bicarbonate levels (19-20).\u00a0\u00a0Does the literature suggest that low bicarbonate may induce panic episodes, and if so, can restoring bicarbonate levels to normal range help resolve the problem?\u00a0\u00a0Or is low bicarbonate simply a by-product of the panic disorder itself?\u00a0\u00a0Note that diabetes and anemia have been ruled out as associated conditions.",
