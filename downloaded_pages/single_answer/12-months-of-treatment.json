    "question": "I relapsed with minimal change nephritis 1year ago and no resolve.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms worsening. I take a 40 mg Prednisolone daily, we have tried to reduce but no joy. I also take Neoral, Mucophenalate plus medication for high blood pressure. To complicate matters I have Type 2 Diabetes, now on insulin due to al this medication. I have had a kidney biopsy which confirmed the diagnosis last September but looks like I will have another very soon. Just wondered if anyone had any ideas of what I and my Consultant could do next, I see him that often we are on first name terms.",
