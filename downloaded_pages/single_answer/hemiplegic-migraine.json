            "answer": "Hi,I understand your concern regarding the diagnosis and the symptoms present. Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a condition caused by inflammation of the thyroid gland\u00a0\u00a0is an autoimmune disease. The body inappropriately attacks the thyroid gland\u00a0\u00a0like a\u00a0\u00a0foreign tissue and the underlying cause of the autoimmune process remains unknown. It tends to occur in families and can be associated with other autoimmune conditions such as type 1 diabetes or celiac disease. If the prescription medications are not helping, it is best that you inform your attending physician about this for proper management. You may benefit from a referral to a specialist. Identifying and avoiding the triggers of your migraine may also help. Take care and do keep us posted.",
