            "answer": "Hi,' Soak frostbitten areas in warm (not hot) water. Continue until you have regained sensation and movement in the afflicted region; this often follows great pain as the nerves thaw. Never rub, slap or shake the stricken region as ice crystals in the frostbitten skin will damage surrounding tissue. Follow the treatment with a period of constant warmth: refreezing following thawing worsens the damage.'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite'Factors that contribute to frostbite include extreme cold, wet clothes, wind chill, and poor circulation. This can be caused by tight clothing or boots, cramped positions, fatigue, certain medications, smoking, alcohol use, or diseases that affect the blood vessels, such as diabetes.''People susceptible to frostbite should wear woolen socks/gloves/caps in extreme cold. For frostbite in the feet, keeping feet in warm saline water will provide relief. Diabetes can also sometimes lead to frostbite, so diabetics should take precautions as to avoid trips to ice-cold places.'Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "I'm 18 years old and have had chronic poor circulation for a couple of years. Its not abnormal to have blue fingernails, toenails and occasionally hands regardless of weather. Anyway, a few days ago, I went for an early morning walk, unfortunately wearing canvas slip ons. To cut a long story short, I ended up with terrible frostbite in all of my toes.During the day I tried very hard to return warmth to my toes. They were white and numb for around 2.5 hours.Now, all of my toes - save for my little toes. The right toe is swollen, pink ~ but still stone cold and occasionally painful. The left toe is similar but a bit better off.My questions are; has my little toe suffered any permanent damage? If so, should I see a doctor? And, is there anything else I can do to heal it? (beyond keeping it warm)Thankyou,",
