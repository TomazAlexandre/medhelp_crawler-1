            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Infection usually occurs with any break in the skin. If there is no recent injury in the thumb, there may be new cuts or breaks or even reopening of the previous scar which may be brought about by repetitive movements or force. To rule out other systemic issues such as diabetes, additional diagnostic tests may need to be done. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hello,I injured my\u00a0\u00a0right thumb few years back and area under the nail turned black probably due to the clotting of blood. 5 days back I started to have this severe pain and swelling in the thumb.The thumb turned pale and slightly yellow due to\u00a0\u00a0development of puss under skin. This was strange to me as I didn't suffer any injury recently. I visited doctor and have been treated with antibiotics and doctor took out all the puss after an incision. He told me that he will take out my thumb nail too as infection is spreading. What could be the possible reason to develop such infection without any injury to my thumb? Is it possible that my old\u00a0\u00a0clotting under thumb nail turned infectious? Could I be suffering from some other problem in my body?",
