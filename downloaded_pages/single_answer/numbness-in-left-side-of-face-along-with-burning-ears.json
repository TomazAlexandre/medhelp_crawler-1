            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes can all cause ear numbness that spreads to face. Hemi facial (half side) numbness is also seen in Bell\u2019s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia where a spasm may cause numbness, or due to acoustic neuroma which is a benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve. An ear infection is a possibility since the ear becomes red and hot. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss these possibilities with an ENT doctor.Take care!",

    "question": "I am 33 years old and have Rheumatoid Arthritis, Degenerative Disc Disease as well as meralgia parasthetica in my right thigh.\u00a0\u00a0Lately I have been having a new problem.\u00a0\u00a0The left side of my face gets numb, along with the left side of my neck. At the same time, my left ear will get really red and hot to the point of pain.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if I need to be really concerned or if this could be a possible side effect to all of the many meds I have to take.\u00a0\u00a0For awhile now, I have had burning ears.\u00a0\u00a0It would be both and they would get really red and painful and then go away.\u00a0\u00a0But now it seems to be more on the left and the facial numbness is only on the left.\u00a0\u00a0I am hoping that someone else here might have an idea what this might be.\u00a0\u00a0I go to doctor's constantly for my other health issues and do plan to bring this up at my next appointment.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't really want to make yet another trip just for this.\u00a0\u00a0I am hoping this is nothing serious but any kind of left side numbness does make me nervous.\u00a0\u00a0Any help would be greatly appreciated",
