            "answer": "Hi,Your Mom sounds like she had quite a complicated medical course, with all of her hospitalizations, medication changes etc. I do not think there is likely one problem as the culprit but possibly several---blood sugar changes may contribute, perhaps there was some damage done in the past from low blood sugars, maybe there are some medication side effect problems etc.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest speaking with a neurologist in the near future to see if they can link some of your Mom's symptoms into one diagnosis and start her on therapy for it. In the meantime, keep an close eye on her blood sugars and in close contact with her doctor. Sorry I could not offer a more specific diagnosis or suggestion.Take care.",

    "question": "My mother, who is 66, was hospitalized in Nov. 2007 with e-coli. She has had diabetes for 20 years controlled with diet. Her blood sugar was 460 in the hospital caused by a severe kidney infection. After being discharged, she went home with insulin prescribed by the dr.\u00a0\u00a0Two days later, she was taken by ambulance to the er for a diabetic seizure because her sugar dropped to 29. Was in ICU for 3 days and released again with no insulin just metformin. She also has uncontrolled hypertension. Was put in the hospital again 2 weeks later for low sugar. Now, here it is 2 months later, and she is still vomiting daily, her blood pressure is jumping all over the place but her blood sugar is staying between 103 and 160 realitively. I know that is ok for the most part because my husband had diabetes. I can't understand what is going on with her. She sleeps 15-20 hours a day, she slurs, her balance is off when she walks, she gets confused as the days wears on. She says she can't make her brain work right. Can anyone help me?",
