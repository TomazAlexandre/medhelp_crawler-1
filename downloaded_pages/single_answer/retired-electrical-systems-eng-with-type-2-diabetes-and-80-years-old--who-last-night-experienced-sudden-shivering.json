            "answer": "Did you test your blood sugar when this occured? My guess is your blood sugar was low. It's important to test and treat low blood sugars; some people treat under 70 and some under 60. You can buy glucose tabs in any pharmacy; I keep mine beside the bed and in my purse. You have to determine how many tabs work for you to raise your blood sugar to the right level. Many people use sweets to treat lows and then they overtreat and go high.",
