            "answer": "Hey dd97.Welcome to the forum.Well, unfortunately, most doctors are in the unfortunate positionof delivering \"hurried\" medical care, due to severe time constraints.In complex situations like yours, it is quite common to continue prescribingsymptom management meds, than open a medical \"Pandora's Box\".I sympathize with you and wish there were some simple answers.A few things you can check and do though:1. Thyroid. Hypo thyroid and Hyper thyroid may present similar symtomology. Hypo is more likely.You can do your own basal temperature test, as lower basal temp. would be indicative. This is very precise. Let me know if you need details.2. Have a tissue analysis for mineral deficiencies.Magnesium is usually deficient in most. (supplementing correctly is delicate! I use\u00a0\u00a0Transdermal Magnesium Oil )Also have a complete nutritional panel for any other deficiencies.Vi tD, some B vitamins are usually low when neurological issues are present.3. Consider a complete detoxification protocol.Too long to get in details here.Jon Barron's website has a good tutorial on this.4. Look into Nutritional Medicine, for a better approachto ALL your health matters!5. Knowledge is power! Get better informed and be more proactive!Do not give up your personal power to the system (docs and meds).Your chances of improvement will increase exponentially!Let me know if you need any more info.Take care!Niko",
