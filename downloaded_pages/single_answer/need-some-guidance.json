    "question": "Hello, I am a 25 year old male born with Con. glaucoma and nystagmus.\u00a0\u00a0The glaucoma has been very well controlled, I have a mini shunt in my left eye and have thus far had no problems with pressure in my right eye.\u00a0\u00a0I lost a little bit of vision in my left eye due to the pressure being at 47 but has since over a year ago been at 9-12, my right eye has historically been at 14-16.SInce about June, I started having trouble with both of my eyes feeling very irritated.\u00a0\u00a0My Rx changed from -3.75 OD & 3.50 OS in 2004/2005 to -4.50 OD & -5 OS in 2008 (Is that a big change for that time frame?).\u00a0\u00a0Anyways, I have been noticing that during the night I wake up and my right eye only feels dry and irritated, but the left is fine.\u00a0\u00a0I've been examined over and over by my Opth, and even sought a 2nd opinion just to be sure, and niether could find any reason for my changing vision.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much!",
