            "answer": "Hello,Without examination, confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but it sounds like boils and not acne.Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus.Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle.Apply warm compresses on the boil and keep the area clean.Drainage of the boil is done only when it becomes soft and forms a head.Also consult a doctor for examination and antibiotics prescription. Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders.So pls get your blood sugar evaluated.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or in case you have any additional doubts.Kind regards.",
