            "answer": "Dear Simogeorge, welcome to the medhelp forum. I can understand your dilemmas. These headaches could be hypertension related if an adequate control has not been achieved despite therapy. the MRI changes are non specific white matter changes suggestive of ischemic changes in the small blood vessels. these could be consequent of hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia. These are also seen in migraine headaches and could be suggestive of multiple sclerosis in proper context if clinical symptoms and signs point towards it. prominent ventricles suggest raised intracranial pressure and need investigation and workup. It would be prudent if you can consult a neurologist for the needful. Best regards.",

    "question": "As from 22 Dec 2011, I had some discomforts consistent with high BP. Checked BP personally on an OMRON digital equipment which showed 98 /176. Doctor check and read 95 / 170. Had been taking Losar 25 (Losartan Potassium IP). Doctor increased the dosage to Losar 25x2 +Amlodipine Basilate 5mg. Still not much relief in the discomfort level. At random I have a kind of heaviness on my head, a feeling consistent with a person taking strong wine giving a post-feeling muscle pull on the face.(I do not drink or smoke). Also a kind of numbness is also felt at times. Discomfort or pain in the back\u00a0\u00a0and left side of head is felt (infrequent).\u00a0\u00a0Did an MRI Scan on 20 Jan 2012. 'Findings': T2 & FLAIR hyperintensities noted in bilateral fronto-parietal periventricular white-matter. (S/o Microvascular ischemic changes) Prominent Vircho Robin spaces noted in both basal ganglia and centrum semi-ovale regions. Ventricles appear mildly prominent. Cortical sulci and basal cisterns appear mildly prominent. Left maxillary sinusitis noted. (Can you kindly interpret this and how to proceed medically. Thank you. I am 60 years old)",
