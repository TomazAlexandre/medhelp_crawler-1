            "answer": "Hello,I hope I understood your situation correctly: your father was requiring several medications during his injury phase but now does not need any meds? I that right?If so, some people have a first phase during diabetes when they need medication, often during acute illness or very high blood glucose levels. As the body recovers and works better overall, it responds to insulin in the body and does not need as much help form medications. Often this phase eventually goes away and the need for medication returns later on. But there is no telling when that will happen.Another situation may be the kidney function becoming worse, and in those instances many people need much less insulin/medication because\u00a0\u00a0the kidneys do not clear it from the body. This is not called the \"honeymoon phase\" however.If that was not the situation you meant, please re-describe it as I have misunderstood you.",
