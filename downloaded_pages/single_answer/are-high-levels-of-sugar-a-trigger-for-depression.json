            "answer": "It seems that you have done the most important thing and realized you need to do something about your glucose levels. Start small, check your blood sugar more often and adjust your insulin accordingly. Trying to make small changes is easier than changing everything at once.\u00a0\u00a0From there you can go on to look at what your eating habits are and try adding some exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I like to walk and it isn't too hard to add a short walk in every day.\u00a0\u00a0Don't look at the big picture so much but at the smaller things and it will get easier and less daunting.I also notice that my hormones play a big part in how much insulin I need.\u00a0\u00a0Certain times of the month, like when I am ovulating or a week before menstruation I find I need more insulin because my readings are higher.Another tip, look at the times you open your bottles of insulin, it is recommended that you only keep the bottle for a month, once it is opened.\u00a0\u00a0If I keep the insulin longer I notice my readings are higher and the insulin is not as effective.Do you have a support group in your area?\u00a0\u00a0Lots of hospital offer diabetes support groups.\u00a0\u00a0It is nice to know that others are working through the same problems.\u00a0\u00a0Have you tried www.jdrf.org--that is the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation website.\u00a0\u00a0You will find a lot of useful information and find some additional support there as well.",
