            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Numbness may be a form of neuropathic pain, which is typically associated with nerve damage. There are multiple etiologies for neuropathic pain. To name a few, some include herniated disc, diabetes, rhematological disorders, and vitamin deficiencies.Treatment for neuropathic pain may include neurontin, lyrica, or medications such as elavil but a careful cardiac workup needs to be performed prior to starting this medication.I suggest you discuss your symptoms in more detail with your primary care physician. A thorough neurological evaluation and history is necessary to provide you with more information.By the way, what was found regarding the kidney \"lump\"?Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
