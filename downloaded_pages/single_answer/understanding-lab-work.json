            "answer": "Labs each have a specimen 'range' of level of the blood drawn. The ranges are based on the machinery they are using. From that range, it is determined if the Lab results are within normal limits or not. On the lab result sheet you can see the ranges which are usually after the specimen\u2019s result and an indicator specifying if in or out of range. Folate deficiency is determined by Serum folate (decrease), RBC folate (decrease), MCV (increase),\u00a0\u00a0and Serum Vitamin B12 (usually normal) lab levels. Hoped this helped you.",

    "question": "Is seems that what is considered to be normal ranges for lab results are actually not normal at all. I recently had a panel created and it turns out that there are many indicators for pre-diabetes. Identifying these indicators is like reading the fine print on a contract! Would you please elaborate on how to determine folate deficiency? Would you also offer up a website that discusses the link between folate deficiency and diabetes?",
