    "question": "http://www.ket.org/health/born-too-soon.htmI am posting this here in a new one in case someone else did not follow the other post.It talks about why preterm births are on the rise and how to prevent them. My state KY got a \"F\" on thier preterm birth rates:( SO sad and hopfully more woman will get educated along with the dr's and hospitals.Recently the times had an article about obesity, heart disease, and other things that affect us in adult life can be determined by what opur mother did in utero not just by dna and genetic traits.Get the magazine! It is a great article\u00a0\u00a0 OH, and it talked about the Pimas indians having the highest rates of diabetes in the nation/ world something like that. It says that yes it is genetic but if the woman watch their diets and control their suger during pregnancy then it will drastically drop the chance the baby would have it. Woman were more inclined to follow a diet and exercise for the 9 months rather then all the time which lots said they tried and failed. Very interesting!Heart disease, obesity, diabetes, air pollution, stress and enviromental factors all talked about in the article.",
