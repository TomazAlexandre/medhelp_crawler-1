    "question": "Hi, I'm 20 year old female. In my 25th week of pregnancy.I have had this problem with my right big toe for a few years now, where I get this tingling feeling and an urge to crack it. It's the only way to get the feeling to go away. If that doesn't work then I have to tie something around it to get a little peace of mind.Lately, this feeling has gone from my right toe to my left toe, to both my ankles and both my knees! It's driving my crazy. I can't get any sleep from it. I asked my gp about it and she said i'm most probably imagining it! But i'm 100% sure i'm not!!Could it be a sign of diabetes or something else?Thanks!",
