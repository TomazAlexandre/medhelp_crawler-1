    "question": "Hello everyone.\u00a0\u00a0As title says I'm 29weeks & 3days. I'm as huge as I was with both my first two kiddos when i gave birth to them. My first was in 2007 & second was in 2012. I guess what I getting at is I'm scared they will come early as I now have gestational diabetes and the doctors say they both weigh just about if not over 3lbs each. I'm always habing server back pain and feel every slight jump or movement by them. I should say its a boy and a girl. We have tried to have another gender ultrasound but they can never see enough because they are so tight in there and they really have no room to move around as to why I feel every sight movement.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on bed rest but having two kids alreadh and a boyfriend who works night and sleep most of the day I really have no down time, I take it very easy but it don't seem to help me at all with the pain and lacknof sleep from the pain. Any ideas to help relieve some of the pain so i can rest\u00a0\u00a0at least at night???? I'm so exsausted and wore out I need a good nights rest. As the doctor said as long as I can keep them in till December 20th I should be safe after that to deliver the twins.",
