    "question": "Firstly I had a low lined placenta, then a suspected issue with my baby's heart (all clear now) her growth is at the lower end of the scale. I had amazing health. I'm now on 2 iron tablets a day and I'm now b12 deficienct. I'm 34 weeks pregnant and there is a possibility that I've now got gestational diabetes :( it's really got me down with how much trouble I seem to be having. I just want my baby to be healthy when she arrives :'(",
