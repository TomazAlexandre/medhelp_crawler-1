            "answer": "Hi!If the blurred vision appeared just after opening your eyes after a long time (like sleeping) then this can be due to some dirt collecting in your tear flim. Splash your eyes with clean water and you should be fine.If the symptoms persist consult an eye specialist as blurred vision can be due to glaucoma, refractive errors (near or far sightedness), diabetes, retinal detachment, optic stroke, infection or injury to eye, migraines, floaters, brain tumors, temporal arteritis or due to bleeding into the eye. Take care!",
