            "answer": "Nerve pain is normally worse at night which does make it hard to sleep. The only effective treatment I've had success with is taking a med called Lyrica. There are a couple other ones out there as well. You may want to check to see if his dr will try him on it. It's pretty expensive so if he does say yes make sure you see if you can go online to the drug company and get a coupon for savings and definetly call different pharmacies to see what they charge. The only other suggestion I have is that nerve pain down the arms can be a symptom of shoulder, hands and neck issues. If your dr doesn't think it's related to diabetes I would then see an orthopedic doc and have some X-rays taken.Hope he gets to feeling better soon!Ginger",
