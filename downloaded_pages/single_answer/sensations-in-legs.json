            "answer": "Hello.You have describes the tingling or the paresthesia nicely. I would think of a bilateral mild peripheral nerve problem. You have to be looking at the low back, or the lumbar spine. AT this age, the intervertebral discs tend to bulge out due to the pressure. Sometimes even a small bulge may produce significant symptoms. A preliminary neurological examination by a neurologist will be extremely helpful, as will be an imaging study (CT scan or MRI) of the lumbar spine.Further exploration can be directed towards possible vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, etc.Regards",
