            "answer": "1 No every disease has a different test, otherwise there would just be one kind of test for the 5,000 diseases people can get.2 No because most times the virus is not transmitted so even if she is positive, you might have sex with her 2.000 times and not get HIV but the 2,001th time you might get it. She has to test.",

    "question": "I had unprotected sex with a friend 14 weeks ago. Since I don't know her sexual history nor her status, I was extremely stressed before taking a test, which came back negative (106 days later)Many told me this test is conclusive, however my question is since I am negative she also ought to be?I never asked her directly about her status or whether she was tested, but medical tests are mandatory before entering the workplace (not STD's or HIV tests required).My question is as follows:1. when doing a normal routine blood test, can the lab detect abnormalities as for viruses such as HIV or other STDs?2. After testing negative, does that mean she is negative as well?Thank you for your answer.",
