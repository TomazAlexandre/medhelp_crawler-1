I'm just getting the pancreatectomy. Which removes all the bile ducts, gallbladder. There is a chance of getting diabetes but its was better than having attacks of pain.",

    "question": "Ihave suffered with severe bile spasm pains for over 15 years.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is always brought on by any narcotic med (morphine,codeine, ultram, demerol etc). The attacks also just mysteriously, pain is so severe that by the time I get to the ER I am screaming in pain. This occurs about 5-6 times per year. my physician has prescribed Inapsine also known as Droperidol.\u00a0\u00a0It ia a smooth muscle relaxer used often by anesthesiologists. my husband injects it IM in my hip and within 3-4 minutes all pain is resolved. I am certainly not recommendin this to anyone as we are all different with different problemns.\u00a0\u00a0I am also diagnosed with dysautonomia which also causes motility problems.\u00a0\u00a0I wondered if any other physicians in the ER or office told you about this antodote,so at least when you must go to the ER you can get immediate relief,This discussion is related to/posts/show/233365.",
