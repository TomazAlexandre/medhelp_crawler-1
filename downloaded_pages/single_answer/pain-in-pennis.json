            "answer": "Hello,Pain in penis after jelqing and slow erection can be due to some nerve injury or compression due to jelqing. Other causes are stress and anxiety, poor communication with partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, negative feelings about non performance, smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone or neurologic disorders.A detailed examination by a urologist along with a comprehensive profile of investigations is needed. You may need nerve conduction velocity test to rule out any nerve damage.Hope it helps. Take care.",
