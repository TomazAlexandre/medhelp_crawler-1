            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin on the arms and hands can be due to Eczema or contact dermatitis. Are you having a history of allergy?Pls get allergy tests like skin ***** tests or blood tests like RAST done to find out if you are allergic to some allergens.Other conditions cause itchy skin as well. Skin conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis,lice,scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "Hello !I have had a 'weird' INCREDIBLY annoying itch that began, roughly SEVEN years ago ! It comes and goes..ie usually comes in september and lasts through March ~ although has been known to bother me thru' the Summer ??! I have sought out many different ways to figure OUT what could be causing this. The itch is SO fierce that IT wakes ME in the night and UNLESS I PUT an ICE Pack on my arm(s), the itch worsens !! (I get bumps ONLY from MY own itching?) I have an issue (I've been told, via my OBGYN, when I miscarried at 4 months :(\u00a0\u00a0two yrs. ago, and the blood apparently had / has too much protein, would not clot (this supposedly caused my 'miss' ) IN any case, I wonder IF their is any correlation with Blood disorders, liver disorders, etc. that may CAUSE THIS AWFUL INSANE itch..I was driving earler today and almost crashed as I was going insane with NO relief (of ice) nearby..argh..I HOPE you may have a suggestion. I've tried every lotion on the market too; stopped using detergents (other than holistic) etc..I'm going BROKE trying to find a solution...Might you have ANY ideas??!
