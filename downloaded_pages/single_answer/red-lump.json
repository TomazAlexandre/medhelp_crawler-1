            "answer": "Hi!Sometimes a hair follicle infection resides in the follicle for some time with redness and inflammation. This may persist for a few weeks and then go away.\u00a0\u00a0If you have diabetes, infection may persist longer. Also, dermatitis, insect bite, infected sebaceous cyst can all cause a small red persistent lump. Rarely the lump is cancerous.You can take something like Tylenol or Aleve for a day or two and apply local antibiotic cream. If this does not help, please consult your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have a small (about the size of a pea) red hard lump on the top of my thigh. I went to the doctors and he said it was inflammation of the hair follicle. however that 8 weeks ago and its still a redish hard lump (nodule) and im really worried its cancerous or something. im wondering whether if anyone has had something similar or whether an ingrown hair can cause that?",
