            "answer": "Hi, burning feet could be caused from a number of causes like ill fitting shoes to diabetes. If you are a diabetic this could be the most likely cause. Diabetes causes peripheral neuropathy, damage to the leg nerves. Alcoholism and vitamin deficiencies can also cause neuropathy. Sometimes allergy to the inner lining of shoes can cause burning.
