            "answer": "Hi,The back pain may be due to several factors .Musculoskeletal or arthritic pain may be a primary differential. It may be referred pain from gastrointestinal problems. Problems with bowel movement like diarrhea may cause vague discomfort or dull pain that may refer to the lower back. Gynecologic conditions may also cause referred pain to the back.A urine culture will establish the presence of an infection. Pyuria or the presence of increased WBC in the protein suggests an infection .In the case of asymptomatic pyuria wherein WBC is elevated in the absence of an underlying infection, there may be other causes such as infection caused by a atypical organisms like tuberculosis. Have you had any previous exposure to someone with TB?\u00a0\u00a0Have you been assessed along this line?Also, you may discuss with your physician the advantages of drinking 100% cranberry juice at this point. You may be given a trial course of antibiotics to see if this may decrease the WBC levels.These are just differentials .Further work up may be necessary if the WBC levels remain elevated even after antibiotic therapy.",
