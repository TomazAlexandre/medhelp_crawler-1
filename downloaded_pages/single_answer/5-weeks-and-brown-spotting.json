            "answer": "Hi!If you are pregnant for first time at 42 years, then you need to be under gynecological care right from day 1. You may need hormone replacement therapy for about 3 months. Also you will need antenatal genetic and other testing to rule out common anomalies in baby that is common in first pregnancies at this age. Chances of high BP and diabetes during pregnancy are also high. So for a successful pregnancy it will have to be rigorously managed by an expert. All the best! Take care!",
