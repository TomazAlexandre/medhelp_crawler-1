            "answer": "I believe that the answer is not going to be an easy one, for each person is different. Some develop ketoacidosis quicker than others do. If glucose levels are high, then the body does go after fat and muscle in order to find the energy it needs. This of course, eventually causes the presence of keytones, but if glucose levels are high for several hours, and then are brought to normal only to rise to abnormal high levels hours later, some people will show keytones while others won't.I do know that some young diabetics who are trying to stay thin will deliberately use high gluocse levels to keep from gaining weight, and not all of these people end up hospitalized with ketoacidosis. But the damages from the high glucose levels can start happening even if keytones are not present, so this is a dangerous way to stay slim. I suspect that most people would rather carry a few pounds than to live in constant pain from neuropathy or to not be able to digest their foods because of gastroparesis.Now, many type 1 diabetics are slim (myself included). But this does not necessarily mean that our glucose levels are high. It means that we tend to eat in a healthy fashion, having been taught from the onset of our diagnosis of diabetes how important a balanced diet is. We are put on a balanced diet that is appropriate for our bodies' size, and if we are in good control, we don't tend to vary from this healthy way of eating very much. This keeps us from gaining unwanted pounds. My a1c stays at about 6 but I stay slim -- this is just an example.So in short, I believe that the fact that so many type 1 diabetics are slim is because we eat healthily and don't tend to snack blindly since we need to counter our snacks with insulin. In your case, if your glucose levels are high quite often, you could be burning off some of your fat and muscle even though your body does not seem to go into the severe form of ketoacidosis. From articles I have read, it seems that some people don't tend to go into ketoacidosis as easily as others, and you may be one of those. Your glucose levels may be sort of borderline -- high enough to prevent you from being able to store a normal amount of body fat without being high enough to make you gravely ill. I would caution you that the fact that you have not reached the point of ketoacidosis does not protect you from other damages.I have volunteered wtih the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation long enough to read many e-mails from people who suddenly have developed life-changing complications after years of high glucose levels that didn't seem to be hurting them. It is usually too late to save the nerves or the eyes or the organs when this happens, for the damages are not apparent until severe. So please consider this and make getting on top of those numbers a priority in your life so that your life will be long and healthy. Studies have PROVEN that tight control does protect from damages, and when you have lived with the disease as long as I have (36 years) and have no complications, you will be grateful that you were prodded to protect yourself.\u00a0\u00a0I think that most of us long-timers who do enjoy good health have come to some point in our lives whereby we realized that we needed to stop living in denial about the possible damages of the disease and start taking aggressive actions to keep our numbers as close to normal ALL the time as humanly possible. This becomes a lifestyle, and, frankly, i find i have much more energy than i did in the days when my glucose levels bounced high fairly often.Sorry for the sermon there, but maybe this will help you take the steps to change some priorities and protect your health. I wish you a long and healthy life.",

    "question": "I am a type 1 diabetic under poor control, resulting in high blood sugar quite often. I was wondering if there was a correlation between blood sugar and the amount of fat or muscle in one's body. At the risk of generalizing, I have seen many \"thin\" type 1 diabetics. I myself am very thin, with almost no visible body fat. During ketoacidosis I realize the body breaks down body fat and muscle, but luckily I have never reached that point. Do everyday high or low bloodsugars make a difference in weight, fat, and muscle?",
