    "question": "I have been going to Weight Watchers for a year, the first 4 months I lost 18 pounds. I was satisfied with this because I felt it was a sensible plan. But... the last 8 months, no matter how hard I try, and stick exactly to the plan, I'm gaining! I have now gained back 9 of the 18 pounds. This is just not worth it. I have no energy and am getting very depressed. About 10 years ago I took Fastin diet pills for a while, lost all the weight I needed and kept it off for 10 years. Now that I'm gong through menopause, I can't loose weght no matter what. I would love to take Fastin again, because it gave me so much energy and I was able to loose weight, but I now have high blood pressure(controlled) and don't want to chance it. I have read a lot on this site about the HCG shot, sounds like it is safe with High blood pressure (under control). Does anyone know where I can get this in Minneapolis area?",
