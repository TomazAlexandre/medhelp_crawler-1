            "answer": "I've had slightly higher readings when I had pre-diabetes. I'm still puzzled as to why doctors still give different diagnosis results. I decided to educate myself on diabetes to understand what it is all about. I was reading a lot to see what different sources say. Don't Mess With Your sugar, Honey by Dr. Zilber helped a lot in understanding diabetes better. At least I know I could trust sources from a doctor through his book because consulting doctors can be very frustrating at times. Good luck !",
