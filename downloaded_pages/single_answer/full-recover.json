    "question": "I had Hepatitis A, in 1983. I was teaching Indian Children, and they have poor sanitation as well as hygiene. Ever since this illness, when I have periodic blood tests done during my yearly exams, very often, it shows elevated enzymes in the liver.\u00a0\u00a0One doctor even said it is a sign I have Cirrosis of the liver. I have not had alcohol since 1972, when I did drink, it was a very, very occasional thing and very little. I have not taken an aspirin or I.B. Profen in ages, and don't intend to ever take any. I was diagnosed with diabetes in April 1999.\u00a0\u00a0First of all, could there be any relation to the liver problem and coming down with diabetes? I thought Hep A was curable. Why am I having the abnormal liver function results in my blood test.\u00a0\u00a0I have been checked for B and C, probably E too, not sure. I am still very tired after all these years. I take no medication for the diabetes or the liver. I have started a flesh free, pure vegetarian diet, no dairy, no eggs either. Any suggestions?",
