            "answer": "Hi!The symptoms of \u2018twitching, stiffness, muscles burning, the back of my neck and base of skull feels as if someone is grabbing it hard and won't let go.\u2019 can be due to compression of the spinal nerves in the cervical spine region. This can happen due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, herniated disc, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. A MRI of the cervical spine and nerve conduction studies may be required. Please consult a neurologist. The treatment is to remove the compression. You have to discuss the best treatment option with a neurologist, which can range from medication to physiotherapy to traction, cervical collars or even surgery.Other possibilities are vitamin B12 or vitamin D deficiency, Lyme\u2019s, lupus, hypothyroidism and diabetes.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
