            "answer": "Hey, I'm 15 as well and have a weird peripheral neuropathy. I can't feel my fingers, half my thumb or my feet at all. I have been tested for almost every disease by neurology team, GI teams, rumitoligy teams and oncology teams. Every test, MRI, LP and nerve conduction studies that I have had comes back normal! I had a nerve biopsy, and that is the only thing left to come back. I have nerve pain in my legs (burning and lighting bolt shocks), sever nausea and stomache pian in the liver/gualbladder area. I take Gabipentin and Maxeran (for delayed stomache emptying). I am really scared of what might happen if the nerve biopsy comes back normal.Will they start saying that this is all in my head? I am not making this up, all this happening to me had ruined my chances of cycling in BC games this summer.",

    "question": "Hello doctors. I'm fifteen years old, and I have been having numbness and \"tingling\" in my arms, legs, fingertips, toes, and several other areas for about three months. I visited a \"neurologist\" and had several blood tests that ruled out blood diseases like diabetes and \"celiac\" (because of vibrating finger tips) and and major brain disorders (ms and allesions in my brain).\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms are beginning to occur more frequently, about five times a day.\u00a0\u00a0(To elaborate, an example of five times would be today: my entire leg falling asleep (numbness then tingling and intense pins/needles shortly after) , my right foot faling asleep, both arms tingling, fingertips vibrating, and inner leg having numbness)\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any idea what I could have or what should be tested? I am becoming a little more nervous.. thank you very much for your time.",
