    "question": "Personally, I have HSV-2\u00a0\u00a0genital (for 9 years, and have mild symptoms) and recently I have started dating a woman who has diabetes type 2, recently diagnosed this year in March.I have told her about my condition and we would like to find out more about the effects of HSV-2 on diabetes type 2 patients, because we would really want more information as it would help us in our relationship.1) What is it like for women with diabetes and HSV-2?2) Do the symptoms alleviate over time, like normal HSV-2 people?3) How do you cope with the conditions?4) Is there any hope in such a situation? (A diabetes type 2 woman with HSV-2)5) What precautions should I take as her partner? (I know that condoms and suppressive therapy are a must. May I know if there are other precautions?)Would really appreciate if you can share your experience or some advice.Thanks in advance.",
