            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Creatinine and blood urea are renal parameters used for assessing kidney function. An increase in these parameters indicates a deterioration of the function of kidneys. The normal value of creatinine is upto 1.4 mg/dl. Infections, dehydration, malnutrition, diabetes, hypertension can cause renal failure there by a raise in creatinine values. Acute renal failure may result from trauma, blood loss, serious infections, poisons, some cancers and biochemical imbalances . A reliable measure of renal function is often expressed to doctors by a creatinine clearance test.I would suggest that you visit a nephrologists to get a complete work up done and advise on treatment.Best.",
