            "answer": "Quite often stones will cause your bile to backup into your liver. This will damage many of your liver cells that become involved within these pooling regions. It's this backflow/damaging process that your doctors are detecting with their LFT blood work.Once your stones have been resolved, your liver will recuperate. It has a very amazing ability to regenerate. But you do need to work with your doctors to quickly get the stones dealt with. They can also tell you whether or not you also have fatty liver disease. This can be resolved as well.Take care.",
