    "question": "I sweat a lot all over my body. I recently got rashes all over my body which itch a lot, especially on my belly, groin and under armpits. Now the rashes have spread all over my body. Tried many ointments, talcum powder but to no avail. I had recently travelled to my worksite, this is the second time i've got allergy after visiting the worksite.\u00a0\u00a0Don't know if any plant is causing this. My doctor says it is due to sweat, but there is no relief. I also am a Diabetic, though Blood-sugar level is not very high.I do have my tablets regularly. Thank you in advance for the answer",
