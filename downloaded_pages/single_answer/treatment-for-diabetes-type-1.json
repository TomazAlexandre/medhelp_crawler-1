            "answer": "Hello,Insulin is truly the best drug to manage diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0However it takes the right dose and also lifestyle changes to make it work.What insulin are you taking?\u00a0\u00a0Are you taking mixed insulin or are you on basal-bolus regime (ie. you take a long acting insulin 1 or 2 times a day) and then you take a fast acting insulin when you eat.\u00a0\u00a0 How much of the fast acting you take depends on how much carb and protein you eat.Do you test your blood sugar frequently enough that you can understand when you are high or low and can make adjustments.Do you know how to do correction doses of insulin (ie. what to do to bring sugars down if you are high).Are you controlling how many carbs you eat?\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is much easier and safer to use if you combine it with a very low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0If you eat low carb you then need less insulin to control your blood sugar and there is less risk of lows.Are you exercising.\u00a0\u00a0At least 30 minutes of walking or other exercise every day is really important in managing diabetes.Do you have any chronic infections, such as bad teeth, etc. These can also make blood sugar control much harder and need to be addressed.I can recommend the following books for you to read and study:-Think Like a Pancreas.Using InsulinDiabetes Solutions - this one also recommends and explains how to eat low carb.Diabetes is a long term medical condition.\u00a0\u00a0To manage it you need to arm youself with the skills and tools to manage it.",
