    "question": "i feel a bit dizzy more of a tipsy thing,drowsy,feels like there's a pressure in my face through in between my eyes,my forehead,as if it's stretching,a facial sensation like i'm going to pass out later. I do not know what is wrong with me but i've been to my doctor's and they don't see any problem with me except my elevated cholesterol (elevated by 1 poin only),the rest ecg,2d echo,fbs,cbc,creatinine,bua are all normal. I have anxiety disorder though,but i'm off my med 3 months ago (doctor's decision).So what's wrong with me?",
