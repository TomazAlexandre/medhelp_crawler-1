            "answer": "Anxiety may easily drive your blood pressure up to 140/90. Though 140/90 isn't dangerously high (actually, it's borderline normal), you may want to ask for a 24 hour monitoring or buy a home monitor to see what your \"real\" blood pressure is.If you usually are below 135/85 (the limit is slightly lower when you're not at the doctors office, seems like some white coat hypertension is expected), you don't have high blood pressure.I completely understand your anxiety. I have anxiety too. I wish you all the best and good luck with your pregnancy.",
