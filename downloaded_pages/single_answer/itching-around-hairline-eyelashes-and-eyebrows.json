            "answer": "Hello,Without examination,confirming a diagnosis is tough but some of the possibilities for your symptoms are dermatitis or eczema,seborrheic dermatitis ,fungal infections of the eyebrows and eyelashes or systemic diseases like diabetes or peripheral nerve diseases.Ketoconazole containing anti-fungal shampoos control the symptom if fungal infection is suspected.Dermatitis like seborrheic or atopic may require steroids.It is also important to get blood sugar levels estimated.I feel that an evaluation by a dermatologist will be the best.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.",
