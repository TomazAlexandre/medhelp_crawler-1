            "answer": "Hi!Pain in the armpit can be due to heat intolerance and due to sweat dermatitis.It is also possible due to peripheral artery disease. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, chemical burns due to any deo or lotions you use, peripheral nerve compression are the other possibilities.If you can feel a lump, then this pain can be due to a swollen lymphnode, in response to fungal infection or sweat dermatitis or infection of hair follicles. At times it is a cyst or a hair follicle too and this can get infected. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
