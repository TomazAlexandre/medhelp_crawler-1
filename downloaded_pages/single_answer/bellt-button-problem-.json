            "answer": "Hi!Ideally a swab from your belly button should be sent for culture and sensitivity analysis to see what micro-organism is causing the infection and what antibiotic will work against it. Thereafter local and oral antibiotics should be started. If you have a family history of diabetes, or are obese then you need to get blood sugar checked. High blood sugar often prevents healing. The third possibility is that a fistula has formed along the tract the laparoscope was inserted. This can be diagnosed by injecting dye in the belly button and taking an X-ray. Surgery is the treatment of choice in case of fistula. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
