            "answer": "Hi there!As single elevated value may not necessarily indicate diabetes since this may occur due to stress, temporary hormonal/ endocrine issues etc aside testing errors. It might be worthwhile taking a few more readings, before and after food on different days and taking a few random readings. If most of the readings remain high, you might consider seeing a primary care physician or an endocrinologist for confirmatory testing and suggestion of an appropriate management plan.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
