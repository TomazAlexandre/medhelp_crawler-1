            "answer": "Hi,Xerosis is the medical term for dry skin. It can have many different causes, including general dehydration, Vitamin A deficiency, and diabetes.Apart from the various lotions/creams etc. you should drink plenty of water every day to keep skin well hydrated.Also include plenty of greens and yellow-orange colored fruits and vegetables as they all contain Vit A in plenty.You cannot undo the damage caused by alcohol by just drinking plenty of water. Since you already have a problem withdry skin you need to avoid factors which will aggravate it.Do not wash your face often , do it once a day and only with water as soaps tend to dry out the skin.",
