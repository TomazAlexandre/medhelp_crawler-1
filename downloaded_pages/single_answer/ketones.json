            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Ketones are the byproduct of the body consuming fat.\u00a0\u00a0Muscles not getting carbohydrates delivered to them is one cause of many of that condition.\u00a0\u00a0Do you test blood sugars immediately after seeing large ketones?\u00a0\u00a0One of the things about testing ketones through urine is that it is a reflection of what was going on in the body anywhere from 2 to 4 hours prior, because of the process of the kidneys filtering the blood and the bladder storing up the urine.\u00a0\u00a0The Precision Xtra meter can check blood sugars and ketones at the same time, and it is an immediate test of what is going on in the body.There are other things that can cause ketones as well.\u00a0\u00a0Non-diabetics can get ketones when there are major stresses going on in their bodies.\u00a0\u00a0Major surgeries or other undiagnosed serious illnesses can cause ketones because of the stress that it causes a body.\u00a0\u00a0I have no reason to suspect that, but it most definitely is a possibility.So what I would do first is try to get your hands on a Precision Xtra meter so you can get a more immediate check of blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0The second thing I would do is continue to work with your pediatrition to check for other major illnesses.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
