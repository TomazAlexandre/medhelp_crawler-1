    "question": "I am a 30yo male who was healthy up until 3 years ago and didn't have major problems until 1 ago. I developed an allodynia 3 years ago on my left calf. I had surgery for a vericocle at the time as well. I had a few severe groin pains over the next 2 years lasting 1 week as unlocalized mild leg pain. Last Nov I got sick and developed gastroparesis. Recently it has improved and I am no longer on medications for it but shortly after in Feb I started developing fasciculations. Blood tests have shown slight hypercapnia for at least 2 years and borderline ANA. EKG of left calf was negative. Faciculations went away when I stopped exercising. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 3 months ago (AHI 50) and am now on CPAP. ENT is baffled about it. Been sick 3 times over the past year without my wife or daughter getting sick, always with respiratory symptoms.\u00a0\u00a02mo ago I developed a bitter taste and tingling in arms and legs, worse at night, in chairs, computer, etc. My mouth has also been very dry. Had a few bouts with conjunctivitis over the past few years, one chronic. Appts w/neurologist in late Jan and Pulmonoligst in late Dec. CATSCAN of head last summer was normal as was ultrasound of abdomen this summer. IgA and Gamma Globulin were slightly elevated this summer but A1c and fasting blood sugar have always been normal. Vit D was low but fixed now. ANA borderline\u00a0\u00a0this summer. Nighttime urination last year but went away. Thought my prostate might be enlarged a few times and Urologist confirmed with prostate exam. Family history of Crohn's, IBS, T2 diabetes, Hashimoto's disease, epilepsy, and skin/breast cancers. IgA-ttg elevated but biopsy negative for Celiac. Borderline hypercapnia for at least 2 years.Primary care thinks it's psychosomatic. My mother-in-law, a vet, suggested heavy metals due to old pipes in MA. Any ideas?My dad is an internist and will be seeing him soon. What tests should I ask him to order? Seeing Pulmonoligist in Dec. Anything I can ask him?",
