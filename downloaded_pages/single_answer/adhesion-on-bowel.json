    "question": "I'm 74 years of age. I recently had laporoscopic surgery to remove an adhesion on my bowel. This was the first time I had been hospitalized since I had my tonsils removed when I was 5. My doctor said the adhesion probably was formed from an unnoticed and/or untreated problem, perhaps diverticulosis (diverticulitis). This explanation seems somewhat lacking. I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes a year ago August. My doctor says the diabetes has been reversed as my readings are what he would expect from a non-diabetic Any ideas??",
