            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The pulsing could be due to cervical spinal nerve compression.It could also be due to thrombophlebitis or inflammation of a vein. This can cause a lump at times along with redness. If you have a lump and the pulsing is in the area of the lump, ten it could be a cyst or an abscess.You should get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.You need a comprehensive investigation taking all these points in consideration. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0Do let me know if there is any thing else you want to know. Take care!",
