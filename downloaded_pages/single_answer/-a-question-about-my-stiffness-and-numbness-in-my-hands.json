            "answer": "Hello kay647,I am sorry to hear that your hands are bothering you.Have you recently changes anything about the way you interact with your work station: for example, new chair, new keyboard, or new computer?Here are some basic ergonomic principles that you can try right now:1.\u00a0\u00a0Try to assume a seat height that puts your feet flat on the floor, your thighs parallel to the floor, and your forearms parallel to the floor.2. Try to assume a wrist and hand position that places your wrist in a neutral position. Neutral more or less means not flexed or extended. This also means that the keyboard should be at or just below elbow height. Try to not rest you palms on the edge of the keyboard or desk - your hand should \"float\"3. The top of your video display (monitor) should not be positioned above the horizontal line of sight.4. Cushioned or broad supports for the hand that maintain a neutral hand and wrist posture can help some people.With regard to the numbness that you are experiencing, if the changes in hand/arm/wrist position do not alleviate your symptoms or if your symptoms worsen, then I would recommend that you see a physician.There are also other medical conditions that can cause problems with nerves in the extremities (arms, legs) such as diabetes and thyroid disease.I hope this is of help to you.-Dr. Parks",

    "question": "To whom it may concern. I am wondering if I should consult a doctor about my hands. I type a lot for school. These past two nights I have had numb hands and they have been stiff. At most times I can type if I really focus and look at the keys. Which I normally just look at the screen and type for memory. I am not sure if this is poor circulation, or an ergonomics issue. Would you suggest I see a doctor and that this might be a work related stress problem in my hand. Is there anything i can do to cope with this?Thankyou so much",
