            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.I am not sure as to the exact location of the burning you feel. The distribution of the burning would help in distinguishing the causes. If the burning is over your whole arms on both sides, or under your armpits, it could be dermatologic (irritated skin, dermatitis due to medication or chemicals, fungal infection etc). If the burning is at your finer tips, it could potentially be a neuropathy, or a disorder of the peripheral nerves. Diabetes is the most common cause of neuropathy, but there are several other causes. If the burning occurs mainly in the 1st three digits of the hand and is worse at night, one possibility is carpal tunnel syndrome. If your symptoms come and go as you mention, and completely resolve, neuropathy becomes somewhat less likely though.Discussion of your symptoms with your primary doctor (internist, family physician) is recommended. After he/she evaluates you and obtains a history, he/she can help determine what if any further testing is necessary and/or whether you need to be referred to a specialist.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
