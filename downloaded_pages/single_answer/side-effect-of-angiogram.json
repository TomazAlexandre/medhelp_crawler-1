            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.It\u2019s unlikely that allergy to the dye used in angiography is causing the symptoms. The dye is excreted in 24 hrs. The itching could be due to other causes. The probable causes for itchy hands are scabies, diabetes mellitus, eczema, tineapedis (fungal infection) and psoriasis. Scabies infection is caused by a mite Sarcoptesscabiei, it burrows in the skin folds of hands and feet and causes intense itching mostly at night. She may need to consult a Dermatologist who will examine her and may ask for blood tests and in addition examine the scrapings from the skin to arrive at a diagnosis for appropriate therapy.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
