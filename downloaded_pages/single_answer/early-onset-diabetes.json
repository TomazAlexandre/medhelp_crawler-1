            "answer": "Hi - I don't think what you are writing about sounds like Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Is that the diabetes you mean when you say \"early onset?\" There are many five year olds (my own was one.... ) and kids much younger, babies even, diagnosed with Type 1, so there really is no such thing, unfortunately, as \"early onset.\"\u00a0\u00a0And if did have Type 1 it would progress more quickly than a year's time - it would have gotten to the point where she would be very sick, with very high blood sugar (much higher then 199) within a month or two.\u00a0\u00a0It does sound like something is going on, though - and that maybe it is something associated with her Lyme diagnosis - ?\u00a0\u00a0Have they checked her for celiac?\u00a0\u00a0That can cause stomache pains and weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0Some of her other symptoms do sound scary.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you can find a doctor that can figure it out.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us posted.",

    "question": "I'm not sure if I should be posting here b/c my daughter hasn't been dx but I really am trying to find out some info on our problem, so I apologize if I'm in the wrong spot.\u00a0\u00a0My 5 yo old daughter has had abdominal pain for about a year now.\u00a0\u00a0It almost a daily complaint but sometimes it gets so bad she gets very pale,dark circles under her eyes,crying, sweating and then she'll pass out, it can be very hard to wake her.\u00a0\u00a0There has been a couple of times where she did vomitduring these episodes.\u00a0\u00a0She complains of leg pain also and says her eyes are bothering her, she has had eye exams and has 20/20 vision. She has a rash often like a yeast infection that i thought she was getting from not wiping herself well enough but that wasn't the case.\u00a0\u00a0She has accidents w/ wetting her pants ans always seems as if it's urgent when she has to urinate.\u00a0\u00a0She hasn't gained any weight about a year. This all started after she was dx w/ Lyme disease. Lyme was treated w/ amoxicillan(sp?), this was in Sept.of 08 and first \"episode\" on x-mas of '08,things have been progressevily worse since than.\u00a0\u00a0She has been to a GI doc that ruled so many things and an allergist. She was also treated for abdominal migrains but that wasn't the problem. I came to this board hoping to get some advice, I know you can't dx my daughter but getting some\u00a0\u00a0advice from someone who has personal experiance w/ diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0We have checked her blood glucose before, she had a fasting number of 199, 157 2 hrs after meal and she has been 131 during the night.\u00a0\u00a0I did bring to the ped w/ the 199 but hours after they would see us her number was w/in range. Could she be very early onset diabetes? Could the Lyme disease been a trigger? I've read it can time to develop. She has\u00a0\u00a0doc appt on Friday, should I talk to them more about this?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any ino and advice!",
