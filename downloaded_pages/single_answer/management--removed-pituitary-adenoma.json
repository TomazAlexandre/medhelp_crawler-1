            "answer": "What kind of pituitary tumor?What replacements is he on? Did he have DI - diabetes insipidus after surgery? Is he always thirsty and peeing a lot?Did they give him cortef (hydorcortisone) replacements and thyroid and maybe other medications? Is he under the care of a neuro-endo, not just the surgeon? He can develop SIADH and other complications, as well if he had surgery and is not replaced with hormones and the pituitary is not functioning well - he can get super sick and even die. If he is in a hospital that is not used to pituitary, they may not know what or how to check. Is he in touch with his surgeon and/or a neuro-endo?",
