            "answer": "While we don't come up with specific diet plans, we might be able to help you.There are a couple of things you should get checked before starting any type of diet.1) you should be checked for diabetes (abnormally high blood sugar), which can cause weight loss or inability to gain2) you should have your thyroid gland checked to make sure you don't have hyperthyroidism (over active thyroid), which can also cause weight loss/inability to gain.\u00a0\u00a0You should have Free T3, Free T4 and TSH tested.Do make sure to rule out medical issues, since both of these, left untreated can cause serious health issues.That said - vegetables are very good for you and should not be causing you to be unable to gain weight.",
