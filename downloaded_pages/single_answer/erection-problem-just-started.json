            "answer": "I'm not sure what your question is. Are you asking about anti-depressants and their affects on erection and/or orgasm? I can give you a general answer, but for specifics, you should consult your physician.Many anti-depressants can have sexual side effects. Ask your physician whether the one you're taking is in this category.It's difficult for me to know what you mean by the term \"ED\" because people use it to mean anything from \u201ccouldn\u2019t get an erection on command after having a fight with my wife\u201d to \u201chave never had an erection in my life.\u201d Viagra doesn\u2019t alleviate anxiety, etc. All it does is open up blood flow to the penis. It\u2019s generally prescribed for men who have a medical condition such as diabetes, which prevents blood flow. For more information about male sexual issues, I recommend \u201cThe New Male Sexuality,\u201d by Bernie Zilbergeld, Ph.D., widely available online, both used and in paperback. Best of luck to you.
