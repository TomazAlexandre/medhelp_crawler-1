            "answer": "The constant thirst and breath odor do sound suspicious for diabetes -- an undiagnosed diabetic's breath will be sort of fruity-smelling. And the 7-year-old's stomach pains don't sound like they are related to diabetes, but should be checked. You might want to have the doctor check for Celiac Disease. I recommend that both children go to the doctor for some tests. Better to be safe than sorry.",

    "question": "Neither one of my children have been diagnosed with diabeties but, the 4 year old is showing some symptoms i think but am not sure. He is always very thirsty, and his breath has a weird odor. The 7 yr old always complains of stomach pain. Are these some things that i should be concerned about?",
