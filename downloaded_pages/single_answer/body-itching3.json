            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dry skin is the commonest cause of generalized itching. Applying a moisturizer and using only soaps that are gentle on the skin is helpful in this case.\u00a0\u00a0(If you have blisters at tip of fingers and dry skin then you need to rule out certain conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition.)Generalized itching can be due to allergy. Common allergens are pollen, mold, dust, pet dander, synthetic fiber, food, cosmetics (powders, soaps, shampoos\u2014see if anything was recently changed) or drugs. You must get an allergy test done, either a skin test or RAST, to know what you are allergic to. Fungal infections like tinea corporis and tinea cruris too cause whole body itching along with genital itching. Liver problems too can cause generalized itching. Worms are another cause of body itch, hence get a stool test.In women menopause is another reason for this. Low estrogens are supposed to be the cause. Hormone replacement therapy can also help a few. PCOD and hormone imbalance too can be a cause.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
