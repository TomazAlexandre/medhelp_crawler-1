            "answer": "Hello,From your symptoms it seems that you are suffering from sweat dermatitis or fungal infection. Excessive sweating can cause skin problems and probably you are suffering from a fungal infection of the scrotal skin called Tinea Cruris. Wearing light and cotton clothes, taking cool refreshing baths and avoiding strenuous activities can be helpful. If you are overweight lose weight. Excess fat causes sweating and oilier skin. You can apply some calamine lotion at the rash as it will help in soothing the skin. You can try taking some oral antihistamine medications like Benadryl and see if it helps. For mild-moderate symptoms a weak steroid may be used .In more severe cases a higher-potency steroid may be needed. Oral antifungal medication therapy may be necessary if the skin infection is intractable. Repeated fungal infection can be an indication of an underlying disorder such as diabetes or any other condition which might be affecting your immune system .A complete clinical examination and tests like urine examination, blood counts and fasting blood sugars may be helpful. Consult an experienced dermatologist. Treatment will be specific based on the cause. Keep me posted on how you are doing.Best luck and regards!",
