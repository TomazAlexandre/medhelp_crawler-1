            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.White matter lesions usually more than one in the periventricular region or in the cerebellum, spinal cord and brain stem are typically seen in MS. The most specific lesions are lesions in the corpus callosum.Since you do have white mater lesions in the periventricular region along with symptoms of numbness on one side of the body does seem to indicate MS.However MS is a very difficult disease to diagnose since the symptoms are non specific. Your symptoms could also be due to stroke or peripheral neuropathy like diabetes or B12 deficiency.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, I have just found this web site and I'm finding very interesting.\u00a0\u00a02 weeks ago I started getting numbness in my right arm/hand and leg/foot. I have since had a MRI scan which read - scattered periventriular areas of altered signal. Largest in right fontal and parietal regions and left parietal regions. Disc space narrowing and deg C5-C7. Post disc bulging from C4-7. Well defined area of attered signal at C5 level on spinal cord. I am now waiting for results from a lumar puncher, I am told these could take up to 4 weeks. After reading items on the net it could be that I am experiencing symtoms of MS? is there any other reasons that I may have these symtoms?I would be gratful for any answersthanks michy1",
