            "answer": "Yes she should be seeing an endocrinologist to help maintain her diabetes. They specialize in diabetes management and would be the best option for your mom. Please get her an appointment ASAP. I would suggest you get a copy of her records from whatever doctor she is seeing now plus the records from her ER visits to give to her new doctor. It is also important that she gets yearly diabetic eye exams either by a optometrist or an opthalmologist.",
