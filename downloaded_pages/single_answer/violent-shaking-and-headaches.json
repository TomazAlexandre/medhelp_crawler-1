            "answer": "Perhaps one of three things comes to mind:\u00a0\u00a0Migraine headaches with aura, hypoglycemia (like diabetes), or seizure activity.\u00a0\u00a0Visiting your regular doc and having them check your blood sugars would be a good first step.\u00a0\u00a0If your sugars are okay, then a neurologist can make a determination about whether you have seizures or not by running an EEG tape.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't have seizures, then the neuro can also decide if it's indeed migraines or even some other neurological or brain problem that I'm not familiar with.While you wait to see your doc, carry some sugar candy around with you, and when this feeling begins to come over you, eat it, and that way IF your blood sugars are low, you just might minimize or even stop the shaking and sleeping stuff.\u00a0\u00a0And obviously you should not drive or be around dangerous mechanical things until this thing is sorted out.\u00a0\u00a0Some people who exercise via a sporting activity will get the sort of thing you're talking about, but usually their eyes are involved, and if I'm not mistaken, most of those things are indeed low blood sugars.",

    "question": "From time to time, and at various times of the day, I get a feeling of being \"spaced out\" then within seconds, I can not walk or talk and after making it to my chair, both arms and legs begin to shake violently and almost instantly I get a severe headache where the brain connects to the spinal cord. The headaches are unbearable. I place ice packs on the back of my neck and that does seem to help. Also, the violent shaking will last from about 5 to 20 minutes and sometimes will alternate between my right side and left side. After the shaking stops, I fall into a very deep sleep. Any thoughts?",
