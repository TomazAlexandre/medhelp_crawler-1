            "answer": "Hi!It would be best to stop antibiotics for a few days and re-test your semen and urine for infection. This will detect any lingering infection. Since, you had to take antibiotics for so long, please ask your doctor whether you need to rule out MRSA infection and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A scrotal ultrasound will help diagnose the lump.Please discuss with your doctor. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
