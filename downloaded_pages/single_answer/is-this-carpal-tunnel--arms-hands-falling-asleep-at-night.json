            "answer": "Hello,There are many conditions which can lead to your symptoms like a neurological or circulatory problem. Your symptoms could be suggestive of ulnar nerve entrapment .The cause of ulnar nerve entrapment is\u00a0\u00a0 swelling of the elbow, which may be due to arthritis or other medical conditions, cysts, prior fractures in the arm or bone spurs. Peripheral neuropathy in diabetes mellitus is another possibility. A clinical examination and MRI findings may help. Do keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",

    "question": "For probably about the past year or so, when I fall asleep at night when sleeping on my stomach with an arm above my head bent 90 degrees to sleep on top of, I wake up either in the middle of the night or in the morning not being able to move my arm.\u00a0\u00a0When it first started I would not be able to move my arm whatsoever for a few minutes until blood circulation restarted, but I think in the past 6 months or so I've gotten so used to it that I wake up in the middle of the night as soon as I feel it and reposition my arm after I get the blood flowing again.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a sign of something more serious like diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Carpal tunnel syndrome?\u00a0\u00a0Or is it the result of working out more and now the nerves are pinched when sleeping more than they used to be?\u00a0\u00a0It feels as though the nerve that usually is sensitive to pressure is under my arm, near the arm pit except on the underarm side, rather than the side of chest side of the armpit.\u00a0\u00a0Usually no problem when awake I don't think.",
