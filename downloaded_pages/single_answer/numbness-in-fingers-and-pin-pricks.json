            "answer": "Hi there. This could be due to many possibilities. The pain and numbness could be due to carpal tunnel syndrome, cervical disc radiculopathy or compression of the exiting nerves by the prolapsed discs, bony spurs, at the vertebral level or elbow and shoulder joints, pinched nerves at the shoulder level. This could be due to systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, folate and vitamin B complex deficiencies etc. consult a neurologist who would do a neurological assessment, order for the required blood tests, imaging studies like MRI cervical spine and nerve conduction velocity study. Treatment will depend on the diagnosis. Hope this helps. Take care.",
