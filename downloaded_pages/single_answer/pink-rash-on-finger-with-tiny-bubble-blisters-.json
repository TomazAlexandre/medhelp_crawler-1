            "answer": "Hi! The itch can be due to dry skin. If your daughter has blisters at tip of fingers and dry skin then you need to rule out certain conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition. Gestational diabetes, and hypothyroidism along with under nutrition is a possibility. At times increased bile pigments/jaundice is the cause. Please consult her gynecologist to run the basic tests. Take care!",
