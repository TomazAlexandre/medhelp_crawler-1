    "question": "Almost any time i eat any food after about 7pm even really healthy things (fruit vegg.), i will either wake up in the middle of the night really sick and walk around till the urge to throw up goes away and then have to prop myself up with pillows to sleep, or the urge will be too great and i will throw up. And if i eat something unhealthy like a burger any later than 2 or 3 same thing. i have been taking some digest aids like enzymes with papaya chewables and some capsules which seem to help a bit if i catch it soon enough, but i will usually still need to prop myself up while i sleep. About 4 months ago i had an episode so bad i had to get an upper endoscopy and i had asophagitis and it was too painful to eat for almost 3 months during which time i lost nearly 35 lbs. It has been much worse since then, and i can literally guarantee that if i eat after 7 without taking my pills i will throw up, and after 8 or 9 even if i do take them. I get a lot of heartburn, and when i have eaten and i lay down i can feel the food coming back up my assophogus, and i immediately start to feel nausiated. Any ideas on what i can do, i really just feel like i am always sick? I think it just takes my body a long time to digest things?",
