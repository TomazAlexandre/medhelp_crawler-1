            "answer": "Hello,Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. . Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle.Pls keep the area clean and apply some topical antiseptics. Also wear loose-fitting cotton clothing and use an antibacterial soap or mild soap like dove.Avoid any kind of cosmetics. Topical antibiotics such as mupirocin or neomycin containing ointment are also useful.In case the symptoms persist then oral antibiotics may be needed.Pls consult a dermatologist in that case.Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders.So pls get your blood sugar evaluated.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Warm regards.",

    "question": "I am a 24years old female. Have been having series of boil-like growth in my pubic region for a while. they come and go throughout the year. It started about 5years ago. Sometimes pus comes out of the growth, and sometimes the boil disappears by itself without discharge. Most of the time i have more than one at a time, varying in size. They are generally not painful, but sometimes they are painful and uncomfortable. Generally, it appears on my pubic region, but sometimes they form in my inner labia. The ones in the inner labia often have a opened part to it, kind of life a little sore. I spoke to my physician about it, and showed it to him, but he said its probably because of hair growth. I am concerned about what it is, and what can be done about it. do you have any idea what this might be?Thank you.",
