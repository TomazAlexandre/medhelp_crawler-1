    "question": "My father is a 76 year old diabetic with a progressively weakening heart.\u00a0\u00a0He has had significant plaque buildup in his arteries which are in fact closing up. He just had his third mild heart attack this past week. He is experiencing further plaque buildup from his diabetic medication, which if he stops, he gets weak and sore muscles.His doctor states that he is not a candidate for surgery because of his weakened heart condition.\u00a0\u00a0Is there not a \"safe\" procedure available to help clear his arteries effectively so that he is not threatened by these frequent attacks?\u00a0\u00a0His doctor leaves us with the rather poor prognosis that he will continue to get these attacks and that there is nothing that can be done.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a hopeless situation?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Bruce,Thank you\u00a0\u00a0for your question.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately a well known complication of diabetes is coronary artery disease.\u00a0\u00a0It is generally due to the diabetes itself and not the medication that one takes for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I can't comment specifically on your father's case but he may be a candidate for high risk surgery at a major heart center.\u00a0\u00a0We routinely perform surgery in older diabetic individuals who need bypass surgery.If he is not a surgical candidate there are still other options such as angioplasty or percutaneous transmyocardial revascularization that he may be a candidate for.\u00a0\u00a0If he is continuing to have symptoms he may consider seeking a second opinion as to his options.I hope you find this information useful.\u00a0\u00a0Information provided in the heart forum is for general purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Only your physician can provide specific diagnoses and therapies.\u00a0\u00a0Please feel free to write back with additional questions.If you would like to make an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center, please call 1-800-CCF-CARE or inquire online by using the Heart Center website at www.ccf.org/heartcenter.\u00a0\u00a0The Heart Center website contains a directory of the cardiology staff that can be used to select the physician best suited to address your cardiac problem.",
