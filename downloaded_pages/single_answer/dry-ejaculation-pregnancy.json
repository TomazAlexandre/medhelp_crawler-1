            "answer": "Unfortunetly, I don't have an answer, but I just wanted to say that my bf has the same problem. He has what's call retrograde ejaculation, which is where when he ejaculates, it goes into his bladder instead of coming out. This is something that is caused by nerve damage, and ppl with diabetes can get it. My bf is a type 1 diabetic and has been since he was 15, so in the last few yrs this problem has gotten worse. Sometimes something DOES come out though. You can still get pregnant, but it just might take longer. And in some cases if u have no luck, u can see ur doc and they can extract his sperm from his urine...that is if he has retrograde ejaculation.My only question with my situation is...if on the times my bf DOES have something come out but its just a little bit, what can I do to give just that little bit a chance to make the swim?",
