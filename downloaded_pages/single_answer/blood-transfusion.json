            "answer": "I am not sure but diabetes is a metabolic condition realted to your pancreas not what is in your blood. You get diabetes if your pancreas stop functioning. I believe blood is \"cleaned\" for impurities before it is given to its intended donor but I don't trust them at all. The worst that could happen is hepatitis, HIV or some infection. I recommend you talk to an expert. I hope you don't stress too much. Good luck to you.",

    "question": "I had a blood transfusion a couple of weeks ago because I was seriously anemic.\u00a0\u00a0After that, I've been fearful of the risks.\u00a0\u00a0I know nowadays it's harder to contract viruses like HIV or hepatitis due to a transfusion, since they screen the donors thouroughly.\u00a0\u00a0However, my question is, what if the donor had diabetes, or cholesterol, or a not-so-serious problem in their blood?\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible for this to be transferred to the receipient of the blood?This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/423522\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/423522</a>.",
