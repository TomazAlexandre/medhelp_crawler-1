            "answer": "Hello!Check your blood pressure and also your blood hemoglobin for anemia. If you have normal values then continue your diabetic medicines properly.Exercise and diet control and get your BMI to normal ranges.For the swelling I would suggest you not to stand for long hours. While sleeping you can keep your legs elevated on a pillow. In you work if you have to stand for long hours then I suggest you to take a break for few minutes every couple of hours and keep your legs elevated on a stool!I would also suggest to you that you have to see a cardiologist if it does not help.Take care!",
