Besides yeast, other infections of the vagina are bacterial vaginosis, trichomonasvaginalis and herpes vaginalis. This can also cause the burning sensation. The other causes for your symptoms could be metabolic disorders like diabetes, which\u00a0\u00a0can be detected by a simple blood test.\u00a0\u00a0You can discuss this with your primary care physician when you happen to meet him next time.
