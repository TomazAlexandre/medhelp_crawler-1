    "question": "Hi! my father has diabetes and mild stroke. For the past week, he has been experiencing headaches and nausea as well as blurry vision. He went for the MRI but there was nothing. Docs transfered him to the eye centre and part of his eyes got lasered to ease his eye pressure flow. But the headache is still there and his vision became more blur. What could be the problem?",
