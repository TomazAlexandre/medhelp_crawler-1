    "question": "Not a question just had to vent. 3 weeks ago I found out I had gestational diabetes. After the last couple of weeks of seeing a dietician, nutritionist and checking my blood levels 4x a day, I now have to use insulin at night. They tried to assure me that I was doing everything perfectly, my numbers are perfect during the day, but while I am asleep they are bad. I couldn't help, but cry. After tryi.g to be as healthy as possible this pregnancy I could not prevent this! (Family history of diabetes) I will take this insulin for my little one and pray we get through the next 9 1/2 weeks with nothing else popping up. I will also try my damndest not to get diabetes later on in life. It's just frustrating!",
