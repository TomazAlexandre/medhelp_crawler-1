            "answer": "Hi,It is important to make sure if the thyroid levels are normal or not. Hypothyroidism can cause peripheral neuropathy resulting in tingling numbness. Other causes of peripheral neuropathy like B 12 deficiency and diabetes also need to be ruled out.There is also a possibility of nerve compression in the cervical spine.
