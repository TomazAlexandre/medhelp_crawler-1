            "answer": "Your prescription can change radically when your diabetes becomes terribly out of control AND also when strict control causes a tremendous improvement in the glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0Both can do it and it's important to wait until your glucose levels have become more stable and then still wait a month or more because it defintely takes time for the glasses precription to settle down.\u00a0\u00a0This is a common scenario and it's good you know what is going on.MJK MD",

    "question": "I'm puzzled by something that\u00a0\u00a0happened with my eyesight recently. About a week before Christmas I found it very difficult to see with my glasses. On the Monday I went to my optician for an eyetest and my eyesight had changed from -4 dioptres to -1. I was also told I shouldn't wear my glasses and to wait until my sugar levels were all sorted out and under control and then go back. Just a few days ago my eyesight started changing again and I am now back to wearing my glasses.My question is this. Could it be down to the diabetes and the treatment begining to kick and can I expect other strange events occuring?By the way, I'm in the UK.",
