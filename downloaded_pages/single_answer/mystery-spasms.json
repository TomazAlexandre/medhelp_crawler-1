            "answer": "\"i have also just noticed that these spasms seem to happen more when I have consumed SUGAR.\"I read your post carefully and it seems it is unrelated to diabetes. Try posting in Family/Internal Medicine. Muscle spasm can be caused by dehydration, poor diet consisting of high levels of caffeine, sugars or other foods you're intolerant too, etc etc etc. This includes medications you're taking. Good luck -",

    "question": "Hi,I am desperate to get help for my situation.\u00a0\u00a0About 4 yrs. ago, I started noticing weakness and degeneration of my calf muscles, to the point that now I have no medial muscles and my whole lower leg swells.\u00a0\u00a0I have no insurance, so the local health dept. is my only option...a bad one, as they are good only at dispensing anti-depressants or giving flu shots, neither of which I subscribe to.The weakness has lead to lack of balance and tone.\u00a0\u00a0I am embarrassed at how my legs look sans inner calf muscles, but more than that is the fact that I have no strength to stand for long periods of time, anymore and it actually starts to hurt with a pulling pain when I do\u00a0\u00a0Coupled with that is very excruciating spasms that go from my ankle up to my inner thigh.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that quells it is a dose of Bone Up or Y Cramp, both of which have high calcium and magnesium.\u00a0\u00a0I get instant relief, usually.\u00a0\u00a0The cramping/spasms are so intense, tears form in my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I can barely walk to the kitchen to get the calcium pills.\u00a0\u00a0i have also just noticed that these spasms seem to happen more when I have consumed SUGAR.\u00a0\u00a0(don't worry, I don't use HFCS or Sucralose.)\u00a0\u00a0I just occasionally have a piece of cake or cookies or dried pineapple and later in the night, I will suffer tremendous painful episodes of horrible muscle spasms that make me want to die.I have tried taking\u00a0\u00a0things to build up my muscles, but so far nothing has helped.\u00a0\u00a0I just bought Synthovial Seven from the health food store.\u00a0\u00a0It is Hyaluronic Acid, which comprises the synovial fluid in the joints.\u00a0\u00a0This cost me a fortune ($46.99) but I am so desperate for some relief.\u00a0\u00a0if it works, I will happily spend that amount each month.Can anyone help me try to figure this out?I made the health dept. run some tests on me and Diabetes was ruled out.Many Thanks,Namaste,1zengirl",
