            "answer": "Hello,Various possibilities for your symptoms are incontinence of feaces,pinworms,haemorrhoids and anal fissures, skin conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis or eczema,lice,scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods.Exact cause can only be determined after clinical examination and investigations like stool examination,blood tests for diabetes,liver and kidney function tests and allergy tests l;ike skin tests and blood test like RAST. Pls consult a dermatologist for that.Wash the areas several times with fresh water. Do not use any cosmetic products at the sites. You can apply some calamine lotion at the rash as it will help in soothing the skin. You can take some OTC oral antihistamine medications like Benadryl or Claritin and see if it helps.Also choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding. Scratching provides only temporary relief and doesn't promote healing of the underlying problem, it is best to avoid scratching if at all possible. If scratching breaks open the skin, bacterial infection can set in. And if scratching continues for many months or years, the area that is scratched may develop thickened skin (lichenification) or pigmentation that darkens the area. The best way to allow irritated skin to heal is to stop scratching it.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "Please allow me to start this post by saying I have been to a total of three doctors over the past 5 years and each assigns a script for 1% hydro-cortizone.\u00a0\u00a0Thus it helps with the itch but I would like an idea of how to cure, therefore:I have had a rash directly next to my perinium that falls between the perinium and the butt cheek for around five years.\u00a0\u00a0The rash never expands bigger than the size of a quarter and has NOT spread.\u00a0\u00a0This rash gets really itchy after I sweat down there (ie after a workout).\u00a0\u00a0When itching, it is the most wonderful sensation and it is hard to stop scratching, however, when I am done scratching it hurts from cracking.\u00a0\u00a0While scratching it seems that part of the area flakes off, causing what looks like dandruff on my hand.I have attached a picture of what the area looks like.Please, anyone, please advise!Thank you for your time in reading my post.",
