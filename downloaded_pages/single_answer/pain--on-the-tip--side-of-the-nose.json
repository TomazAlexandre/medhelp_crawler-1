    "question": "I have been experiencing this pain on and off for abt two weeks; dont know what causes it. The nose becomes painful to even the mildest touch. No evidence of sores / pimples (even internal); no bleeds, no nothing! I have so far just willed it to go; apparently it (the pain) is stronger on will power coz it just keeps coming back. The current cycle is over 4 days - the longest yet. I will now have to seek medical advice.\u00a0\u00a0Any thing on offer?",
