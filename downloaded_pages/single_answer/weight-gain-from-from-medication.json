            "answer": "You were severely underweight, as you stated you weighted 100lbs and 5'9 height. Gaining of 40 lbs is good and you are still about 15lbs underweight for your height (160lbs), You gained muscle due to your good nutrition habits, vegan. You mentioned your issues with the medication, and I suggest you go to your MD about it. Thank you for your question.",

    "question": "Hello,I think there might be an underlying cause to many of my symptoms (listed below), but I don't know what. I'm a 24 year old male. I'm 5'9'' and weigh about 140 lbs. However, before I started effexor two years ago, I weighed about 100 lbs and was the same height. I gained about 40 lbs after being on the drug for 6 months. I started taking 75mg then gradually increased to 375mg before going back to 300mg. My BMI was 14.8. The real kicker is that almost all (if not all) of the 40 lbs I gained came on as muscle! (I am currently taking 300 mg of effexor with 50 mg of Wellbutrin).(This is not at all common! Most people just put on fat!)Here are my symptoms: fatigue, depression, anxiety, lethargy, constipation (IBS supposedly), putrid gas, muscle weakness, weak immune system, growth hormone count of .04ng/ml (nanograms/millilter) [on the low end but not \"deficient\"--The 'normal' range is between .01-.97 ng/mL], some symptoms of rickets (large dent or groove on top of skull and mild genu valgum), very low motivation, confusion, lack of focus, and sensitivity to medication (I need less and it works faster, with the exception of effexor).Somethings to consider: I was prescribed prednisone frequently when I was younger for asthma. I haven't taken any prednisone since I was 16 or 17. I also took inhaled steriods for intermittent periods of time and I would frequently use a nebulizor and an albuterol inhaler. There is no family history of any disease or mental illness in my family except for type II Diabetes and Asthma on my Dad's side. I'm a vegan, but I'm conscious about my nutrition, so I doubt I'm deficient in anything nutrition-wise and my blood tests, though not extensive, would seem to agree. Even my sisters, who were shorter than me, weighed more than me and were at a normal weight, and my Dad was not a skinny guy either, so it's unlikely that my previously low weight was due to typical genetic variance. I gained weigh in proportion to how much effexor I was taking.",
