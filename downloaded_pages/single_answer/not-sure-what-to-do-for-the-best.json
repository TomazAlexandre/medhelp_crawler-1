    "question": "I'm a 24 year old male who has been on Prednisolone since 1997.I take 8mg @ day. On a typical day, I find it extremely hard to wake up. As soon as I take the Prednisolone after a carbohydrate breakfast (3 or 4 slicesof toast usually), my vision becomes blurred, I also feel spaced out and panicky almost, and I feel lethargic and teasy for the rest ofthe day. And then as soon as evening comes, I feel fine again.My hands and legs tremble, and I can't hold a conversation with someone because I fell really strange sometimes too.If I take the steroids every other day, my mood seems to be better, and I sleep well, but I then have the problem of Hypoglycaemia (even though I havn't been diagnosed with diabetes, the range has been as low as 2.2, and as high as 11.3)Here are a few reasons why I think this problem is related to my adrenal glands:I have been on Prednisolone intermittently for nearly ten years.I suffer from continual nausea, recurring infections, low mood nearly all of time.I don't exercise, and am very inactive, because I just feel far too fatigued.My diet consists of refined carbohydrates, sugar, fats etc - all the bad stuff, because I have an Ileostomy, and can't eat all the'super foods', e.g nuts, seeds etc, because I might get a bowel obstruction which I have had to deal with a few times previously.I'm aware that it involves the HPA Axis too. And am wondering if my symptoms could be related to prolonged inactivity of it?",
