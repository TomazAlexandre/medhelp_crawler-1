            "answer": "You have taken the correct step in getting an appointment with an endo. I know you are worried, but at this point there is nothing else you can do. Yes, often people with diabetes have an initial period where there bodies are still producing insulin. Blood sugars over 200 are a definite red flag so you are doing the right thing by getting her evaluated. Good luck and let us know how it goes.",

    "question": "My 14-month-old girl is only in the third percentile for her weight. Her pediatrician and I cannot figure out why she is not gaining weight. She recently leveled off on her growth chart. She eats and eats and never seems to get full. I have also recently noticed that when her diapers are wet, they are VERY wet. I do notice these may be diabetes symptoms and have recently started checking her blood sugars. Here is the deal, one evening before dinner I check her sugar and it was high at 201. About an hour later I checked it again, and it was 227. I hadn't really heard about the \"honeymoon phase\" until I logged on to this website, so I am wondering if this could be the honeymoon phase, or if you have to have been recently put on insulin or dx with diabetes to have this. Ninety-ninety-five percent of the time she is normal, but occassionaly she is high. Her pediatrician is now going to refer her to an endocrinologist, but who knows how long it'll take to get her in. I am just wanting some answers and advice.PLEASE HELP! I'm making myself sick over this.Sincrely,worried mommy",
