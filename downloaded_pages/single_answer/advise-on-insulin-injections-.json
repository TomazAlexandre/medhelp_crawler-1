    "question": "HiI have 2 weeks ago been put on insulin injection to manage type II diabetes which was not well managed on pills for 14 years. They needed to do this pre-surgery so that I have good sugar control before having my thyroid removed.I have a question on the injections that he won't answer for me (my endo).My endo just says \"Do it the way I told you to\", but I know there has to be some room for slack in this new regiments, isnt' there?I take 6 units of Novo Rapid at breakfast at 7:30 , 4 units at lunch at 12:00 and 6 units at dinner at 5:#0 and then 22 units of Lantus a bedtime 9:30 with a snack.My question is this: How do I adjust the times and the doses? For example, to day is mother's day. My family brought me breakfast in bed but it was 8:30 by the time they had it ready which means I didn't do my breakfast injection at 7:30 and waited until 8:30. So now do I have to push lunch off by 1 hour because of how long the Nov Rapid peaks and lasts???Also tonight we are going to my mother in law's for dinner. There will be cake as we are celebrating mother's day and a birthday. Can I have cake? Do I adjust my 6 units of Novo Rapid because I will eat cake?I mean, this doesn't seem right to me. I don't eat the same breakfast every day, so how come I take 6 units every breakfast? Same with dinner, what if tonight it's salad with chicken but tomorrow it's chicken and rice and bread? Isn't the carb count different so I'd have to adjust the insulin?If anyone knows how to do this, I would really appreciate hearing from you!Many thanks",
