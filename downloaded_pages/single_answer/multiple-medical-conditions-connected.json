    "question": "Hello, I have something going on with my body! It may or may not be all connected, but it seems to have occurred all around the same time. All of the sudden, I have endometriosis which is painful and has attached to my colon, causing pain and bleeding during menstruation, but I am on oral contraceptives to help this. I have painful cysts in my breasts which will not resolve. I have symptoms of diabetes insipidus, but nephrogenic DI has been rule out by the nephrologist. I have been on a strict weight loss program for 8 weeks and have not lost any weight (by the way, I am a dietitian). My TSH level is normal, but no other tests have been done. I have constant yeast issues, not limited to vaginal yeast infections. I have a hx of HPV, but have been \"normal\" for years. I have been on elimination diets and seem to be mildly more comfortable with the elimination of wheat and corn. Does ANYBODY have anything to help me? I have been reading clinical studies, and it appears that this could all possibly to connected to the Neuro Hypophysis, but I don't have enough medical knowledge to fully understand this.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody seems to believe me, but psych issues have been ruled out! I don't get it! Please help!",
