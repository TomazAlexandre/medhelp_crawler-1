            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0Since your grandmother's primary tumor is 2 cm in size, she really should have the radiation after the lumpectomy (in accordance to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network or NCCN practice guidelines).\u00a0\u00a0This will indeed help lessen her chances of recurrence.\u00a0\u00a0If your grandmother is in relatively good health and is expected to live for another 10-15 years if not for the cancer, then I really think she should take the option of radiation.\u00a0\u00a0Since her estrogen sensitivity is only 40%, taking femara alone may not be as effective in preventing cancer relapse in the next 10 years, and I would be more assured of preventing recurrence if she had radiation treatment.",

    "question": "Hello,My grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer about a month ago and had a lumpectomy 2 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0They also did a biopsy of the sentinel node.\u00a0\u00a0Margins are clear and no other cancer has been found.\u00a0\u00a0She will be starting Femara soon.\u00a0\u00a0She has been seen by two separate oncologists (and members of their teams).\u00a0\u00a0While they both agree on the Femara, they disagree on whether or not she needs to have radiation therapy.\u00a0\u00a0One recommends it while the other says it's an option but doesn't think it's necessary if getting the treatment will affect my grandmother's quality of life.\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother is old-world and just wants her doctors to tell her what is good for her and she will do it.\u00a0\u00a0So, they decision is more or less left up to her family (including me).I lean towards her getting radiation now while my uncle would rather \"save it for when it is needed\" (since she can only have radiation in the same area once in her life).\u00a0\u00a0Here is the info we have for her:age:\u00a0\u00a078general health:\u00a0\u00a0good, no dz (other than the cancer), no heart/cholesterol/diabetes problems, expected to live a healthy and long liferemoved breast lump size:\u00a0\u00a02 cmestrogen sensitivity:\u00a0\u00a0approx. 40% (not sure what this means, but quoting MD who thinks she should have radiation)My understanding is that without radiation, there is a 15-20% chance of reocurrence.\u00a0\u00a0Is this true?\u00a0\u00a0Also, how much would this percentage decrease if she does have radiation now?\u00a0\u00a0I was told that without radiation, she is \"good for another 10 years\".\u00a0\u00a0What about after the 10 years?\u00a0\u00a0God-willing, she can live past her 80s (my grandfather is well into his 100s).It seems to me that, considering that the side affects of radiation are less compared to other forms of cancer treatment/prevention, the only real issue would be a logistical one and my grandmother's convenience (she will have to go to the MD 5 days a week for 6 weeks).\u00a0\u00a0I think this is worth it, but I'm concerned about the idea that she will not be able to have radiation again later should it re-occur.\u00a0\u00a0Is that enough of a reason to not have it now?I'd appreciate whatever guidance or clarification you can provide in this matter.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much!",
