            "answer": "Hello,This can be due to urinary tract infection. Symptoms of UTI are frequent urination, burning sensation during urination, passing of blood in urine and even fever. The most common causes of repeated UTIs are kidney stones and diabetes mellitus.Making a diagnosis of a urinary tract infection includes performing a urinalysis test, which checks for the presence of pus, white blood cells, and bacteria in the urine, which point to a urinary tract infection. A urine culture and sensitivity is usually performed to find the exact microorganism that is causing the infection and to determine the most effective antibiotic to treat it. Your doctor needs to repeat a culture sensitivity test of the urine to prescribe the best possible antibiotic so that the infection does not come back.Till that time drink plenty of water and fluids to flush out the toxins. If the symptoms persist then consult a urologist and get other causes ruled out.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
