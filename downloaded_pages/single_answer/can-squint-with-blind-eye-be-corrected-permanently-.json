    "question": "Hello doctor,I am 29 years old now. I am type 1 diabetic since last 19 years and on diabetic medicines now. 19 years back I was suffered with high fever and detected with diabetes. Due to high fever and diabetic complications, i also lost my left eyesight with optical nerve damage and developed squint in the left eye. I have refereed with so many ophthalmologist for squint correction/removal but all of them told me that squint can be removed but there is no vision in eye so it will get back to squinted position after 2-3 years. Can squint be corrected permanently?",
