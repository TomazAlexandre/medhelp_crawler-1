            "answer": "Dear JPfred,I am not a medical professional, so I cannot give you any advice except from my experiences of being a mom to a 15 year old who was diagnosed at the age of 21 months.\u00a0\u00a0What I can do, however, is share some thoughts based on the information you've supplied.The first question that comes to mind is, have you been trying to lose weight?\u00a0\u00a0The joint pain (or lack of it) could possibly be the result of your weight loss, causing less stress on the joint or joints. I totally agree with you and want to encourage you to see your doctor for some blood work.\u00a0\u00a0The frequent thirst and urination are classic signs of diabetes, but at this point, you need to begin the process of elimination first and go from there.\u00a0\u00a0Make that appointment ASAP so you can get some answers and post again to let us know how you make out.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you!",

    "question": "I am a 63 year old male and as of the last 2 months have loss 15lbs. I was a bit over wieght at 200 lbs and should be approximately 170 lbs for my height of 5'-7\". I am thirsty more than usual and of course need to urinate much more frequently and urgently. I have over the past 5 years or so also expreienced authritus pain in my joints. The reason that I mention this is that these pains have gone away and I am feeling great. I have lots of energy and and sleep well. There are no other sysmptoms. Eventhough I am happy about my weightloss and feeling good,I am going to schedule a doctors apponitment to have blood tests. I am concerned that the thirst and wieghtloss may be diabtes. What do you think?JPfred",
