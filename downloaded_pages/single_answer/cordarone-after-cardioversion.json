    "question": "Posted By Heather on April 01, 1999 at 14:24:38:My Mom ( 69 years old) was recently diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure(left atrial fib.) in January.She was found to also have diabetes. She had an echocardiogram and was put on Warfarin along with diabeta ,vasotec, lasix etc.. On Feb. 7 she suffered a major stroke ( left side paralysis) and has made a fair recovery from that so far. On Mar. 31 she had a cardioversion done . Her Doctor has put her on cordarone(200 mg).I have read quite a bit on cardarone and I am concerned about the side effects and outcome of long term use.What are the outcomes of using this medication? Are the side effects as serious as what I have been reading? Even her Doctor mentioned that a serious side effect is sudden death.Also, will she need another cardioversion? I was not sure that you can have another.Thank youHeather",
