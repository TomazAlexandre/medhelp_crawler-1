            "answer": "Hi,Usually coronary artery blockage is seen in people aged over 50 years, but can occur in younger people also. Some of the risk factors which can lead to coronary artery disease are strong family history, hyperlipidemia, smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, peripheral artery disease etc. With CABG, occlusion in one branch of the arteries that supply to the heart would have been corrected, but there is a chance that other arteries could also be occluded either completely or partially. Your angiogram report can provide information on this.You need to keep a watch on your weight, follow diet restriction and exercise regime avoid unhealthy habits and get regular follow up with your cardiologist for ensuring good health.
