            "answer": "Thyroid is not likely cause of diabetes.If the thyroid function is now over-active on this low dose of synthroid would consider stopping the synthroid and rechecking after 6 weeks -- if high (ie low TSH) - then I-123 nuclear scan to see if the nodule(s) are over-functioning.\u00a0\u00a0If so, then Radioactive I-131 treatment could shrink the nodules (as opposed to surgery).\u00a0\u00a0Short of that, there is not currently another non-surgical approach to solid nodules.The cough may be related to the nodules - but remember, there are many causes of cough, so the presence of large nodules may not be the cause and removing/treating the nodules may or may not resolve the cough.",

    "question": "I have had a cough for about six months and seen many specialists who have concluded that my I multiple thyroid nodules and the recommendation from two doctors was to remove my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I am very nervous about the surgery and would like to know if I don't do the surgery if there is any way the nodules will shrink and I could avoid the surgery.I have taken Synthroid .05 mg for the last 20 years for an underactive thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Recent blood tests now indicate that my thryroid function is now over active and I should stop taking Synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0Could the nodules be the cause of the change in bloodwork?I am a 50 year old woman who also recently have been diagnosed with being pre diabetic and prescribed Metformin and Byetta 10.\u00a0\u00a0Could the thyroid be the cacuse of the diabetes?Could you please give me some insight in helping make my decision.Thank you",
