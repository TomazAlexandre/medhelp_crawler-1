    "question": "My 16 year old has been extremely exhausted recently (12 hours isn't enough) and a bit grumpy/depressed. She eats a lot but has always been very very thin (5'6 and weighs 101) Today after school, she took a long nap and when she came downstairs she said she felt really \"weird\". I don't know why, but I decided to test her glucose with my monitor and after not having eaten for 4 hours, it was 111.\u00a0\u00a0I thought this seemed a bit high, so 90 minutes after she finished her dinner, I did another test and it was 99 which was much better.\u00a0\u00a0I had a horrible time getting any blood out of her fingers, even on a higher setting on the finger ***** thingy, not sure if that's related or not.She said she doesn't pee or drink an unusual amount, so I'm not sure if I'm overreacting.\u00a0\u00a0Her sister was diagnosed with mono 2 months ago, so I'm also wondering if she's got a milder case of it or something.Should I monitor her for another day and see what her levels are?",
