            "answer": "Make sure your therapist specializes in treating anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0You're a bit beyond the age when chronic mental illness breaks out, but anything can happen.\u00a0\u00a0But given your age, I'd really try to think about what might have happened around six weeks ago or earlier that started this way of thinking from taking over your life.\u00a0\u00a0Then you can work on it with your therapist.\u00a0\u00a0But again, if your therapist doesn't know how to work on the way you think, you could be in for a long long time in therapy without necessarily getting better -- most therapists don't specialize in treating anxiety so they're not well versed in how to teach you techniques to get control over this.\u00a0\u00a0As for your doc thinking it's \"paranoia,\" what's that?\u00a0\u00a0You're not describing psychosis.\u00a0\u00a0It's an anxiety problem.",

    "question": "Hi everyone, I'm a 30 year old female who started having panic attacks about 6 weeks ago out of nowehere. My PCP thinks it's paranoia and that I'll be fine. In the last month I have diagnosed myself with cancer, hiv, other stds, diabetes, and now I have somehow convinced myself I have MS I started having a tingling feeling all over my body yesterday but went away when I relaxed and got into bed and started again in the morning. Not painful just slight tingles all over. I know this is all in my head. I have always been so strong and dependent and healthy. My life is good, my family is healthy and my boyfriend is wonderful but somehow I find myself paralyzed with fear when I think about my future. I keep thinking that something bad will happen.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to go back to being normal. I realize my irrational thinking but I sit at a desk for 11 hours with nothing to do but think and google (terrible I know) I've seen my pcp, done blood work, etc and all fine. I am also seeing a therapist. Sorry for venting but it makes me feel better to know I'm not alone.",
