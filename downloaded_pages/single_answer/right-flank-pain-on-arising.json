    "question": "And statement. I did not join what seemed to be a self and other help forum to be lured into the world of \"ask me a medical question for a fee.\" If this is what this group is about, please dismiss me and forgive me for wasting your time.I Have pain right flank on arising and it recedes after being up and about. Being a pain specialist (hospice and palliative care) and one who pays attention, I seek and offer assistance in slaying this persistent dragon of flank/rib/side pain on arising. I am overweight and believe this is partly to blame. I'll get to the point and be blunt. After having a bowel movement, cleaning myself is a bit of a chore and I noticed this pain beginning as it became more and more difficult to wipe after defecating.I am right handed and the pain is on my right side. I am\u00a0\u00a0on a weight loss program and trust this will offer some relief. Obesity presents a myriad of problems one of which is type II diabetes. Mine is reasonably well controlled with diet and exercise but I could do better. sleeping in a recliner\u00a0\u00a0minimizes the pain. Hope this information is helpful.Wayne Earl",
