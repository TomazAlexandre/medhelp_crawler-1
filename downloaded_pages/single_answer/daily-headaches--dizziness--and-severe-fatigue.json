    "question": "I am a 19 year old female. I have daily severe headaches. I also have extreme fatigue, dizziness, double vision, and nausea(sometimes vomiting). I have seen lots of doctors, and had lots of testing, with no answers. It has become very debilitating to me to the point that I had to quit college because I couldn't keep up. My other health issues include diabetes, high blood pressure, polycystic ovarian disease, chronic back and neck pain, tachycardia, high cholesterol, clinical depression. Any advice would be wonderful!",
