    "question": "Continuing with previous question regarding vomiting in Diabetes 2 patient --- My dad is showing the same symptoms! Further complicated by being a kidney transplant survivor. He has a gastrologist, plus the kidney dr, plus an endocrinist assigned to his case. He recently was dx'd as gastroparetic and put on Reglan. THat worked for about 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0He then started vomiting again .... After admission for the recurrence of the vomiting, and some tests, he developed a mild UTI. They found an inguinal hernia but won't/can't repair it until the UTI is cleared up and he gets vomiting under control. They seem to be at a total loss as to what is causing the vomiting. They are doing some tests now related to the Ciclosporine he takes for kidney transplant, but since he has been on that for 15 years, I am having a hard time accepting that.\u00a0\u00a0Really do sense head-scratching .... Any further suggestions I can send their way? They finally did an endoscopy today, no esophogeal blockage.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/390683\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/390683</a>.",
