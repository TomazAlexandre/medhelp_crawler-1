    "question": "I am a 52 year old CF patient who has diabetes and had a double lung transplant 10 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0In July 2011 I had surgery to my left wrist for de quervains disease.\u00a0\u00a0After the operation I noticed I could not smell or taste.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0hampered my doctors and after three months they decided to send me for a CT scan.\u00a0\u00a0It showed that I had chronic pansinusitus.\u00a0\u00a0The ENT specialist said that he could operate but it could make my sinus worse.\u00a0\u00a0I have never sufferered from sinus in my 52 years, except the loss of smell and taste after the hand surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I finally had my sinus operation, they relieved the (puss) and also scraped my bone away and also took out some pollyps.\u00a0\u00a0It has now been nearly 1 year since the operation and I cannot still smell or taste.\u00a0\u00a0This is really getting me down, as I never appreciate eating, so am inclined to not eat sometimes which is not good for cystic fibrosis, as my weight is hard to keep on.\u00a0\u00a0It is also very dangerous with being immunosuppressed that I could easily have food poisoning with spoilt food.\u00a0\u00a0I am very careful with what I eat, but it is equally hard when you cannot smell and taste.I need help, the doctors have just said I have to live with it......\u00a0\u00a0Im sure they would think of something or do something if they could not smell or taste...Please if you have any ideas, I would appreciate your input......",
