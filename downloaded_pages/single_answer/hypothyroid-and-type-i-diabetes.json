    "question": "since there is an autoimmune link between type I and hypothyroid problems, would it be possible to be at risk for type I diabetes if you are hypothyroid?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed as hypothyroid in 1983, and developed type I diabetes in 2002.\u00a0\u00a0There was never a test for thyroid antibodies done until recently I had a Thyroid peroxidase antibodies indicating 225IU/ML-ten times the normal range. This would indicate (to me, and I could be wrong) that I have Autoimmune Thyroid disease, and have had for 25+ years.\u00a0\u00a0Could this have lead to me getting type I?",
