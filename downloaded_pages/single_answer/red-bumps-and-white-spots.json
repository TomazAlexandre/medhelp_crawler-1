            "answer": "Hi,The burning sensation could indicate urinary tract infection. could you post the test results here?There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.Fungal infections are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "My scrotum is covered in redness (completely). There are small bumps where hair is growing out. Also there are white spots on my penis at the base. I can't tell if these spots are where hair are coming in, though it appears it could be the case.I have gone to doctors about thsi before. Once for a blood test, and the doctor asked after seeing the blood test results if there was a burning sensation when urinating. At the time, it did not, but later it did.Now I'm wondering if this is even a skin condition?",
