    "question": "I begin taking depo in Sept 2011 after suffering a miscarriage. Because I was so devastated( I lost a son at 3 mos old who was born with an undetected congenital heart defect), I didn't want to try again and face the same problems plus I was newly diabetic and felt that I should allow myself to heal and learn the ins and outs of diabetes so the shot seemed ideal. I only had 3 shots total. Sept 21, Dec 23, and Mar 22. I stopped after suffering some bone density issues, lack of appetite. I was horrified at the withdrawals my body went through, constantly feeling pregnant, going to the docs and made to feel batty when explaining my story. My new doctor finally told me to ride the wave back to normalcy and that in most cases it take6-18 mos to get your cycle back. Today marks the first day of my menstrual cycle in over a year and a half. Now that my period has returned can I expect to be ovulating as well, or does that take longer still? My husband and I want to try for another son, the sooner the better. Any help would be so greatly appreciated.",
