    "question": "I am post transplant (liver and kidney) 8 yrs ago. I have type one diabetes. I have episodes of cholangitis. I have acute arthritis in both knees and surgery has been delayed due to cellulitis, which regularly flares up with infection. I\u00a0\u00a0am morbidly obese still with no opportunity to exercise due to arthritis. My anti rejection tablets leave me vulnerable to infection, and all this and more means a life plagued with clinical depression which gets greatly enhanced on a regular basis. Fearing that I might not have time to finish this letter, in your opinion what is a realistic prognosis of my life expectancy.",
