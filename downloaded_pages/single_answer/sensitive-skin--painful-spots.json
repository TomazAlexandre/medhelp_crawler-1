            "answer": "Hi!If neurological causes have been ruled out, then this could be an allergic reaction to bra material which has spread to neighboring areas. It could also be an infection under skin called cellulitis. You need to rule out diabetes as this metabolic disease predisposes to allergy and infection. Calamine lotions and other over the counter preparations with camphor/menthol may help reduce the sensitivity. If they do, then in all probability this is an allergic reaction. Please discuss this with your treating doctor. The possibility of shingles should be re-investigated if allergy/infection is ruled out. Take care!",
