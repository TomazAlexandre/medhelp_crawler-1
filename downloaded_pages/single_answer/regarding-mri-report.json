            "answer": "Hi there,A detailed clinical history and examination findings are very important before arriving at a diagnosis. It is important to correlate test results clinically. The differential diagnosis of white matter lesions varies based on the age of the patient. In adult patients with a history of\u00a0\u00a0diabetes mellitus, essential hypertension (high blood pressure), dyslipidemia (high cholesterol), current or past heavy smokers these white matter lesions can represent small vessel disease .Other possibilities are vasculitis,migraine,multiple sclerosis etc.It is best to follow up with your neurologist for further diagnosis and work up. Keep me posted.Best luck and kind regards!",
