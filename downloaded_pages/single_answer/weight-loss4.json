            "answer": "Hi there,You should eat a diet which contains more of green leafy vegetables, fruits and protein and less of spaghetti, potato etc. Cut down on pastas, burgers, sweets, cold drinks.\u00a0\u00a0It is best to eat lots of fruits and non-starchy green veggies, go slow on fats, eat carbohydrates in moderation and increase your protein intake. Drink plenty of water and non fattening fluids such as clear soups etc. Common causes of weight gain like overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, and hypothyroidism have to be ruled out in your case. You have already been having the problem of water retention .It is one of the causes of weight gain. Exercise regularly. You need to change your lifestyle. A calculative and disciplinary approach will definitely be helpful. Do write to me again.Best of luck and regards!",
