            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Memory loss can be triggered by sleep disorders. In another post you mention that you snore and are always tired. I think that there is a possibility that you have a sleep problem and nothing more serious. Please consult a sleep specialist to start with. Certain types of epilepsies and seizures too cause short term memory loss along with tiredness or fatigue. Chronic infections too are known to precipitate memory loss. For this you can try yoga and meditation. Disorders of the hypothalamus, chronic fatigue syndrome andpsychiatric disorders like depression too cause similar symptoms.The enumerated the possibilities should be ruled out one by one. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
