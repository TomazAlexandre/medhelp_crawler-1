    "question": "For a few months now I have been having some odd things happen with my health.\u00a0\u00a0I saw my regular doctor in January who said he wasn\u2019t sure what was going on with me, but he suspected it was either an adrenal or hormone problem.\u00a0\u00a0He referred me to an endocrinologist, and said that based on my symptoms, he was leaning towards a diagnosis or hypothyroidism. He had me do a few tests first and found that my thyroid levels were all within normal limits, my calcium was slightly elevated, my carbon dioxide was low and my glucose was slightly high.\u00a0\u00a0My results were:Calcium: 10.3 Retest: 10.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Range 8.6-10.2)Carbon Dioxide: 17 Retest: 21\u00a0\u00a0 (Range 21-33)Glucose: 129\u00a0\u00a0Had OGTT that was all normalFree T3: 325\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Range 230-420)Free T4: 1.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Range .8-1.8)TSH, 3rd Generation: 2.27\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Range .4-4.5)The endocrinologist didnt say much other than he wanted to run some tests and we would go from there.\u00a0\u00a0He is now on vacation and wont be back for 10 days, so it will be at least that long until I get any results back from those tests.\u00a0\u00a0I know he wanted all sex hormones checked, cortisol, my cholestorol, something binding globulin and other things I dont remember.Last year my gyno had my thyroid tested just to get a baseline.\u00a0\u00a0My TSH at the time was .97(Range .34-4.82)\u00a0\u00a0and my Free T4 was .77 (Range .77-1.61) so there has been an increase in both in less than a year.\u00a0\u00a0I was also told then that I had excess androgens.I am 27 years old and I have an 11 year old daughter with type 1 diabetes and my father and brother were both diagnosed with high blood pressure in their early 20's. Given the increase in my levels, could it be that I could be developing hypothroidism?\u00a0\u00a0Would it be a good idea to have my thyroid levels checked again since it was January the last time they were checked or should I wait longer?",
