    "question": "I've been experiencing burning in both legs for about 9 months, now also have muscle twitching in both legs. One week ago, started experiencing pain in the left shin and left side of leg. Lupus and MS have been ruled out. When pressing on leg, no additional pain is felt. Have been diagagnosed with neuropathy and am on neurontin and amitryptaline and have now added in skelaxin for the shin pain. MRI's have ruled out anything going on with the brain or leg. Any clues???",
