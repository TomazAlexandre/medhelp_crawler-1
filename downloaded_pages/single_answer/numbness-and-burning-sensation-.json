    "question": "Over the past few weeks I have developed a burning, numbing sensation in the top center portion of my head (no where else). It started out sporadic but has increased to almost constant over a 4 week period, becoming more intense. I have gone to a MD who had no clue what it could be and to a chiropractor who did all the usually procedures but was unable to stop it. I am worried that it could be something serious. There is a history of medical illnesses in my family (MS, Diabetes, Cancer, etc.) Should I see a neurologist proto?",
