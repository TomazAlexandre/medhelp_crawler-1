            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possible causes that may need to be considered include low blood sugar/ diabetes, cardiovascular causes such as arrhythmias, metabolic disorders, vascular issues, hypotension, dehydration, medication side effect, psychological causes such as stress etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an internist initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
