            "answer": "Yes, you have signs of diabetes that may include cardio issues too.\"I love sweets.\"A lot of people do and most practice restraint and common sense.\"I have an unbelievable urge to devour what I can get my hands on.\"This is a psychological problem. If you can't control your urge I suggest you seek professional help.\"I feel physically drained, unable to think, unable to judge, non responsive to questions asked, and I normally pass out.\"If you continue on this road of destruction one day you might not wake up. These are very dangerous warning signs that your body is not accepting your behavior. You really need to see a doctor ASAP and get your glucose tested. Medication can help control your glucose but then you must also curb your sweet binges. And, please DON'T get behind the wheel of automobile and drive for eventually you may injure yourself let alone cause the death of an innocent child.Good luck.",
