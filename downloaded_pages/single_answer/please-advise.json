    "question": "I am a 42+ female married having a 18 year old son. My husband has been using a male condom for the last six years and now I will like to switch over to Ovral-L (a female contraceptive pill) for the next six months. I had taken this once earlier about six years ago. I do not have any history of BP, diabetes or heart related disease nor am I obese. Will there be any future complications if I start taking pills at my age??",
