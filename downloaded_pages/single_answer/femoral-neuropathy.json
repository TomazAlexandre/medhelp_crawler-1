            "answer": "Hi.Can you clear something up with regards to the timeline of your condition as I am a little bit confused. When was the diagnosis of femoral neuropathy made and when did your orthopedic doctor say that the neuropathy is caused by the disc herniation?You are correct in saying that, technically, a femoral neuropathy (or mononeuropathy) is not a result of disc herniation or degenerative disc disease. However, both conditions can, indeed, cause the symptoms you have been experiencing.Did you suffer any trauma or surgery that would have possibly injured the femoral nerve? Are the herniated discs causing significant compression to the spinal cord or nerve roots that might have caused your symptoms? Without any history of trauma, surgery, diabetes or aneurysms, and if with significant imaging findings of disc herniations, it would probably be more likely that what is causing your condition is neuropathy due to disc herniations.Go ahead with the consult with your neurosurgeon and see what he/she has to say about this.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with Femoral Neuropathy after 2 months of consistant pain from my hips to my ankels in both legs when sitting, standing or lying down.1 1/2 years ago I had a C3-C7 fusion with 3 discs replaced because of severe head, neck, and shoulder pain for 6 years. The orthopedic Dr. said the cause of my neuropathy is bulging/herniated discs in my L2-L3 and referred me to my neurosurgeon.Today I read on your forum that femoral neuropathy is not a result of DDD or herniated/bulging discs? What is the cause then?, could this be\u00a0\u00a0a wrong diagnosis? I have a future appt with my neurosurgeon but would like to know your opinion.",
