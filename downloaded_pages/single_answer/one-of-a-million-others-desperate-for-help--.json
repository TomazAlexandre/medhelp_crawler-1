            "answer": "Hi!I am really sorry to hear about all this. I am not sure how I can help you, since apparently you are doing the right diet and exercise schedule. But chemotherapy drugs coupled with hypothyroidism can cause havoc.\u00a0\u00a0See if you can consult your doctor to run tests to rule out other conditions which can cause similar situation. These include worms in stool, depression, anorexia nervosa, AIDS, cancers especially colon cancers, , infections, irritable bowel syndromes, and malabsorption syndromes as are seen in intestinal tuberculosis, HIV, tropical sprue, parasites in stool and Whipple\u2019s Disease. Diabetes too can be the cause. Also your current thyroid status needs to be evaluated. Definitely, you need to see an endocrine specialist.Take care!",

    "question": "Looking for the last couple of years for the same help, finding the same answers.... I'll still take a shot in the dark here. Six years ago I was diagnosed with \"hypothyroidism\", no biggie right? The kicker is that my docs refused to send me to an endocrinologist and in LESS THAN 2 yrs I gained 210lbs. Diagnosed with papillary carcinoma 09, TT, lost 210lbs. Now I am on H.U.D., bad credit, Social Security, whole 9. Question is who has enough heart/money a/o time to do some WELL NEEDED, and I might add well deserved reconstructive surgery pro bono. I'm literally wasting away underneath despite my healthy eating/living. Look big but I'm just \"deflated\". Its starting to show in my face now so at 36 Im gettin spooked, and yes, feelin a little hopeless. It impedes my workouts(tummy/thighs)and has all but eradicated my sense of femininity(breasts and buttocks have withered away as much as can) and the 8 inch hanging flaps under my arms are VERY disconcerting when my arms are only about 6 inches wide. At 5'10\" its a hot mess to look at, and although I sound as though I'm making light of it, it is excruciatingly painful emotionally and very uncomfortable physically. In clothes I would appear average but I feel hideously deformed. I'm not talking about a couple inches, it's well beyond the average case. I reeeaally need help even though it sounds like simple vanity, it goes so much deeper and I would go to any length to get the help I need. I know I'm 1 of a huge amount of others in the same boat but I'm to the point of feeling desperate. Please help!!!",
