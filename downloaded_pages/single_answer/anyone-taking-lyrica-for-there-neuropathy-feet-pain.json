            "answer": "I take Lyrica 75 mg twice daily (that would be 150 mg daily) for low back nerve pain.\u00a0\u00a0Very disabling discomfort, can't lean over, so I can't do hardly anything without my medicine.\u00a0\u00a0I also happen to have very painful feet, and it just so happens Lyrica numbs my feet up to where they rarely hurt now.\u00a0\u00a0I weigh 160 pounds, that dose is all I need.One thing you can try with Lyrica, is if you will cut back a little for two days, once or twice a month, the numbing effect improves (if you think it worked for a while but now does not).\u00a0\u00a0Another thing, could be if you just take it once a day, and you notice your feet hurt 12 hours later, that's about when the medicine begins to wear off, altho it stays in your bloodstream a lot longer.\u00a0\u00a0So, if you're on your feet 12+ hours after your dose, could be you can change when you take it, or divide the dose so you can take it twice a day...just be real careful with walking and driving, as you probably already know.\u00a0\u00a0The reason your doc doesn't want to prescribe more is because you can get some tricky side effects, which include major vision disturbances.But if Lyrica never worked in the first place, I reckon your foot pain could also be an impingement on the sciatica nerve, which goes from your low back down into your feet, OR diabetes can also cause foot pain, so you could look into those possibilities as being an additional cause of your foot pain.\u00a0\u00a0One other thing, I know it's obvious, but you need to have good arch support in your shoes and wear some padded socks, soak them in a pan of warm water when you get home from work, and during lunch massage your feet to keep circulation going (might hurt, though, so go easy).Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0One other thing, I take a codeine medication for another disorder, and it works in good synergy with the Lyrica, so maybe my results are different from yours, I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0But the codeine doesn't do anything at all for my feet...they hurt and my low back hurt until I took the Lyrica.",
