            "answer": "Hi Candiwith3 and welcome to the forum,Please get tested for hypothyroid asap!Pregnant women with low thyroid function have a 400% increased risk of miscarriage, premature delivery and or low birth weight, in the 2nd trimester.Even sub-clinical low thyroid-this is the scary part: it is usually ignored by doctors!!!- is enough to put you at higher risk.Wait, it gets worse. Even if you carry to term, your baby will be affected by YOUR low thyroid function! It might not show up right away, but it will manifest later.There's more. Conventional testing for thyroid\u00a0\u00a0is flawed.Usually you get a blood test for TSH, T3 & T4 levels, which DO NOTnecessarily reflect accurately CELLULAR thyroid function.In other words, your doctor will say that your thyroid function is fine,while you might be hypothyroid, with the symptoms and the added risksI mentioned above.You may also do a search for hypothyroid type 2, just like in diabetes 2,for details, as this affects\u00a0\u00a0a large number of patients, who most of the time,go undiagnosed, under-diagnosed or even worse, MIS-DIAGNOSED!.An easy way to check for low thyroid function is to do on your own Dr. Barnes Basal Temperature Test. Just look it up and follow the simple instructions precisely!The only other accurate way to test, is to ask for Free T3, Free T4 andReverse T3.Finally, if you are experiencing chronic stress (could be inner or hidden stress), fatigue, anxiety, easily agitated or emotional, not sleeping well at night and have lower than normal body temperature, lower blood pressure,then you may have low adrenal function, which should be treated before the low thyroid function (hypothyroid secondary).The best doctors, with the least amount of controversy, delays, protocols, politics and other medical \"bleep\", to help you with this are NDs and Functional Medicine Doctors who are trained in this field (endocrinology,hypoadrenalism and hypothyroidism).I hope this helps, however, there are other possibilities as well.This is not intended to replace medical advice.Take care and I wish you the best for a successful and uneventful pregnancy.Niko",
