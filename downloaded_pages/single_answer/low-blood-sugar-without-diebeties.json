            "answer": "Ask your primary doctor for a referral to an Endocrinologist, a doctor who trained and specializes with diabetes care and treatment, among other things. Discuss with the Endo about getting an A1c [HbA1c, HgbA1c] test, and having your thyroid and pancreas tested too. A misbehaving thyroid gland can cause hypoglycemia as it\u00a0\u00a0disrupts your pancreases insulin production. Good luck.",
