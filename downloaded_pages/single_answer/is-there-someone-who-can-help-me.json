            "answer": "Our institution excels at difficult cases and redo open heart surgery. If you would like to be evaluated by one of our cardiologists call 216 444 2200 during normal business hours and ask for cardiology appointments. There are avenues of treatment which are available only at a large academic center that you may not know about that may obviate the need for repeat open heart surgery.",

    "question": "I'm a 66 yr male and have had so many things done to my heart. I have heart heart disease, coronary artery disease. I have several stints placed and several angioplastys, I've had 2 bypasses(a triple and a double), and i have a myocardial infarction. I also suffer from type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol. Ive been to several different cardiologists and other specialists. my current cardiologist has done the most for me than any other and even he now says there is nothing more that he a cardiologist can do for me. He says the only option left is another bypass. I refused due to the fact that it'd be the same crew who did my double and screwed it up. I need some help. is there anyone that knows another alternative to helping me other than open heart surgery? Or someone who's actually willing to touch such a complicated case?",
