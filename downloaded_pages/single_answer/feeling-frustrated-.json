            "answer": "I'm sorry. I am also measuring almost 3 weeks ahead. I passed the GD test but for some reason doctor is just telling me he's measuring big... My first baby I delivered vaginally and was told she would be about 7 pounds and she was 9. I'm afraid as well that I will need a c-section if he gets too big. I see my doctor tomorrow to see what she wants to do but I'm hoping there's something other then c-section as I'm super worried about having one. Anyways, I understand how it feels, and it ***** not knowing and worrying..",
