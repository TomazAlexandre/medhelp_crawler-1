            "answer": "Hi, is it a redundant loop? chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is a rare disorder that may be due to an underlying neuropathic disorder. Please check with your doctor to rule out diabetes. Diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy and affect the digestive system, leading to problems with digestion and elimination. Medications to promote motility may help in emptying the intestines by promoting motility. Regards.",

    "question": "I have a loop in my descending colon diagnosed through colonoscopy. I have constipation and have developed some really bad neuro issues. All neurological conditions have been ruled out. I started taking align probiotic even before the finding of my pseudo obstruction. It had helped tremendously with the numbness, tingling, and anxiety. Who knew all knew about the gut/brain relationship and the neurotransmitters that can be whacked if your flora is not in order. FYI I started with extreme symptoms after an acute pesticide exposure 17 months ago that evidentally wiped out my flora and stomach enzymes. It has been a nightmare!!!! Amazing how most docs have no clue what to do with people like me.",
