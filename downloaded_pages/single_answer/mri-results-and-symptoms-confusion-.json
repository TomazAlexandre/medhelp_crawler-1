            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Blurred vision can be due to glaucoma, refractive errors (near or far sightedness), diabetes, retinal detachment, optic stroke, infection or injury to eye, migraines, floaters, brain tumors, temporal arteritis or due to bleeding into the eye.So, if the blood vessels to eye are constricted and the inflammation markers are high then it could be temporal arteritis as well. ESR, CRP and other markers of inflammation should be done. High cholesterol can also cause FLAIR changes as reported on MRI. If you also have swollen feet, then different types of vasculitis should also be ruled out. Autoimmune disease should also be looked into.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Recently on a routine eye exam my eye dr felt I was having TIA episodes as my blood vessels in my eye were very constricted. My vision has been blurred and I briefly lost sight in my left eye. She reported to my family dr and I was sent for an MRI. MRI results are as follows3mm foci of FLAIR signal abnormality are noted in left frontal and left temporal subcortical white matterThe ventricles and suici\u00a0\u00a0are within normal limitsNo enhancing intracranial lesion is visualizedImpressionSmall focal FLAIR signal abnormality. Differential considerations include sequela of microvascular ischemic change, migraine, vasculitis, demyelinating diseaseThat is a lot of possibilities. How do I assure I am getting the right diagnosis?I am 45 years old I have high chlosterol but blood pressure is normalMy vision stays blurred and I also suffer from dry eyesI find myself consistently tiredMy feet always seem to be cold and I experience swings from hot to coldMy left ankle & foot stay swollenInflammation in blood tests is highAny thought or suggestions would be very much appreciated",
