            "answer": "HiSharp pain down an arm and numbness on finger tips can be due to a lot of causes like a disc herniation, stroke, hemorrhage, tumor, arteriovenous malformation , effect of some medication, peripheral neuropathy , hypothyroidism, cervical spine disorder, injury, diabetes, arthritis, HIV, lyme disease, etc.The exact diagnosis requires additional details such as any history of recent injury, raised cholesterol, raised BP, diabetes, cervical spondylosis or any other medical problems. I would advise that you should consult a neurologist with your past medical and neurological examination and tests like CT scan, MRI or lumbar puncture, as appropriate, would be able to diagnose your condition. You should take rest and avoid lifting any weights for the next few days.Do write in if you need some other information.Take care!",
