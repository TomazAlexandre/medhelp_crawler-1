            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Can you elaborate on the character and location of the headaches? If the coughing persisted, infectious causes should also be ruled out. Dizziness can be caused by a variety of conditions such as ear and eye issues, infection, or underlying medical conditions such as anemia, diabetes, and changes in blood pressure, to name\u00a0\u00a0few. If you experience pain behind your ears also, you may need to have this evaluated further by your doctor or by an ear specialist for proper diagnosis. Pain medications may help provide relief. Take care and do keep us posted",
