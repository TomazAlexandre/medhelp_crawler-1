            "answer": "If you are having panic attacks,have fibromyalgia and anxiety you may have a lower pain threshold and have pain. You had the gold standard to look for heart disease with the cath and it was normal. Your doctors need to look for other causes. You could also have depression which lowers pain threshold and is common in fibromyalgia.",
