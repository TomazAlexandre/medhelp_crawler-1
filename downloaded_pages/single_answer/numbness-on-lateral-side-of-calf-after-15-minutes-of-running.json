            "answer": "The numbness is due to compression of your blood supply or some nerve problem. the artery and the nerve may not be present near your extensor digitorium longus. They may be compressed by some other muscle, tendon etc. But before that be sure about your mineral content in your body, check your Diabetes state and also your hypertension. Have balanced diet and proper food before coming for exercising. If everything is fine, and after that also you are having these symptoms get yourself examined near an orthopaedician. Take care!",

    "question": "Does anyone know why I get a numbness on my lower leg after running?I get a numbness in my lower leg (exterior) after running for about 10 minutes. The muscle closest that I could find is the extensor digitorum longus. The numbness runs vertically up my leg. I have been inactive for a while and am now getting routine cardio in at the gym. I've noticed that I've had this problem now for about 5 years now. I've changed shoes about 4 times but the same thing happens. Could someone offer some tips and help.3 days ago - 18 hours left to answer.Additional DetailsI do stretch out and I don't believe it's a pinched nerve. I thought maybe it had to do with the placement of my foot. That maybe my foot is landing wrong or stepping at an angle. Any ideas?3 days agoAlso, it is not my calf. If you're facing forward the muscle that I'm referring to is on the left side of my left leg. (Very strange) It's a lateral muscle on my leg. See the reference above. thanks for all the input.3 days agoI'll feel it getting tired and runs vertically about 3 to 5 inches.",
