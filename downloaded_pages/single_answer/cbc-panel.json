            "answer": "I had many many CBCs going through anal cancer treatment.\u00a0\u00a0The only reason I ever looked @ them was because my sis thought I should.\u00a0\u00a0Frankly, I was too ill with chemo and radiation to care.\u00a0\u00a0Figured the oncologists who ordered tests were handling that.I need to know more about what an HPV infection is.\u00a0\u00a0No one talked to me about it...just blood counts: which were in ok range for patient in chemo treatmentAfter the worse was over the only tests were something they do before CTscans.I just went to MD Anderson for pelvic..which has to be done with a wee speculum, as radiation has scarred vagina, anus and uretha.\u00a0\u00a0Results were 'stable'.Don't know if any of this has helped you.\u00a0\u00a0Be very aggressive with doc.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't and didn't get the best of treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Almost died from c dif, because they misdiagnosed stuff and disagreed on treament plan..lol.",

    "question": "Has anyone had routine CBC blood tests done while they had an active HPV (High Risk) infection accompanied with abnormal paps?I ask this because up until October of this year I have had clean paps for the last 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0I see an edocrinologist regularly because 2 years ago a pituitary tumor was found.\u00a0\u00a0This resulted in LOTS of blood work every 2 - 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0I also have Hashimotos Thyroid, Diabetes and Vitamin D deficiancy.\u00a0\u00a0For a year and a half my White Blood Cells have been high... specifically my Neutrophils and Segs have been abnormally high and my Lymphocytes have been low.\u00a0\u00a0As I said before it's been like this consistantly (sometimes increasing further) for the last year and a half\u00a0\u00a0and checked every 2 or 3 months.Could the HPV or abnormal cell changes be the cause of this? Has anyone else had this experience?",
