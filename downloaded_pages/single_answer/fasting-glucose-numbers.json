            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.Your fasting blood glucose can vary from day to day. Variations can be caused by stress levels, hormonal changes... If you are having fasting sugars of 140 at times, I recommend that you let your doctor know. Further testing may be indicated to find the cause. I would recommend that you keep a record of you blood sugars. Note your diet, exercise, sleep patterns, and anything else that may seem important. This may help your doctor find a pattern as to when your fasting sugars are elevated and help diagnose cause and appropriate action going forward.I hope this helpsCathy",
