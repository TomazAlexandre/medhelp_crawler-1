            "answer": "Hi,This could be folliculitis, dermatitis, or allergic reaction. In most individuals there are outbreaks of folliculitis from time to time.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months.Let us know if you need any other information and consult a skin specialist if the lesion is persistent.Regards.",

    "question": "Hello,This question doesn't concern me directly, but I still feel the need to ask.About 2 weeks ago, my partner discovered a pimple-like growth in his genital area, and he subsequently popped it, thinking nothing of it. It came back looking the same, and he popped it again, this time it bled a little, and now he's developed what looks like a blister on the base of his penis, and it's painful to the touch, where it was located. As you can imagine, I'm a little worried about it being STD-related, but I'm remaining optimistic that it's just a regular pimple that hasn't properly healed. Can you tell me anything about what it could be, and/or what you think it is most likely? Thanks",
