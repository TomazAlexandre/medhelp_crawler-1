            "answer": "Hello,Your symptom is called polyuria (excessive frequency of voiding). It can be due to many reasons which can be physiological or disease-related, and include excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones.I suggest you to take opinion of your doctor who would do a clinical examination and advice for needful tests (such as routine urinanalysis, blood glucose test, blood & urinary osmolalities, ultrasonography of renal system, etc). Accordingly you might need to take measures such as control of excessive liquid intake, reduction in diuretic substances/drugs, treatment of any infection (with short-course antibiotics), removal of any urinary tract obstruction, treatment of diabetes, etc.Hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing. Kind regards.",

    "question": "I am a 25 year old relatively healthy male. Two months ago had a sudden onset of assumed uti symptoms that only included the urge to urinate often. A week prior to symptoms, was forced to stop urinating midstream, causing the urge to urinate twice more with in half an hour. MD diagnosed UTI and put me on 10 day cycle of cipro, which stopped symptoms in 3 days. Symptoms returned 1 month later, this time took D-Mannose sugars for 5 days as recommended by a naturopath. Symptoms continued so same MD diagnosed chronic prostatitis and put me on another cycle of cipro, for 20 days, followed by septra. Once again cleared symptoms after 3 days but returned on the 19th day of cipro cycle. Have now been taking septra for 5 days and the symptoms range from unchanged to worse.The only sypmtom I have had is the urge to urinate, though it feels more like I am holding midstream urine in, and not that my bladder is full. It actually helps if I drink enough water to fill my bladder and have a natural urge to urinate. Some hesitancy with urination occurs only when i have not drank much water and my bladder is close to empty.Both trips to MD produced negative urine samples and an unremarkable prostate exam. On a potentially related note, I do have an anal fissure that has been treated and is healing. Looking for any advice or possible differential diagnosis's, thanks",
