    "question": "Hi -I am a 42 year-old woman. The past five years or so, I've been to several doctors in different fields - GI, hematology, rheumatology, etc. I've gotten some generalized diagnoses, but as even with numerous meds I feel as if I am steadily getting sicker, I would like some other opinions. HELP!!!I've been diagnosed with: fibromyalgia, GERD, IBS, slight neutropenia, various (borderline severe) allergies, and chronic sinusitis. I had a full hysterectomy at the age of 39 because of cystic ovaries.Amongst the usual abdominal cramping, nausea, and vertigo, occasionally my heart flutters, I get throbbing \"fullness\" to the lower right of my bellybutton, and I have had a fever on and off. I also have had blood in my urine numerous times (three times visible to the eye, four times found in lab test), along with abdominal pain. Tests (sonogram, cystoscope?) show no signs of kidney stones, kidney damage, or bladder damage. GI doc found polyps in the cecum, evidence of GERD - diagnosed GERD, internal hemorrhoids, and IBS.When I feel my WORST, it seems to stem from MUCUS overproduction - my head clogs up, I get terrible post-nasal drip, which upsets my stomach to the point of me not eating. My weight has steadily dropped - from 115 three years ago to 108 currently, and I am 5'5\" tall with a medium frame.LUPUS and RA run in my family, on my mother's side, although I test negative for both the RA factor and ANA.......Nonetheless my bloodwork is always off. I will list the results here:COMPLEMENT C4\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 17\u00a0\u00a0 (REF RANGE) 14-40COMPLEMENT C3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

high IRON...... I don't eat much meat, I do not take supplements, and my doc actually suspected that I was ANEMIC??? So to have high iron was strange. Also, the slightly elevated GLUCOSE level was weird, as I did not eat before the test, and am somewhat adverse to sugar in general.......???I have been dairy free and gluten free for years, and stay away from most sugar, soda, and only eat meat three times a week (usually chicken or fish). My daily diet consists of rice and occasional fish and vegetables. Sometimes potatoes, fruit, or corn (flour) products.While I should be as healthy as ever, I am thin, weak, and pale, and my bones ache.......I've been to the ER three times the past two years, for hematuria and vertigo (separate). Honestly, I feel like I am being POISONED. When my abdomen (\"innards\") hurt and throb and are swollen, I can feel it to the extreme and do not eat for 24 hours, at times. I do not get diarrhea but get constipated - have always had that problem. I know, I know, eat fiber. Believe me - I've done it ALL - I have tried natural remedies, probiotics, glucosamine, vegetarian diets..... But nothing works for more than a month, and then I am feeling SICK again :(I am active - walk walk walk, and do Yoga. I'm not as active as I used to be; some days I cannot get out of bed, I am so achy or nauseous. Oftentimes, I feel like I have the flu. Too often - like three times a month.I was thinking maybe it's a slight form of diabetes, as my eyes are steadily getting worse??? I don't know - I am grasping at straws here! lolIf anyone can help, or possibly attribute my symptoms to something already found (such as my severe allergies), it would be greatly appreciated. Or maybe it is just a combination of all these things...... I just feel as if that throbbing in my lower abdomen is relevant, and am not sure by the bloodwork whether my gallbladder, pancreas, or appendix had been checked?NOTE: Things that run in my family are: LUPUS, RA, GOUT, DIABETES, ALLERGIES, DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS, GALLSTONE, KIDNEY STONES, HEART MURMUR.My female cousin has Lupus and says that is what I have, no matter what the ANA test said. She said I need to get the \"numbers,\" and see if they lean towards Lupus, because her ANA was negative twice before it was finally positive..??Anyway.....Thank you !!!!!!!!!!",
