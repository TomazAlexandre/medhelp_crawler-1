            "answer": "Hello,This is known as urgency of urine and can be due to many reasons like polydypsia( excessive intake of water)and\u00a0\u00a0polyuria( excessive urine production) which occur due to diseases like diabetes mellitus and\u00a0\u00a0diabetes insipidus. Excessive intake of coffee and cola drinks can be another reason. In men prostatic hypertrophy can cause this. You need to get some tests done to diagnose the underlying problem.I suggest you to take opinion of your doctor who would do a clinical examination and advice for needful tests (such as routine urinanalysis, blood glucose test, blood & urinary osmolalities, ultrasonography of renal system, etc).I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I am a 25 year old male and I'm having problems with the need to urinate frequently from time to time. I don't know what is wrong with me. I have had this on and off since March. I will get it for maybe 1 to 2 days in a row, then it goes away for about 3. Does anyone have any idea what it could be? Sometimes I think it's mental because I will just focus on if I have to urinate or not. I stay seated a lot through the day too; I don't know if that would have anything to do with it. Any advice is appreciated.",
