            "answer": "Hello,These rashes can be due to hives in response to an allergic reaction, contact dermatitis or eczema. Do not use any cosmetic products at the sites. You can apply some calamine lotion at the rash as it will help in soothing the skin. You can take some OTC oral antihistamine medications like Benadryl or Claritin and see if it helps.If the symptoms persist then get it evaluated from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Just over a week ago on holiday I found myself scratching my hands and fingers.I noticed that there were red patches UNDER the skin around the creases and down the side of my fingers. After a short time the itch and marks would disappear. It was happening at any time but wasn't too much of a problem. Then when I got home it started getting worse and has now started on my feet.\u00a0\u00a0The weird thing is the itching starts suddenly and then goes away completely without a trace. I get the itch, look at my skin and I have, maybe, a line of red coming up. If I dont scratch it, it just fades away. I have been to doctor and he suggested mites but surely there would be marks on my skin all the time? It is possibly related to changes in temperature though my hands never feel really cold but it never itches when my hands are really warm. I am having a blood test tomorrow. It was on my suggestion as I have recently had two water infections and I am concerned that I may just have the start of diabetes as I have to get up three times a night to go to the bathroom (I am 60 yr female).\u00a0\u00a0It was unfortunate that when I saw the doctor, there was nothing to see (typical) Hopefully someone will recognise these symptoms and come forward and share how they got it diagnosed. To recap, the red marks are under the skin and not raised, nor do I have any bumps or spots on the skin. Thank you.",
