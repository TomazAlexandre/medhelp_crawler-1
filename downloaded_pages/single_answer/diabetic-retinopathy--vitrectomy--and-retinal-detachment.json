    "question": "My dad has type two diabetes and he has been diagonosed with diabetic retinopathy, and I don't know how to help him. i was wondering if there was anybody who knows of good opthamologists that can perform a vitrectomy, or that might have any other solutions for diabetic retinopathy. if anyone could give me any kind of feedback on diabetic retinopathy, doctors, or even anything that you think might help in any way that would be greatly appreciated. because i am desperate and it hurts me and my family so bad to have to see my dad go through the loss of his vision.",
