            "answer": "Hi dana,How are you? It is good to hear that the diagnostic tests done were normal. Aside from ear issues, dizziness can also be due to environmental factors, eye conditions\u00a0\u00a0such as error of refraction, blood pressure changes or from underlying medical conditions like anemia, diabetes, vertigo and many other illnesses. Additional tests like blood tests and other imaging studies may need to be done to determine the underlying cause. You may also benefit from a referral to an opthalmologist. Take care and do keep us posted.",
