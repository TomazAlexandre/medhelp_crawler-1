            "answer": "Hello.Can you mention if you have got your blood work for diabetes done? We are just trying to rule out some common causes of neuropathy.It is quite possible that there may be a nerve impinged in your lower limb. This will be evident on a clinical examination and MRI of the lower (lumbar) spine.To add, migraine is known to be associated with such symptoms throughout the body. But if you have it on a regular basis and have controlled your headaches with medication, it is better to look out for other causes.Regards",
