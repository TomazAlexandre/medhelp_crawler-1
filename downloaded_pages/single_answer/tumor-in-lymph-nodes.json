            "answer": "Hi,If the location of the nodes is along the crease that your leg makes when you sit down, then this is a common location for nodes. Sampling of such nodes is common place and there is no apparent problem with the penis afterwards. Some of these conditions, even if they turn out to be cancer have excellent chances for cure, so it would be best to go through with the procedure so you can get the disease at an earlier stage. Not all nodes in this area would need to be sampled though. If you have a number of injuries on your legs, or have a history of sexually transmitted infections, there would be an increase in the size of the nodes here. Discuss the pros and cons of the procedure with your doctor. Healing is more a function of your general picture - how healthy is your blood, whether you have diseases like diabetes or not. The procedure can be done as outpatient, and you can go back to regular activities afterwards, just keep the wound clean. Stay positive",
