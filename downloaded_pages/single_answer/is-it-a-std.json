            "answer": "Hi!You can treat this by applying a warm cloth to the area twice or thrice a day alternating with antibacterial cream. This encourages the pus to come to the surface, make a mouth and drain. Once the boil has drained, the area should be washed with antibacterial soap and an antibacterial cream applied and kept dry, and sterile.\u00a0\u00a0However, if you have any medical problems like diabetes, please consult a doctor, and do not wait for it to heal. Also if the boil appears to spread, the area around it becomes progressively red, then also consult a doctor. This may need incision and drainage. Take care!",
