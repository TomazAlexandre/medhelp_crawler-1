            "answer": "Hi!High angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels do indicate sarcoidosis. However, ACE levels can also be high in active histoplasmosis, hyperthyroidism, diabetes, amyloidosis, asbestosis, silicosis, emphysema, berylliosis, Hodgkin's disease, hepatitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, primary biliary cirrhosis, and scleroderma. If the lymph node was reactive and you have lung nodules then the following should be ruled out: sarcoidosis, asbestosis, silicosis, tuberculosis, Hodgkin's disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and lung cancer. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
