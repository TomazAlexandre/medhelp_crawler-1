            "answer": "What you are describing is definitely a common symptom of SSRI withdrawal but that doesn't necessarily mean that is what is causing your symptoms in your case.\u00a0\u00a0You should get a physical examination to rule out a medical cause for your symptoms in case they are not related to Paxil withdrawal.Do you have any reasons to suspect you may be hypoglycemic?\u00a0\u00a0Do your symptoms get better with sugar intake, etc?SSRI withdrawal symptoms can present from a day of stopping medication to weeks (and in some cases months) from taking the final dosage.\u00a0\u00a0Even if a doctor-implemented tapering regime is followed, withdrawal symptoms tend to occur in a good proportion of people and many people have a lot of difficulty stopping the SSRI.Hang in there and see a doctor about your symptoms just to be sure.",
