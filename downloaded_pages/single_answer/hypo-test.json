            "answer": "If you have an elevated TSH and you are pregnant you especially need to to take thyroid replacement but the antibodies, if present, won't effect your treatment. Same treatment.Some have said selenium 200 mcg per day will lower antibodies a little (10-15%) but selenium supplments may contribute to other health problems like diabetes and you are pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Speak to another doctor if you possibly can.I am hoping you can post to the thyroid doctor as well. If you can't get on that one, there are other docs\u00a0\u00a0answering on the expert pages including a family practice doctor , a pregnancy expert and a pediatric endocrinology expert.Perhaps you will be able to post to a doctor on one of those other expert forums.Good luck",

Keep my hope up.I would appreciate any knowledge of Throid test, I wasn't care for many years as i don't have many symtems. I am really concerned as i am pregnant for 9 weeks. Due to the lack knowledge of my general doctor, I have to suggest him what to do everytime. i have requested my blood test, after i read some questions on here, i realised i might have to test T3 , T4 , Free T3 , Free T4 and antibody.I would be grateful to know what are the normal arrages on these test?Many thanks",
