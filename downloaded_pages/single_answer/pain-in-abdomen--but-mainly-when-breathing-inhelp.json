    "question": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 32 yr male who is moderately over weight.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't have diabetes or anything like that.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I started one day having this aching feeling over on the far side of my abdomen, maybe 3-5 inches below my right rib cage.\u00a0\u00a0 At first I wondered if I have a gall stone or something, but then I wondered if it was too low......then I realized that pressing around on the area doesn't cause extra pain, but breathing in past a certain point increases the pain feeling.\u00a0\u00a0 I would say it's a mild to moderate pain, not severe, but it's not normal...so the question would be does it seem like an organ or simply muscular or something like that?So in other words, it doesn't hurt more if you just press down, but if I breath in on my own, or particularly against your hand it would hurt more",
