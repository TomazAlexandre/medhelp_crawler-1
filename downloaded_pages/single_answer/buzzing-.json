            "answer": "Hello.First of all, do not be scared. You have successfully controlled Diabetes. The human body has a great capacity to fight off diseases, which are part of living.Observe if the leg pain increases on upward movement (dorsiflexion) of the foot. You could be having the compartment syndrome. It is a condition where the membrane coverings of the muscles are too tight. And after a short exercise or a walk, the blood circulation increases and this builds up pressure in the \"compartment\". This condition can be diagnosed even by your physician. Please discuss this possibility with your doctor.I hope you get well soon.Regards",

    "question": "Just wondering if any one can shed any light on some of my symptoms. I have type 2 diabetes and was diagnosed in 2005. Just before Christmas I started attending a Gym. After using various pieces of equipment I noticed buzzing in my hand and legs. I have since been diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel syndrome and am waiting to have surgery, this goes some wsy to explaining the numbness, buzzing and tingling in my hands but not in my legs. The buzzing isn't present all the time. I have stopped going to the gym. However, I do walk the do and walk to work and experience the buzzing after I have stopped walking. I have also notice that the buzzing is increased when I bend my head and rest chin on my chest. I have frightened myself to death by self diagnosing MS, spinal cancer and god knows what else. My diabetes is well under control. I used to take Atorvastatin, then my doctor put me on Simvastatin, but had too many unwanted side effects so am now back on Atorvastatin. Please can someone give me some advise and put my mind at ease.",
