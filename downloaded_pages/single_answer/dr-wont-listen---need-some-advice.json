            "answer": "You would most likely feel better with T4 on the higher end of normal, and your doctor should have tried you on thyroid hormone pills. Also, with your symptoms, doc should have tested the antibodies: TGab and TPOab to see if Hashimoto's is causing your symptoms. With Hashi, our TSH can swing up and down depending on the week. The doctor cannot rule out thyroid disease without ALL of the tests. Interesting that the doc ran T4 and not FT4 and FT3. Sounds like this doc is not up-to-date.Time for a new doc. I went through four before I found one who knows thyroid. My docs said nothing was wrong with my thyroid because my TSH and FT3 were normal, but I insisted something was wrong with me and I never gave up. I found this forum and many wonderful people told me about the TGab and TPOab tests. My TPOab as well as a thyroid ultrasound indicated Hashimoto's.Many endos specialize in diabetes.This site has recommended thyroid docs:http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/This is how I found my new, wonderful, endo. I called his office ahead of time and his nurses told me 75 percent of his patients are thyroid. Too many endos focus on diabetes and don't know how to test/treat thryoid.Best of luck!:) Tamra",
