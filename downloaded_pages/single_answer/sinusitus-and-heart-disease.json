(yes I get told not to put things in my ear by the Dr's all the time).\u00a0\u00a0I have no allergies.\u00a0\u00a0One Dr thought I might be alergic to Aspirin so I stopped taking it although I do still take Ramipril.Aside from clearing my sinuses by blowing my brains out what can I do???Thnx, Tagg29",
