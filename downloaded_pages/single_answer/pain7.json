            "answer": "Hi!Pain in sides can be a symptom of anxiety. Do deep breathing exercises and see if it helps. It can also be due to gas in abdomen. Hence walk around and take antacids and see if it helps relieve the pain. It can also be due to anemia, low calcium, low iron etc\u2014so get this tested. Pinched nerves or peripheral neuropathy due to thyroid problems or diabetes too could be the cause.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
