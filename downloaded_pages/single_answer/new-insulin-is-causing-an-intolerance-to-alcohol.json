            "answer": "Hello Coopz,We are volunteers here and not physicians, so be sure to discuss with your endocrinologist any new ideas you pick up here -- or anywhere on the Internet.I am in US where the names of our insulins are a bit different, so I did a little research to understand the insulins you're on.\u00a0\u00a0From what I can tell, Protaphane is a long-acting insulin and may last for about 24 hours.\u00a0\u00a0According to the manufacturer (Novo Nordisk), Novorapid is a formulation of insulin aspart starts working in about 20 minutes and lasts for 3-5 hours.Novorapid is one of the newer insulins and many folks experience its quicker onset than their previous short-acting insulin.\u00a0\u00a0It might be that you need to eat more when you drink because your insulin is acting faster than you're accustomed to.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to only have alcohol with food and to be with folks who know you're diabetic and know how to help you if needed.\u00a0\u00a0Trouble comes quickly if everyone is drunk, of course.\u00a0\u00a0Because your blood sugars are averaging 5.5, you likely are running close to normal or low ranges most of the time.\u00a0\u00a0This is terrific for your long term health; it can be disaster if you're drinking, however.If the social aspect of being out with friends who are drinking is important to you, consider some accommodations.\u00a0\u00a0These ideas come to mind:\u00a0\u00a0Buy snacks for the table, so you can ensure your blood sugar doesn't plummet, switch to beers that are lower in alcohol, instead of drinking only beer -- drink one beer, then one water or soft drink, then your second beer.My hope is that you don't really drink \"10++\" beers ever because that would be a serious risk.\u00a0\u00a0Every year in the US, we read about the sudden death of young people from such alcohol poisoning resulting from such binges.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "Hi, I'm 28 and have been a diabetic since I was 13. I have enjoyed alcohol since I was 18. Been of a large size (6`5 and 95kg) it has never effected me. I have only been drunk 2-3 times in my life. I also don't drink heavily.My control has been excellent with a averege Hemoglobin A1C result of around 5.5.Now late last year I went from Acrapid and Monotard, to Protaphane and Novorapid. I easily adapted to the new insulins and my control was fine. But I can no longer enjoy alcohol. After 2-3 beers I become dizzy and well... drunk, what used to take 10++ beers for the same effect only takes a handful.I know its not healthy to drink much anyway if you have diabetes but before taking these new insulins it was never a issue for me.Has anyone else had similair issues?Any help welcome",
