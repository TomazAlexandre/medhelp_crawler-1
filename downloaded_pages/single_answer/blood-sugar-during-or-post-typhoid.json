            "answer": "Hi,it is normal for blood sugars to rise during infection.\u00a0\u00a0However, even while ill, I don't thing that blood sugars would be as high as you describe. To have blood sugars of the level you describe definitely requires further thorough investigation and likely treatment.It may be that you have diabetes and that you are lucky enough to find out about it before you have any symptoms or complications.",
