            "answer": "You might want to get her checked for migraine headaches. From my understanding when you get one you feel nauseas, even throw up, feel faint and splitting headache. You can also feel or see an aura around you right before it hits you. Your eyes are extremely sensitive to light and you're sensitive to noise too.These symptoms sound pretty close. And if she is prone to migraines then certain foods can trigger them so you might want to get her tested on that too. I'd also get her blood sugar tested to see if she might be hypoglycemic. I'm wondering if I should get my own son's blood sugar tested. It can't hurt. My friend found out her little girl's blood sugar would get too low and she had to eat a protein snack about every 2 to 3 hours, so she'd send some nuts or a cheese stick or something with her to school to eat between lunch for a snack with the teachers permission and it seemed to help quite a bit.",

    "question": "Today at school my daughter briefly fainted...her description afterwards:\u00a0\u00a0she felt like her body was 'melting', she could barely hear, her vision was as if looking through binoculars, tired and her heart 'felt like it was falling'.\u00a0\u00a0The teacher noticed something was wrong because she saw my daughter starting to walk wobbly while leaving the room to get water and my daughter walked past the 'door' that she needed to exit the room.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She also vomited a small amount immediately after coming to.I am dumbfounded because upon picking up my child she was perfectly fine ...maybe a little shaken from the commotion caused by the incident.\u00a0\u00a0She has no fever and full of energy this evening.\u00a0\u00a0I will add that 36 hours prior she complained of a very bad headache prior to going to bed and a bad headache upon waking in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0Both times I gave her Ibuprofen and she was fine.Prior to school she had a bowl of cereal (Total type cereal) with milk but nothing has been out of the ordinary, no head injury, no signs of diabetes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Should I take her in to\u00a0\u00a0the doctor or keep a close eye and monitor her closely?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any input.",
