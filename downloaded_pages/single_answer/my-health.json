            "answer": "I'm not sure what ALT and AST are, but I had a similar experience of things that I'd had for many years normalizing after my diagnosis as well. I was on blood sugar meds and was continually feeling dizzy then went to the doctor after I found myself on the ground one day. He lowered and lowered my bp meds until I no longer took any and my bp is fine. I take thyroid replacement meds and found that the dose suddenly was way too high (though that went back to normal). I also take cholesterol meds and my liver values are normalized on that, so I don't know if that changed as well as I still take them (I think the values you list are liver?). I wondered about this as well and wondered if it was perhaps normalizing the high blood sugars that influenced everything else?(But I am LADA so I had slower onset of Type 1) Only theory I have; if you find out more, let me know! From everything I've heard from thousands of diabetics is these things are very complex and all related.",
