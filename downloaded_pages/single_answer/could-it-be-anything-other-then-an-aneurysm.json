    "question": "Heres the deal...my grandmother who's turning 54 has started to have some major headaches. Monday she had a slash of pain across her whole head she fell to the ground and was rushed to the ER. They checked for blood on the brain but said there seemed to be non that it must have been from the cold. Every day since then she's had a horrible headache almost all day long. She eats anything she vomits it back up. When she trys to sleep she's lucky to get a few hours of sleep. The headaches tend to get worst as she lays down. If she's getting a little heated up in a conversation she nearly falls to the ground because the pain is so harsh. Also I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it,but last night she was sitting on the couch and when she got up the cushion was soaked in poop. She never felt she had to go nor did she feel it as it came out. She's freaking out and the doctors keep telling her its nothing. Her family is worried and I'd appreciate any help i could receive. thank you",
