            "answer": "Hello,I do think you should have your glucose retested very soon, and with a 2 hour gluose tolerance test instead of only the fasting glucose.\u00a0\u00a0In addition there may be some other tests needed because autoimmune diseases can come in groups instead of just one and include others like Type 1 diabetes, liver disease, malabsorption syndromes, rheumatologic syndromes etc.Having some relatively low blood sugrs can be quite normal in young slender women, especially those who are very active, and all you may need is a change in your diet(spacing out several small meals instead of big ones, and avoiding carb-heavy snacks). But weight loss with any group of complaints should be evaluated fully so it is best that you speak with and see your doctor s soon as possible.Take care.",

    "question": "I know this is a type 2 forum, but maybe you can help. I am a 21yr women and I have Hashimotos Hypothyroidism (autoimmune disease) . I am very active...I run in college for a divison 1 program. About a year ago I started to get very thirsty all of the time. It is now to the point that I can't go five minutes without taking water. Also I am peeing a lot and my blood sugar just suddenly drops throughout the day. One minute I am fine and the next I am about to pass out or kill someone if I do not get food. When I am hungry my stomach does not hurt I get a hoorible headache. Today I freaked out because my vision got cloudy (like smoke is in the room). I have lost some weight also. I feel like the more I eat the more weight I lose. I also have very bad circulation in my feet and my eyes have been very dry lately. I have also been very cold...my ferrition is 21. I am 5'6\" and like 102. I did take the fasting glucose test about a year ago and I was fine. Is it possible that now I am not? Can anyone tell me what they think...thanks...I think I am going to call the doc tomorrow.",
