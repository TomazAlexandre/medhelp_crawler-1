    "question": "I\u2019m male aged 20, I have been doing a wee about 10-12 times per day normally every 30mins - 1hr 30 mins (sometimes longer) for the past month or so. This problem has come and gone over the past year (did happen a couple of time before that though, but no where near as bad), but recently it\u2019s came back and has stayed longer than usual. I\u2019ve also been getting up during the night to go to the toilet quite a few times (which has never happened before). Another things which is different this time is that I\u2019m actually weeing when I feel the need to go (previously it was just a trickle, so clearly I didn\u2019t need to go, this time it\u2019s a fair bit more but less than normal). Normally I can only hold for 30mins after having a drink because as soon as anything enters my bladder it start feeling weak, strained and full, which means it\u2019s hard to know when I really do need to go. I'd just like some opinions before I probably eventually do the doctors.",
