            "answer": "Hi!If the pain and numbness is coming and going then it can be due to the heart. You need a 12 lead EKG/ECG to rule this out. Other than this this pain and numbness can be due to compression of spinal nerves, Brachial plexy, or peripheral neuropathy as seen in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s or lupus.Another possibility is Scalene Myofascial Pain Syndrome. When scalene muscle is the cause of pain, the pain is referred from neck to to (either all or a combination of) chest, inner lining of scapula (shoulder bone), shoulder, posterior and lateral sides of the arm right up to the thumb and index finger. When this muscle shortens, this can press on brachial plexus (bundle of nerves and blood vessels in the armpit) and the subclavian artery and can compress or irritate these structures and cause symptoms such as abnormal sensation, cold extremity, spasms of pain, and lymphedema (swelling of lymph channels causing swelling of arm or leg) in the involved extremity. Treatment is by physiotherapy that involves indentifying the trigger points, and massaging them, and other exercises to relieve the muscle tension. This is a major cause of TOS.Other than this it can be inflammation of veins or phlebitis, inflammation of lymph channels or lymphangitis, deep vein thrombosis or compartment syndrome.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "I've been experiencing numbness in my left arm and aches. And sometimes the ache shoots down to my middle finger and the palm of my hand and rarely it spreads to my right arm as well and neck. I also have pain under my left armpit. It aches more than I feel numbness or tingling. My ache is probably 1 to 10, I'd say it can go up to 7 and my numbness and tingling can go up to a 4. But its persistent and its every day. I recently posted a question regarding this before. But I went to the doctor today and all they did was check my vitals, my vitals were normal so they sent me home. But I still feel my left arm numb. If my blood pressure and vitals are normal does that mean its not heart related? if so why do I still feel these aches and numbness? Has anyone experience this before?",
