    "question": "I have been diagnosed as borderline b12 deficient and have been getting b12 injections for several months.\u00a0\u00a0My level has gone up and then back down with the different frequencies my doctor has been trying.\u00a0\u00a0The extremity numbness and tingling improves after I get a shot but by the end of the month starts to come back.\u00a0\u00a0I generally wake up several times at night with arms totally asleep.I saw a specialist who didn't think my level was low enough to cause problems and suggested I had a pinched nerve causing my tingling.\u00a0\u00a0But would a pinched nerve affect both arms and legs?\u00a0\u00a0I've had some other ongoing issues that I've tried for years to find a cause, but no doctor has found anything. Most of which can be caused by low b12 and/or vit D levels.Has anyone read the book \"Could it be B12\"?\u00a0\u00a0I was recommended to read it and did and thought some info was incredibly useful, but don't know if it's accurate.My doctor insists that the cyanocobalamin is fine, when the book states that methyl cobalamin or hydroxocobalamin is better.\u00a0\u00a0She is willing to treat due to symptoms in the \"gray\" area so I don't want to complain.\u00a0\u00a0Also I'm curious why if some countries state that symptoms may be felt in some patients if their level is below 500-550, why my doctors say it doesn't matter where you are in the range as long as you are in the range.On that theory, shouldn't they be just as happy to get me to the top of the range so I could see if I felt better?\u00a0\u00a0You can't OD on b12 so there's really no risk.\u00a0\u00a0Thoughts?My final question is actually about my vit D level.\u00a0\u00a0It was a 10.2 and my doctor has now put me on 1X weekly 50,000IU.\u00a0\u00a0I've read you need other cofactors (magnesium, vitamin K, etc.) to help the vit D.\u00a0\u00a0I was taking 2,000IU daily that had these components, but my 50,000IU doesn't have them.\u00a0\u00a0So, do I just take the same amount of these as was in my daily or do I need more to correspond to the much higher dose of vit D I'm now taking?\u00a0\u00a0Are these things safe at higher doses?Thanks!",
