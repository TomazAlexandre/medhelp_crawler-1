            "answer": "Changes in your diet and exercise can cause changes in your stool.\u00a0\u00a0I think everyone is bothered by gas at one time or another.\u00a0\u00a0It could be the fruits and vegetables that cause the gas or something else in your diet.\u00a0\u00a0One way to try and figure out what causes the gas in your case would be to keep a food diary of everything you eat and when you take your metformin.\u00a0\u00a0In the same diary note when your have gas, see if you can figure out what you might be eating to cause it.\u00a0\u00a0It has also been my experience then when I used to exercise regularly, my stools my stools were long and more regular. It does not sound like anything really wrong with your system but talk to your doctor and see what he/she recommends.\u00a0\u00a0Gas is more annoying then a real problem.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
