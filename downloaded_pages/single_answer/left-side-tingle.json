            "answer": "Hello,Tingling on the left side of the body means that there may be an abnormality in the right side of the brain.It can be a neurological pathology like motor neuron disease,TIA or stroke or autoimmune condition like multiple sclerosis in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination.It can be diagnosed by MRI brain and MRS of the brain.Other possibilities are vit B12 deficiency,diabetes(already ruled out in your case) , hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism or peripheral nerve trauma or compression.If tingling is there only on the left half of the body,it means a right side pathology of the brain.So I feel that clinical evaluation from a neurologist is necessary to rule it out.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "its, like i loose control of my thoughts,weird feeling,i then experience tingeling that feels like the entire left side of my body is awaking, as if it had been asleep. this has been going on for years, the weird kinda dizzy spells started first several years ago. then a couple of years ago the left side thing started. its very hard to describe, but i can feel when the spell is about to start. its is starting to scare me. my doctor did a sonagram on my heart,blood work and nothing was wrong, but some times when i go to see a doctor, they seem to pick up somthing wrong when they listen to it. i am confused, now wether their is somthing really wrong or i am just going crazy.i know nothing about my dads side of\u00a0\u00a0the family health history, but my mothers side has a history of diabetes, so i get checked for that a couple of times a year,so far,so good. i suffer from migrains and have for years, i problems taking pain medicine,it seems to make them worse and the nausea worse. so i take 100 milligrams of amtriptilyn generic for somthing. it keeps the migrains away but i am afraid it is adding to what i call the \"spells\", my doctor seems to think its side effects from not having the migrain. i am at a total loss. i don't want to quit taking the only thing that seems to keep the migrains away. but goodgrief,what if i have one of these spells while driving down the road. have had hystorectomy,gall bladder removed and 3 kids, i am afraid the next thing i loose will be my life.",
