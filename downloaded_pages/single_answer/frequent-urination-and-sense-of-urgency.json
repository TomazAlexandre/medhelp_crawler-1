            "answer": "Namaste,It seems as if you have covered all the bases to eliminate a physical reason for this problem, although you didn't include your fluid intake which, obviously can have an effect on your ouput.Additionally, some medications can cause symptoms similar to those you describe.I wouldn't be too quick to blame your problem on anxiety(too many people do). I suggest that you continue to work with your doctors and if you think the issue is psychological, tell them that, so an appropriate evaluation can be made.Michael",

    "question": "Hello,I am a male 30 years old and have a problem from over 7 years of frequent urination and sense of urgency to urinate and it increases if I am travelling , giving a presentation , going out .. etc. I have been to dozen of urologists and done the following:-1. Urine dynamics test2. test on the bladder nerves3. Ultra sound on the bladder4. different prostate and urine tests5. X ray on the kidneys with IV injection with a substance \"don't remember it\"6. diabetes testand basically all the tests proved that the Urinary system is having no functional problems and no infections what so ever. and for medications that I tried will range from Ditropan, detrusitol, calmipam, tofranil, and many others.And I still look for a treatment and I am feeling that my problem is because of Anxiety, as in general I am very anxious person and feeling that every day activities is already big and I feel stressed in 95% of the normal day situations and I worry a lot.I am not sure how can I treat my self as basically I am not a US resident.Thank you in advance for your advice.",
