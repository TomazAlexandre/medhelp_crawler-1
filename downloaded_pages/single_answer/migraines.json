    "question": "I am a 31 year old female with hypertension and am 24 weeks pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0This all started about 7 months ago ( before I was pregnant).\u00a0\u00a0I woke up one morning and my face was tight/ numbish.\u00a0\u00a0It got worse throughout the day and I went to the ER where they did a CT scan (normal), blood work (normal), ekg (normal),...my bp was a bit elevated, but as I was on Licinapril, my bp had been well controlled for 3weeks and the best answers were either a reaction to the meds or MS or stress.\u00a0\u00a0(Quite a range of dx's)My PCP took me off Licinapril and put me on Labetalol (it had worked durring my second pregnancy) and concured with the sress theory.\u00a0\u00a0 He did have me wear a halter monitor for 24 hours which also showed normal results.The facial numbness never went away for more than a few hours at a time, but started switching sides and coming and going.\u00a0\u00a0I started having headaches, which I never had before.\u00a0\u00a0 Then I got pregnant on accident and soon after started another symptom.\u00a0\u00a0I felt tingles/prickles all over....every side, all parts....sometimes just one prickle, sometimes lots of prickles.\u00a0\u00a0It got worse in the heat.Then I had a numb patch below my right knee that would be the size of a quarter or spread to the whole knee and shin, then reduce again.\u00a0\u00a0This felt like my face.\u00a0\u00a0I could still feel the affected area, but it felt tight and strange.Then came the buzzing...in my left knee, my left hip, my right hip, my right foot.....a pulsating vibration...on for two seconds, off for five seconds.\u00a0\u00a0Not all at once....the location changed over time with an episode not lasting longer than two weeks at the most....usually three days.most of these symptoms have eased up or disappeared.\u00a0\u00a0But i still have the facial numbness that comes and goes and brings with it a heck of a headache.\u00a0\u00a0The headache feels dull all over but feels sharp and stabbing around my eyes and small, specific parts of my head.\u00a0\u00a0I see sparkles and feel terrible.....and, yet my bp is 115/65.I saw a neuro who said he cant do anything for me until I have the baby.\u00a0\u00a0He did get me an EEG which was normal, B12 which was 525, and Lyme which was neg.\u00a0\u00a0 My PCP thinks it is all stress and my OB is not concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like anything?\u00a0\u00a0Migraines? Seisures? MS?\u00a0\u00a0or is it all in my head?\u00a0\u00a0I am so frustrated and have been realitively healthy my whole life.\u00a0\u00a0What has changed so suddenly that I am now feeling so strange?\u00a0\u00a0 Please help!",
