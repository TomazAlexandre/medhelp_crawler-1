    "question": "Why they say diabetes means because of too much sugar? Diabiaties mean when a brain starts to produce poisionous harmon. It's a poisionous harmoneeeeeeeeeeee. Insulin is a poison neutralizer. So our organs don't spoil. When we get old or a diabetic baby . Suger don't make diabities. Those who have diabities they don't have to take sugar. I can prove this because when i take 2 or 3 spoons of suger i get more stress or go little bit more psyco. Mental medicine doesnot\u00a0\u00a0make diabities cause we already have diabities. Mental illness is a most hardest and most dangerous method to fight with diabities. Cause my mother used to say my urine forzen when i was child.",
