    "question": "I'm a 27 year old male with normal blood cholesterol, 153 total, no diabetes, fairly good blood pressure despite my family history 125/75, and I work out frequently these past 3 months including swimming, yoga, pilates, and free weights among other things. I've lost about 20 lbs in that time 262 down to 242. Basically I'm taking better care of my healthReally my only gripe are premature atrial contractions, which I went through vigorous testing including Echo, Holter, and stress tests which all came back negative for major heart problems.Just this last week however I've been getting these really weird vibrations or to the right of sternum, the center, and first two ribs. They don't hurt, but they are constant close to a dozen times a day. When I work and my mind's not paying attention I don't really notice it. But they're making me worry cause they're not going away.I just want to make sure there is nothing wrong or new with my heart.any advice?",
