            "answer": "Hello.This does look like peripheral neuropathy. The reason behind the peripheral neuropathy has to be ascertained. Only then can we expect to have a treatment which is appropriate.If the nerve is compressed for a long time, it may result in muscle atrophy, which can present as the pulling of toes.Please get an EMG (electromyography) done. This will tell which nerve is affected.Regards",
