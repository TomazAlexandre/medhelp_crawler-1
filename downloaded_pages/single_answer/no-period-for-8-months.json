            "answer": "It sounds like you might have PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome). You have some of the symptoms. Have you noticed any excessive hair on your face/body? You need to see a gynecologist and have an ulltrasound done to check for ovarian cysts. They are mostly benign so don't worry, but they are a hassle to deal with. Surgery is necessary in some cases, depending on the type and size of cyst(s) you have. See the gynecologist soon. If left untreated, it does get worse and you will gain more weight. It could also lead to other diseases like diabetes or cardiovascular disease if left untreated. If you do have PCOS, you will be able to get some meds that will help control the symptoms, including the weight gain. Good luck!",
