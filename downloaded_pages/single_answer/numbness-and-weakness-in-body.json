            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum.This looks like an episode of transient ischemic attack wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. To diagnose this you need a prompt evaluation (within 60 minutes) to identify the cause and determine appropriate therapy. CAT Scans done later or when you are fine will not reveal anything.Another possibility is Vitamin B12 deficiency. Underactive thyroid and diabetes too should be ruled out. It could also be postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position). Please get your BP checked next time you have this feeling.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. The enumerated the possibilities can be investigated or ruled out one by one by your physician. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have had numbness right after I had my baby in July; it came and went for months. I saw a neurologist and\u00a0\u00a0had a brain scan and that came back normal.I am really scared because Friday night I started to feel really weak in my entire body coupled with an achy feeling. I am really worried that I have something seriously wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0Could I have MS? RA? Lupus? Or something.I have had also had chest pains for quite some time. I am not suffering from anxiety and I do not want that as a diagnosis. This is just peculiar that this happened after I had my baby...which was delivered via c-section and I lost over a liter of blood. Any help? Suggestions?",
