            "answer": "Congrats on controlling your diabetes. I too am an adult onset type 1 (LADA/1.5 actually) who was initially misdiagnosed as Type 2 due to age.To answer your questions briefly: For some people the doses work out to about equal amounts of basal (Lantus) and bolus (Humalog), not everyone. Whatever doses work to keep your numbers in target range work.The most up to date method of carb counting doesn't involve exchanges but just straight carb counting. Most packaged foods list carbs and you can look up listings for other foods as well. I cannot tell you what dose to bolus because we are all different. What you need to establish is your Insulin: Carb ratio and it may be different for the three meals. Mine is breakfast 1:9, lunch 1:11 and dinner 1:20. In other words I take one unit of insulin for each 9/11 or 20 carbs in my meals. One way to figure yours is to start at 1:15 and work up or down depending on how that controls your blood sugar. So if you eat a meal with 45 carbs you take 3 units and if you end up too high at two hours then you know you should reduce your I:C ratio to 1:14, if you end up low you can up the ratio to 1:16. Do it gradually.What I really suggest for all the things you have to learn is to get the book Using Insulin by John Walsh. It's a great book that contains a lot of important info; the only caveat being he talks about a higher carb intake then most of us eat. Also you might want to go to a website where there is more traffic of people managing Type 1 for many years. E-mail me if you want a couple websites.Zoe",

    "question": "I am 69 yrs. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 6 yrs ago. I am currently taking 60 units a day of Lantus and do Humalog 3 times a day. I seem to be controlling my BS pretty well. I went to the Dr. last week and he said I should be taking equal amounts of Lantus and Humalog daily. Is this correct and why?Also can anyone explain to me the exchanges of carbs and how much humalog I should take to counteract carbs at meal times. My Dr. has never explained any of this to me!!!! With the knowledge I have of food and diabetes, which is not much, I am surprised I have been controlling it so well, so far!!!",
