    "question": "I went to the Dr. For a series of test because of lack of period...I've been really stressed to the point where I have panic attacks.. My fiance left me without notice so thats why.. Well the test confirmed I have nothing wrong with me.. No diabetes no pcos.. No cyst no tumors.. No cancer... Just the hormone that triggers ovulation was kind of low.. Can stress cause this? I thought I was pregnant due to the colostrum and bloating.. Which is still present. And I've never had a child",
