            "answer": "Hi,Diabetic neuropathy usually comes after poorly controlled diabetes and/or longstanding diabetes, so it is very unlikely that this is the cause of your symptoms. That said, fasting glucose alone can miss cases of impaired glucose tolerance(where your fasting is fine but your blood sugars go up after eating). The best way to find out is through a glucose tolerance test.Hang in there, ask your doctor about doing a glucose tolerance test, and I think the other appointments/tests are a good idea too. If nothing shows up on the diabetes test, then perhaps a referral to a neurologist may shed some light and bring you a diagnosis.Best of luck and take care.",

    "question": "Fat, female, 50, fatigued, very heat sensitive. Father was a type II diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I have a BMI of 31.\u00a0\u00a0One of my sons was nearly 10 pounds at birth.\u00a0\u00a0I walk half an hour most days.\u00a0\u00a0Can walk on a flat surface forever (as long as it's cool), but one flight of stairs gets me winded.\u00a0\u00a0Don't smoke or drink.Lousy family history for heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0Recent\u00a0\u00a0nuclear stress test\u00a0\u00a0was fine.\u00a0\u00a0High blood pressure controlled by medicine, and Zocor for cholesterol.Frequent urination, including 4-5 times at night.\u00a0\u00a0Had a UTI in September, my second ever.A month ago, the skin on my stomach got numb and tingly.\u00a0\u00a0I chalked it up to a long plane ride and jeans digging in my waist, but it hasn't gone away.\u00a0\u00a0A week later, my fingers and toes started getting the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0It's constant, but I notice it especially after a hot bath, or at night in bed.I've only had a fasting glucose > 100 once, but\u00a0\u00a0<110.\u00a0\u00a0Most recent was 98.\u00a0\u00a0Never had a glucose tolerance testScheduled for a sleep study and EMG.\u00a0\u00a0EMG sounds scary because of the diseases that get linked to it on searches, like ALS.\u00a0\u00a0My physical therapist SIL says sounds like MS, but muscles and nerves are her bag.\u00a0\u00a0The fatigue, heat sensitivity, paresthesia, frequent urination, and dizzy spells kind of go along with that, too.\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t have muscle weakness, but feet cramp often.Could I have diabetic neuropathy without ever having had blood sugar high enough to count as official diabetes, or even pre-diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Just from insulin resistance?\u00a0\u00a0Or if I had a glucose tolerance test, would it show diabetic numbers even when the fasting ones are good?\u00a0\u00a0I do get worse fatigue and \"head rushes\" after I eat sweet stuff. Any reassurance out there to keep me sane until I get results?",
