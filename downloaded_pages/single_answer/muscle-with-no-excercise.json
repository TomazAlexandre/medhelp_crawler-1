            "answer": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I'm certainly not an expert in physiology and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0As I understand it, lack of exercise makes muscle tissue turn into fat, creating deposits and making your muscles less strong.\u00a0\u00a0In joints it makes the cartilage and tendons stiffer, making you less flexible and stiffer.\u00a0\u00a0With respect to diabetes, what it does is prevent the glucose in your blood streams from being absorbed automatically just through simple things like walking from your car to your office.\u00a0\u00a0That will make your blood sugars rise, requiring more insulin.Did that answer your question?",
