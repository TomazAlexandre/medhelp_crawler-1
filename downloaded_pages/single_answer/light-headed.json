    "question": "hi im jimmy,Not sure if my question would fit here or not, I get these spells of light headed to the point where it gets hard to focus on anything.Almost like if you look directly at the sun and then look around and you cant see everything as clear, usually last about 15 to 20 min. then i get a really bad headache that sticks around all day, shortly after i regain total focus my hand and sometime tongue get numb. Not sure exactly what this is was thinking maybe something with cholesterol or BP. I'm 34 if this helps at all, thanks",
