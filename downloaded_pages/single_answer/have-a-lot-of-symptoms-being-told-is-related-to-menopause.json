            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, the symptoms can be due to menopause. Get FSH, LH, estrogen and progesterone levels checked. Hormone replacement therapy may help.Since you have temperature fluctuations also rule out thyroid disorders, adrenal gland problems, anemia, diabetes, hypoglycemia, liver diseases, low Vit B12, and vasovagal attacks.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
