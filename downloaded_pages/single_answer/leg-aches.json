            "answer": "Hi!The symptoms could be due to a pinched nerve in the lower back of due to a peripheral neuropathy (due to diabetes, Lyme\u2019s, lupus, hypothyroidism), deep vein thrombosis or due to electrolyte imbalance.I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders could also cause this. It is less likely to be due to ALS.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "I have leg cramps and aches in my left leg only from my butt down to my calf. I have been to see a Chiropractor, Physiotherpist, MD and a massage therapist. I now have tingling/numbness in my left\u00a0\u00a0foot. My father died 4 yrs ago of ALS and I am concerned. It is especially bad when I drive and it hurts badly to get out of the car. I am on a low dose anti inflamatory and take tylenol for pain. Any suggestions to alleviate the pain?",
