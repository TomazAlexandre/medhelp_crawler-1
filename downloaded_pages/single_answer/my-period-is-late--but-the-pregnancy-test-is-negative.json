            "answer": "Well I think that the only thing you can do at this point is head to a doctor...it does sound eerily similar to thyroid or even diabetes issues (is it anywhere in your family?).Usually if your period was this late (except in a few rare cases) the test would be showing positive by now if you were pregnant....but there are a LOT of things that can cause delayed periods as you seem to know so really with a negative pregnancy test the only thing to do now is to go to a doctor's.Good luck hon I hope you get an answer soon!",

    "question": "I was supposed to get my period on 10/05, but it's now 10/27 and my period hasn't come yet.\u00a0\u00a0I took a pregnancy test on 10/20 and it was negative.I'm worried that I might be pregnant, but the test doesn't show it.I don't think I have a thyroid problem... but this are some of the symptoms that may say otherwise.1. I'm always cold! anywhere.\u00a0\u00a0I usually sit under the sun with a sweatshirt on to be warm, I don't use the AC in the car and I live in Florida!2. I'm not always tired, but I do feel like I could feel more alive.\u00a0\u00a0I actually don't sleep enough, just about 6 hours or less.3. I'm overweight, but I've been losing a little weight because I've been dieting.This are other symptoms that might help you answer the question.- I have white thick vaginal discharge, not all the time.- It smells sweet, could it be because I'm using splenda more than usual?- I'm eating less than usual.- I haven't had any pregnancy symptoms such as morning sickness or wanting to eat protein. Although I know, not every women gets them.- The last time I had sex was on 09/13 and that same week I had a traumatic experience which kept me stressed for about a week, but now I'm back to normal and I don't think I'm stressed at all.Hopefully I gave you enough insight, please help!",
