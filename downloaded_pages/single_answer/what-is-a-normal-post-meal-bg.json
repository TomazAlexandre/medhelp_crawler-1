            "answer": "Those numbers aren't normal. To be diagnosed as diabetic though, you'd have to have a random BG of over 200. Your numbers would come into the category of impaired. You probably should have an oral glucose tolerance test.Since your older daughter is a type 1, I would contact Trialnet and have type 1 diabetes antibody tests done on your 6-yr-old and yourself. The tests are free. Just because someone has type 1 antibodies doesn't mean that they will necessarily develop diabetes, but most kids who do have diabetes have the antibodies -- ~90%. You could have type 1 or type 2 or LADA. I know a couple of adults who developed type 1. Type 1 onset is usually in children, but adults can get it too.Here's the info for Trialnet -- http://www.diabetestrialnet.org/patientinfo/studies/natural-history.htmAs far as I know, type 2 has no connection with type 1, so that family history is more relevant to you than your daughter. Type 2 does tend to be genetic.\u00a0\u00a0A sibling of a type 1 child has about a 5% chance of getting diabetes. She should be checked ASAP. I would call your older daughter's pediatric endocrinologist first thing in the morning and get her in and tested. Check her for ketones and make sure she's ok. If she has ketones, call your doctor immediately and get advice about what to do. Keep a close eye on her. If she had any signs of DKA, take her to the hospital immediately.As you know from your older daughter, Type 1 in children is nothing to fool around with. So if you have any concern your younger daughter might have it, call your doctor immediately and see what they suggest.Good luck. I hope your 6-yr-old doesn't have it. I hope you don't either. But you both need to be seen and get to the bottom of these elevated BGs.",

    "question": "My 6 year old had a post-meal 1 hour BG of 176 and 2 hour of 112.\u00a0\u00a0Her fasting BG has been in the 90 range.\u00a0\u00a0These were all random BG tests.\u00a0\u00a0She has had weight loss, is tired all the time, very irritable, complains of thirst quite often, and pees a lot and even wets the bed weekly.\u00a0\u00a0Her older sister by 4 years is Type I diabetic and she has many other families with Type 2 (great aunts on both sides, great grandfather's on both sides, a grandmother, and a great-great grandmother) as well as a distant cousin with Type I.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I had gestational diabetes with her younger sister and am having similar problems.\u00a0\u00a0My post-meal BG has been in the 180 range after 1 hour and 160 range after 2 hours.\u00a0\u00a0I'm always tired, drink a lot and just had my annual eye exam which showed my vision has worsened drastically.\u00a0\u00a0My prescription has tripled.\u00a0\u00a0Are the post-meal BGs mentioned above, normal?",
