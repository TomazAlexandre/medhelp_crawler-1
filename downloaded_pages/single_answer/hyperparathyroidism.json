            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Post thyroidectomy there can be Secondary hypoparathyroidism, resulting in decreased calcium levels. The incidence of hypocalcaemia following thyroid surgery varies widely between 1% and more than 50%. In the majority of situations, post-operative hypocalcaemia is transient. Permanent hypoparathyroidism is unusual and occurs in less than 1% of all patients undergoing total or radical totalthyroidectomy. And as your calcium levels are within the normal range its unlikely that your symptoms are due to hypocalcemia. Check to rule out diabetes mellitus, it can cause the symptoms described by you.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hi Dr Lupo,Could there be a chance I have hyperparathyroidism?? I have had a total thyroidectomy for stage II papillary. The also did a neck disection (spread to nodes) and removed a parathyroid. I don't know why the parathyroid was removed. It's been a year and keep changing doses of thyroxine as my Endo wants my TSH\u00a0\u00a0to be zero or lower.I have serious symptoms of hyper at times but at the moment think something else is wrong. I'm extremely tired, dizzy, low blood, irritable, insomnia, heart palps and weak to the point I'm not at work. My legs almost can't keep me up.Hemoglobin 10.7 ref 11.5-16.5Wcc 8.5 ref 4.0-11.0Pcv 33.5 ref 37.0-47.0Sodium 140 ref 136-146Potassium 4.3 ref 3.5-5.0Calcium 2.30 ref 2.15-2.65Cor.
