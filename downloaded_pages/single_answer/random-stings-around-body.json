    "question": "This started 2 days ago.I am experiencing localised splinter-like stinging sensations in different parts of my body. There are two on my glans, and one just inside my left nostril. There are no visual symptoms, and feel just like splinters, but there is nothing to pull out. As all 3 are in very sensitive areas this isn't something I want to have to put up with for long, so what can you recommend, if anything?Thank you.",
