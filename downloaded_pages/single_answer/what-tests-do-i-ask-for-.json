    "question": "I am overwhelmed. It sounds like hypothyroid is not diagnosed properly much of the time. I have a Dr appt tomorrow morning. The Dr I am seeing is a new doctor that I've never met before. She is an Internal Medicine specialist who specializes in metobolic disorders, diabetes and women's diseases (if that makes any difference). I have almost all symptoms of hypothyroid, plus my grandma, aunt and sister are hypothyroid. If I tell her my symptoms, will she do the proper tests? Do I need to ask for specific tests to be done?I'm kind of nervous.Thanks.",
