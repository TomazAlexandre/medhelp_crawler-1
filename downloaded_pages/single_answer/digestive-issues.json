            "answer": "These are all things that you would have no way of knowing but that your doctors should be able to discover with further testing.\u00a0\u00a0To put it another way, your condition should be diagnosable.\u00a0\u00a0The first place to look should be your intestines, upper and lower, as suggested by the gastroenterologist.\u00a0\u00a0You may have celiac disease (despite the previous negative tests), a condition that may occur at any age.\u00a0\u00a0This is a disease diagnosis that is made by a biopsy of the small intestine.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to get more information about this possibility from the GI specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Whatever intestinal disease you have, it could be responsible for non-intestinal symptoms such as fatigue, dry skin etc but it might also be advisable to have your major hormone levels checked.Should you prove to have celiac disease, note the following:\u201cCeliac disease is an inflammatory condition of the small intestine precipitated by the ingestion of wheat, rye, and barley in individuals with certain genetic predispositions. High-risk groups for celiac disease include first-degree relatives and individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus or autoimmune thyroid disease About 20% of patients diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome have celiac disease.\u201dI believe that you should agree to the upper endoscopy and the colonoscopy as this will be the most direct and reliable way for a diagnosis to be made and proper treatment instituted.Good luck",
