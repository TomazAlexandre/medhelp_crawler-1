            "answer": "Hi and welcome to the community.\u00a0\u00a0We are \"famous\" here for the support we can provide, so you've come to the right place..........As to your food - do you get the option of choosing what you get?\u00a0\u00a0If so, then be sure to pick as much fresh fruits and veggies as you can (if, when available).\u00a0\u00a0If most of the food is canned, go the \"low sodium\" versions whenever possible; opt for sugar free as much as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Limit the amount of pasta and bread as much as you can or make sure you opt for whole grain whenever possible.\u00a0\u00a0For the meats - there are delicious ways to prepare meals using ground beef (a lot of us are going for less expensive cuts these days) - but after browning it for a dish, make sure you drain it well before mixing in other ingredients.\u00a0\u00a0Grilling or broiling, both ground beef and pork, is preferable to frying whenever possible, except when using in other dishes, such as casseroles, etc.\u00a0\u00a0You don't mention dairy - but try to get enough to get at least 3 servings of low/no fat dairy daily.\u00a0\u00a0This includes milk, yogurt, cheese, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Also, eggs are high in protein for very few calories.\u00a0\u00a0Also very important, is to limit your portion sizes.\u00a0\u00a0It's a good idea to keep a food diary (MedHelp has an excellent one) so you can see exactly how many calories you are consuming each day.For exercise - you might do best to walk since you have arthritis, but there are other exercises that you can work into, that might even help your arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0A brisk 30 minute walk per day is great or aim for around 10,000 steps per day - you'd need a pedometer to know for sure.\u00a0\u00a0If you can't do a full 30 minute walk at one time, break it up into 3 - 10 minute walks.\u00a0\u00a0You can also do a computer search for exercise videos that you can watch for free - YouTube and spark people both have some.\u00a0\u00a0Yoga is fantastic - it's low impact and helps strengthen your core muscles, plus stretching and strength.\u00a0\u00a0An exercise and weight tracker is good also (MedHelp has good ones).Just a few suggestions to think about and research.\u00a0\u00a0You are right that losing weight could bring down your cholesterol levels, but can't guarantee you could get off med.\u00a0\u00a0Eating right and losing weight, would also help with the diabetes - again can't say for sure you could get off med, but it might help to cut down - I'm not a doctor, so I can't know for sure.Good luck and keep posting so we know how you are doing.",
