    "question": "Hello, my name is Nicole.\u00a0\u00a0I just turned 23.\u00a0\u00a0I have had type 2 diabetes since I was 9.\u00a0\u00a0Exactly, a week before my birthday about 2 months ago I had a TIA in my sleep.\u00a0\u00a0Didn't know it for a couple of days but finally got to the doctor and had the catscan.\u00a0\u00a0Side effects were pretty extreme:\u00a0\u00a0I lost all strength in my right arm(I couldn't handle anything) and some in my leg, (I limped for a while feeling like when I walked it would give out on me), I had problems talking (slurred alot as if I was drunk or something) That's exactly how I felt for the first couple of days, just disoriented and in slow motion.\u00a0\u00a0Well all in all, it lasted for about 2 weeks, I don't have insurance so everything comes out pocket and the doc gave me some really simple exercises to do for rehab and within a week of doing those it was fine I felt like myself again for awhile, but for the past week or so, I have been having some problems:\u00a0\u00a0I don't even know what to call it but hopefully there's someone out there that might be able to tell me if one has anything to do with the other: Randomly, I get this feeling on my right side no matter if I'm standing up or sitting down, where I lose all strength if I am standing I feel like I will faint and I sit where ever I am,\u00a0\u00a0It happened when I was brushing my teeth this morning and I automaticly dropped my toothebrush...then again this afternoon coming out of the store, I ran into an old friend and just standing there on the sidewalk I felt it again and just sat right down on the ground until it passed, which was only about a minute, never lasts much longer than a minute or two and then just goes away and I'm fine, but I'm really concerned and I have another appointment this week but like I said I was hoping someone out there could relate It has been about a week this has been going on and it's steadily everyday an average of 3-4 times a day...I have heard there are permanent side effects to having a stroke and if that's so do you think it's possible that's what this is?\u00a0\u00a0I have done my absolute best to take care of myself with my health I've been on my own for quite some time, almost 6 years.\u00a0\u00a0I work hard just to get by, and it's just that I'm really scared because this is effecting my performance at work",
