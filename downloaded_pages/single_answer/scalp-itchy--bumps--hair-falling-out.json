Now I have large bald spots. I thought the hair loss was thyroid related but now I'm not so sure. My scalp has bumps all over, some small red and some large like whelps, very itchy!! To the point I can't sleep. My ears are itchy now. Inside and out!! I will put a picture on here if I can. Please!!! If anyone knows what is causing this I need help!!!",
