            "answer": "Hi, I understand your anxiety. But neurological assessment follows a particular pattern. Like if an area of the brain is affected, it causes certain results peripherally. In the absence of this, it is difficult to say that the symptoms are due to TIA or stroke. And if you are on controlled substances, the symptoms can be attributed to these medications in the absence of positive findings on MRI.Either way, even if your symptoms are due to TIAs, therapy for TIAs is focused on controlled high risk factors like diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Also, smoking is a high risk factor and should be avoided. Besides this blood thinners are given to improve blood supply to the brain. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance. Regards.",

    "question": "I have been having episodes of falling with injuries.\u00a0\u00a0My son took me to ER and when MD saw\u00a0\u00a0meds I was on he automatically said over medicated. I gave the pain meds to my son to give me if needed. He knew I wasn't\u00a0\u00a0overmedicated. My pain doctor and my psychiatrist both said not overmedicated. Was just easy diagnosis due to my meds. Said if they went with same symptoms they would really look to see what problem was. I was concerned because I drove around in metro area for 2 hours and most I don't remember. Had 13 y/o son with me. My 2 doctors said they wanted me to see a neurologist. I did only thing that showed was vascular changes in MRI brain w/o contrast. Neurologist disagreed with ER MD's. was not related to being overmedicated. With my unlimited funds I would not press to find answers for the part I have to pay that Medicare doesn't pay is busting my budget. When I have these \"spells\" my legs feel like an octopus legs look. Other times I will be writing a check and it becomes illegible. I have to get someone else to complete. During these times when I get shaky my speech gets to where I can't get the words out that I ant to say. My thoughts won't come out. I can't even get the whole word out. Could this be TIA's or seizures. What does vascular changes in the brain. It is really depressing. I am only 58 y/o. First grandchild that is 2 weeks old and my son and his wife are afraid to leave him with me. To be honest I am afraid also. Please if MD out here what does this sound like? Awaiting an answer. Anything that can shed some light on my situation is gladly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0 mommy52",
