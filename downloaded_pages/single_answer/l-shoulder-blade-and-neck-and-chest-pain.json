            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your pain. Possibilities that may need to be considered include infections/ inflammations, bursitis, tendonitis, arthritis, capsulitis, ligament/ tendon tears, growths/ tumours, nerve impingement, avascular necrosis, fractures, dislocations, respiratory tract infections etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an orthopedician for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. Meanwhile you may try some tylenol/ OTC NSAIDS and see if these are helpful for pain relief.Hope this helps.Take care!",
