            "answer": "Hi!Conditions causing dry mouth can cause drying up of spit and also cause bleeding from the mucosa.Dry mouth could be the side effect of any medication that you could be taking. It could be due to Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome but this will also cause dry eyes. GERD or reflux disease too can cause similar symptoms. A generalized dehydration too can cause these problems. Iron and vitamin deficiency, fungal infection, hypertension, diabetes, strokes and transient ischemic attacks, anemia, smoking all cause dry mouth. Poor oral hygiene is another cause. Nerve damage due to some trauma or surgery can be another cause.A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
