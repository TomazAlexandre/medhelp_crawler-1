            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Esophageal dysmotility can cause breathlessness. It can be caused by diabetes mellitus. Hope Asthma has been ruled out. Diabetes mellitus can cause autonomic neuropathy and consequent slower motility of the intestinal tract. Medications to promote motility may help in emptying the intestines by promoting motility. Discuss about these medications with your doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "My husband is 49 years old, smoke free for 5 1/2 years, has esophageal dysmotility for 6 years, has all the test done for that and was told by gastro that there is nothing he can do for him. The muscles have almost stopped working.Now, as of 2 weeks ago, he started having severe shortness of breath and pain in his left side. Took him to the ER and they immediately ran an EKG and chest XRay, both normal, blood panel was also good. Went to dr that next Tuesday and she put him on Omeprazole in case of silent reflux, that his throat was irritated. He does a lot of clearing of his throat from the dysmotility, possible reason why, anyway, he got worse, so, she called in an antibiotic and she sent him to a Cardiologist. He did another EKG and then did an stress echo, both were normal. Cardio said possibly Pleurisy, but, he has not other symptoms of it. The shortness of breath is triggered by heat. He has worked outside all of his life. As soon as he's outside, he starts having trouble. He's gotten better on how long he can stay out and then goes inside to sit down until it's gone and then goes back out. The chest pain is just below his left nipple and goes around the side and to his back, just below the shoulder bone. He is unable to take a deep breath and the pain is pretty bad at the time of \"attack\". He's given up on drs as they have all acted as though he's faking, seriously! This man is never sick, never misses work and never goes to the dr unless he is scared. I have known him for 29 years and have taken him to the ER\u00a0\u00a0only 3 times and to the dr about 10. There is something wrong and I can't find anyone to help us!! Is there anyone else that knows what this might be from experience?",
