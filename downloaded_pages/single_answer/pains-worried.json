            "answer": "I am sorry that you have been feeling so poorly.I recommend that you see your doctor about your anxiety and other symptoms. You should have it checked out to make sure that all of your symptoms are addressed and treated appropriately. If there is another cause other than your anxiety, you want to make sure that you find the cause so it can be treated appropriately. Additionally, if your anxiety is the cause of all your symptoms, it is effecting the day to day quality of your life and needs to be addressed. Your doctor may have suggestions for counseling and/or medication to help you manage your anxiety.I hope this helps.Cathy",

    "question": "Hi I'm a 19 year old female that has been suffering from anxiety for 3 months. These past 2 month I have been getting tiny aches in body all over they last from 5 seconds to 2 minutes. They aren't very painful just quite distressing and worrying. I don't feel sick and I still have the energy and it doesn't stop me from doing anything. Also I have had a bladder infection which lasted a week and a couple days after I went to the toilet and it stung again. Also I get shooting pains in the side of my head they are like the aches in my body not that painful but uncomfortable and I panic straight away they come and go one day I don't get them but then the next I do it happens from a couple to a few times a day. Ever since I was like 13 I suffered from migraines and headaches. But can't remember having anything like this. There is also a few people in my family that have diabetes and I also keep thinking I have diabetes as I do have some symptoms but I have never got round to going to get tested. Can someone help thanks",
