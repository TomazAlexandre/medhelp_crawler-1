    "question": "Dear Dr.,For a long time I have been a low energy person. About 2 years ago I had a glucosetolerance curve done and the result was slightly over 300 after 2hs of ingesting sugar water.I went to a diabetes specialist and was told I have diabetes but it was not clear what kind becauseI tend to have hypoglycemia more than hyper.Then another physician ordered a battery of tests including t3 t4 tsh glycemia, post brandial glycemia,and antibody tests including anti thyroglubulin, TPO, anit gad etc (I am in Argentina and I don't knowwhat you call these tests in the states but I imagine it is similar)Anyway, today my anti thyroid peroxidase came back at 232 with a normal value of up to 5.Does this mean I have Hashimoto's disease? The new doctor ordered tests for celiac disease which is apparentlyassociated with hashimoto's but I have been eating gluten all my life with no problems.My parents are both diabetic and at one point a doctor thought Imight have MODY diabetes.What do you think this could be?Thanks in advance!",
