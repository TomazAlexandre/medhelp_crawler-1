            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms that you are having, they sound like boils or cysts. Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. The bacterial skin infection can be transmitted by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle. Apply warm compresses on the boil and then clean the site thoroughly by topical antiseptics. Then apply some topical antibiotic cream like Bactroban or Neosporin if you are not allergic to any of them. If the symptoms are severe then oral antibiotics and incision and drainage may be needed. Recurrent boils are commonly found in diabetes, disorders of the immune system, malnutrition, poor hygiene and exposure to harsh chemicals that irritate the skin. So you should also get your blood sugar levels estimated. You can get fasting blood sugar levels and post prandial blood sugar levels estimated to check your status of diabetes.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing..",

    "question": "I keep developing lumps/bumps on my back filled with a *****/blood mixture. Sometimes they're quite painfull and othertimes they give me no issues what so ever. I've had three surgerys now to drain them but they keep reappearing. Biopsies come back negative for any infection. I've been tested for diabetes, hepatitis, golden staph and HIV all negative. Antibiotics don't clear them up and I'm currently on minomycin which doesn't seem to be working after six weeks. I've had multiple consults with surgeons, infectious disease specialist and dermatologist but still no specific answer on the cause. I'm still being treated by a dermatologist but they still have no answers and just continue to cut me open to drain these things so that they heal. The last theory they had was epidermal cysts but I'm not so sure noting how many I'm getting and that it's only started occuring in the last six months (I'm 24 yr old male if that helps).\u00a0\u00a0Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.",
