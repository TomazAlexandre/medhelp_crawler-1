            "answer": "Hello Jonnie,Welcome to our Pain Management Forum. I am glad that you found us and took the time to post. I am sorry to hear about your knee pain and swelling.Unfortunately you don't offer a lot of information. Have you seen your physician? If so what did he/she have to say about your symptoms?Are you in general good health? Do you have diabetes, arthritis or heart disease? Any of these could account for your symptoms.....as could other conditions. I have no great diagnosis....this must come from your physician.Is this dependant edema, meaning when your legs are down the swelling appears....or when your feet are up the edema greatly decreases? When you press down on the swollen tissue does it indent? If so how quickly does it return to normal? Do you have increased warmth or redness? Does the area feel \"spongy\" to touch?Whatever you may have you certainly need to consult your PCP, as soon as you can. This could be a serious condition or it may not be. Only your physician can provide you with the correct answers.In the meantime try to keep your effected areas elevated. It's usually recommended that you keep the part above your heart frequently through out the day...or at least even with your heart. Avoiding sodium intake until you consult your PCP can not hurt. I would call at the very least on Monday, talk to your PCP nurse and ask for guidance. Hopefully they will get you in quickly. If it is very pronounced and/or painful you may want to visit your local Urgent Care Clinic or ER today.I hope you will keep in touch with us and let us know how you are doing. I will look forward to hearing from you with interest. Best of luck to you.Take Care,~Tuck",
