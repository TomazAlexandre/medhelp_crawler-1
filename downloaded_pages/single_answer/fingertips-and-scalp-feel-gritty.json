            "answer": "HiWas your doctor able to mention that your scalp actually feels gritty?Have you been taking any medications, supplements or other drugs lately?I would suggest that you have your Vitamin B6 and B12 levels assessed as these vitamins may cause nerve related symptoms when deficient. If there is no problem with the scalp, then this would appear to be nerve related. A complete physical and neurological examination by\u00a0\u00a0a neurologist may help.",

    "question": "My fingertips and scalp feel gritty or sandy. Everything that I touch feels sandy to fingertips. Feeling is more pronounced when touching areas with hair. My physician has ruled out nerve damage and I have never been diagnosed with diabetes. Do you have any ideas as to what might be going on. Also, does this seem like a problem for which I should seek a dermatologist? Thanks.",
