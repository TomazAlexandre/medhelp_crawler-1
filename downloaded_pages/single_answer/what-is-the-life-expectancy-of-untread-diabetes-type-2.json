    "question": "I'm trying to find an honest answer (no sugar coating - no pun intended) for my question.\u00a0\u00a0My husband is a Type 2 diabetic and refuses to go to the doctor to get assistance for this or his other medical conditions.\u00a0\u00a0His last to sugar reading since APRIL are 368 in August and 670 in April!\u00a0\u00a0He refuses to take it more often advising that: 1- he knows when it's high!\u00a0\u00a02- He can control it.\u00a0\u00a0This as you might imagine is causing other complications.\u00a0\u00a0Hypertension 180/140.\u00a0\u00a0His response: His work and our children are causing it.\u00a0\u00a0Sleep Apnea, he stops breathing for 18 seconds and increasing (or should I say decreasing) in length between breaths all the time.\u00a0\u00a0His answer: he doesn't need as much o2 as everyone else.\u00a0\u00a0When he can't get to sleep, he has a beer and then can \"sleep\".\u00a0\u00a0My sense is that he's going into a coma from high blood sugar!?!Yes he has an irregular heart beat.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes skipping every other beat.\u00a0\u00a0And will pound/restart hard enough that he wakes up screaming.\u00a0\u00a0I can also feel his heart beat through his chest cavity.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, he's having trouble seeing.\u00a0\u00a0How bad?\u00a0\u00a0He's not able to see a stamp on an envelope OR peoples faces and expressions as they walk by or he's talking with them.\u00a0\u00a0He claims this is because of all the time he is on the computer (his work).Yes I've tried talking to him about those I know that were amputees, that \"doesn't apply to him\".\u00a0\u00a0I say yet!!! I've tried talking to him about our children and leaving them behind.\u00a0\u00a0NO IMPACT.\u00a0\u00a0When his sugar was 670 I finally got him to go to the doctors/er and his response when we left was, \"see I knew they wouldn't do anything\" and \"they think it's the I.V. that lowered it.\u00a0\u00a0I'm at a loss as to what to do or say.\u00a0\u00a0His denial and defenses are way to HIGH to receive me (or anyone else IE: his mother, sisters, pastor etc.).\u00a0\u00a0So, I'm now looking at how long he's got left.\u00a0\u00a0He's had it for around 10 years and the only thing I've been able to find is for a 55 year old man.\u00a0\u00a0He's had it since at least 40, so age 55 doesn't count/apply unless I can have a formula for someone that is younger and what impact that gives from diagnosis.I know this isn't a pleasant topic, but I need to make \"plans\".\u00a0\u00a0From what I can tell, he's probably going to have an MI or CVA, both of which run in his family!!!\u00a0\u00a0Any and all help would/is greatly appreciated!!!Thanks!!!",
