            "answer": "Hi,This sounds like a nerve related problem. At this point, we can not exactly tell what could be causing this. I suggest that you seek consult with your neurologist for a complete neurologic and physical examination. This may not be something urgent however,I do understand that this could be discomforting.Have you any other associated conditions like diabetes for instance?Other differentials to consider will be hormonal imbalance like thyroid problems and nutritional deficiencies like vitamin B6 and B12 deficiencies. Do you\u00a0\u00a0follow a particular diet for the moment?",
