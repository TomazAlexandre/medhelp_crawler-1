            "answer": "Hi!Usually Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis affects small- and medium-sized blood vessels. Aorta is not a common site of affliction. Mainly the blood vessels of kidney, lung and skin are affected. Heart and aorta is usually spared. Hence, it could be atherosclerosis of the aorta, which is unlikely to be related to the inflammation of blood vessels in Wegner\u2019s.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss with your doctor. It may be worthwhile to get your cholesterol, thyroid and diabetes status checked. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
