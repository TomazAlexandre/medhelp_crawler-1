            "answer": "Hi!Generally a high ANA titre indicates an autoimmune disease (SLE, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, scleroderma, polymyositis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, dermatomyositis, primary biliary cirrhosis, Addison disease, Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus). Mixed connective tissue disorders also cause a high ANA. What is important is the pattern of ANA staining: homogenous, speckled, or nucleolar. Rheumatoid arthritis is a possibility that needs to be ruled out by doing RA factor and pattern of staining as you have pain in your hands. Depending on the pattern of ANA staining, other antibody tests will have to be done.\u00a0\u00a0You can probably consult a rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",
