            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.It is unlikely to be hernia. The \u2018sore\u2019 on your scrotum could be due to diabetes, dermatitis, sebaceous cysts, certain medications and sexually transmitted diseases like herpes simplex infection. Alcoholism and smoking could further contribute to this. Please consult your primary care physician for further evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
