    "question": "I asked my doctor last week to check me for diabetes since I 've been feeling bad lately and it's a fear of mine since it runs on both sides of my family. My blood work came back no concern of diabetes but my liver count was extremely high at 743. I don't drink or take meds on a regular basis do I have reason to be worried?",
