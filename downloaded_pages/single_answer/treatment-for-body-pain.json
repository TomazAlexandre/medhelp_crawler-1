            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Eat a healthy diet, take multivitamins and increase fluid intake. However, this may or may not help. The cause of your symptoms needs to be analyzed. It could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In women it can be due to hormonal disturbances related to PCOD/menopause and in men it can be due to low testosterone.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
