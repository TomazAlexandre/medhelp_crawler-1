            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Excessive thirst is called Polydipsia. It can be due to several causes. The treatment will depend on the cause. Hence first the cause has to be found out. Polydipsia can be primary or secondary. It can also be psychogenic. One can feel very thirsty for hours together after a spicy or salty meal. Diarrhea, excessive sweating, exposure to excessive heat and sun can all cause polydipsia. This can also be the result of diseases like diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Heart, liver and kidney failure and also certain medications cause excessive thirst.In your son\u2019s case along with other symptoms, you need to rule out hyperthyroidism and diabetes insipidus for sure. There can be pituitary tumors too causing polydipsia, resulting in twitches and tremors. It can also be a transient ischemic attack or TIA or mini stroke.Electrolyte disturbance, hyperparathyroidism and Vit D and Vit B12 deficiency should also be ruled out. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
