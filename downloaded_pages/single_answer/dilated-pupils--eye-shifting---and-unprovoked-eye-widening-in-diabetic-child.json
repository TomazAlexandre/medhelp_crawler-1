    "question": "My 9 year old daughter was diagnosed with diabetes 5 years ago, vitiligo 2 years ago, hypothyroidism 1 month ago, and autoimmune-related hives 1 week ago.\u00a0\u00a0She experienced one seizure 3 years ago that was diagnosed as diabetic-related after an EEG failed to reveal any abnormalities.Five days ago I noticed that her eyes would involuntarily shift to the upper right and at times widen and shift upward while she was listening to someone talk or quietly watching television.\u00a0\u00a0I've also noticed that her eyes seem to be unusually dilated.\u00a0\u00a0When I informed her endocronologist of these symptoms, he claimed it was most likely a direct effect of swelling to the musles after a severe breakout of hives which was accompanied by swelling to the face 4 days ago.\u00a0\u00a0She has not had hives in 2 days, and the shifting of the eyes, eye dilation and frequent eye widening are still present.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any idea what may be happening and could you please advise me on what action I need to take at this time?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much for your time.",
