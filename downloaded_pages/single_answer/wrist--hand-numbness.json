    "question": "Is it true that numbness in the hands , wrists, and arms can be a symptom of diabetes? Because I have real bad numbness and my wife thinks it might be something more then carpal tunnel due to the fact that I drink a lot of Coke and eat a lot of sweets. I am also about 25 or so pounds over weight. HELP ME!!!!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0I have not slept more then an hour straight for 5 years!!!!!!!!!P.S. are there any other ways to test for diabetes then blood work?, because I'm afraid to let any one stick a needle in me, what with HIV and stuff.",
