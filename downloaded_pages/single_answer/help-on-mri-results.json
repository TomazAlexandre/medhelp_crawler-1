            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.It is difficult to tell what the MRI read means. There are multiple causes for so called plaques (or white matter lesions) in the brain. Most often, these are due to what is called \"chronic small vessel disease\", literally meaning diseased small vessels that supply blood flow to the brain. This is not an uncommon process in the brain and increases with age. This is not a disease in and of itself but rather is a reflection of unhealthy blood vessels, damaged by years of plaque build-up. This is most often due to a combination of several factors including the following: high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol. If these factors are well controlled, the damage to the brain can be stabilized and further damage prevented. This is what the radiologist was discussing at the end.Other causes of plaques in the brain can be migraine. People with migraine often have plaques on their MRI that are of unclear cause or significance.Other causes of plaques on MRI can usually be distinguished based on history and symptoms, such as symptoms of neurologic deficit (for example arm weakness or difficulty walking etc). These can also be distinguished based on the MRI appearance. These include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, other demyelinating disease, and inflammatory processes such as vasculitis.Why did you have the MRI ordered? If you have neurological symptoms, it would be a good idea to see a neurologist to discuss in the context of the MRI findings.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "What does this report mean.. Do i need to see neurologist? My primary is suggesting tooMultiple nonspecific cerebral white matter lesions are mostly stable,probably with minimal increase in number or size of these lesions. Thedifferential diagnosis for these includes but is not limited todemyelinating disease, migraine headache lesions, and Lyme disease.Unless the patient has risk factors, chronic microvascular ischemicdisease is considered unlikely.",
