            "answer": "Hi, the nerve innervating (supplying) the thumb, the index finger and the middle fingers is the median nerve. This can get compressed in the wrist, leading to numbness of these areas leading to a condition called Carpel Tunnel Syndrome. The nerve can get compressed due to obesity, Diabetes Mellitus, hypothyroidism, arthritis, pregnancy and trauma. Would advise you to consult your primary care physician who may do a neurological assessment and may ask for Nerve conduction Studies to detect lesions in the nerves. And you should not keep thinking about sleeplessness, as this in turn promotes insomnia and it becomes a vicious cycle. Condition yourself that you can relax and that you can sleep well. Regards.",
