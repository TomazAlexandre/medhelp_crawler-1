            "answer": "I'm not a doctor, but I really think she's exhibiting a number of signs: thirst, frequent urination. Ofcourse, sweating reminds me of hypoglycemic reactions, and not the elevated bloodsugars that go with a diabetic diagnosis, but when we're young and diagnosed our pancreas does go through a \"honeymoon\" period where it begins to slow down, so a new diabetic's bloodsugar isn't always extrememly high. Nonetheless, I'm hoping that you've contacted her pediatrician and that they will lead you in the right direction.Best,c",

    "question": "My 18 month old daughter sweats excessively during the night, to the point that i have to get her another pillow and not to mention, turn the air down to where me and my other daughter freeze. She also has been urinating alot more than usual. During the night she would only go through one diaper, she now goes through at least 5 diapers. she is waking up wanting something to drink every two hours and during the day she constantly has to have something to drink. this has been going on for about 2 weeks now. are these signs of diabetes? or what could possibly be going on with her? Thanks for any info.",
