            "answer": "Enalapril is a beta blocker which is for blood pressure. Are you on it for that or for a side effect pill? That could be changed. Geodon is not usually that sedating. Abilify would be another option. Effexor is a standard SSRI anti-depressent but there are other ones as well. Lithium is very sedating for some people. Lamictal would be less so. Synthroid is for thyroid conditions or bipolar depression? The first you would need it for. The second it could be changed over. Zocor is for cholesterol and needed. You can get the mood stabilizers adjusted. You don't have narcolepsy. These are sedating medications. And as I tell everyone as for anti-psychotics, the future generations of them will not create sedation, motor movements, tardive dyskinesia or diabetes and promote a fuller recovery. I am on glycine, a glutamate antagonist in Phase II FDA study. For information google \"Dr. Javitt, glycine\"and there are mood stabilizers that are approved off label that a mood disorders specialist would know about:http://www.psycheducation.org/depression/meds/moodstabilizers.htmYou need to see a mood disorders specialist or psychopharmocologist and have your medications adjusted for sedation and other side effects as well.",
