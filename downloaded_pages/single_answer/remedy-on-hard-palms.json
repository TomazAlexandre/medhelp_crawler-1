            "answer": "Your problem may be hereditary ( the hard skin on palms ) or it could be caused by syphilis, touching arsenic , or from diabetes.A callus is formed when there is constant pressure and rubbing...such as shoveling, playing musical instruments, chopping wood, climbing, etc.I have them from constantly gardening without gloves on.I think they show character, and that I'm a hard worker.\u00a0\u00a0I'm female by the way. lolSometimes they CAN become quite painful. Watch for any cuts/abrasions. If they start to \"leak\" a clear fluid or pus see a doctor.You could try applying balms made for cow utters on your hands. You could also try Red Barn ointment ( or something similar ) and covering your hands with rubber or latex gloves over night.Gently rub at them with an emery board ( nail file ) before soaking them in hot, soapy water as well.",
