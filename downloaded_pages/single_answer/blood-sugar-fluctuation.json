    "question": "I have a 7 year old who has had high and low blood sugars with symptoms of both for a year.\u00a0\u00a0We've seen three different doctors and had a lot of lab work done.\u00a0\u00a0The lab fasting glucose was normal for the most part but at home he's gone up to 200 (not a lot of the time) and has dropped down to 50.\u00a0\u00a0I can't seem to get any answers and the doctors have all told me it is not quite normal but that there is nothing wrong with that.\u00a0\u00a0He has some blood work come back slightly high but not high enough to tell what's wrong with him or do anything about it. He urinates a lot, drinks a lot etc.\u00a0\u00a0But will fluctuate depending on the day. Does anyone have any ideas about what else we can do??",
