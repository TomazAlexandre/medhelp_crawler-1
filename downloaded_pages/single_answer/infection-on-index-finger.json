            "answer": "Hello,In my opinion,you should consult a doctor or your PCP.If there is any infection of the finger,then pus has to be drained by surgical incision aseptically and appropriate antibiotics are to be prescribed.Although warm compresses can help in relief but drainage of the pus is more important.Till that time pls clean the wound with dettol and maintain hygiene.Recurrent infections are more common when there is incomplete healing,in unhygienic environment, diabetes,obesity,malnutrition, taking corticosteroid medications prescribed for another disorder or condition, a weakened immune system and in heavy smokers.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted in case of additional queries.",
