    "question": "Here's to start off with a simple bio about myself. I'm 18 years old and female. I'm prescribed to Vyvanse 30 mg, Lexapro 30 mg, Wellbutrin 300 mg, Risperidone .25 mg, Sprintec birth control, and Formula 303 muscle relaxants. I haven't experienced my current symptoms, however, until this past week, plus I've been on these medications for quite some time. Over the past week these have been my symptoms: severe dizziness when moving my eyes, extreme hunger, recent weight gain (probably due to always being hungry), constant headaches centered in my brainstem area, severe neck stiffness, frequent urination, eye pain and light sensitivity, and just an overall \"drugged\" feeling. Sometimes it makes me sick to walk, my shins have felt like they might just break and collapse. I'm having a hard time concentrating and an even harder time make my thoughts and words connect so that they are coherent and make sense. I always feel in pain and every activity is a struggle. If anyone could help with any ideas of what this might be, it would be so greatly appreciated. I just want to feel normal again. i forgot to add that in the past several months, my left breast has been lactating and i've had more discharge than usual. i thought that i was pregnant, and i also thought that's what my recent symptoms were, but the tests are negative. my symptoms mentioned in this and my last post are increasing in severity every day. any advice would help so much",
