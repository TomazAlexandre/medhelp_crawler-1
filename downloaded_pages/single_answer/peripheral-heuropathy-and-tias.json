            "answer": "Dear Al:Yes, in some cases there is a common etiology.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, diabetes can cause a peripheral neuropathy and also predispose a patient to having TIA (athrosclerosis).\u00a0\u00a0Alcoholism can cause a peripheral neuropathy and also predispose to TIA via malnutrition.\u00a0\u00a0One needs to know what the underlying problem is before you can link up a peripheral neuropathy and stroke.\u00a0\u00a0Breast cancer can lead to metastic lesion in the brain and the chemotherapy can cause a peripheral neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I would pursue the latter.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your neurologist.Sincerely,CCF neuro MD",

    "question": "My sister in law has a serious case of peripheral neuropathy reaching up to her knees and affecting her fingers. Tests at the Mayo clinic were unable to reveal cause. Last week she sufferd soem TIA's and now has a slight speech imparment - slow to express herself. Test at her hospital have failed to identify a cause - all arteries were clear. Is there a connection between TIA's and peripheral neuropathy? She is also in the hospital for an operation to remove an abdominal mass that is believed to have been caused by aggressive chemo and radiation therapy for her breast cancer.Al",
