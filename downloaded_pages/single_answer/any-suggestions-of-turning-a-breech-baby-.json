    "question": "I am 37+3 and I am getting induced on Monday at 38 weeks because I have Diabetes... My baby is still breeched and I'm afraid that the ECV will not be successful. I really don't want to have a C-Section! I have been doing pelvic tilts/ inversions for a week now and she still hasn't moved... Anyone who has had an experience like this or know of any successful exercises or remedies I could try? This is my 1st baby. I am really praying for a vaginal birth. Thank you so much!",
