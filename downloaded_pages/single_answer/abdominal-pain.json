    "question": "Hello, I apologize ahead of time that this isn't related to liver transplant, but I had a hard time finding a forum to put this question in.\u00a0\u00a0I hope maybe you could comment...\u00a0\u00a0 I'm a 32 yr old male, moderately over weight....but I don't have diabetes or anything like that.\u00a0\u00a0 I last had a CBC/comprehensive metabolic panel done maybe 4 months ago.Maybe 5 days ago, I developed this aching mild pain in my far right abdomen, maybe 5 or less inches below my right ribs.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If I lay on my back and press around on everything it doesn't increase pain or feel anything unusual,\u00a0\u00a0but what does increase pain is breathing in deeply,\u00a0\u00a0breathing in at all against pressure from my hand,\u00a0\u00a0or especially if I strain like I'm having a bowel movement (will radiate into my right arm if I strain).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have absolutely no other obvious symptoms that I can see.\u00a0\u00a0My appetite is fine, no fever, no obviously unusual bowels,\u00a0\u00a0 can you tell me what this sounds like?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am seeing my doctor in a few weeks anyway, but until then??",
