    "question": "Taking the first gestational diabetes test... Again. We were late to our appointment last time because of crazy traffic and I'd already had the juice in me for over an hour so now I'm starving myself again. We for up at 5;30 this morning to make it about 75 miles away and Denver traffic is terrible so hopefully almost three hours is long enough this time! On the plus side we get our 3d/4d scan after :)",
