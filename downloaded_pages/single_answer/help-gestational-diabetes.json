            "answer": "I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes at 28 weeks. I am on a diet of 45g carbs for breakfast, 15g carbs for a snack, 60g carbs for lunch, 15g carbs for lunch, 60g carbs for dinner, and then 15g carbs for a snack right before bed.\u00a0\u00a0Each meal and snack should always contain protein. Following this diet I have had a easy time keeping my numbers under control. My fasting number was always slightly elevated so I was out on a small dose of insulin at night.I am now 37 weeks and I have had no other complications and my baby was just measured earlier this week and my baby measured just under 6lbs. So definitely not a big baby.Good luck with everything, gestational diabetes is not a scary thing as long as you follow the diet.",
