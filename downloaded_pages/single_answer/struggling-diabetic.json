            "answer": "Hi. I thought I responded to your post but don't see my response. You might want to check into another website called *********.com which has a lot more traffic than this one. A frequent topic on that website is how to pay for diabetes supplies and if you post on there you will get lots of useful responses. Best of luck to you. I am terrified by the thought of another Type 1 who can't afford their insulin. I hope you find some good suggestions.Zoe",
