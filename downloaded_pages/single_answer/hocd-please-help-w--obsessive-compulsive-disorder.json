            "answer": "HeyI know what your going through. I have OCD and I went through this too. I have always been obsessed with men my entire life and then one day in high school out of no where I just started getting these thoughts what if I'm becoming a lesbian. I was so confused because I didnt know what was going on because all my life I had thought of nothing but boys and all the sudden I was questioning my sexuality out of no where. I would get stressed out anytime I thought a girl was pretty because I thought that meant I was a lesbian but then I did some research and although I have never heard of HOCD before I realized it was my OCD because I realized I have never been attracted to a girl, never wanted to be sexual with a girl and never wanted to be with a girl so that must mean I wasnt a lesbian. It was hard to push the thoughts out of my head but I when the thoughts would come I would sing a song or think of something and they would come back but I push them out again agian and again until they finally stopped. It is your OCD just remember that!!!! Try different to push it out of your head. Your focusing on it thats why it wont stop but they will. Hope this helped.",
