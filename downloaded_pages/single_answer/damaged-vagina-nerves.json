            "answer": "Are you and your partner spending enough time on foreplay, or are you going straight for intercourse? Many women need a lot of foreplay before having intercourse or you may not have enough natural lubricant.I don't think you damaged nerves by having the yeast infection for a long time. I think you need to know your own body and what you like and don't like. You and your partner can both do this together.",

    "question": "Hello, i just started having sex at the end of last year, i am 20 yrs old btw. I do not enjoy it at all. It just feels like friction and is very uncomfortable. I just recently was diagnosed with diabetes but before that i had a yeast infection which i didnt treat for more than a year. Could that have damaged the nerves in my vagina or something because it was really itchy and i did scratch. I have tried using lubricant, it temporarily takes away the discomfort but i do not feel any sensations at all. Please advise",
