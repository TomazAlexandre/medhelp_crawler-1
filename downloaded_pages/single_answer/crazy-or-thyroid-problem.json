    "question": "14 yrs ago after the birth of my second child I developed carpel tunnel and became a very emotional person. About 1 year later treated for anxiety/depression due to severe financial problems. Seemed to get my act together then five years ago I developed extreme fatigue and was told it was motherhood. Since then for every complaint I have I am told it is depression. Have been on several anti-depression medicines and just become a zombie (do what I must then sleep the rest of the time). Started having lower leg and foot aches, night sweats w/chills, anxiety and morning adrenaline rushes, very heavy painful periods and many other nuisance symptoms. Now they are saying pre-menopause and put me on low dose birth control pills. Solved chills and heavy periods and little nuisances, so I resigned myself to living with anxiety, leg pain, fatigue and night sweats. Just diagnosed with breast pre-cancer and told no birth control and need lumpectomy. Both parents are deceased but have questioned relatives and Paternal Aunt and Grandmother have Graves disease and Diabetes runs on both sides. I'm also asthmatic and have been on various steriods/cortisteroids. Is it possible these symptoms are thyroid related? GP has run thyroid tests in the past, once, TSH was borderline high 4.? but when retested I was told it was fine. Recent test TSH 3rd gen 2.33, Free T4 0.97, TPO AB <10, Gluc Low 69, MCH High 31.2, Lymphocytes low 23.6, TBIL High 1.32, ALT (GPT) low 29, BUN/CREA High 20.0, prolactin high 25.3, Estradiol high 585. Prolactin was retested at 11.2. Should I bother to see an endo?",
