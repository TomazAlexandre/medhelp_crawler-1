    "question": "My son just turned three and some concerns have been raised and i do not know if i am being overly sensitive , but here are my concerns ... my child cannot drink milk (lactose problems since birth) so he drinks apple juice that we water down as much as possible - ALL DAY LONG, he thirst is insatiable... becasue of him drinking so much, he also drinks at night in his sleep, (just like me) and he urinates all day long as well, and soaks through his diapers daily and nightly and i have to change sheets every morning - i can't take his drink away, he has to have it at night for dry mouth ... he constantly wants sweets and fruits only (typical 3 year old??) ... my mom had gestational diabetes, and type 2, i had gestational diabetes with insulin shots, and now mine is controlled by Metformin, so is it too early/young for him to be tested, and if not, do I just ask his pediatrician? if diabetes is the case i would oike to get a jump start on it for his diet and such especailly since he will be going to preschool in the fall and if i have to pack himhis own lunches, i would like to be as informed about this as i can be ahead of time ... thanks in advance for any suggestions or advice that can be given...",
