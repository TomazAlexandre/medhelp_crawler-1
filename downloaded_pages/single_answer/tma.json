            "answer": "Hi,Weight loss can be achieved by a combination of diet control or dietary modification and exercise. You should consult a dietician to prepare a diet chart according to your food habits, in such a way that nutrition is not compromised. Exercise should be such that is as per your liking so that the chances of sticking to the exercise regime are greater. Also medical conditions like diabetes, hormonal problems, and thyroid disorders should be ruled out.Hope this helps.",
