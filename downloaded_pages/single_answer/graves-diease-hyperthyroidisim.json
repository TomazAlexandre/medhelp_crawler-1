            "answer": "I was DX with Graves back in 96 and was very ill. Finally got to an ENDO Dr. who confirmed the disease. He put me on med for 1 yr and brought it under control and it resolved. He did say that it could come back at anytime. I did not have the typical signs but it was confirmed with my TSH & T4 testing. It is autoimmune and my dad had a goiter removed back in the 60s. He died a year later from a massive Heart attack. I developed Diabetes a year later and it is autoimmune too.My brother also has DM11. My daughter developed Hypothyroid two years ago in her 30s. So Family heredity?\u00a0\u00a0Please remember that this Graves CAN cause what is caused thyroid storm and is dangerous. The thyroid affects every organ in the body. I would be dealing with a ENDO Dr. for sure.",
