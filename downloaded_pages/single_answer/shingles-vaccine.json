            "answer": "Hello!Shingles vaccine has been approved by FDA for people 50 and older. It has also been recommended that anyone 60 years of age or older should receive the shingles vaccine, regardless of whether they recall having had chickenpox or not and even if one had shingles, shingles vaccine may be given to help prevent future occurrences of the disease. It is because shingles occurs commonly in the older age group and can lead to serious effects in old people. It is contraindicated for use in people suffering from diabetes, leukemia, lymphoma, and people on steroids, immunosuppressive therapy, HIV and pregnancy. It should not be used in people with history of allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or any other component of shingles .The common side effects are pain, soreness at injection site, headache and mild rash. The decision on when to get vaccinated should be made with your health care provider. Talk with your doctor and discuss all your concerns about shingles vaccine. Hope it helps.Best Wishes!",
