            "answer": "Yes, she could have been hypoglycemic due to not eating enough. I would look for symptoms of high glucose such as extreme thirst, fatigue, frequent urination, and weight loss if diabetes is present. However, hypoglycemia in a small child can be dangerous, too. You may want to check the website www.hypoglycemia.org to get some dietary tips. If it happens again, I would suggest that you take her to the doctor for some blood glucose tests.",

    "question": "I received a phone call today from my child's nursery, telling me that she had had a funny turn: she had stood still for 30 seconds clutching a paintbrush and shaking. Since I was aware that my Dad has developed diabetes in later life and having lived with a diabetic for a year when I was a student, I wondered if it might be that she is beginning to develop diabetes, or if this could just be caused by low blood sugar due to not eating enough? She only ate half her breakfast this morning and only half her lunch at nursery.Could you advise me?",
