            "answer": "Typically, blockages are not treated until they exceed 70% or if the individual is experiencing symptoms of heart disease like chest pain.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that your Uncle has diabetes puts him at a much higher risk for heart disease so it is very important that he keep his diabetes in check. His blood pressure should also be easily controlled with meds, is he on any?Based on what you wrote, I don't see why stents or bypass would not be an option however that seems a little premature given the stage of his blockages, but his doctor would know best.Hope this helps,Jon",
