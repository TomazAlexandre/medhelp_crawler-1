            "answer": "Sounds a lot like peripheral neuropathy to me.\u00a0\u00a0Mine was mild because of a wrecked-up spine from a car wreck, and then it got worse when I got chemo-induced neuropathy on top of it.\u00a0\u00a0Bad peripheral neuropathy will make it hard to grasp things with your hands, hard to walk normally, the fingers and toes hurt.\u00a0\u00a0But since the EMG said you are getting \"power\" to your extremities, then as a layperson, it's hard for me to know what might have happened to cause this problem with the nerves going into your arms and legs.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't know enough about things like diabetes, which can cause something similar to this.\u00a0\u00a0Whomever you saw for this, I do not think they are good enough, because otherwise they would have decided what might be wrong and continued to test you or at least referred you to another specialist.\u00a0\u00a0So, go to another dotor.",
