            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Were you able to see your doctor about the non-healing wound?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What type of cream did you use? How well a wound will help depends on the location, presence of medical conditions such as diabetes, age, and type of wound. Applying topical antibacterial medicine may help prevent secondary bacterial infection and helps with the healing. If symptoms persist, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "So my question is concering a scar that i have that's having a bit of trouble healingso exactly two weeks ago today i went for a skin biopsy to check for skin cancer(which in the meantime has come back clear thankfully) and\u00a0\u00a0a week ago today i got the stitches removed and the nurse remarked that it was healing pretty well. then i went about some christmas shopping and the next day i woke up and realised that the scar had opened and it scabbed over, also in case it's relevant, i realised from the pajama pants i was wearing in bed had a tiny amount of blood on them so the opening didn't cause pain/much blood loss. it hadn't become infected at all, i kept it covered, cleaned around the area and i'm using\u00a0\u00a0a cream that prevents infection.\u00a0\u00a0the scab has since come off(i didn't pick or anything) but the area doesnt seem to have healed much if at all. could me keeping it covered, using the cream be stopping the natural healing process at all?any help is much appreciated,if it doesn't heal any more over the christmas period i will go to the doctor's just looking for some advice until thenthank you",
