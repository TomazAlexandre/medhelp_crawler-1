    "question": "Resp sir,I am 49 yr old. I have -2.5 in right eye and -1.75 with -0.75 cylinder in left eye (75 degree axis) With the glasses, I have clear vision.No hypertension, recent diabetes. I have only lattice since 15 yrs and only few flotters.No other symtoms.Still retinal surgeon did barrage laser before 7 days . Barrage was done on upper part of left eye and lower part of right eye. I have one black spot at lower in left eye and flickering in lower part of left eye. could be due to vitreous traction? or likely to have some post laser crack? I am worried about it. Will it stop after sometime or can progress further? Will it resolve? If yes, how much time will it take.? I have g6pd defAfter the surgery,I read opinions of international experts on internet. As per them, only lattice degeneration without cracks or tears is not indication for laser. Was my doctor justified in doing the procedure without such indication? He did not explain me anything of the treatment put me under fear and told that the procedure had no complication at all and without informed concent did the procedure instantly.This discussion is related to/posts/Eye-Care/Laser-correction-and-Lattice-Degenration/show/883296.",
