            "answer": "Hi,Numbness in the buttocks and thigh is due to disease effecting the spinal cord in the lumbosacral region. This may happen due to damage of nerves while arising at the cord. Vertebral column disease may present initially as loss of sensations, without pain in the back. Hence it is necessary that you visit a spinal surgeon for further evaluation.Peripheral neuropathies, caused by Diabetes, hypothyroidism, vit B12 deficiency also need to be ruled out, in case your back bone is fine.Do come back with any other queriesRegards",
