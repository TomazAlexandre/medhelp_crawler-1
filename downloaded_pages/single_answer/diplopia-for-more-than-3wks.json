    "question": "i am 31yrs old male suffering from binocular diplopia.My MRI is normal, CT scan shows some sphenoid sinus which ENT doc thinks will not cause diplopia. Then I did blood work for autoimmune dieseses which came out normal, Tensilon and blood work for mysthenia greaves came normal. Only abnormal thing as per doctor is fasting blood sugar which is at 101. and he has ordered hemoglobin test for blood sugar for which results are awaiting.What might be the cause and how should i go for it. I read online that 101 is not that high level.I had diplopia 5 months back and at that time i had considerable sphenoid sinus and was put on antibiotics and prednisolone, and it got cured within 3-4 days of starting medication. So can it be sinus or diabetes.please guide me what i should doregards",
