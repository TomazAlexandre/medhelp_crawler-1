            "answer": "I'm type 2 as well and have had these shakes in the morning when my BG's were high. Not sure of the metric number but mine was about 165. This was in the beginning when I first was diagnosed and experimenting on different foods, etc. I was also new on Metformin. It may have been a combination of the meds and not eating the same foods I had been for so long. It's been over a year now and I no longer get the shakes when I do go high.For you it could be various things. If you are under the care of the dr then that is the best you can do. Try looking at the meds you take and the types of foods you eat and the times that you eat them. You can experiment with this yourself and see if that helps. It did me. Also make sure you drink enough water too. I get shaky when I don't drink water all day.",
