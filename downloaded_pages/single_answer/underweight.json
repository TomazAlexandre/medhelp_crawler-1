            "answer": "Your pediatrician should consider giving you a referral to either a Pediatric GI doc or an endocrinologist. An endocrinolgist can check your daughter for any metabolic disorders etc. SInce your child's height isnt an issue, it probably isnt a metabolic or hormone problem. A GI doc can check her for a couple things related to digestion and nutrition. Its probably just that she has a high metabolism and she eats small meals when she eats. I have a son who was very underweight for his height, and he had a short stature, also a small meal eater.He went to the GI doc and after some tests to rule out serious stuff, the doc gave him a medicine called piriactin. It is a mild safe antihistamine that stimulates appetite.My son, like your daughter, has a good appetite, he just eats small amounts at a time. But Piriactin helped him to eat more at each sitting. I added Pediasure, two a day, and also sometimes made it into a peidasure milkshake with ice cream, all recommended by the GI doc. Basically push the calories. The Dr. sent a note in to school to allow my son to have a snack around 9-10 am and we gave him extras at home. Basically, giving a snack every 2 hours or so, even something small, will help. It can be a little bit of an inconvenience, especially at school, but it worked for my son. He started gaining weight. He is now 9. He is still thin, but not extremely underweight like he was. Its hard to get a child who \"eats like a bird\" to get in extra calories.Since your daughter is having some stomach upset with milk, could be she is a little lactose intolerant. A GI doc can test her for this as well. GI docs are great with issues like this, and can get to the bottom of it for you, to help your daughter. If you have insurance that doesnt require for you to get a referral, tkae your daughter to a GI doc. If you need a referral, her pediatricain should have no problem sending her to one. Like my son, your daughter probably doesnt have a serious problem. Im glad I took my son to the GI doc, they are especially experienced in this kind of problem....One other thing though, the bedwetting you mentioned. You said they checked your daughter for diabetes. I assume they checked her urine/ kidneys...I mention this only because a common symptom in children of urinary tract infections and kidney disorders is weight loss. Combined with the new bedwetting, I would ask her pediatrician if kidney function/urinalysis tests have been doen. Those are simple, basic tests. I hope this helps, take care.MM",

    "question": "I have a 6 1/2 year old daughter who is 3'11'' but only weighs 36lbs.\u00a0\u00a0She eats 3 meals a day with some snacks in between meals; however lately she complains that her stomach hurts when she drinks milk.\u00a0\u00a0She loves to drink water, so she stays hydrated.\u00a0\u00a0Doesnt seem to go to the bathroom too many times in the day, but has wet the bed roughly 3 times this last year which is really odd for her since she's only wet the bed a total of 5 times since she was 2.\u00a0\u00a0She does come home from school and seems very tired, sometimes she naps after school. She isnt runny any fevers, nor does she vomitt.\u00a0\u00a0She is a very little eater (so is her dad).\u00a0\u00a0She does seem to stress alot so not sure if that is the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Of course as a mom I do think the worse thinking it could be diabetes, but shes was tested earlier this year and nothing showed up.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything I can do to help her gain healthy weight? Or is there something I should have the doctors test her for?\u00a0\u00a0Please help me with some ideas.\u00a0\u00a0She is so tiny that her ribs show and her spine.\u00a0\u00a0Im concerned if she were to get really sick she would have no weight to lose. Overall she is very healthy but this does concern me, especially since she was getting closer to 40 lbs and now getting farther away.",
