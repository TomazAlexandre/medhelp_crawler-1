            "answer": "Female hormones play a big part in thryoid issues although many Doctors wouldnt agree with that.With you having diabetes (you dont say type I or II) these will also wreak havoc on the thyroid levels.Metformin is one medication that counteracts with any thyroid meds (yes I know you arent on any) but this med also interferes with thyroid levels.You dont say in your posting when your last labs were for Hypo and what they were so hard to comment on them.But if you havent had recent tests, I suggest you get them done.Once the labs show HYPO...shove it in the Doctors face (sorry to be blunt) and tell him/her to fix it.You should be on a T4 med if you are HYPO and also need antibody testing too for Hashi's.Diabetes can be hard to control with Hypo and congrats for doing so well and losing the weight.Its normal for a weight loss with diabetes and then to come to a halt.You also dont say what meds you are on for the diabetes (if any).Can you post this info and maybe others can also help?In regards to FSH..thise doesnt show whether you have a Pit, tumour...this is a hormone to determine if you are post menopausal.The only 100% correct way to determine a pit. tumour is a CT scan.I had a pit. tumour removed in Marsh this year.It was found because my TSH just kept rising (Pit, Gland went into overdrive) giving impression I needed more T3 and T4 and didnt as my levels were good.I would be getting labs done, asking for a CT scan to rule out a pit. tumour.",

    "question": "Ok, this may sound like a rant, but I have to get this has really gotten me down and I have no one to talk to.\u00a0\u00a0I have been doing low carb since 2003 when i was diagnosed with PCOS and Diabetes.............In 2008, I was also diagnosed with hypothyroidism.I have been untreated for my conditions since the middle of 2008 due to relocating back to my home state of Illinois (which is very rural) and we ended up with jobs that had no insurance benefits and could not get my own insurance due to pre-existing conditions........I have gotten my Diabetes under control and some what reversed through Low Carb eating and have lost about 15 pounds.The weight loss has stopped, came to a screeching halt...........and I have stopped having TOM.\u00a0\u00a0Sure, I get the cramping and bloating, but don't get the relief from starting TOM.So, I start going to my new Doctor now that we have moved closer to the City of St Louis and landed a great job with benefits.\u00a0\u00a0My thyroid, A1C, cholesterol, fasting glucose, etc are all checked.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor prescribes me Progesterone since I haven't actually had a TOM since March.The progesterone doesn't work and he says my thyroid is in order.\u00a0\u00a0That doesn't make sense to me because when I lived in Virginia, my doctor confirmed that I was in deed hypothyroid, hence the problems losing weight.He orders more blood work due to the fact that my testosterone levels are highly elevated.\u00a0\u00a0Found out that I have Adrenal Fatigue, he still doesn't believe that I am hypothyroid though.Last week while in his office, he gives me a shot of Progesterone to bring on a TOM..............Ha, still NO TOM.When will he start listening to me that the reason I am not getting TOM is partially due to PCOS, but mostly due to hypothyroid.I am also seeing a Naturopathic Doctor, but she is waiting on the Gynecologist to see if he can get me partially lined out because she doesn't want to confuse my body even more..........The gynecologist thinks the Naturopathic Doctor is a quack.Now, I have to go get Estrogen, Prolactin and FSH checked because his thinking is that I may have a pituitary tumor or hypothalamus tumor going on.I am so frustrated, angry and upset because it seems that I know more about what is going on in my body than the Doctor knows or wants to know.All I know is that I am not going to get my health in order without a Doctor listening to me...............I don't need pain killers for chonic pain, weight loss pills for my weight issue and I don't need anti-depressants.\u00a0\u00a0I am merely depressed because I have no energy for anything.\u00a0\u00a0I need for a doctor to find the Root Cause to my issues, not a band-aid and a mask.Thanks for listening if you have read this far.",
