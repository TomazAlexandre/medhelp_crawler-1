    "question": "after we have lived out of control for so long...we have to make so many lifestyle changes to stay sober...the easy part is the detox..i know some of you going thru the detox might disagree with me. but studies show detoxing is the easy part...then the goal is to stay sober. sobriety is management...just like any disease..diabetes..high blood pressure arthritis ms any other disease requires management...part of our regiment requires goalsboundaries. admitting. acceptance. meetings. researching.getting to the root of addiction.addiction is a by product of a bigger problem...usually a mental health issue also compounded by pain... depression. being bipolar. left over trama we never got overcronic pain. maybe a disability...the list goes on. and regardless on your personal opinion aftercare is needed...take a natural disaster like a tornadoe....we don't walk away from the mess of the storm. we rebuild. and new new buildings go up in place of old ones...so why does so many people walk away from detox thinking they are done...those people have a higher relapse rate...so imagine a tornadoe hitting your house in spring...and your house had damage but not totaled ...then another one hits in fall..and totals out your house...now what do you do",
