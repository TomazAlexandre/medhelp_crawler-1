    "question": "I had my son 2 months ago almost and now I have been going through really bad pain. I was thought to have carpal tunnel but I self diagnosed myself with neuropathy and have been taking my medication. Well my new primary thought my dosage was high and sent me to the neurologist and did a nerve test and found that I have mononeuritis multiplex? on both arms and also carpal tunnel in both wrists... Gosh. Also, he said nothing will fix it but years of getting better blood sugars.. WTH??? Anyone have diabetic neuropathy and on treatment and has it gotten better in a couple months or is it taking a long time. I honestly have probably the worst pain I have ever experienced in my arms after holding my son for more then 10 minutes. I fear I will drop him because my arm goes numb completely after holding him for 20 minutes. When I wake up I feel like I have no arms at all... It ***** and I am only 26 I want to enjoy my baby boy not deal with new issues. I JUST got better from back problems while pregnant.. now this!",
