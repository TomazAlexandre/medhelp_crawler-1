            "answer": "Hello,You could be having male pattern baldness. Men who have this type of hair loss usually have inherited the trait. Other causes may be use of some drugs, infections , low testosterone levels and underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. A serum testosterone level and a biopsy (taking a small sample of cells to examine under a microscope) of your scalp may be needed to establish the correct diagnosis.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
