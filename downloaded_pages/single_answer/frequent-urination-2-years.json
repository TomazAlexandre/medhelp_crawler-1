            "answer": "You have been through quite a comprehensive workup already, including urodynamic testing as well as evaluation by several urologists.\u00a0\u00a0The tests make it unlikely that a mechanical urological problem is present.I would assume that things like a urinary tract infection as well as prostate problems have been ruled out by the urologists.You may want to consider systemic diseases - including both diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus - each which can increase the frequency of urination.Diabetes mellitus can be evaluation via sugar levels in the blood.Diabetes insipidus is a disorder where the hormone that controls water absorption is impaired.\u00a0\u00a0This can be evaluated with what's known as a water deprivation test, and can be arranged via an endocrinologist.You can discuss these options with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.http://www.straightfromthedoc.com",

    "question": "I'm at my witts end. I'm a 36 year old male. I have had frequent urination for about 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to both my G.P. and 2 urolgists. I have had bladder dissension, urodynamic studies, x-rays, and endless tests.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My condition from my urolgist at first was an infected prostate. He first did the antibotic thing for 4 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0No progress.\u00a0\u00a0Then flomax with no real improvment.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried supplements along with the flomax and achieve much better flow but no decrease in freqency.\u00a0\u00a0I have had urodynamic study, and also just had bladder dissension, with a biopsy. The biopsy was negative and I don't have intercisital cystitis (sp?)\u00a0\u00a0I have monitored my intake and measured output several times.\u00a0\u00a0When I do go, it is about 5 ounces +/-. I go 3-5 times a night, and about 15-20 times during the day.\u00a0\u00a0I also have consistant pain below my belly button with an increase when I urinate paritcularly when I am finishing.\u00a0\u00a0The urologist also thought possible hernia? I went to a general surgeon who thought maybe slight.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a P.S.A. test and that was real low.\u00a0\u00a0What should I be trying to do? I live trying to find the next bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0I can't do things with my young sons because of the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 5'11 and 170 pounds. I'm in good physical shape.\u00a0\u00a0 When I get the sensation to go it is not overpowering, just a slight feeling that peeks and if I try to ignore it it settles down a little and comes back again a little stronger.\u00a0\u00a0Urinating provides relief for a short time.\u00a0\u00a0I'm willing to try anything.\u00a0\u00a0The urolgists keep passing me off to others in their practice.\u00a0\u00a0Right now I'm desperate.\u00a0\u00a0Please any guidance at this point I would appreciate.\u00a0\u00a0Should I try a new urolgist?\u00a0\u00a0Should I try medicine for an overactive bladder?\u00a0\u00a0Could it be prostatisis?\u00a0\u00a0BPH?\u00a0\u00a0Help help help",
