            "answer": "Hello,Feeling of incomplete voiding can occur due to infection, diabetes, tumors in the bladder or prostrate, STD, excess intake of fluid, pregnancy, use of diuretics, stones in the urinary tract etc.Reduced bladder capacity, masses in the bladder can also cause increased frequency and incomplete voiding.I would suggest that you repeat a urine analysis with culture and cystometry with cystoscopy done. I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.Treatment will depend on the same.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.Kind regards.",

    "question": "I had been to the doctor becuase I was all of a sudden peeing every 45 minutes. This has beeen going on for a few months and was diagnosed by my doctor as an irratable urine syndrom. I have never has this problem before and was suprised that my doctor perscribed Vesicare (30pills) with no refill.... I notice when Im sexually active that I always have the feeling of needing to pee and will actually need to pee when I have an erection sometimes.... I notice alot of dribbly pre-*** comes out more then ususal when I masturbate (almost like a runny nose) as well.... The vesicare seemed to work but is losing its effect.. I have given a urine sample and have been cleared of an UI infection.. Im wondering if ther can be anything more seriosu like prostate cancer, prostatities or some other urinary issue.I am a male 32 years old in relativley good shape.",
