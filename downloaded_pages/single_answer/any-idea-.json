            "answer": "It really depends on the curve of your baby. If your baby is not \"straight\" it's hard to read. I'm 13 weeks and measured at 15 weeks and 1 day. Only because he was curving his body. That's what the ultrasound technician said. But who knows.",

    "question": "Has anyone measured 3 weeks early at one appointment and then at the next appointment measure right on time. At my 28 week appointment I was measuring 31 weeks and at the 30 weeks appointment I was measuring right on time and there was only a 1 pound gain in between the 2 appointments. They said it could of been from swelling but my hands feet or anything else weren't swollen. The baby weight and fluid are all fine and I don't have diabetes. Any idea what would cause me to measure so big ?",
