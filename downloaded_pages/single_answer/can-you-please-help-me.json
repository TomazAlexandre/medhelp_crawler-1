            "answer": "Hi Samina!I can appreciate your concerns. The MRI shows age related changes. The non-specific increase in brain spaces that carry the brain fluid (CSF) is due to age. The ischemic foci (regions with poor or no blood supply) can occur with age, or due to conditions like headache/migraine, MS, high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol. While you may not have any condition causing the ischemic foci, it could be due previous head trauma or due to age.Please however, consult your doctor regarding this. Also, read, play brain games, and keep your brain active. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
