    "question": "I've been on birth control (tri-sprintec) for a couple of years now and I take it pretty regularly and when I have sex I always use a condom. Yesterday I had some really sharp pains in my abdomen and stomach right after I ate. I thought it was just gas or something that I ate. The cramps went away after a couple of hours, but then I started having brown spotting so I put a tampon in. I woke up this morning and my tampon was about halfway full of brown blood and so I put another one in, and I checked a few hours later and I am still bleeding brown blood. I am now crampy again. I am supposed to start my period in a about four or five days, however I am not on my placebo pills yet, so I am concerned. Am I miscarrying? I have had spotting between periods before, however they have never lasted this long, or have I had cramps with them, so I am really concerned...",
