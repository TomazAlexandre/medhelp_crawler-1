It is best that you have this evaluated by your gynecologist or be referred to a neurologist for proper evaluation. Direct clinical or neurological examiantion and further tests may be done. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "ok so its been 4 years since i had my last child. I had two epidurals in 1 year and two years later had another. after my son was born while in the hospital i couldnt urinate and my bladder was the size of a basketball. Since then I have been numb in my vagina ( i cannot feel sex, tampons, anything) and also have a hard time controlling my bladder. I can still feel my clitorus and outer skin but no feeling inside its causing serious issues with me and my husband does anyone know what this could be and is it serious. thank you from a 27 year old female",
