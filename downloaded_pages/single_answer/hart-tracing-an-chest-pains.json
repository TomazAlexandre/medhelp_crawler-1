            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The cause for the heart attacks could be transient episodes of reduced blood supply to the heart muscle, referred to as angina. This is due to vasospasm, which is reversible. The EKG will reflect this changes but as there is no permanent narrowing of the vessels, the angiogram will not reflect this.But you should take adequate measures to prevent these changes, aim for optimum weight with regular physical exercise. Other risk factors like diabetes and hypertension need to be adequately controlled. You should consult your doctor for further advice and therapy.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
