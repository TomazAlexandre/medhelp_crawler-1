    "question": "Hi, 36 y/o male with some history of HBS with no diagnosis. About a year ago I noticed that my hands were prone to bouts of numbness. I had it checked and was dx'ed with Carpal Tunnel. The thing is both my hands are wasting...I mean loosing fat and or other soft tissue. The skin is shriveled. I now get pain in my right palm below the thumb and I've noticed wrinkling ( horizonatal ) on both hands in this area. I've also noted very thin and somewhat constorted ( is that the right word...kind of twisted ) veins showing on my palms. I am trying to figure out if this is neuropathic related as Diabetes was suggested by a Doctor in another forum here.If anyone can help, suggestions are welcome.I believe it may be autotomic neuropathy. Another couple of weeks before my Dr. appt.How is vessel neuropathy diagnosed and what is the treatment?Thanks everyone.",
