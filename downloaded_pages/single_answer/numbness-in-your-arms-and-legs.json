            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Numbness in hands and feet can be due to diabetes, Lyme\u2019s, hypothyroidism or due to premenopausal symptoms. It could also be due to spinal nerve compression, high up in cervical spine. Please ask your mother to consult her PCP and run some basic tests to rule out these possibilities.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "My mom is 40 years old and when she had my sister who is now going to be 10 in april they left her IV in way too long.. I am not sure how this could have anything to do with it but after that her feet and hands became numb constantly. It is now not only in her hands and feet but in her arms and legs also. The numbness is so bad that she cant tell weather or not she has something in her hand. I am really concerned and desperate to find an answer as to what could be wrong.",
