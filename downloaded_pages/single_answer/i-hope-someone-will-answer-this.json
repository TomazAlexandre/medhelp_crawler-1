            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Your symptoms could be due to UTI, or urinary tract infection. The infection could be at any level from bladder to ureter to kidney. It could also be due to a stone in the urinary tract.However increased frequency of urine is also seen in diabetis mellitus and diabetes insipidus. You must talk to your physician regarding all these possibilities. You would need some more tests beside urine analysis to reach a confirmed diagnosis. Very diluted urine is generally seen in diabetes insipidus.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
