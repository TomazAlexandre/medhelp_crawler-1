            "answer": "With a family history of thyroid disease, I would get tested for hypothyroidism. Usually anything over 3.0 for a TSH is suspect for hypothyroidism. Those test results are based on the newer test ranges.Chest pain and heart palpitations are common symptoms of hypothyroidism. They can also be signs of pericarditis, a disease which can sometimes accompany hypothyroidism. Sleep apnea is also a symptom of hypothyroidism. Weight gain is common with hypothyroidism.",

    "question": "In Dec. 2005 I was diagnosed with enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged spleen, and after many ct scans, mri's and follow ups with oncologist it came down to a mass that had grown from the bowel to the tip of the liver, with bile ducts in it.\u00a0\u00a0Initially the doctor had thought these were signs indicating Lymphoma, but no elevations in blood levels were found, and no cancer was found.\u00a0\u00a0No explanation could be given for what it was.\u00a0\u00a0It was removed.Also in the past I have had bouts of Palpatations,and chest pain with no explanation. Stress tests, echocardiagrams, ekg's and blood work all proved negative for heart issues.\u00a0\u00a0There is a very strong family history of Heart disease, diabetes,Thyroid disease and breast cancer in the family.\u00a0\u00a0More recently I have suffered with more chest pain which sometimes radiates to the shoulder and arm. Usually on the left side.\u00a0\u00a0The heart doctor has recommended a weight loss program, which I joined and have already lost 14 lbs in about 5 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0They have also done blood work and the crp level came out being 20 so he referred me back to my personal doctor rechecked the level and it was down to 3.\u00a0\u00a0She is also doing follow up with crp again, as well as cpk, alkaphos,rheumatiod factor, and an ESR.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what that is for and I didn't get to ask the doctor because she mailed the blood order to me.\u00a0\u00a0I have a very stressful job, and my husband is urging me to seek new employment, but I don't feel financially I can do that right now. Today I am scheduled to go for a ct scan of the heart and organs.\u00a0\u00a0They ordered 50 mg of Lopressor to slow the heart for the test and I thought they said they were giving me an IV , I would assume would be to highlight the organs.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could feel better.\u00a0\u00a0I am an over all healthy 51 year old female, non smoker, occassional drinker.\u00a0\u00a0As I said I am overweight and have began to address this issue--faithfully.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I suffer from sleep Apnea.\u00a0\u00a0I don't use the cpap machine because when I tried to I always felt like I was being choked.\u00a0\u00a0When I went to the sleep lab, the report indicated I stopped breathing 45 times per hour.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any suggestions of what could be going on?",
