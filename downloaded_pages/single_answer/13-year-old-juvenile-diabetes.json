            "answer": "I wish I had the magic answer to your concern, we take care of 2000 children with diabetes in our practice and have many many frustrations with the adolescents and try hard to work with the families. Firstly, this is normal, not healthy but completely expected. After 5 years of diabetes she is tired. Tired of checking her sugars, tired of injecting 4 times a day and tired of you asking if she checked and what her number was and if she gave her dose. You are allowed to do this, she is still a child, she has a serious disease and is not able to do what she needs to stay in her best control.Are you followed by a diabetes center and if so find out either through them or via jdrf in your area about a teen support group and or a day or overnight camp. Meeting with colleagues her age who also have to deal with this is helpful. Also meet with her endocrinologist and or the NP, sit down and come up with a plan. If she wants you to back off and you want compliance, sometimes we have to make contracts, mom will not ask everytime about the sugars but the meter and the logbook need to be reviewed weekly together in return. Observing her shots is not unreasonable. Find out from her what goals she has, does she want a pump and if so work on agreeing to some tasks she should complete to get one-do this with her doc otherwise your list will be longer than hers and they can act sometimes as referee.Also a psychologist is not out of the question. Our team has psychology students that participate in some of the clinics to work with teens, giving them independent time to talk without the parents, at your visits with your doc, allow time for your child to meet with her doc without you in the room. Don't do the scare method, she is still in what we call concrete operations thinking, meaning she cannot see someone who loses their legs and understand that she should be in control at this very minute. Many of us are still in concrete operations! (if I eat this donut I will not gain weight :) )See how these things work, but don't do this alone, work with her doc and any other ancillary folks that are helpful. Also see how you can give your daughter independence while still making sure you remain in the parent role-this is not unique to diabetes and something we struggle with in general as parents of adolescents. I find that my teens either just click into shape at a certain point or I have the rare 2-3 of my own group that never grow up come age 19 or so, what I mean is that she will have a very good chance of doing better with time, often I have seen a boyfriend or good friend of hers that loves her and supports her and wants to care for her diabetes as well is a good influence even if they say all the things you already said, somehow their voices are gospel.(not that she is old enough for a boyfriend yet :)Hope this makes you feel a little easier that this is expected and that you are not alone.Keep us updated and thanks for posting at our site.",
