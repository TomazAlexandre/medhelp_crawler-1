            "answer": "Hi Barbara!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Loss of smell and taste can be due to common cold, sinusitis, upper respiratory infections or due to conditions that prevent air from reaching the smell receptors such as nasal polyps or tumors or deformities of the nasal septum. Loss of smell can be due to head injury/concussion. It can be temporary or permanent due to damage to olfactory pathway. Some endocrine diseases like diabetes and thyroid disorders may affect smell. Smell sensation diminishes with age and in\u00a0\u00a0Alzheimer's.For loss of smell due to aging, there is no treatment. Chronic sinusitis, cough and cold can affect your taste buds and smell. Sometimes zinc supplements are recommended. Also taking steam and using perfumes helps tickle the smell receptors. Colds, sinusitis, upper respiratory infections would need appropriate treatment. If there are polyps or tumors or septum deformities, then this would need surgical correction. You can try spicy/tangy/peppery dishes and aromatic food to tingle your taste buds and see if it helps. Change your toothpaste\u2014high fluoride in some toothpastes often change the taste. For loss of smell caused by a recent viral upper respiratory infection, you have to be patient. The symptoms return to normal without treatment. If the taste and smell do not return, please consult another ENT specialist for a second opinion. Hope this helps.
