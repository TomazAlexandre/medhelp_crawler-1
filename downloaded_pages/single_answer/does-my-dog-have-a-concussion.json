    "question": "A few weeks ago my dog was acting normal, but then it was like all of a sudden she wasn't. She was acting \"drunk\" and shaking her head and was walking off balance. We took her to an emergency vet and we had them induce vomitting. They determined that she hadn't eaten anything she wasn't supposed to. That night she stayed at the hospital with and i.v. and was perfectly fine the next day. Since they never found anything in her vomit and we couldn't pay for blood work, I started doing some research and I've come to the conclusion that she may have had a concussion. Now she's acting the same way, kind of \"drunk\" and off balance, but she threw up on her own twice, which I didn't find anything. She's still acting funny but she's wanting to play with my other dog. I'm trying to avoid a very large vet bill as i'm purchasing a house so it would be very much appreciated if you could help determine if it is, in fact, a concussion.",
