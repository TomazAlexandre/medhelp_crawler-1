            "answer": "Hi indianrose,If his symptoms are back to normal, it is more reassuring.\u00a0\u00a0However, it is best to have more workups to see if there is any intracranial arterial stenosis that needs further treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Imaging studies such as MRI brain stroke protocol, MRA carotids and circle of willis, or CTA brain (angio) are the most common way to look at the brain and it's intracranial/extracranial arteries.Most common vascular risk factors (risk factors for stroke and heart attacks) are smoking, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol).\u00a0\u00a0It is essential to correct all risk factors.\u00a0\u00a0Blood pressure of 200 is extremely high.\u00a0\u00a0He needs more aggressive blood pressure management.\u00a0\u00a0Blood pressure of less than 130 (systolic) is recommended.\u00a0\u00a0If he doesn't have previous workup for hyperlipidemia, he'll need to have fasting lipid panel tested to see if he'll need to take additional cholersterol-lowering agents.\u00a0\u00a0If he's diabetic, he'll need to have blood sugar controlled.\u00a0\u00a0Blood test such as HbA1c is a test to see how well blood sugar is controlled in the past 3 months.Antiplatelet agent (e.g. aspirin, aggrenox, plavix) is also preventive of stroke.\u00a0\u00a0If he was on aspirin (baby 81mg daily, or 325mg daily) during the earlier mild stroke, he probably will be best to increase his antiplatelet therapy by either increasing the dosage or switching to a stronger antiplatelet agent.\u00a0\u00a0Some institutes have the aspirin/clopidogrel resistance test (blood test) to see how adequately aspirin and/or clopidogrel suppress platelet.\u00a0\u00a0Please ask your neurologist if this test is available.\u00a0\u00a0We typically want to see at least 70% ADP or arachidonic acid suppression by clopidogrel (plavix) and aspirin, respectively.If he is a current smoker, he'll need to stop.\u00a0\u00a0Smoking increases risk for stroke, heart attack, cancer, and many other diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Please ask his primary care physician for smoking cessation therapy.Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for using MedHelp Forum.THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL MEDICAL EDUCATION PURPOSE ONLY.\u00a0\u00a0PLEASE CONTACT YOU PHYSICIAN FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT OPTIONS OF YOUR SPECIFIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS.",
