            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Itchy thumb pads with increased sweating can be seen in hyperthyroidism, and diabetes. Itchy thumb pads can also be due to hypothyroidism, psoriasis, contact dermatitis or due to fungal infection. Vit B12 deficiency is unlikely to present with increased sweating and itchy thumb pads.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. You need to test for T3, T4, TSH, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood sugar and post prandial blood sugar. Take care!",

    "question": "My question to you is\u00a0\u00a0- Do you think that these symptoms could anyway be related to Graves disease? I had RAI 2 trs ago as I became agranularcytotic following treatment with Carbimazole. I was feeling much better initially but i now have some bizzare symptoms going on. Pads of my thumbs itch as if a small insect is in them and sometimes my other fingers feel tingly. The sweating over my scalp and face is very uncomfortable and happens when I am active in any way. When I am at rest this does not occur. Is it possible that this could be the start of vit B12 deficiency as I know that it can be linked with autoimmune problems. Many thanksThis discussion is related to/posts/show/637611.",
