            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms it sounds like boils. Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Apply warm compresses on the bumps and keep the area clean. Also wear loose-fitting cotton clothing and use an antibacterial soap or mild soap like dove. Avoid any kind of cosmetics. Topical antibiotics such as mupirocin or neomycin containing ointment are also useful. In case the symptoms persist then oral antibiotics may be needed. In case the symptoms persist then please get your blood suagr levels checked as recurrent boils are often found in diabetes. Also then consult a dermatologist and get evaluated for hidradenitis suppurativa or swollen lymph nodes.I hope that helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I am a 15 year old female. I have been experiencing painful lumps in my armpit for a while now. It started up about 2-3 years ago. They come and go frequently. More times they are 1-2 under each arm and they go away. At first they are really painful, to the point i can't move my arm without it hurting. After the that the pain usually calms down and it doesn't hurt unless i push on it. I haven't shaved in a month, only too see if they come again without me shaving and they have. Is this serious, should i see a doctor?",
