            "answer": "Hi there!It is normal for the penis to tilt to one side and have prominent appearing veins when erect and should not be anything to worry about. Erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction could occur due to a few causes such as psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors with your partner. You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, or you have difficulty controlling anxiety; I would suggest seeing your primary care physician or a urologist for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",
