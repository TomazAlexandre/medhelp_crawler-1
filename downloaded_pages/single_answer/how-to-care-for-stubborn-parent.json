            "answer": "Hello and Welcome to the Caregivers Forum.This is the correct place for your post. I apologize for my tardy response. I was off caring for an injured husband and did not get to the Forum until now.It is a fact that a CVA (cerebral vascular accident) (stroke) can cause changes in one's personality.I think that is part of what you are seeing.Your mom is a nurse and is probably very aware of this fact. It's very difficult when you are trying to nurse a loved one...we are often too close to the situation to see it with clarity.Though you keep repeating you are only a child, you sound very mature and understanding of the situation. No \"child\" should have the worries that you are expressing. It sounds like you love your father very much. I am so sorry that you have to see his non-compliance and denial. Again this too can be the result of the CVA, at least in part.You talk about having your father live with retired brothers and sisters. Does this mean that you and your mother no longer want him in the home? Or does this mean you are looking fro daycare for him?You've asked a very good question. You really can't make someone that is legally incompetent take medications or do something against their will. We all have \"rights\" regardless or if we act in our own best interest or not.Many ppl are married and divorced with children from a precious marriage and they are not \"depressed all their lives.\" I suspect that your father's depression goes deeper than a former divorce, especially given the other behaviors that you report.I cannot guess what may have triggered his CVA but I doubt that the pizza actually caused it. I would guess he had a clot or uncontrolled high blood pressure that was at the root of his CVA.Have you tried having you dad put his meds in daily dosing containers? This may help him remember what he has or hasn't taken. You can purchase containers that have to be set up only once a week. Maybe you and your mom could help him with this. But suggesting and not ordering him to to track his meds may be more beneficial.My dear I wish I had a good answer for you. I do know that being a caregiver can be the most difficult task you will ever encounter. If you dad refused to follow his physicians orders, eat correctly or take his medications, sadly there is really nothing you can do to help him. However you can help yourself. Don't feel guilty for his behavior. It is not our fault. Do talk to your mom about getting some counseling to help you deal with his behavior and the pain that it is obviously causing you. In my opinion it is okay to kindly tell your father how he is affecting you...but again please discuss this with your mom.Understand that you dad still needs your love and respect. You may be able to reach him once you are able to deal with the situation and have the tools to do so. He is very fortunate to have your love and concern. Let him know everyday how much you care. You will never be sorry.Please let us know how you are doing and what solutions you may find. You are in a very difficult position and my heart goes out to you and your mom. Don't forget to take care of you too. I'll look forward to hearing from you again soon.Take Care,~Tuck",

    "question": "I hope this is the correct forum for my question.\u00a0\u00a0My father had two strokes in the last seven years.\u00a0\u00a0I am an only child, so my mother and I take care of him.\u00a0\u00a0He no longer works, but sometimes drives to buy groceries since it's close to home.\u00a0\u00a0My question is -- how do you take care of someone who does not want to be taken care of?He is the most stubborn person I know.\u00a0\u00a0My mother is a nurse, yet he won't listen to her when she tells him he needs to take his medicine or watch what he eats.\u00a0\u00a0In 2003, he had his first stroke after basically eating the whole pie of Papa John's pizza.\u00a0\u00a0We thought that would be his reality check.\u00a0\u00a0Guess what?\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't.Then 3 years ago, he had a second stroke.\u00a0\u00a0Reality check?\u00a0\u00a0No.\u00a0\u00a0He still does not believe in doctors, nor medicine. He has diabetes, just like his father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc.\u00a0\u00a0He also has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0He refuses to believe that his stroke was caused by anything else besides diabetes.He has also suffered from depression for years, even before the stroke.\u00a0\u00a0He was married with two children before he met my mother. I'm sure that's one reason why he's been depressed all his life.\u00a0\u00a0Not to mention he was the eldest of 8 children and had to leave school to work and take care of them.\u00a0\u00a0He does not want to move in with his brothers and sisters (who are also retired but on the other side of the country), because of pride.Lately he's been having memory lapses after waking from naps.\u00a0\u00a0We don't know if these are mini-strokes, or just part of the long-term effects of strokes.\u00a0\u00a0Again, he is stubborn; he does not want to call his doctor about this.\u00a0\u00a0He says he's fine, but I'm scared that one day something serious will happen to him.\u00a0\u00a0Since I'm an only child, he's home alone whenever my mother's at work and I'm at work or class.\u00a0\u00a0No one is there to watch him and make sure he takes his meds or doesn't overdose on them.\u00a0\u00a0We worry that when he has his memory lapses, he'll overdose on the meds, not realizing he had already taken them.Please, if anyone could shed some light on how to deal with this, it would be greatly appreciated.",
