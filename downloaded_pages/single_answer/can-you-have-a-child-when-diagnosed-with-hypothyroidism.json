            "answer": "Yes, you absolutely can have healthy babies :) !!!I'm a 33 yr old mother of two precious healthy boys, a 7yr old & a 17 mo old. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism at 18 . As long as your tsh levels are good before and during your pregnancy than your fine. I also have type 1 diabetes and am considered very high risk while pregnant, so I am followed closely.... but all was\u00a0\u00a0well.My sister didn't know she was pregnant till she was 4 months and when she got her labs done found out she was hypo. She never had a thyroid issue that she knew of before then so she and the ob were a bit concerned.Of course she then went on synthroid and got leveled out but they didn't know how long she was hypo and were concerned. End result was a beautiful healthy baby, praise God :) !!!Just thought I'd share and give you some encouragement.",
