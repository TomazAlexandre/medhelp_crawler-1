            "answer": "Hello,I don\u2019t think that Lisinopril is the culprit for causing tingling and itching that you are having.Hypocalcemia or deficiency of calcium along with diabetes,vit B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism can also cause such symptoms.My advise would be to consult a physician and getting your blood sugar levels along with thyroid hormone levels,vit b12 levels and serum calcium levels estimated so that the exact cause can be identified.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "I have been taking lisinopril for 2 years now and lately I have been experiencing really itchy skin and a tingling on my lips and tongue. Is it possible to develope a allergy to this medication after 2 years? I have gone to the site for lisinopril to look at side effects and they do list itching as a side effect along with pain and joint aches which I am also experiencing. Back in Jan. I did have bloodwork done that came back that my blood was showing a allergy of some type. I do not take any other meds and have not changed any of m soaps or detergents. Any info would be appreciated.",
