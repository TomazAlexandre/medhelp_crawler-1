            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The progression to scarring and cirrhosis varies from patient to patient, on the treatment taken and on the presence of other problems like liver, alcohol consumption, and HIV. Data on untreated patients shows that roughly one-third progress to liver cirrhosis in less than 20 years. Another third of untreated patients progress to cirrhosis within 30 years. In the remainder one third of untreated of patients the progress is so slow that they are unlikely to develop cirrhosis within their lifetimes. The NIH guidelines compute the risk of progression to cirrhosis to be 3-20 percent over a 20-year period.Chronic Hepatitis C can affect the coagulation process, the kidneys, cause thrombocytopenia, diabetes etc.Hence an annual checkup is a must. Please discuss this with a internal medicine specialist and get a regular checkup as advised.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
