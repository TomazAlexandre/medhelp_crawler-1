            "answer": "Hi,UTI especially an infection involving the lower urinary tract such as the bladder and urethra may present with an increase in urinary frequency. However you have mentioned of blood in the urine ( is this correct)? You have also noted straining just so to void ( is this right?).I suggest you seek a follow up consult with your urologist. Bleeding and straining with urination requires immediate attention and further evaluation. One has to rule out the source of the bleed and a structural obstruction. Hemorrhoids and involvement of gynecologic structures need to be ruled out.Do you have any hypertension, diabetes, and other underlying disease?Do get a follow up consult and keep us posted.",

    "question": "If you have a UTI is it common to actually pee MORE?? I was put on Cipro (antibiotic) and just recently started peeing more often and was wondering if that could be just because of the UTIALSO.... any of you women who have had a UTI, did you ever see blood on the tissue paper after peeing OR HAVE\u00a0\u00a0an inability TO pee?The first 8 days i didn't know I had a UTI b/c there wasn't any pain....I just couldn't pee (unless bending over and squeezing and/or waiting 5 minutes) and then suddenly I was able to pee and then it started burning. Doc diagnosed it as a UTI but b/c I've never experienced those symptoms, I'm still confused!",
