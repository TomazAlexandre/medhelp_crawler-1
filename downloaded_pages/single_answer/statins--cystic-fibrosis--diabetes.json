            "answer": "Hi,I do not Lipitor has hyperglycemic effects, as a general rule. The Prednisone, as you said, is the likely culprit. In addition, your own underlying insulin effects are still likely there because your own pancreas is in place, so the prednisone is likely exacerbating that effect.Keep a close eye on everything and speak to your docs soon if you continue having sustained hyperglycemia. I am afraid it may mean another medication added on to control it, but the goal is to preserve you and your transplant so it may be needed.Take care.",
