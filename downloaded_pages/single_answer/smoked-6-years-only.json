            "answer": "Hi!Anxiety, anemia, lung and heart problems are the usual causes of shortness of breath. You could be having social phobia due to bad breath and fact that you do not want any one to know about your habit of smoking. Additionally you could be having COPD or smoker's lungs. You should consult a doctor and find out the cause of bad breath. This and COPD could be related. Bad odor from mouth can be due to poor oral hygiene, dental caries, gum disease, dry mouth, post nasal drip, smoking, chewing tobacco, diabetes, sinusitis or due to a bad gastric reflux. Consult a dentist and an ENT specialist to start with. Also, consult a chest specialist. Take care!",

    "question": "I smoked for the last six years only, and till to-date. I am now 29. I smoked 1/2 to a packet a day for the first three years, and always inside a closed house because I don't need the people in my small village watch me smoking. For the last three years I am smoking not more than 10 sticks daily. But though I felt that I felt a shortness of breath since at age 10, I didn't feel any such difficulty as what I feel now. I am now conscious of every count of breath. A very serious shortness of breath, very tight chest and dumbness. My shortness of breath deteriorates when I am approaching people anywhere, at work, school, in a taxi and so on, and even my family members. One thing important. At childhood my school friends always told me that I had a bad breath (they were right, I still have it...so nasty) and I stated developing to keep long distance while talking to people. I since then preferred to stay alone and hate any social events. Up to now, when people are approaching me, my shortness of breath deteriorates. Also these days I started coughing with a thick nasty mucous out from my long, and it's staying with me for the last two months but with out any blood. But what terrified me is not the mucous and the bad breath. Thanks to a forum I read, scrapping my tongue do me a trick.\u00a0\u00a0But what worry me most are the shortness of breath and the very heavy and tight chest that remain with me all the time. So my question is would it be COPD? or may be because I developed social phobia at childhood due to friends reaction to my bad breath which I now controlled very effectively? or would it be a panic disorder? Any experience please help... I am really worried about this day and night. Thank you guys.",
