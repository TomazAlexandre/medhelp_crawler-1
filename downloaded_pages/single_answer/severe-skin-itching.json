            "answer": "Hello,One of the possibilities for your symptoms is eczema. Avoid using any lotions and creams for the meantime. Wash the skin with a mild cleanser with moisturizing properties like Cetaphil. Then apply a good hypoallergenic moisturizer over the area and see if this improves. If the symptoms still persist then you can apply mild steroid like dermacort. For the itching take some oral antihistaminic like Benadryl or Claritin.If the irritation persists then please get it evaluated from a dermatologist. Other possibilities need to be ruled out like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
