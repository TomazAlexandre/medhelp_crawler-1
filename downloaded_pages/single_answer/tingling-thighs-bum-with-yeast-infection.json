            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to parasthesia which is due to dysfunctioning of neurons and can occur due to nerve irritation also. It can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, neurological causes or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar, vitamin B 12 and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. Animal protein is the richest source of vitamin B 12 and if you are a vegetarian then you may be having vitamin B 12 deficiency. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve. If the symptoms persist then get an evaluation done from a physician and also get nerve conduction velocity tests done to rule out any nerve irritation.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I keep getting reoccuring yeast infections every single time I have sex. This I can deal with, as I already have for years but the part that worries me is that for the last year I have been getting tingling down my bum and the backs of my thighs every time I get a yeast infection after sex. My family doctor hasn't seemed overly concerned and said it just nerve damage from the reoccuring yeast infections. I didn't think anything of it until a nurse friend suggested it sounded like prodrome symptoms. It literally happens every time my boyfriend and I have sex and I get a yeast infection. Is this sensation normal or should I be getting tested?! Has this happened to anyone else?",
