    "question": "Hi,I am East Indian - 40 years, 200 lbs, 5'8\", male. Both my parents have Type 2 diabetes. I work out about three times a week. Either 30 lengths in a 25 yard pool or 4 miles walk and run or a 400 calorie workout - 10 minutes on a rower, 15 minutes on ellipticals, 15 minutes on a exercise cycle. I can't lose weight.I monitor my blood glucose with fingersticks. A couple of days back I had dinner at 6 pm, at 11:30 pm when I went to sleep my blood glucose was 120, when I woke up at 6 am it was 123 and after I finished my shower (without eating) it was 129.Why does my blood glucose increase at night? Am I right in trying to eat dinner earlier? I am trying to reduce my traditional rice-based diet because rice has a high glycemic index. I have also noticed that when I'm on holiday my blood glucose is under control. Would stress increase my blood glucose?Thanks,Joe",
