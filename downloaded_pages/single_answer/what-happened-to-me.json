            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Breathlessness can be due to several causes. The commonest cause is anemia. It can also be due to asthma like conditions, bronchitis (this should be evaluated further), high blood pressure, diabetes, hypothyroidism or obesity. Certain heart conditions too can cause breathlessness like mitral valve prolapse, high pulmonary artery pressure etc. Stress and anxiety too can be a cause and so also gastric reflux. What is important is to find out whether you are breathless all the time or is it due to exertion. At times certain triggers can cause breathlessness like a visit to a dusty area, using the blower of a vacuum cleaner, visit to a garden with flowers, perfumes, sprays etc. This is a type of allergic asthma and avoiding allergens will help take care of it.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
