            "answer": "You need to call your doctor. Skin rash [skin redness] is a listed allergic reaction to Prednisone. Prednisone [steroid] is known to elevate glucose [blood sugar] in some ppl too.OK to have over 400 mg/dl levels? Heck no. In fact it is very unhealthy and creates other health issues. Normal is 60/70 to 99 mg/dl. To ask this question implies a need on diabetes education. A good start with educating yourself on diabetes control and management is the ADA [American Diabetes Association] web site along with reading other threads on this forum. Good luck.",
