            "answer": "HI and thanks for using the forum.A prednisone taper can affect your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Talk with your prescribing doctor and see what he/she wants you to do (ie. monitor your blood sugars a little more frequently while you are on the taper).\u00a0\u00a0The prednisone dose is not unusually high and a prednisone taper would be appropriate for the unknown rash, you just need to know how to manage your diabetes while on the prednisone.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your primary care physician for guidance in this situation.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.Bridget",
