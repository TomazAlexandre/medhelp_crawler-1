    "question": "About an hour after I lift weights I get a rushing sensation in my neck, head and ears. Sometimes when it\u2019s quiet enough, the sounds around me appear to be fading in and out. It seems like the rushing sound and fading coincide with the pumping of my heart. When this sensation is severe, it is associated with pain in my back if I tilt my head forward and there is also pain under my biceps. I have also noticed that if I lean back in my chair and put may hands behind my head, the sensation is more pronounced to the point where I feel like I might pass out. If I work out my biceps at 10:00 in the morning, the sensation will last all day and into the evening. By the next day I am totally fine and this will not happen until I lift weights again. What is interesting, is this sensation does not seem to happen when I do any cardio exercise where I increase my heart rate. It seems to only happen when I lift weights and most often when I work out my biceps. The sensation subsides at times, but depending on how I position my body, it will become more pronounced. For instance, if I lay down on my stomach and lift my head as if to read a book, it appears to get stronger. I\u2019m not sure if this sensation is cardio related, or nerve related. Sometimes at night, I will wake up to my two small fingers on both hands being numb. It is not the same feeling as the whole hand or arm being numb due to lack of blood and the tingly feeling as the blood begins to flow to the hand and arm again. This is a numb feeling and if I move my arm the numbness will go away. I think the numbness occurs at night when I sleep if I put my arms up over my head. Once I put my arms to my side, the numbness goes away. I have been to various doctors and related my experience and symptoms and no one has any answers. I have done treadmill tests, blood pressure tests, EKG, blood tests, carotid artery scan and everything checks out OK. One note, I am diabetic, but I keep my diabetes under strict control and I get the sensation whether I may be high in blood sugar, or low. It does not matter.Thanks for any help you can offer\u2026Stan.",
