            "answer": "Hi, the first step would be to learn to relax. This could be posing your problems with hunger and digestion. Anxiety can cause these symptoms. Sometimes metabolic disorders like diabetes and hypothyroidism can produce tiredness; hence discuss this with your doctor at your next appointment. Try relaxation techniques like yoga and meditation. Take long walks and prioritize. Good Luck!!",

    "question": "I am a 16 year old girl who has been feeling nauseated for almost a year.Since Christmas day 2012 when my brother and dad got the stomach bug, I have felt sick every day.Some days it can be worse than others and it affects me at different times but usually before I go to sleep and when I wake up.I've not been to the doctors yet but I'm scared to as my parents say it's all in my head and I will end up in a psychiatric ward and this could affect my career options.My stomach always seems to feel really squirmy and makes weird noises all the time. I have got a very little appetite and could spend all day on. Breakfast bar if I really had to. I feel most nauseated when I'm stressed, upset, worked up, or hungry or tired.I also find that food seems to repeat on me at night when I'm in bed and it can take hours for my stomach to settle to let me sleep.This is having an affect on my college work and I would love to know what it is because I cannot cope with it anymore.Has anyone got any suggestions as to what it may be? Thank you for your help.",
