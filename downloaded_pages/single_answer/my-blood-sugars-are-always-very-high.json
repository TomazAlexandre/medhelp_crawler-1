            "answer": "Unfortunately, Yasmin, you can't eat the same as your friends and I know that's hard to hear at your age. 12 (216 on the American numbering) is WAY too high. Complications begin at 140. I'm not trying to scare you but if you continue that high you may get diabetic complications long before 40 or 50 and they are not pretty. You can have your legs amputated and become blind. You need to talk with your doctor or with a diabetic educator who will tell you more about possible complications and more important will help you come to terms with how to control your blood sugar. You don't have to be miserable but you do have to make significant changes in how you eat. It might also help if you ask your doctor to refer you to a diabetic support group, preferably with other young people so you can have people to relate to who are controlling their blood sugars but also living their lives! There is a website you might enjoy called TuDiabetes.com where you can hear from a lot more people with diabetes and I even believe they have a special young people's forum.",
