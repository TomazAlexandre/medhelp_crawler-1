    "question": "I have recently got 2 titanium dental implants after the loss of tooth. I am 44 yrs old with no metabolic diseases like diabetes etc. However, there is a mild headache\u00a0\u00a0which worsens at night making me feel irritable. It has been a fortnight since the implant. Is this the side effect and do I have to continue the I-mol prescribed by the doc forever. I have an appointment with the doc later this week.",
