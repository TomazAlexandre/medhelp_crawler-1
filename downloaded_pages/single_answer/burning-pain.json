            "answer": "This is not the doctor forum, but will try to give you some answers.Did they do a 2-3 hour fasting glucose? Sometimes that is the only way to detect diabetes, especially if it's early stages.Did they run tests for Vitamin deficiencies?B-12 deficiency can cause a neuropathy (nerve damage) of the small (sensory) fibers and Neurontin and B vits (mostly B-12) are a way of treating it. It's possible you are not tolerating the Neurontin, but it's best to discuss that with your doctor. I do know that as the nerves heal, it can cause more pain. Small fibers CAN regenerate. It's the long fibers that generally don't.Sometimes neuropathy can be of unknown origin (idiopathic) but the best chance of reversing it is knowing the cause and treating that.I would suggest that if it continues to be that painful, you call your doctor and let him/her know. They may decide to try a different approach.",
