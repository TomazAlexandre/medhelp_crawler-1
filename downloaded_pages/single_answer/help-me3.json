            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Bell\u2019s palsy is often temporary and is attributed to the inflammation of the facial nerve that controls the muscles on the weakened side of the face. Commonly mentioned triggers for occurrence of bell\u2019s palsy include stress, trauma, fever, viral infections, and tooth extractions. Facial nerve is the most commonly paralyzed nerve of the body.Side effects of steroid use depend on the dose, the duration and the frequency of administration. Short courses of prednisolone, days to a week or two are usually well tolerated with few and mild side effects. Long-term, high doses of prednisolone will usually produce predictable, and potentially serious side effects.Side effects include fluid retention, weight gain, high blood pressure, potassium loss, headache, muscle weakness, puffiness of and hair growth on the face, thinning and easy bruising of the skin, glaucoma, cataracts, peptic ulceration, worsening of diabetes, irregular menses, growth retardation in children, convulsions, and psychic disturbances.Psychic disturbances can include depression, euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and even psychotic behavior.Immuno suppression is also observed in patients with steroid use but on long term use.Hope this information was helpful.All the best.",
