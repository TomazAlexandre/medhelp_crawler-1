    "question": "Hi I have been experiencing yeast infections since January 20th. I had unprotected sex with an old flame who was married and 2-3 days later this itch occurred. I immediately think it is a yeast so I go and purchase the 3 day Monistat. It didn't work. The next few days I purchased it again only because the store didn't have the 7 day cream. It still didn't work. I finally found the 7 day cream, tried it, it didn't work. After so many attempts to get rid if whatever it it OTC, I broke down and went to the dr. She didn't do an exam just asked questions . She said maybe it was diabetes and drew blood for that, but gave me Diflucan and another for the next week if symptoms persist. I used both and still nothing. I went back on last Wednesday and she was not available so I had to see another dr. Once again no exam just questions. She told me that I was borderline diabetes and that is probably why I am having all of these yeasts. She prescribed me Ciprofloxacin HCL 500 mg and told me to continue using the cream. Today is Saturday and it seems all I am doing is just taking medicine because I feel no different. I fear that it may be something life threatening and everyone is too lazy to do an exam. Please help me find a solution. I feel insecure and less if a woman as days go by. Thank God at this moment I don't have a man because I still would lose him because I can't even make eye contact with the opposite sex the way I have been feeling.",
