            "answer": "Be sure to get a copy of your labs. Next to each test are the ranges - low to high. I look carefully for scores that are close to being low, or close to being high. Doctors focus on only the L's (lows) and H's (highs) not the boderline/marginal scores. These you can work on yourself w/o meds to normalize.",

    "question": "So finally went to the lab and am awaiting results. My doctor must be really on it because without me even asking him to test me fully for diabetes, he had already ordered a glucose 12 hr. fasting test, a hemoglobin A1C test and a glucose tolerance test. He is also checking my BUN, CREA, total lipid profle, SGPT, Lytes, HTN Benign and some other stuff I dont remember on my lab paper. The lab technician said my doctor should be receiving the results tomorrow. Now is the scary part, awaiting my results. I'll post them once I get it. Thanks to all of you for your great responses and support with all my previous concerns.",
