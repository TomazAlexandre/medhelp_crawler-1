            "answer": "Unfortunately, there is a wide differential for the cause of chest discomfort.\u00a0\u00a0I would be reassured if your physician evaluation noted everything to be fine. However, if you continue to have persistent chest discomfort or worsening symptoms, you may want to be re-evaluated to ensure there is not something else going on.\u00a0\u00a0Heart attacks happen most oftenly in individuals who are older with multiple risk factors (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, history of smoking, diabetes, and family history of an early heart attack).\u00a0\u00a0Given your relatively young age (unsure about your other risk factors or other medical conditions), I would suspect that a heart attack would be very unusual, but unfortunately cannot say for sure without\u00a0\u00a0more deatiled description of your symptoms and with a physical examination (and/or other diagnostic studies).",
