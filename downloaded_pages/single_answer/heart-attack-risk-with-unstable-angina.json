            "answer": "Unstable angina is an \"acute coronary syndrome\"...this means you have a plaque (atheroclerotic disease) in the artery that is unstable and small pieces are breaking off and causing her chest pain or causing the arteries to spasm (clamp down). Sometimes allowing an artery to completely close off actually improves the symptoms. I think you should have a lengthy conversation with the cardiologist as she is very young and I would be very aggressive, as long as it is anatomically possible.Her activity should be discussed with her physician.",

    "question": "My wife is 46 yrs old and has diabetes and takes insulin.\u00a0\u00a0She had bybass surgery last year and now has a blockage in a branch off an artery that wasn't bypassed.\u00a0\u00a0The decision is being made now as to what should be done because the Dr fears that it is in a bad place and might compromise the main left artery.\u00a0\u00a0If he doesn't stent it, she is at risk for a heart attack because it is causing unstable angina.\u00a0\u00a0She gets pressure for no reason at all now.\u00a0\u00a0He said she is at maximum medicine therapy.\u00a0\u00a0My\u00a0\u00a0questions are why does unstable angina put you at risk for a heart attack?\u00a0\u00a0Is it because of the 50% blockage?\u00a0\u00a0If decision is not to stent it, what happens when that branch becomes 100% occluded by plaque (she plaques up quickly even on heavy statins)?\u00a0\u00a0Should she be doing less strenuous activities?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your advice.",
