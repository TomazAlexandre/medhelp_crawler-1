    "question": "I am 25 years old, overweight and recently tested for high bp (160/100).\u00a0\u00a0For about a month I have non-stop dizziness and feeling faint.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms intensify at times making walking feel like it would cause me to pass out.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it gets real bad even sittng and causes blurry vision.\u00a0\u00a0Today I felt ok but even walking in the mall just increased pressure in my head and neck.\u00a0\u00a0Other symptoms that occur sometimes are headaches and pain in different spots of my head, facial numbness/tingling, tightness or pressure on my neck.\u00a0\u00a0I dont know if this is related but I also have not had solid stool even longer, and I have hair loss and dryness on my legs.\u00a0\u00a0I thought this was new but then I remembered I got sick last spring after I worked out and felt very ill and an overwhelming feeling of passing out.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the real onset seemed to be shortly after that after dinner one night something wasnt right in my head and working out has not truly happened since then and feel limited in my life.\u00a0\u00a0Although this past month the symptoms are unrelenting.\u00a0\u00a0Went to get checked out when it first came on--hit me walking to the bank, was not a pleasant feeling--diabetes, thyroid, anemia, ekg all negative, no inner ear or sinus issues, even though it has always been easy for me to get unbalanced.\u00a0\u00a0Chest x-ray was normal, did find on a tilt table test that my hart rate goes up when moved up.\u00a0\u00a0I was starting a new job so no insurance so some tests are delayed until I do get insurance (thankfully next week), any help would be great.",
