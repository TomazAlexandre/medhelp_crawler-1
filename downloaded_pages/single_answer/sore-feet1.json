            "answer": "Hello JD,I am sorry to hear about your sore feet. Until they hurt none of us realize how difficult it can be to deal with foot pain.You don't offer a lot of information. Have you consulted your physician? Are you feet discolored or do they swell? How long has this been going on? Do you have any open area on your feet?Do you soak your feet or massage them? There are some good products on the market that massage the feet, even foot bathes that offer massage. Adding a soothing foot product to the bath as suggested by your Pharmacist can be beneficial. Don't over look the free services of a Pharmacist.Do you have diabetes? If so it's very important for you to see your physician asap.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you will keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. I'll look forward to hearing more from you.Take Care,~Tuck",
