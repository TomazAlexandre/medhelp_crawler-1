            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Rash with scabs in presence of cold can be due to chicken pox or measles. Since they are contagious, please consult a doctor to rule them out. Otherwise it could be due to atopic/contact dermatitis or due to psoriasis too.Tingling and numbness can be due to vit B12 deficiency, diabetes, thyroid disorders, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Multiple sclerosis is also a possibility.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
