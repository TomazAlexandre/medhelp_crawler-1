            "answer": "Initial answer to your question is yes, a dental infection can very easily go systemic if left untreated.\u00a0\u00a0It can even become life threatening.The tingling/numbness sounds like an uncontrolled diabetic problem.\u00a0\u00a0One of the long term effects of diabetes is decreased circulation, which you would notice as tingling/numbness.I would suggest finding a dental school that can take care of the infected teeth at a very discounted rate, or check with your state and local dental societies to see if they offer any charity work.",
