            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Pain can present itself as different feelings depending on the location and cause. One type of pain called neuropathic pain has had descriptions that include burning, gnawing, aching, and shooting or lancinating qualities. This type of pain is caused by injury to a nerve. There are 2 types of nerves in our body, large and small. The small nerve endings supply the skin and sweat glands. There are two types of sensory neuropathy: small fiber and large fiber (depending on the size of the nerves affected). With small fiber neuropathies, symptoms including burning or buzzing or other vague symptoms starting in the feet and hands then in some cases spreading to other parts of the body. EMG/nerve conduction studies (NCS) (tests done to check for neuropathy) will not show an abnormality, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a skin biopsy so that the number of nerve endings can literally be counted. There are other tests of the function of small nerves that can be ordered, such as QSART testing which looks at how much sweat the skin makes, since sweating is in a sense of function of these small nerves. There are several causes of small fiber neuropathy, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune problems.The other type of sensory neuropathy is called a large fiber neuropathy which has multiple causes and can present itself with sensory changes as well as weakness and change in tendon reflexes. Some types of sensory neuropathies occur and progress very slowly, others sort of wax and wane (with flare-ups) and some are progressive. One of the most common causes of neuropathy is diabetes, and sometimes only glucose intolerances, or abnormal rises in blood sugar after a glucose load can be the only indication (this is called a oral glucose tolerance test. Other causes include but are not limited to hereditary/genetic causes (such as in a disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth, in which there is a family history of sensory neuropathy usually from an early age associated with other clinical features such as high-arched feet), autoimmune problems (such as lupus (SLE), Sjogren's, Churg-Strauss (in which asthma also occurs), polyarteritis nodosa, which affects blood vessels), and demyelinating diseases (such as CIDP). Vitamin B12 and B6 deficiency, as well as excess vitamin B6, can also cause neuropathy. Some toxins, such as lead, arsenic, and thalium can cause large fiber sensory neuropathy. Other causes include abnormalities of protein metabolism, as in a type called amyloidosis or monoclonal proteinemia. In many neuropathies, both the sensory and motor nerves (the nerves that supply the muscles) are involved, leading to sensory symptoms as well as weakness.\u00a0\u00a0This type of neuropathy can be diagnosed by EMG/NCS. In rare cases, a lumbar puncture and perhaps nerve biopsy may be necessary for diagnosis.Treatment for neuropathic pain, as described, includes neurontin and lyrica, and medications such as elavil but a careful cardiac workup needs to be performed prior to starting this medication.Regarding muscle twitches: It must be emphasized that in the majority of cases they are benign meaning that they are of no consequence and are not resulting from a serious cause. In such cases, the twitches may be related to anxiety/stress, caffeine, and often occur after recent strenuous activity or muscle over-use. It is important in such cases to reduce stress/anxiety levels and to reduce caffeine intake.Benign fasciculation syndrome (BFS) is a condition in which there are involuntary twitches of various muscle groups, most commonly the legs but also the face, arms, eyes, and tongue. If the diagnosis is confirmed and other causes are excluded, it can be safely said that the likelihood of progression or occurrence of a serious neurologic condition is low.When BFS is present but not particularly bothersome or disabling, treatment is not necessary. If severe and it requires treatment, there are a few medication options though this condition is not very common, and the research that has been done on its treatment is limited. Minimizing caffeine and stress, and treating anxiety if it is present, will improve your symptoms.I would recommend that you follow up with your PCP. You should have basic lab work performed including thyroid evaluation.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "Hello --I've had various symptoms that worry me. Most have resolved, but I am still concerned:1) About a year or two ago, I had some very faint feelings of pins and needles in my feet. I do not have diabetes. It was extremely faint (looking back on it, it could have been \"in my head\" for all I know). Anyway, I no longer have this (haven't experienced for at least a year), but I do have a lingering concern about it.2) Also, about a year or so ago, I was having periodic muscle twitches, for example in my abdominal area. They would not last very long. I had no muscle weakness or change in sensation, etc. I do exercise quite heavily, so I'm hoping that may be the explanation? These muscle twitches went away (haven't had them for many months) even though I'm still exercising. However, a few weeks ago, I developed a twitch in my left eye that isn't going away.3) About three months ago, I had a couple of weeks where I would get these random sharp pains (in my legs, if I recall). They felt almost like a shock or pinprick and would last a fraction of a second. This would happen several times a day. It diminished in frequency and disappeared within a couple of weeks.Anyway, any insight you could give me would be very helpful, as I am worried. Thanks!!!!",
