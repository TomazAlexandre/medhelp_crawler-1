    "question": "Dear Dr. I have a seventeen yr. old that was diagnosed with Hashimoto's seven yrs. ago. She has been on synthroid since then and in my opinion has never really helped her. My daughter has battled depression and weight gain and everything in between. The weight gain has casused the most problems, we've done everything from dieting to exercise and nothing works to lose the pounds that have accumulated. She's seventeen and the kids have always been cruel about the weight and now it's taking a toll on her. She wants so desperately to be somewhat normal, which brings me to ask if you think lap-band surgery would be of help to her?\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I would consider this for her if you thought it would help. We are in the process of looking for a new endo dr. for her at this time. Also, Hashimoto's is supposed to affect middle aged people, how would a child develop it? She was a normal skinny child up until the second grade.",
