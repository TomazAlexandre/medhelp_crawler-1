            "answer": "If she is concerned, an her doctor is unwilling to order tests, I would try another doctor. It would certainly not hurt to do an A1C which measures average blood sugars over a period of a couple months. They also are available at pharmacies for home testing and cost about $25. Results of 5.7 to 6.4 are considered prediabetes and anything over 6.5 is diabetes. If the hypoglycemia is frequent and causes problems or anxiety, the doctor should have at least worked with her to find solutions.",
