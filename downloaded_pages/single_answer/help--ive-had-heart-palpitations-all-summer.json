    "question": "So around halfway through May, I started feeling a heart pounding feeling in my chest, and I Got really scared so we went to the ER and they said everything was fine. Later, during June I've feel them every night while trying to go to sleep, I felt heart palpitations (what I believe it is) and occasional random twitching in my arms and legs. Now here In July I've started feeling them in the day time too, and it feels worse during the nights when I lay down. Now just recently I started waking up in the middle of my sleep with a suddenly high heart rate, and I can't sleep at all now.After learning my family has a history of diabetes and heart disease I've gotten really worried about my future.Any Help?",
