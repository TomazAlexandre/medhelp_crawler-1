            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine your daughter and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of her symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Though rare, a disorder of the nerves or the peripheral nervous system, called neuropathy, can occur in children. This can cause burning, tingling, numbness, shooting pains, and/or motor weakness. There are many causes of this disorder; in adults, the most common cause is diabetes, but in children, some specific vitamin or other nutritional deficiencies, lead and some other rare toxicities, and uncommon rare genetic or metabolic disorders can lead to a painful neuropathy. Again, painful neuropathy is rare in children, but can occur.Another possibility in a rigorous athlete are stress fractures, small hairline fractures that can occur, though it would be unlikely to occur in all four limbs. The stresses associated with professional athlete children can also lead to pains as a manifestation of their stress, and this should always be kept in mind if children have unexplained limb pain (of course after other potential causes have been excluded). Another cause of pain in the legs that occur mainly at night are growing pains, aching or throbbing of the legs that occurs in children up the teens and then resolves. Other musculoskeletal causes are a possibility as well.Evaluation of your daughter by her general pediatrician is recommended; after he/she obtains a history and examines her, it can be determined whether referral to a pediatric neurologist or other specialist is indicated.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
