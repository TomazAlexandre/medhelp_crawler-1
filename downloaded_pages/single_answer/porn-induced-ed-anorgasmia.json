            "answer": "Hi there!Erectile dysfunction or problem maintaining an erection can develop in young adults due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors with your partner. You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, I would suggest seeing your primary care physician for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi think I need some help, I've recently discovered the phenomenon that is porn-induced dysfunction and I'm convinced I have it; I'm a male in my mid twenties and I'm only turned on by lesbian porn. I've never had trouble maintaining an erection with partners but always had to fantasize about lesbians to orgasm, however lately I've been losing my erections with my partner; I have no trouble getting hard and just touching her gives me an erection but I lose the erection within 5 minutes of penetration. I've been trying to \"retune\" my sex drive by only masturbating to solo women porn but I've read that half the problem is that I can't arouse myself via touch alone without stimulation. I'm going to try not masturbating for a week or two and want to try the \"no porn no orgasm\" route, but want to maintain a sex life with my partner; the trouble is if I keep fantasizing about lesbians to finish myself off isn't that sending me back to square 1 every time? I'm very worried and could use some advice thanks.",
