    "question": "I recently had a comprehensive blood test done that included NMR and Hemoglobin A1c.\u00a0\u00a0The NMR was very good:\u00a0\u00a0LDL-P 603, LDL-C 85, HDL-C 92, Trig 28, Total cholesterol 183, Small LDL-P less than 90, LDL size 21.3 (Pattern A).\u00a0\u00a0My Insulin resistance score based on my lipid profile was \"0\" which is an assessment of my diabetes risk.\u00a0\u00a0However, my A1c was 5.8 which is increased risk for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Fasting BG was 95. So, which do I believe?\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 61-year old female, 105 lbs, lifetime exerciser, on meds for hypertension (Lotrel 5/20, Spironolactone 25 mg), Cholesterol (Zocor 20 mg, Slo-Niacin 500 mg), Synthroid (50 mcg) and a daily baby aspirin (plus quite a few supplements).\u00a0\u00a0For the past 6 months I've changed my diet to lower carbs (except for healthy carbs such as green veggies), eliminating starches and processed foods.\u00a0\u00a0Can you give me some insight into how one test says I have \"0\" risk for diabetes and the other says I am at increased risk?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
