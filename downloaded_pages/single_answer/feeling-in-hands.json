            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Electrical charge feeling can be due to very dry hands. Another possibility is hormonal imbalance due to menopause. A third possibility is peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, hypothyroidism or Lyme's.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
