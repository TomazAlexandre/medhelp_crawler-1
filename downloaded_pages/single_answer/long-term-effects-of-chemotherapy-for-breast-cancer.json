            "answer": "Dear AlaskaAngel, There can be many reasons for elevation of liver enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0Both cytoxan and adriamycin (the C and A of the CAF regimen) list elevations in liver enzymes (transaminases), and hepatotoxicity as possible though uncommon side effects.\u00a0\u00a0These problems if attributed to the chemotherapy would usually resolve with the discontinuation of therapy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The evaluation of elevated liver function tests would be to rule out the many possible causes. Your history of treatment for cancer and the chemotherapies given would be part of the assessment of these continued problems.",

    "question": "I'm 7 years out from CAF x 6 and NED. Since the 1st year after completing treatment, my LFTs have been mildly elevated and I've had right-sided pain within the rib cage with no extension of the liver below the ribs, no jaundice, no pruritus.I don't drink, don't smoke, don't have diabetes or hypertension, and don't have a family history of anything but breast cancer. I've had every lab test for this as well as ultrasounds and 2 CTs with them all being negative, and the pain is slowly worsening. It feels like the ribs are being pushed out by the liver.\u00a0\u00a0My hs-CRP just came back as low, my HDL is very high and my triglycerides are very low, and my LDL and total cholesterol borderline high. The 5-HIAA was fine as was the antimitochondrial antibody. Could standard CAF cause damage to the liver? This therapy has been used for decades now; does anyone know if this is a long-term effect or not, or do they just keep using it without tracking the effects?",
