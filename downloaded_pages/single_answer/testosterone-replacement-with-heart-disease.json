            "answer": "Testosterone increases the risk of coronary artery disease over long periods of time, which is part of the reason why men have higher rates of coronary artery disease (CAD) than women. However, if you have low testosterone, you are just replacing back to normal levels. While this raises the risk of CAD, this is an extremely small increase in risk. Given that your CAD has been revascularized (opened up) with a stent, the existing disease should not typically be of concern. Other factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, kidney disease, family history, and your prior personal history are far more important and impactful on the developmen of CAD and future risk of more disease. As long as you are currently asymptomatic, then use of testosterone replacement, under the watch of your physician, should not be a problem.",

    "question": "I am a male, 40 years old with CAD and 1 stent, and a history of SVT with (so far) successful ablation. I have low testosterone and was given a gel for replacement therapy. The Dr. said it would be ok with my history, but the warnings do state to inform if you have heart disease. Why? Is it really ok to use testosterone replacement with heart disease? Thanks.",
