            "answer": "Hi!I can understand your worries. An increased T1 signal can indicate deposition of fat, proteins, melanin, contrast agent or gadolinium. It can also occur in case of hemorrhage or metabolic disorders like diabetes. Sometimes an increased T1 signal is an artifact or false result. A T2 hypointense lesion is usually cystic colloid lesions of unknown cause or MS lesion (less likely as they are usually multiple) or due to lacunar infarction, cystic neoplasms, and cystic periventricular leukomalacia. I know these names will not mean much to you, but your husband needs further tests to rule out these conditions one by one.Sometimes the lesion is of not much significance, especially if there are no symptoms. Please discuss in detail with your doctor or take a second opinion. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "My husband recently got a MRI done and report said well defined altered signal intensity lesions in anterior 3rd ventricle near foramen munro which are hyperintense on T1 adn hypointense on T2 and Flair images. Possibilty of colloid cyst to be considered. I consulted 2 doctors and they said there is nothing to worry but I couldn't still be satisfied if there is colloid cyst or not. He has no symptoms.I am really scared and would really appreciate your inputs.",
