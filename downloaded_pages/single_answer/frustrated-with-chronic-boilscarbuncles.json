            "answer": "Hello,Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle.Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders. So please get your blood sugar and immune system evaluated.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep us posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",
