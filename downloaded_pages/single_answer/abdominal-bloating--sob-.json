    "question": "Dear Doctor,I have suffered from abdominal pain, bloating (uncomfortable on the side of my abdomen) for a few years now. It started when I was dxed with lupus.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen a gi doctor who dx me with bacterial overgrowth.\u00a0\u00a0I took abx twice for the episodes but it seems to return every 6 months or so.\u00a0\u00a0Also I have SOB when the bloating is bad and abd pain, chest discomfort.\u00a0\u00a0My cardiologist does not think it is cardiac in nature since I excercise regularly and the symptoms do not occur with excercise.\u00a0\u00a0In fact excercise seems to help the bloating abit.\u00a0\u00a0I am also a type 1 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be my gallbladder? or worse yet do I need to consider ovarian cancer?\u00a0\u00a0since breast cancer runs in my family?\u00a0\u00a0I know it is hard to determine since I have 2 chronic illness but I am just wondering what steps to take next.\u00a0\u00a0It does seem to be precipitated by stress or periods of not eating appropriately having a glass of wine etc.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
