            "answer": "Dear little bird, welcome to medhelp forum. I can understand your concern over the burning sensation in your foot.\u00a0\u00a0Trauma to the affected foot causing nerve irritation could be one and needs clinical examination and radiological exclusion. This could be due to compression of tibial nerve as it passes through the tarsal tunnel in the foot. This can happen if you have varicose veins or swollen, corrugated veins due to damage venous valves. Clinical examination and nerve conduction study may be required. There are certain systemic causes, which can affect both the feet like vitamin deficiencies like B6, B12, B1 and niacin need to be assessed as per history of malnutrition and serum levels. This could also indicate thyroid disorders, liver and kidney dysfunction. Neuropathy secondary to alcohol abuse and diabetes are important causes of burning sensation in both the feet.You need to be checked by a neurologist in detail.Wish you all the best.Should you want any clarification, you are most welcome here.",
