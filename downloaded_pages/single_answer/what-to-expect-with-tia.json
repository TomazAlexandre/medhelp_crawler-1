            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand what you are going through. Hormone therapy is known to increase the risk for TIAs. The risk is more so if there is a strong family history, if you are a diabetic or hypertensive and if you smoke. For most patients with a TIA, the symptoms last less than one hour. The longer the symptoms last, the more likely that there will be permanent brain tissue injury. For now you could focus on controlling high risk factors like diabetes and hypertension and discuss with your doctor about blood thinning agents like aspirin.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
