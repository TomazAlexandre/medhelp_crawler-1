He is now getting help for his diabetes...which we wouldn't have known about if it wasn't for going in to get his eyes checked.",

    "question": "7 days ago my 2 year old tripped and on the way down hit her head on the corner of a wooden chair (forehead) she imediately cried and didnt loose conciousness or vomit. Had a bump and Within half an hour she was playing as normal so I wasn't worried.Until 3 days ago I noticed her left pupil was bigger than her right. I checked they were both reacting to light and they were but the left one always goes bk to being slightly bigger than the right.I took her to the docs to explain and he wasnt worried but I still am. What do u think? Everything I read on un even pupils after head trauma points to serious scary stuff. I am so scared she is having a bleed up there.She is having no other symptoms and it is only a slight difference in size",
