            "answer": "Hi,Your son is suffering from something known as polyuria and I\u2019ll suggest to get him examined and rule out som of the common causes of the same, for e.g. diabetes mellitus,diabetes inspidus, urinary tract infection etc. Once these have been ruled out, then only it should be labeled as an obsessive compulsive disorder(a disease in which a person has an obsession of doing something and that obsession settles down only after the compulsive act of doing it). For this, you\u2019ll need to consult a psychiatrist.I sincerely hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Kind Regards.",
