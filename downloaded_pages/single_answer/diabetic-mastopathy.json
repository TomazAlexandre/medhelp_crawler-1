            "answer": "Hi,Diabetes is not a proven cause of breast cancer. Of course, breast cancer can occur in diabetic women, but is not known to be more frequent among them as compared with non-diabetic women.Your axillary lymph nodes may be caused by the mastopathy or infection (which is more common in diabetics).However, I would urge you to quickly see a surgeon for getting a physical examination and a mammogram.All the best, and God Bless!",
