            "answer": "Hi,I understand this is very hard for you. You have mentioned of several symptoms. Is your condition improving? Do you still have fever ,facial pain and change in bowel movement?I believe that you have been fully assessed already. What tests were done and what were the results? This sounds like there is an underlying infectious process. A sinus infection may be considered here as this may help explain your facial pain ,ear pain and chest infections. Have you been taking medications for this? This may b a severe sinus infection or a pneumonia. Do you also cough?A systemic infection may explain most of your symptoms. If you have not been evaluated yet, then I suggest that you need prompt consult. Upper respiratory tract infections and other respiratory (lung related ) infectious disease may be readily treated using antibiotics.Do you have diabetes? Are you on any prednisone or other immunosuppressants?",
