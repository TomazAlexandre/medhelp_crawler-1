            "answer": "when cats start inappropriate illumination its b/c something is wrong, you changed back to the original litter and still have the problem...therefore its highly likely that being a male he would have crystals in his bladder and he's telling you it HURTS when he pees....crystals form mainly in males on DRY food. if you are feeding dry food please change to cans, the extra fluids in can foods help to flush out the crystals and return urine to a proper PH balance.kitty also needs to have a urinalysis done by your Vet, he could also have a UTI..and may need an antibiotic. only a c&s and urinalysis will tell you for sure whats going on with him.If he does have crystals these could eventually block off his small urinary tract and not allow him to pass urine...than the bladder could burst.so its very important to get this checked out.....and very important he is on a can food diet...I should also mention(hopefully not to scare you...) you need to be aware that when cats drink more than usual its sometimes an indication of Diabetes or Chronic Renal Failure (CRF)...please see a Vet asapkeep us posted please....\u2665",

    "question": "Not sure about this topic section but here it goes:We have an 8 year old cat that, until about 2 months ago, used the litter box regularly.\u00a0\u00a0We changed the litter every other day without fail and never had any issue.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, he has been urinating outside of the litter box but still uses the litter for defecating.\u00a0\u00a0It seems he uses the fresh litter once for urination, buries the clump, then won't use it again.\u00a0\u00a0We did recently change the litter we used, but changed it back to our original brand a few weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0We also noticed he is drinking more water than normal.We are curious as to why he is doing this...any help is appreciated!",
