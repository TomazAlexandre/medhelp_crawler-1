            "answer": "Hi!I am not sure how severe is the heart condition, and how low is her iron/Hb level, but must be quite low for doctors to be concerned. If she cannot get clearance for general surgery then there are other options which can be explored such as sclerotherapy, electrocautery, infrared radiation, laser, or cryosurgery. In all cases about 70 percent remain recurrence free at 3-4 years. Hence at your mother's age these are good options. Please discuss them with her treating doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "My 70 year-old mother has had severe rectal\u00a0\u00a0bleeding for years now due to Grade 4 hemorrhoids? Her iron level and hemoglobin levels are low (doctors concerned)She had a colon resection in 2009 and had also undergone chemotherapy (in remission).In Oct. 2011 she had a colonoscopy (2 polyps removed and biopsy came back negative).She also has a heart condition. Every since her colon resection, she's had diarrhea when eating fruits or vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0She takes 2 iron pills a day plus other pills associated with other health issues (diabetes, etc.).Her surgeon advised her that she is not a candidate for hemorrhoidectomy (surgery) because of her heart condition.\u00a0\u00a0She also suggested rubber band ligation but is skeptical that it would work.I've read that the rubber band ligation may need to be done more than once (hemorrhoids come back).\u00a0\u00a0My mother has suffered so much already that I don't want to put her through more agony.I am very concerned about her, I don\u2019t know what else to do.Has anyone ever heard of removing hemorrhoids using laser ??I truly welcome any thoughts or suggestions.Thanks in advance and for listening,Patty",
