            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The symptoms point more towards an endocrine pathology. You must seriously consider diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus. You would need a comprehensive investigation to diagnose these. A urine test should anyway be done to rule out UTI.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
