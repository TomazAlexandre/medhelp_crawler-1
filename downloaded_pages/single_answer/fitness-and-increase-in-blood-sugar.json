    "question": "Why do my blood glucose levels spike during exercise?I have not been diagnosed w/diabetes and when I eat something with sugar like an apple my blood glucose goes down.I used to eat one large meal at night(exercise in the morning) but I have started eating throughout the day and now I feel sluggish during exercise(still in the morning), I did not have this before.\u00a0\u00a0The reason I stopped eating one large meal at night was because I was having a burning sensation in my mouth, ears my whole head was warm feeling- and my hands and feet would be frozen.With eating throughout the day I have not had this burning sensation and my blood glucose levels appear normal around 88.But once again during exercise it is a struggle.\u00a0\u00a0I exercise everyday.I am 21 years old, female 115-120lbs",
