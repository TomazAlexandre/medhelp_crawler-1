    "question": "Diabetes runs in my family. My grandmas sister had diabetes, and other people in the family has had it too. I've never thought that diabetes might be causing these problems that I'm having. So I'll tell you my background: I'm 16, 5'6 and 119lbs. I'm very active and I eat decently. And now I'll tell you my symptoms: tired, I feel sick after eating sugary foods sometimes, frequent urination. Right after I pee I'll have to go soon after, seriously within 5 minutes. I'm thirsty, and have somewhat of an appetite. Sometimes I'll wake up and be shaky and weak and I'll feel like I have to eat sugar and I'll stuff a bunch of sweets in my face and it makes me feel a little better. My hairs falls out. Uh I get really out of breath easily. PLEASE REPLY ASAP.",
