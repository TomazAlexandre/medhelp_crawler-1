            "answer": "our brain has 4 lobes namely parietal, temporal, occipital and frontal. each lobe has different functions;Symptoms of cerebral infarction are determined by the part/s of the brain affected.http://psychology.about.com/od/biopsychology/ss/brainstructure_2.htmin the client's case, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes on the left side were affected by infarction; infarction is the time when there is decrease blood supply to certain vessels due to blockage.diabetes is a major contributor since it makes the blood very viscous thus can create small blockages.(as what I have known)while small vessel ischemic change means small strokes or prior strokes that were not so evident since they don't create physical symptoms, it usually happens to people in their early 60'sas to when the client can regain his full mental functioning, I don't have the exact answer to that, apparently,we have the same question as to my dad has been in a vegetative state for 6 years and has not fully recovered yet. doctors tell that it would take more time for people to recover in their latter years,but\u00a0\u00a0each case is different; I hope for the client's fast recovery.",
