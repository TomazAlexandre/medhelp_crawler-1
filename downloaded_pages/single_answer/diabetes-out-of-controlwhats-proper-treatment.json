            "answer": "Hello,Your A1C is certainly higher than it should be ideally--the goal is around 7%, so I suggest speaking with your doctor about changing/adding to your current diabetes regimen to bring glucose levels under control.Given your history of bleeding your blood count would be an important thing to review, but you did not list it.
