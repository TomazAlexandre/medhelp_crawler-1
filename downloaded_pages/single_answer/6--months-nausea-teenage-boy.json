            "answer": "It's possible your boy has migraines.\u00a0\u00a0They usually cause vomiting as one of the main symptoms, along with the headache, of course, and sometimes numbness in the extremities.\u00a0\u00a0Bright light can sometimes trigger these things, altho there are many ideas about what causes them and nobody really knows.\u00a0\u00a0There is treatment, including the anti-nausea meds he's taking, and to help the migraines, one medicine among several is Beta Blockers, I've taken those before, very mild and make a person feel so much better no matter what the reason.Another possibility for his vomiting is too much caffeine.\u00a0\u00a0If he drinks sodas, he should drink only those with no caffeine, like Ginger Ale or decaf sodas.\u00a0\u00a0Kids his age will drink tons of sodas, so it's important he not drink the ones with caffeine.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, sometimes store brand sodas will really do a number on the tummy, so he should stick to name brands.I would also suggest the doctors do another stool sample and more comprehensive bloodwork to look for unusual bacteria that can float around in the digestive tract.\u00a0\u00a0This labwork stuff is not that expensive and repeating it may show a clue, since sometimes the first go can indeed miss something.I am assuming the ultrasound would have picked up on any constipation issues.\u00a0\u00a0But if he has constipation a lot, that has got to be straightened out.\u00a0\u00a0Enemas and laxative suppositories can get the waste moving again, and the basics of preventing it are:\u00a0\u00a0Plenty of water, enough exercise, and gradually adding more fiber to his diet.\u00a0\u00a0Typical fiber foods include oat cereal, whole wheat bread, frozen or fresh cooked vegies, dark leafy salads, fruit as a snack.Those would be my ideas.\u00a0\u00a0I sure hope they figure out your son, maybe the endoscopy will shed some light on this.",
