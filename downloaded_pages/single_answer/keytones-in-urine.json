            "answer": "There is a good explanation about keytones on the following website:http://www.diabetes.org/type-1-diabetes/ketoacidosis.jspKeytones are present in the urine when the body starts to burn off its own fat in order to give you energy. This is the body's emergency mechanism in order to survive, and it happens when your glucose levels are too high. You see, your body needs the foods you eat to be properly broken down and used in order to give you energy. When a diabetic person has high glucose levels, this means that there is not enough insulin to metabolize the carbohydrates that you eat and turn them into energy. The brain needs glucose, for this is its primary fuel. If no glucose can be properly metabolized because there is not enough insulin to do this job, then the body goes into its emergency procedure, which is to use the body's fat cells for energy. And when this happens, keytones show up in the urine. It is dangerous and so the most important thing you can do is to lower those glucose levels. If you are newly diagnosed and are on insulin, as the insulin works, the keytones should disappear. If you are a newly diagnosed type 2 and you are seeing keytones, I would call my doctor -- you may need to be put on insulin instead of oral medications.The way to get rid of the keytones is to get your glucose levels under good control. Once you are taking enough insulin (I am assuming that you are a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic), your body will cease to burn off its own fat for energy because the insulin will allow your body to use the carbohydrates (sugars) for energy the way it is supposed to.Now, there is one more thing that can cause keytones to be present -- a lengthy sickness. If keytones are present because you have been sick, then they will go away once the virus is gone and your body is healthy again. But again, if you are sick and this is causing keytones to appear, then you probably should call your doctor and work with him to make sure your glucose levels aren't rising high because of the illness. The actual diet should not be a factor so much as the balance of insulin and the food you eat.",
