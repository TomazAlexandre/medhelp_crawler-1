            "answer": "Hi,How is your mother? Are there other symptoms present? Chills together with burning sensation while urinating highly suggest urinary tract infection (UTI). To confirm the diagnosis, urine tests may be done. UTI may also present with dysuria or pain while urinating, urinary frequency and flank pain. This may be treated with antibiotics. If she is diabetic also, it is important that she monitor her blood sugar and to check her urinalysis for presence of glucose. Have her see her doctor for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",
