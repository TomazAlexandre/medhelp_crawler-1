    "question": "I am 26 years old and for the past 4 1/2 years I have had a heavy, white, DRY vaginal discharge that seems to be similar to yeast but more clumpy and thick. YEAST HAS BEEN COMPLETELY RULED OUT. NO ODOR as well. I have seen many doctors and have ruled out ALL possible STDs including yeast and cervical disorders, diabetes and thyroid conditions. Also just had my hormones tested with normal results. DOES ANYONE OUT THERE HAVE ANY ANSWERS??",
