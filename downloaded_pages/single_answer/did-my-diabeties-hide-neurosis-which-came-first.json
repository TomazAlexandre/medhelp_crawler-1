            "answer": "Wow, have you been through it and back...I don't know what came first, I just have a couple of ideas to toss in the pot.Another cause of diabetes, usually type 2, would be other hormones going awry - a leading cause would be cortisol being high. If the cortisol went up and down, you would have the symptoms, but your testing would be all over the place - and it would also cause a lot of pain.How many hormones, outside of glucose and a regular panel have been tested? I read up on your doc - all his papers are on diabetes, so I am not sure how far any other hormones were tested.For pain, have you tried acupuncture? It may help with the pain without being addictive, It helps with my pain.Just ideas.",

    "question": "I am 35 yrs. old with four kids. lets sstartt at the begining. I was born with lumbar stenosis ( didnt find out about the lumbar stenosis until age 34)and had serverly deformed feet with slight deformaty in mt fingers..I turned 16 was diagnosed with I.T.P, asthma, and diabeties,. All at the same time. I was told not to have kids I would bleed to death b/c of the I.T.P\u00a0\u00a0I was treated with steroids and given insulin .over those two years my parents did not bother to continue the treatment for my diabeties. ( dr.s thought I might have had Lupus) Needless to say two yrs. later I had my first child.After the birth of my son while in the reccovery room they ran cold fluyid through an IV I had a terrible reaction it was life ice was put in my veins. I have not been able to adjust to tempeture especially cold. It takes me a hour or more to warm up in the winter after being out. The summer I feel suficated I need AC at all times I cant sleep without a fan .either My body tempeture changes when I eat sometimes when I open my for the meal I chew a couple times my tempures rises so that I sweat until I stop eating . It stops immediately when Im done.\u00a0\u00a0From age 18 to 23 my blood sugars were never under control Dr. Kwame Osei one of the top endocrinologist in America was my doctor. he had a hard problem controling the the blood sugar even when I was hospitalized, said that I was both type one and two diabetic started treating me with shots and pills..At age 23 I started having seizures, periphial nuerophathy in my feet, depression, and back pain. I was working as a STNA at a nursinng home . Eventually it got to the point I was in so much pain all day I started collecting disability. At age 30 I had my fourth digit amputated I stepped on a carpet tack and I didnt feel it and it was infected to the boneI was treated with IV\u00a0\u00a0anibotics for about three months. At 31 I lost my right eye due to retina detachment after a surgery for retinophathy.At 32 I had my second digit on my left foot amputated for infection from me trying to remove a callas on the fleshy part under my toes.The bone behind the third digit was removed also.At 34 I lost partial use of my\u00a0\u00a0left knee to a fall and I never completely healed I have completely no cartalige or fluid in it. Neddles to say after all these years of living with nuerophathy in the feet it spread to my head, tongue, hands, arms, vagin, and breast. I constinlly feel burning , stinging, and pain all over my body daily. I use1800 mg 3X daily\u00a0\u00a0 Nuerotin and right now 200mg 2X daily ultracet for pain. I refuse peracets Im scared to become addicted . Im already dependant on Nuerotin and maxed out on the dosage.Most doctors say its the diabeties causing the nuerophathy but after ready what nuerosis was I believe I have that and its not just the diabeties.SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK WHAT CAME FIRST THE NUEROSIS OR THE DIABETIES?",
