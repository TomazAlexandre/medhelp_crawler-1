            "answer": "Hi there. This is a patient forum and we don't have the skills to read x-rays and such. We are just here for support and we can offer up a few guesses.I can tell you about my history too - I had impacted wisdom teeth (nasty!) and so did my brother. We both had to have them cut out and I remember I had to deal with infections and headaches - he did not.Given the location of your headache and that you have a clear cause, I would not think, as a layman, that the cause could be anything else but the teeth and infection. After all is out, healed and the infection is gone (some are mighty persistent!) and you still have pain, it may then be something else.Bending over can give anyone a headache.Have your surgery, and I bet all will go away - no tumor.Re the diabetes, yes, that can run in families but if you diet carefully (always a protein with a carb, watch sugar, eat regular meals so your body does not spike or go too low) and even sadly drinking a lot can be an issue as in can convert to sugar. My mom died of diabetes. I don't have it myself though.",

    "question": "Well basically the past 3 months i haven't been up to par. Started as a worry about diabetes (sister has it, so i get worried, pretty bad hypochondriac) Then I started getting headaches every day. They are always on my left side right by my temple. I would get a tingling like sensation in the left side of my face and a few more minor symptoms.Anyway, I figured it could be my wisdom teeth coming in doing the damage (I'm a 16 year old male) I went in for a dental X-ray, turns out they are in and impacting, so this could be playing a role. However, there was a cloudy round spot that they noticed along my sinus. My dentist said it is most likely a sinus infection and prescribed me with 10 day amoxicillin. I am now done the 10 days. My headaches went away pretty much while i was taking the amox, but they have come back. Same spot on my left side by temple and ear. They are very short, sometimes last like 10 seconds to a few minutes. They are also sometimes in the top left side of my frontal part of my head and sometimes cheek pressure. When i bend down, sometimes there is immense pressure in between my eyes. Only sometimes though. Went to a doctor recently she said she is 100% sure it is not a brain tumour but i am still not satisfied. She also prescribed me with a longer prescription of amoxicillin, and i am going to start taking them again tomorrow.And also when i was on 10 days, my facial tingling sensations have completely gone away.Basically the point of this thread, I would appreciate if someone could look at the attached image and tell me their opinion. Do you think it looks like a sinus infection, or could it be a possible tumour in there? :s",
