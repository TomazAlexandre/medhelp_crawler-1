            "answer": "Have you had any tests done for peripheral artery disease?\u00a0\u00a0I have PAD and had my iliac artery stented.\u00a0\u00a0I walked around with the pain in my leg for 2 years shrugging it off as arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0It got to the point where it was too painful to walk around the store or a mall. When the foot went numb I decided to have this checked out.\u00a0\u00a0The doppler showed a problem with the blood flow.\u00a0\u00a0My leg had actually shrunk.\u00a0\u00a0It was 2 inches in diameter smaller than my right leg. The artery was 100% blocked and had been for a couple of years. It took the doctor 4 hours to finally get the stent in place.\u00a0\u00a0The plaque had become so calcified it was hard to get the stent in. The doctor said at one point he thought he would have to do bypass. Just my experience.\u00a0\u00a0Take care, Ally",
