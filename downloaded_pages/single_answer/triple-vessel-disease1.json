            "answer": "Dear chilla105it is of course very difficult to give you an accurate answer without actually seeing you in person but I can give you some pointers that may be of benefit.I'm sorry to hear about your mother having a cardiac arrest but I am glad that a diagnosis has been made and an underlying condition has been\u00a0\u00a0identified. The risk of surgery increases with increasing age, diabetes, history of cardiac arrest and the extent of coronary artery blockages. The risk of death\u00a0\u00a0auto major adverse cardiac event during and after bypass surgery is dependent on multiple factors including the ones that I have listed above.Most cardiac surgeons would provide an\u00a0\u00a0approximate estimate of the risk of surgery. The decision to proceed with surgery would be dependent on the risk of a major complication after surgery versus the quality of life that your mother could have if she were to be managed on medicines alone. Certainly, the outcome of a successful surgery and the fact that your mother does not suffer a major complication would be better than medical management\u00a0\u00a0alone.Hope that helpsCCFHeartMD19",
