    "question": "I am a type 1 diabetic that recently went from controlling my BS with approx 1U per 10g carb ratio to probably 1U per 5g carbs.\u00a0\u00a0I am very healthy aside from the diabetes and excercise frequently. I was officially diagnosed about a year ago but from the results of all the tests run my specialist feels that I was diabetic much longer than that, but keeping it somewhat under control due to lots of exercise and the fact that I don't have a high carb intake.\u00a0\u00a0I would have thought I was past the honeymoon phase due to my tests reflecting beta cell function and how much insulin I could naturally produce was near non existent. I feel ok besides a very mild stuffy nose and was wondering if I could feel fine but be fighting an infection I don't know about yet? Would that affect my BS control that significantly? This is. the first time I have been just a tiny bit sick since my diagnosis",
