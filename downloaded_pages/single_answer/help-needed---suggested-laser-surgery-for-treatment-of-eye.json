    "question": "I\u2019ve got diabetes for last 3 years and few weeks back I started having blurry vision. Got my eyes checked at Evergreen Eye Center, Washington, and after fluorescein angiography it was known that I\u2019m having background diabetic retinopathy. I\u2019ve been expecting this but when laser surgery was suggested a fear came into me. I want someone who had laser surgery for their eyes before to share their experience and tips that would help me continue my treatment at the earliest.",
