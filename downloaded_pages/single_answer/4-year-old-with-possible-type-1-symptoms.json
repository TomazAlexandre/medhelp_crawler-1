            "answer": "Unfortunately, it does sound as if your daughter is exhibiting symptoms of type 1 diabetes. The fruity breath and \" virus\"\u00a0\u00a0could be symptoms of ketones in her urine and DKA, diabetic ketoacidosis which is a very serious condition. Her symptoms sound like diabetes and those kind of blood sugars don't happen for non-diabetics. However, I am not a doctor and it is good that she is seeing her doctor tomorrow.What I do want to tell you is that if she is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes it will totally change your lives. You will have a great deal to learn. But in time it will be integrated into your life and your daughter will be able to do anything other girls can do. And the technology is getting better all the time and a lot of research being done. If she does get diagnosed send me a private message and I will give you a website with lots of other diabetic and parents of diabetics so you can learn from their experiences. Good luck and hang in there.Zoe",
