            "answer": "Really informative and interesting\u2026.. It\u2019s long been understood that there is a connection between memory problems and diabetes, a disorder characterized by excessively high blood sugar. Sugar provides the body with fuel for various processes, including memory processing. Memory and diabetes have been associated for quite some time. A lot of queries have been there if whether or not the consideration of diabetes really has an influence on the memory. The connection between memory and diabetes was made very early because of the place that memories are stored \u2013 the brain. The brain is highly affected by the levels of blood glucose in the body. Recent research shows that high blood sugar levels are linked to memory loss. The best way to maintain a healthy blood glucose level is to exercise regularly. What does regularly mean? It means that you should spend at least 20 minutes focusing on raising your heart rate. Do this at least three times each week. Thanks",
