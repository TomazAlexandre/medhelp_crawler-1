            "answer": "If you ovulated just a couple of days ago it would be way too early to have any pregnancy symptoms. If you are trying to get pregnant the best thing to do is start tracking your ovulation so that you know the best days to have intercourse. You can do this by taking your basal body temperature (google it for more info on how that works) and also using an ovulation predictor kit that you can buy at the drugstore. This is especially important if you have irregular periods, because sometimes that means that you aren't ovulating regularly, and there are medications the doctor can give to help with that.Definitely talk to your doctor about your plans to get pregnant because of your diabetes. That can add some extra complications, so you will want to be under the close care of a doctor.Best of luck to you!",
