            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Loss of balance can be due to inner ear problem, Meniere\u2019s disease, diabetes with peripheral sensory neuropathy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, affect of certain medications, past head injuries, loss of foot\u2019s perceptions and sensibilities, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), joint weakness etc.Even if you have no pain in the ear or apparent infection, wax in the ear, internal ear infection or labrynthitis can cause balance problems. Postural hypotension or BP falling with change of posture is another cause. Cervical spondylosis (or pinched cervical nerves due to any cause), mini strokes, MS, high blood pressure, tumors or injury to cerebellum of the brain, syncopal attacks, severe anemia, and thyroid disorders are some of the causes for loss of balance.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
