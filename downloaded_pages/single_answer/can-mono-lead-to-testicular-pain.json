    "question": "I started having problems with testical pain about a month ago. I went to my doctor had no std, diabetes, and blood was normal. I went to a urologist and everything was normal. I then went back to the doctor and asked him to do a mono test. It came back positive. My question is could the testicular pain and muscle pain be from having sex with a person with mono?",
