            "answer": "Dear LisaWhen you have serious symptoms such as you describe, it is always appropriate to seek medical help. You cannot yourself differentiate what is causing the symptoms. Anyway, too much Lanoxin can be a serious problem also and can require treatment.I hope this has been useful. I wish you the best of luck.

    "question": "Previously posted 40 y/o female with history of CHF, atrial Fib,diabetes, stroke.\u00a0\u00a0 Last Thursday morning\u00a0\u00a0I woke up with intermittent chest pain, nausea, fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0 Upon arrival at hospital I was told I was dehydrated and the lanoxin was too highand was causing the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 After 2 days I was re-hydrated and released when lanoxin levels started falling.\u00a0\u00a0How can onetell the difference between a REALLY serious chest pain (with nausea and exhaustion) from something like what I was admitted with?\u00a0\u00a0 And how can a person who only walks from the car to the house and drinks 2 quarts of water a day get dehydrated?\u00a0\u00a0Is it a result of my multiple health problems? Thanks, Lisa",
