            "answer": "What do you mean by gurgling in the chest? Does it rattle deep down in your chest? Or maybe is it some mucous that dripped from your throat into the top of your airways? I do know that some people from post nasal drip or GERD can sometimes wake up feeling like they are suffocating due to a buildup of mucous at the top of the airways or in the throat area, which is blocking proper air flow. If it is deep in your chest, you will develop a fever and acquire an infection, due to too much mucous in the airways. You can see your doctor and discuss what can be done for your problem, especially if it occurs more on a regular basis.",
