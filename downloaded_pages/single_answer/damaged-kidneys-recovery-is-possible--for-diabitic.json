            "answer": "First and foremost you need to start controlling and managing your diabetes better. Having levels of 650 mg/dl is suicidal. Consistent high levels can and will damage your kidneys, create heart disease, and can lead to neuropathy [amputation]. Making lifestyle changes is required to reign in and control your diabetes - eating a proper diabetic nutrition, maintain normal body weight, exercise 30-60 minutes daily, maintain normal blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and above all, stop depending on medication to resolve your health issues.Are you seeing a Nephrologist, a kidney doctor? Have you had a CT Scan, an MRI or a kidney biopsy performed? These will inform the doctor of how far along your CKD [chronic kidney disease] is and what treatment can be undertaken. Good luck",
