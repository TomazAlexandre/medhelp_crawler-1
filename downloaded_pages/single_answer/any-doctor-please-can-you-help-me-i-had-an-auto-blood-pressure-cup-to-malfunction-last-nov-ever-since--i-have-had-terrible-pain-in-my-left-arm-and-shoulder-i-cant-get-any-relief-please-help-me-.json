            "answer": "Hi there.I understand your concern.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes makes the body prone to neuropathies, especially peripheral neuropathy which affects the distal hands and foot.\u00a0\u00a0Your symptoms may really be due to nerve damage, however, it is very hard to say or ascertain if the blood pressure cuff could have actually caused the damage, though by proximity of events, it is also very hard to discount the possibility.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that you seek consult with another doctor, as there are good medicines that can address and relieve neuropathic pain that he can prescribe.\u00a0\u00a0Massage therapy also works for some people, even alternative treatments like accupuncture.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you will be rid of this pain as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Regards and God bless.",

After about a few days my arm started bothering me right where the cup was also elbow and below elbow and my shoulder ...I can't raise my arm and when I touch my elbow against something it feels like an electrical shock...My shoulder and neck\u00a0\u00a0hurts so bad I actually cry...Can't sleep .My arm feels like it is broken...I went back to the same ER ,They had no idea about anything that happened before so they asked if I had injured it in any way so I tell them about the incident that happened in ER prior to\u00a0\u00a0coming in that day{same hospital}...They refused to do test until I insisted which was only an ex-ray..No broken bones I was told...I was told it was neuropathy because I am A diabetic..Please note I never had this before...The pain is overwhelming...Suddenley my doctor doesn't care anymore!!
