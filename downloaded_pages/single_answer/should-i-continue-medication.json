            "answer": "Extremist,I reviewed the 6/26/03 post.(1) \"Lone afib\" is a term used to describe atrial fibrillation in a young person without any risk factors for stroke and in whom no underlying reason for the afib is apparent.\u00a0\u00a0So 3 requirements have to be met before one can be given the diagnosis of \"Lone Afib\": (1) youth, (2) no risk factors such as heart failure, previous stroke, hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease, and (3) no cause for the afib, like hyperthyroidism or pericarditis.\u00a0\u00a0If these requirements are met, then the annual stroke risk is about 1 to 1.5% if the person is in persistent afib.(2) You NEED follow-up.\u00a0\u00a0It can either be with the cardiologist who saw you in the ER or with your internist, but the decision regarding the atenolol is a judgement call.\u00a0\u00a0Health care in general should be by committee (you and your doctor) rather than by dictatorship (the doctor alone).\u00a0\u00a0Why you ask?\u00a0\u00a0Because historically people try to kill dictators -- what I mean to say is that the only chance you have of being satisfied that the right thing is being done for you is if you understand the risks/benefits of your treatment.(3) Have you been cursing more? Have you stepped on sidewalk cracks? Walked under a ladder?\u00a0\u00a0Just as we don't know why many patients have heart attacks or cancer, we don't know why many of the patients have afib.\u00a0\u00a0Precipitating causes do exist, however, and include hyperthyroidism, myocarditis, pericarditis, heart attacks, hypertension, valvular heart disease, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, electrocution, pulmonary embolism, just to name a few.\u00a0\u00a0Many patients, however, have none of these.You mentioned in your previous post that you were 80-90 pounds overweight.\u00a0\u00a0This degree of obesity frequently leads to high blood pressure, which can lead to afib.\u00a0\u00a0Further, obesity can lead to heart failure, which is another cause of afib.Hope that helps, and good luck.",
