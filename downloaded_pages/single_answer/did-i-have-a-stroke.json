My husband just got diagnosed with diabetes last Saturday, and the doctor said that a lot of people think they are having a stroke, and then find out they have diabetes......have them do the test that tests your blood 3 months back (I guess you blood keeps a memory.)",

    "question": "I am a 39 yo male, 5'10\", 275 lbs, treated high blood pressure that is under controll and the same with high chol...I do not or have I ever drank alcahol, smoked tobacco or done drugs of any sort. I have allways been very healthy up untill the last 3 or 4 years.Monday afternoon I was in our back yard when I started feeling strange, My daughter pointed out some flowers that were grownin under our boat and I said I would need to move the car. I knew it wasnt a car but could not connect the boat with the word boat. The next thing I remember is being at our back door, not knowing how to use it. I knew it was wood but could not think of how to get past it. Then I was in our house and saw mud on our carpet but did not know to take off my boots (it is muddy in our yard) then I was infront of our toilet and I needed to urinate but could not figure out how to make that work. I was then looking at a bottle of tea and very thirsty but again could not figure out how to use it. I knew that something was very wrong with me but could not tell anyone about what was going on. (physicly) My torso also seemed \"heavy\"Both of my hands were asleep. I could not feel my lips and kept pressing them together not knowing if my mouth was closed or not. I lost all memory of any events inbetween the times described above. I went to my doc today (wed) and was ordered a M.R.I. that returned clean for stroke signs.I feel somewhat better today but am still a little confused and very tired. I have a pulling sensation kind of headache towards the right rear of my head. (I have no other way of describing this)I have found myself staring into nothing not knowing how long I have been staring.I am conserned about this and would appriciate any input anyone might have for me.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
