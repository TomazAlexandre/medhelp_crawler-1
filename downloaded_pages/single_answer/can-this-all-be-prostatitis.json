            "answer": "Hello,One of the possibilities for your symptoms is prostatitis. Also get any obstruction in the urine stream ruled out. Diabetes can also present with urge to urinate and hence blood sugar levels need to be done.Diagnostic tests that may be performed include Urinalysis, Urine culture, X-rays of the kidneys, Cystoscopy, IVP, prostatic ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen. I suggest you to get an examination done from a urologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Back in February I started to have problems having to urinate a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Beginning of March I went into a doctor and he said I had prostatitis and put me on an antibiotic.\u00a0\u00a0About a month and a half later I was starting to feel better and a year of problems came to an end with a divorce.\u00a0\u00a0Moved out of my house and kept missing my morning antibiotic.\u00a0\u00a0Had a followup shortly after and they said to continue on the antibiotic and be sure to take it twice a day.I am so uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like i have to urinate very bad, and then barely go and dribble at the end.\u00a0\u00a0I hurt down into my testicles, into my belly button.\u00a0\u00a0Also the skin of the head of my penis is very irritated which they said can be a side effect of prostatitis.\u00a0\u00a0I am so frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like this is never going to go away!All day I feel a burning feeling at the tip of my penis and keep feeling like I have to urinate.\u00a0\u00a0The first visit I went in they did test to see how much urine was still in my bladder after I went.Is the skin irritation normal?\u00a0\u00a0Is there something else I should be doing to help move this along?\u00a0\u00a0I had this once before a couple years ago but it went away very quickly.",
