            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, if the levels are marginally low, then no cause of worry. Repeat test after a month and see. However if the levels are too low, then yes, you should worry. Low albumin can be the result of malabsorption syndromes, Celiac disease, chronic hepatitris B or C, non alcoholic hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson\u2019s disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and alpha 1 antitrypsin enzyme deficiency. Hence all tests to rule these out should be done. It would be good to consult a hepatologist. Increased urinary loss as in kidney problems or due to diabetes can also be investigated.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Hope this helps. Take care!",
