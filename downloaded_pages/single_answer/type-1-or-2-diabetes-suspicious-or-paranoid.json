    "question": "So, I am a 23 year old female, 5'9 and 140lbs. I know you probably are all rolling your eyes, but you'd be surprised at how often doctors ASK me if I am diabetic.I am having a whole lot of onset symptoms.-Recently, I cannot stop drinking and I have to urinate approximately ever 30min - one hour. Even when I don't drink a lot, I still urinate quite frequently.-I have NEVER had problems with my skin but lately, my skin has been INCREDIBLY dry, so bad to a point where I can't write with a pen that the chapping on my hands is so bad. Its even dry around my vaginal area which is really really strange.- I have been getting frequent yeast infections which I have never had up until a few months ago.- Ear infections are constant, and keep coming back or wont respond to anti biotics. Ringing in one ear, facial numbness, slight weakness on left side....- I have trouble seeing now, I thought I may need glasses but who knows, it could be all related.- I am rapidly losing weight.- The tips of my fingers and toes and numb along with the inside of my vaginal labia (sorry)I am not sure what to think, I do know that if doctors constantly asking me this - so could someone give me an input on what they think?Thanks",
