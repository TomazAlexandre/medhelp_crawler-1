            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include GU infections/ inflammations, enlarged prostate, neuro-muscular issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, renal causes, metabolic disorders, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis, psychological issues etc. just to name a few. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors such as stress. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work; I would suggest seeing your primary care physician or a urologist for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",
