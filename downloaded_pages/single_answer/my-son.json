            "answer": "That's a normal sugar level for a healthy person who just ate some candy. Does your son have any symptoms of diabetes, like peeing and drinking a lot or weight loss?To keep you from worrying so much, check your son in the morning before he eats and check a few times randomly throughout the day. As long as he's below 100 when he wakes up and he doesn't rise to close to 200 after eating, he's likely fine. You can always take him into the doctor if you have any concerns.",
