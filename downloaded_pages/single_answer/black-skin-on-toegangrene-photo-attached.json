    "question": "I notice a small patch of black skin on the edge of my toe, I might have cut a bit of the skin when trimming my nails a few days back.I have no history of diabetes. Male, 44 years old.No pain in the area, no numbness either, the toe feels 100%I thought perhaps it might be a dirt mark or piece of fluff, tried to to scrub and pull it off so it is now slightly tender, but not at all painful.I am posting a picture of the area, this taken just after I tried to scrub it and pick at it, so it appears slightly red.Is this gangrene or should I just put some bacterial ointment on the area and keep an eye on it for a few days?Any help would really alleviate alot of stress.",
