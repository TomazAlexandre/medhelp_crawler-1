    "question": "Hi. I am a 28 year old female. I had an MRI of my brain done a while ago and just read the radiologists report as I am now filing for disability. The report states that there are several white matter spots on the frontal areas of my brain. I asked my own neuro over the phone and the nurse said that he was \"unconcerned\" but wanted me to come in. I initially saw him for neuropthy of the feet and hands. I do not have diabetes. I was dxed with fibromyalgia, SI joint disease, OA, slight bulging discs, narrowing of the spine, among many other things. I am going to a new rheumatologist and I plan on bringing this up. I am aware that lesions could mean MS. While I am not diagnoising myself, I do show signs of that disease and there is a family history. My question is are white matter spots and lesions the same thing? Are white matter spots something to not be concerned about? If so, why would the radiologist note it as abnormal in the report?",
