            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confirming a diagnosis is tough,but it sounds like hives. Hives (medically known as urticaria) are red, itchy, raised areas of skin that appear in varying shapes and sizes. They have a tendency to change size rapidly and to move around, disappearing in one place and reappearing in other places, often in a matter of hours.Many cases of hives are \"idiopathic,\" meaning no cause is known. Others may be triggered by viral infections or medications.Other possibilities are dermatitis,psoriasis and irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods. Internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia and thyroid diseases can also cause itchy rashes.Since you are having thyroid disorder,so its chance of causing this itchy rash is more.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Also pls don\u2019t scratch the rash as it may cause infections.If the symptoms persist,a consultation of a dermatologist will be the best.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
