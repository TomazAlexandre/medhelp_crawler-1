            "answer": "OK, so a very athletic child with diabetes, a challenge, add Addison's and you have got a big big challenge. First thing I would consider is an insulin pump. Also a blood sugar of 20 is mmol correct so that is really 360 mg/dl, again not good control.In regards to his Addison's-is he on cortisol and is he on too much, this can raise sugars, also the higher readings may be rebound from lows, or rises due to the other hormones the body makes with exercise. I have alot of swimmers and the pump is nice, diconnect for swimming, reconnect every 30-40 minutes and check sugar and give back some insulin depending on what their doc recommends.He is not hurting himself with the exercise but really needs to work with an endocrinologist who is patient and can work closely with him, they can consider continuous glucose monitoring(NOT in the pool!!!)There are also folks who study diabetes and exercise, one of the labs that I was in for years did this and sometimes some important information is collected.So start with your peds endo and if he is near 18 get an adult endo who really really knows diabetes and pumps and sensors and monitors, it takes a team to work with this, also even though he is checking, does he really know what to do with his numbers -this is where the diabetes educator and pump nurses are so helpful.Let us know what happens.",

    "question": "Is there somewhere to go for SPECIFIC assistance for Competitive athletes who have diabetes and Addison's ?We are not getting enough input or assistance. This shouldn't be this hard. There must be others who have experienced this - or who can help us.My son trains for swimming 6 times a week for 2 hours at a time. We are not in control of his blood counts. We test and test and test and we are no closer to a solution. There seem to be to many variables. We have trouble getting his counts into a good range for practice never mind for meets.How can he even hope to be successful when his blood sugar is in the 20's ( Canada ) 15 minutes before a race. It is like he is trying to swim and his blood is molases.He is a triathlete. He loves to run and he is quite good at the triathlons.He wants to compete. He loves it.Does anyone have any input for us ?ThanksMelanie",
