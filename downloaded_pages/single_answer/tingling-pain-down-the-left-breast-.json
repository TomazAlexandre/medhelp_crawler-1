            "answer": "Hi!If you were working outdoors or exercising, the trickling down sensation can be due to sweat trickling down.Otherwise any abnormal sensation such as trickling down sensation with a feeling of warmth can be due to clot in a vein or deep vein thrombosis or due to peripheral neuropathies secondary to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme's or lupus.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
