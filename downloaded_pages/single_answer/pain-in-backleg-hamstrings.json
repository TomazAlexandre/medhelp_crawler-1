            "answer": "Hello,What you seem to be having is spasm of the muscles. It can be due to overextension of the muscles, overweight, prolonged standing during the day, dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low calcium, sodium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, nerve compression, and multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy or stroke.Some of these causes like dehydration, being overweight, alcohol intake and prolonged standing are modifiable by efforts of the patient.My advise is to consult a physician and rule out the above medical conditions by thorough investigations as without physical examination and investigations, pinpointing a diagnosis is tough. Hope it helps. Take care and do keep me posted on how you are doing. Warm regards.",
