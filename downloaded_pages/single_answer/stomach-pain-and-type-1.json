    "question": "My 10-year-old daughter was diagnosed with type one in September. She was doing really well with her bgs until about 6 weeks ago. At that time, her bgs began running high. She also started to complain of stomach pain. The stomach pain has gotten more severe of late. It seems to be worse when she eats and is sometimes accompanied by bloating. When she was diagnosed, they tested her for celliac disease and the test was negative. Her pediatrition couldn't find anything \"wrong\" with her. Her endo team has been making some adjustments in her insulin but she is still running high...none of the changes seem to be making a difference. What can we do to help her numbers come back down into target? Is the stomach pain related to diabetes? Could she develop celliac disease in the past few months? Thank you for your input...I am very worried about her and need some advice. Thanks :)",
