            "answer": "Hello,Gestational diabetes required careful monitoring of blood glucose levels in pregnancy. Dietary changes and exercise may be enough to keep your blood sugar levels under control but if the blood sugar levels are rising then you may need treatment. Other than insulin injections, you may be prescribed oral antihyperglycemic drugs.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
