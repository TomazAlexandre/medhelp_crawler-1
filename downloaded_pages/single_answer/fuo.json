    "question": "For the last month i have been running a low grade fever that runs up to 100.8. My normal temp is 97.3 and for the last several years i have been running low grade fevers that stay between 98.6-99.2. In the last month the temp has been up and I have protein in the urine, although it is lower than last year. Last year it was in the 300's and this year in the 200's. I feel like i can't completely empty my bladder but a UTI has been ruled out. Any ideas on what else to do. I also get the worst case of night sweats, waking up soaked and feeling as if i need a shower and change night clothes.",
