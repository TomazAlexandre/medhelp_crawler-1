            "answer": "Hi there. You have metastatic breast disease with secondaries in bone. The cervical spine disc herniations are apparently responsible for the dizziness, numbness of left hand. Lumbar spine MRI needs to be done to exclude any lumbar nerve root irritation. Peripheral neuropathy causes like diabetes, autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, vitamin deficiencies\u00a0\u00a0need to be checked. Another possibility for these varied symptoms could be a paraneoplastic syndrome due to the breast cancer. Discuss these possibilities with your neurologist when you meet him. Take care.",
