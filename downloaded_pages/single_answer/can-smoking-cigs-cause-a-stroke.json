    "question": "I am trying to quit smoking and just have to say no to the habit.\u00a0\u00a0what kind of scares me is when I take a deep drag off a cigarette I get double vision of distant objects.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if that is a sign of a stroke coming since I assume that the double vision is caused by the constricting of a blood vessel somewhere which cuts off the oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0But thats just my theory.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to have a physical soon and talk to the doctor about that.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any ideas on this symptom?",
