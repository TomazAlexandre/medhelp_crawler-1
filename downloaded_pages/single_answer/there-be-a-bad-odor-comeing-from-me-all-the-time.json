            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Body odour can be caused due to a number of reasons like poor hygiene, infections (fungal, bacterial or parasitic), hormonal changes during puberty, hyperhydrosis, some metabolic disorders, a few foods like spices garlic etc, stale sweat, penile discharge, gastrointestinal disorders, diabetes, ketoacidosis, urinary tract infection, scurvy etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary care physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this helps.Take care!",
