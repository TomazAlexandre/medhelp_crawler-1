            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your father. He has a recent onset (subacute) but not acute closure or narrowing or spasm of certain blood vessels in the brain causing restricted blood supply to the areas of the brain supplied by these arteries. This could be causing dizziness and change in blood pressure reading. Nothing much can be done to reverse the condition, but the doctor may prescribe medications to keep the blood thin and avoid further plaque formation. BP fluctuations and blood sugar fluctuations need to be seriously monitored, especially if he has diabetes and is on medications. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
