            "answer": "These drugs may or may not help you.\u00a0\u00a0This sounds more like a valve issue.\u00a0\u00a0They are not covered by insurance normally, but you might try them and see.Cialis is supposed to last a couple of days so they might give you more planning time.\u00a0\u00a0I have heard from others that Viagra stays with them for a day but does not take affect in 30 min for them.I understand wives generally do not like to plan an occasion, so you will need to become extremely familiar with her cycle and behaviors.\u00a0\u00a0More communication will help.It will take a prescription for these, which most doctors do not mind giving.\u00a0\u00a0There is only a slim chance of any bad side effect.If it is a valve issue, you will need surgery to fix it.Also, have your prostate tests done and eliminate any possible problems there.Lastly, just because I let everyone know this, if you otherwise masturbate to porn, you need to remove your mind from this to be healthy in the bedroom.",

    "question": "I'm type 2 diabetic and in my 40's and from the start of this year I've had problems with my penis going limp / soft during intercourse with my wife... it stays hard 50% of the time and the other 50% of the time it goes soft very quickly after insertion... I was told 20 years ago when diagnosed with diabetes that later in life there may be erection problems, but I thought that meant people who were 60 + not people my age.I've looked into Cialis and Viagra, but apparently the pills take 30 mins to work and my wife wouldn't want to wait that long for my penis to get erect.... has anyone used either pill and do they work and were there any side effects?I want to be able to please my wife and ejaculate inside her with an erect penis",
