            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. The symptoms that you mentioned numbness, tingling and pain, heaviness can occur due nervous disorders. Enlarged prostrate does not cause any of the symptoms that you mentioned, because it does not compress any of the nerves.Are your sugar levels under control? Diabetic neuropathies are neuropathic disorders that are associated with diabetes mellitus. These conditions are thought to result from diabetic microvascular injury involving small blood vessels that supply nerves. Relatively common conditions which may be associated with diabetic neuropathy include third nerve palsy, mononeuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic amyotrphy; a painful polyneuropathy; autonomic neuropathy; and thoracoabdominal neuropathy. It affects all peripheral nerves and manifests with numbness, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, impotence, dysesthesia, dysphagia, dizziness, muscle weakness etc.Despite advances in the understanding of the metabolic causes of neuropathy,treatments aimed at interrupting these pathological processes have been limited by side effects and lack of efficacy. Thus, with the exception of tight glucose control, treatments are for reducing pain and other symptoms and do not address the underlying problems.I would suggest you to visit your physician and neurologist for further assistance.Take care.",

    "question": "For the last four days I have experienced numbness in my genital areas which has spread to my inner thighs, along with that I have an extremely swollen rectum which hydrocortisone suppositories will not work on. At the same time I started having numbness on the bottoms of my feet which has spread upwards up my calves almost to my knees. My feet feel heavy and are painful to walk on. I am 65 yrs old and have had Diabetes for 3 yrs. I have a very large prostate, about 140 cc. Could an enlarged prostate cause these symptoms? NEED HELP! Went to ER 2 nights ago. Urine showed no sign of infection, blood work all in normal range, and CAT scan to my lower back showed no pressure on spine or nerves. Any idea what this could be???",
