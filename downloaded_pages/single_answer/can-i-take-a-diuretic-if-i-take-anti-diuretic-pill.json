    "question": "I have hypothyriodism, but that's not my main problem here. I don't know where else to post this. I wanted to take wheatgrass powder. I found out tho, it has a mild diuretic effect to it. I'm taking an anti-diuretic pill now for years because I have a condition called diabetes insipidus (water diabetes), to stop me from going to the bathroom alot. I REALLY wanted to take this wheatgrass powder form, but it seems maybe I shouldnt? Any thoughts?",
