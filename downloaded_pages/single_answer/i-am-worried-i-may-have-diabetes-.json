            "answer": "Hi there!Your blood sugar levels do not seem to be deranged nor do any other of your symptoms specify the need to suspect diabetes. It is normal for the blood sugar to rise after food and as long as these are within the specified range there is no cause to suspect diabetes. I would suggest getting the headaches and the blurred vision evaluated by a primary care physician or an ophthalmologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
