            "answer": "Hello,Frequnet urge to urinate can be due to excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones. I suggest you to take opinion of your doctor who would do a clinical examination and advice for needful tests (such as routine urinanalysis, blood glucose test, blood & urinary osmolalities, ultrasonography of renal system, etc).I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Keep needing to urinate about 5 times a day. No pain when urinating, no blood, colour of urine is normal. I've been drinking plenty of fluids and a glass of water with a teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate twice a day aswell as 4 cranberry supplements a day. I've had UTI twice before so i know the symptoms, if this was an infection then i think im rid of it but the urge to urinate hasnt gone yet, although the urge isn't very strong either but its something i dont want to risk ignoring.\u00a0\u00a0Under stress, for the first time i've been binging on sweets for about 3 weeks, not badly though, i dont usually have much of a sweet tooth. I've been sugar free for nearly two weeks now.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions?",
