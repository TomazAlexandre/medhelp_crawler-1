            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Firstly I would like to mention that there is no change required in the diet even after surgery, if the patient was taking the appropriate diet before surgery. Secondly, uncontrolled sugars should be brought under control as this prolongs the healing period after any surgery.Diet should consist of high fiber diet, complex carbohydrates, reduce the cereals and take little more proteins. Fruits like apple, cherries, pears, peaches, plums, guava etc. Whole cereals like whole wheat, dalia, whole wheat flour should be included in the diet.Consult your physician for treatment of diabetes.Best.",
