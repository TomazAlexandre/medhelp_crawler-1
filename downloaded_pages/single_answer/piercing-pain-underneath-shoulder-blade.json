            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.The location of your pain in the shoulder blade and the \u201cpinky\u201d symptoms would be odd. The symptoms in your medial finger (pinky) may be secondary to a neuropathy from the ulnar nerve. This nerve is also known as your \u201cfunny bone\u201d when tapped or hit. It has several sites of compression along its course \u2013 one site being at the elbow. Classically, it may be a truck driver who rests elbow on window/door. It should also be mentioned that with rapid weight gain or weight loss, the ulnar nerve or median nerve (which causes carpal tunnel syndrome) can be compressed and cause their neuropathies. Neuropathies can also be caused by many mechanisms including microtrauma (overuse), hypothyroidism, weight changes, amyloidsosis, and diabetes, to name a few.The pain in the shoulder blade may be local irriation/strain. Have you followed up with your primary care physician to address this? If not, I would suggest you follow up to determine if there is a connection between the two symptoms.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
