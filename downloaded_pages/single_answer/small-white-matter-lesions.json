            "answer": "Hi!It all depends on the type of lesions. Small punctuate white matter foci can be due to migraine, diabetes, high cholesterol, high BP etc. Diagnosis of MS is complicated as no single diagnostic test is confirmatory. However, more than 90 percent people are diagnosed based on MRI only, which shows multiple demyelinating plaques (so may be the lesions are not demyelinating plaques). The number of plaques increases with MS flare.\u00a0\u00a0Since you also have other symptoms suggestive of peripheral neuropathies, you must get tested for diabetes, thyroid disorders, lupus, and electrolyte imbalance. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "My current neuro saw small white matter sub cortical lesions on an MRI from a couple years ago. I am 26, is this normal? And how does he rule out MS if there are lesions? Can lesions heal? Or become invisible on other mri's?I have sharp stabbing pains in random places that last for seconds, muscle burning in one area at a time, muscle twitches all day and night, vertigo, delayed muscle relaxation especially in neck,\u00a0\u00a0ribs, hands and ankles, muscle will feel like it's about to fall asleep even though I am not in a position that would cause it to fall asleep( with pins and needles), occasional skin prickling, very small translucent \"target\" shaped circle in my left center vision, cheekbone/eyebrow/jaw/behind ear stabs which I believe are called Trigeminal Neuralgia.Recent EEG cleared epilepsy (which he was concerned about), Visual evoked potentials was normal, all my blood work was normal, and this last MRI in September the neuro did not say if the original hyper intensities were still visible, but he said he didn't believe it was MS. He said for me to read about Ion Channelopathies....Has anybody been in a situation similar to this? Any input would be appreciated",
