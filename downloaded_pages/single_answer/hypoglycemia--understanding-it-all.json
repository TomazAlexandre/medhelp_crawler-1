    "question": "Forgive me for posting this here on the diabetes board but I didn't find one related to hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0This is probably the right place though, considering they are the opposite of each other.My husband was diagnosed with being hypoglycemic some years back.\u00a0\u00a0Just recently has he been experiencing some of the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0We are trying to make changes in our diet\u00a0\u00a0and eating more small meals or snacks instead of fewer large ones.\u00a0\u00a0We are still working on getting the exercising part in motion.We have introduced more fresh veggies, low fat and low sugar foods, whole grains, reduced carbs and more protein.\u00a0\u00a0Is this correct?\u00a0\u00a0Also, would caffeine cause the blood sugar to drop?I look forward to your experienced input!",
