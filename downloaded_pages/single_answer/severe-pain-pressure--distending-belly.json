            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear that you have been suffering from constipation for three years with what looks like inadequate follow ups. Since you are suffering for three years, you probably know that chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber, dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies.Of these severe acidity with gastric ulcer has been diagnosed in your case. Acidity can also cause gas to build up in the gut. Hence possibility of H pylori infection should be looked into through carbon urea breath test, if possible. You may have been started on some drugs to treat the stomach ulcers. Usually, you may be prescribed a combination of medications like a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole, lansoprazole or pantoprazole empty stomach in the morning and an antacid gel after meals or H-2 blocker such as ranitidine for complete relief.Apart from this you will need to follow some lifestyle changes such as: Drink cold milk. Avoid heavy meals and eat frequent small meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, smoking, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Avoid lying down for least 2 hours after food. Take a late night snack.Also, log in what you eat and see if there is a correlation between a certain food type and the symptoms. Drink 7-8 glasses of a combination of the following: water/fresh fruit juice/clear soups. Eat fresh fruits, salads, whole grains, cereals etc for roughage.Usually symptoms like gas/distension and constipation which come in episodes are due to an irritable bowel disease such as IBS, Crohn\u2019s disease, celiac or due to food allergy or thyroid problem or diabetes. Ask your doctor to test for the above mentioned causes of chronic constipation.When you have distension, walk around a bit. Use some warm compress (not directly on the belly). Often this helps relieve the distension.I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health. Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor. Try and adapt the mentioned lifestyle changes.Hope you get well soon! Good Luck and take care!",

    "question": "For the past few years I've suffered from severe lower belly pain and pressure and painful pressure on my buttox. During these \"episodes\" my lower stomach distends so much I look at least 4-5 months pregnant.I say episodes because I will be ok for 1-3 days then not ok the next few days. It feels better just not to eat anything!A little history.. I have suffered from constipation with little relief for about 3 years, since this has been happening. In 2011 it got so bad that I didn't have a bowel movement for almost 2 weeks. My doctor gave me miralax. The next day I passed out and ended up in the hospital with a fecal impaction. No further follow up per my primary at the time.2012- Was hospitalized, had an endoscopy and found out I had 4 \"impressive\" ulcers. I asked the gastroenterologist if that was causing my other issues, he said no.No further follow ups..Im simply asking if anyone else had had similar issues and any advice :(\u00a0\u00a0it's absolutely miserable!I am 29 years old.",
