            "answer": "HI,Thank you for writing in on behalf of your friend.This is indeed a serious problem. I am glad he recognizes that, but now he needs to seek some professional help. Withdrawals from medication can be quite serious and he will need some professional help in guiding his recovery, so please encourage him to seek some help from an addiction center or his own physician as soon as possible. This is very, very dangerous, and can lead to his death in the worst of circumstances.In terms of diabetes, the medications themselves do not necessarily cause a complication as such. BUT the most serious problem may be his inability to adequately take care of his diabetes, most worrisome if his blood sugars are too low or too high, because he is impaired by the pain medications. This can also have serious consequences including death.Please urge your friend to seek help soon. You may need to take drastic meaures and turn him in to get this done.Take care of yourself, and your friend.",

    "question": "I am seeking information for a friend of mine. He is 23 years old and has diabetes. He has also recently developed a pain pill addiction. What started as help for his back pain turned into a recreational nightmare that has lead to him snorting pain pills instead of swallowing them. He has admitted to having a problem but when he tried to stop using (cold turkey for 2 days) he couldnt handle the withdrawls. Are there added risks from taking-snorting pills due to his diabetes? Are there any web sites that have any information about this? I have been looking for information but have only found info about the pill addiction and not complications that can occur due to his diabetes. He has been taking pills for \"recreational\" reasons for about a year now but has been taking them daily for only the past 2 or 3 months, and did not start snorting them until 3 or 4 weeks ago. Any help will be great! Thanks.",
