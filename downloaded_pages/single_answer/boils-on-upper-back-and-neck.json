    "question": "For many years I\u2019ve had large reoccurring boils on my upper back. Occasionally I get them on my neck as well. They are a constant source of pain and shame. Recently I\u2019ve been trying once again to get rid of them. But nothing works. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying:1.\tMultivitamin to boost my immune system and overall health2.\tA healthy diet consisting of vegetables, lean meats and occasional fruit.3.\tTrilex herbal tea, formulated for skin health.4.\tAntibacterial body wash.5.\tI\u2019ve been making sure to take off my shirt before bed each night to help the skin on my back breath.6.\tNo more hot showers that could damage the outer layer of my skin, I hear that makes it easy for staph to get in.7.\tI got tested for diabetes. I don\u2019t have it.8.\tI moved from Seattle to Los Angeles for a while and it helped lessen the condition. I assume it has something to do with the dry heat. But I\u2019m back in Seattle now.9.\tFor a while I lived in Wyoming working a hard job on the drilling rigs. This also helped to alleviate the condition; I actually went about a month and a half without a boil. But I don\u2019t work there anymore.10.\tA long time ago I took antibiotics for it. They killed the boils, but when the antibiotics ran out the boils came back.I\u2019ve heard that staph can colonize your nose and from there re-infect your skin. Perhaps I should try some sort of nasal spray? How would I know if my nose was colonized?Does that even make sense? Doesn\u2019t staph exist all over in a moist environment like Washington? Even if I removed the staph from by noes, wouldn\u2019t I just inhale more staph and be re-infected?I\u2019ve heard that blood problems can cause reoccurring boils. But I can\u2019t find info on what types of blood problems can do that, or how I can fix these problems.The only real solution I\u2019ve ever been offered was taking antibiotics permanently. But that just doesn\u2019t seem right to me.Can anyone out there help me? Or is this a condition that can\u2019t be cured?",
