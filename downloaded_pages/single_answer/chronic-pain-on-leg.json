            "answer": "Diabetic patients often suffer from diabetic neuropathy, which is permanent damage to the nerves. This would likely explain your leg pain. Your doctor or a neurologist would need to do an EMG to confirm this, and would prescribe the appropriate medication. I am sorry, I know it hurts. Nerve pain can be horrible. Please see a doc and get the tests done.An EMG is not very pleasant, but it is relatively quick. The doctor puts electrodes on your leg and sends signals down the nerves to check for damage. This is done in different spots on your leg.It is common for ppl with diabetes to have this problem, and it is important to get it checked out.",
