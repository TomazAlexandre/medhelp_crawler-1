            "answer": "Hi there,You are admirable in your desire to make a difference. But starting a foundation may not be the best way to go, unless you have a big pile of money. A foundation is typically launched with a large donation from an individual or organization. A lawyer is needed to set it up as a legal nonprofit entity, depending on your state's laws. A nonprofit fundraising organization can seek donations, once it is legally incorporated, but usually a foundation does not seek donations-- it has already been 'founded' (funded') by a wealthy benefactor. The capital is never touched-- the foundation does its good work with just the income from the invested capital in the foundation.You could look into forming a nonprofit organization devoted to helping people with these health issues. You'd need to have a strong relationship with doctors/health-care providers who are addressing the diseases, decide whether funds would go to research or treatment, set up a legal entity, etc. etc.If you're serious about this I would suggest starting by finding an attorney who specializes in incorporating nonprofits and find out what's involved in your state.Good luck to you.",
