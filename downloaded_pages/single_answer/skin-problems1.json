            "answer": "Hello,There is a difference between itching and tingling. If it is itching then contact dermatitis, allergic reaction and other skin manifestations need to be ruled out. If it is tingling then parasthesia need to be ruled out.Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
