    "question": "I have fibroid tumors, they have gotten very large and are causing my digestive tract to have some trouble mainly severe constipatioin, the pain was so severe I had to take hydrocodone to get any relief, it also made the constipation even worse, I went to the emergency room several times and the last time I went the dr. gave me an injection of medication and he told me it was to treat the effects of the pain medication. It worked like magic, all the pain went away and the constipation went away for several months,\u00a0\u00a0it is now starting to come back slowly but I'm not in nearly as much pain as before.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know what the injection could have been that I was given?\u00a0\u00a0 I would like to see about getting another but I do not know what its name is.",
