            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms could be side effect of the medications you are taking. So though they are not serious now, if medications are the cause, your doctor should know about it immediately so that the doses can be adjusted to make you comfortable.Other than this you must get your blood pressure, blood sugar, hemoglobin, serum electrolytes and other such tests done in consultation with your doctor.Since you have OCD, it is important that you are symptom free.Please consult your doctor regarding this as soon as you can. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Some information about myself: I am a 21 year old male. I am obese. I have extreme OCD (diagnosed) and take 5 different medications.For about a week now I've felt kind of dizzy/lightheaded, it's not severe but just kind of annoying. Sometimes I'll feel a bit nauseous but only for a short amount of time. Sometimes I'll get a bit shaky. But as I said, none of it is severe, and them are really my only symptoms.Being diagnosed with OCD and Anxiety, obviously I'm very worried something is extremely wrong with me. (brain tumor? Low oxygen to the head? Diabetes? Bad blood pressure? Heart attack?). I'm scared I'm gonna go into a coma or something.If something was seriously wrong, or something seriously wrong was gonna happen, would I have severe symptoms + more symptoms which show something is wrong?Do these symptoms sound like something is seriously wrong, and do you think they will eventually go away on their own?",
