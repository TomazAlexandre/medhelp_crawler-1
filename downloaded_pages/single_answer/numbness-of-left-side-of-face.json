            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth etc\u00a0\u00a0can all cause facial numbness and pain. Hemi-facial numbness is also seen in Bell\u2019s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia where a spasm may cause numbness, or due to acoustic neuroma which is a benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve.If this is happening only if you are stressed out then you need to get your blood pressure checked. It could be a TIA but not very likely. The other possibility is TMJ which can cause numbness of face.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
