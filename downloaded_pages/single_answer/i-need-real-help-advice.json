            "answer": "HiI took type 1 diabetes when I was 3 years old I am now 54 and in good health - dont get me wrong I often curse the disease but have learned that you can live with it if you put in a bit of effort - its not always easy but anything worthwhile rarely is - I suggest a continuous glucose monitoring system which should help you get your blood sugar control sorted out and on the right path and let you live like a young person but just being a wee bit careful. I have two sons which proves that reasonably good control can be got without too much effort but surely it is worth a bit of effort, in my case it has definately been worth the effort. Hope this encourages you!!",
