            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. The symptoms of pain,altered sensation & swelling in right side of face & inner top right gum can be due to maxillary sinusitis, infected root canal or even due to pyorrhea. You need to consult a dentist and an ENT specialist.Scattered foci of increased T2 signals indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.The cervical changes can cause upper back, neck pain etc and need to be treated with physiotherapy.Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
