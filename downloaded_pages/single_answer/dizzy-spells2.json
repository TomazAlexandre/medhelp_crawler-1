            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!Dizzy spells occurring with change of posture could be orthostatic hypotension.\u201cOrthostatic hypotension may be caused by hypovolemia (a decreased amount of blood in the body), resulting from bleeding, the excessive use of diuretics, vasodilators, or other types of drugs, dehydration, or prolonged bed rest. It also occurs in people with anemia.\u201d\u201cThe disorder may be associated with Addison's disease, atherosclerosis (build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries), diabetes, pheochromocytoma, and certain neurological disorders including Shy-Drager syndrome and other forms of dysautonomia. It is also associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. It is also present in many patients with Parkinson's Disease\u201d Refer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotensionIt could also be due to problems in internal ear and spondylitis involving the cervical spine.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss this with your doctor. You may need to undergo tests to rule out internal ear problems, spondylitis, blood tets for anemia etc.. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
