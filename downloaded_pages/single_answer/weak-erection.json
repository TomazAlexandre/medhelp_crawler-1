            "answer": "Hi,I suggest that you have a consult done by your urologist.The presence of erectile dysfuncton is ascertained when this is present in at least 25% of the time .A decrease in nighttime erections may also suggest the presence of erectile dysfunction.Erectile dyfunction may have both an underlying psychological and organic cause.I sugest that you have a complete neurologic consult done to rule out any neuropathies( one side effect of TB medications). Also a complete work up is done to rule out hypertension, diabetes, thyroid and sex hormone problems.An evaluation of the prostate and any possible penile deformities also need to be excluded.A complete assessment may be able to point out the direct underlying cause of your condition.Treatment of this cause will offer a solution.",
