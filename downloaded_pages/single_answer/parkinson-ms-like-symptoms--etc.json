            "answer": "Hi,What tests have you undergone? Are you taking any treatment?Your symptoms could be because of a neurological disease like MS or nerve compression, they could also be due to thyroid dysfunction and diabetes.Fever with night sweats indicates a chronic infection.Please discuss these possibilities with your treating doctor as it is very difficult to make an exact diagnosis without clinical examination and test reports. Take care!",
