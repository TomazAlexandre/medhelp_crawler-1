            "answer": "Dehydration can cause what you describe. With dehydration you feel okay lying down, very tired, and the problems begin when you stand up.\u00a0\u00a0Your blood pressure drops and because of this you become lightheaded and can pass out.\u00a0\u00a0Did your doctor give you any ideas on how to stay hydrated besides drinking water?\u00a0\u00a0When we become dehydrated we also lose electrolytes, which can be dangerous and they need to be replaced.\u00a0\u00a0Eating a banana every day is good, drinking orange juice, and Gatorade will replenish your electrolytes.\u00a0\u00a0There is a Gatorade that is low in sugar and that's the one you want, or dilute the regular with some water for better absorption.\u00a0\u00a0Did your doctor take your BP sitting and then standing....this would have told him a lot, especially if you're dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0It appears that your medication is causing your sugar to drop too low and creating your problems.\u00a0\u00a0It drop and then spikes, he should be looking at this.\u00a0\u00a0Although it's normal for our sugar to rise and drop throughout the day, it's not normal for it to rise too high or drop too low.\u00a0\u00a0Is your doctor an Endocrinologist, they are best at managing your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0We can and do pass out when our sugar drops too low, so I think your doctor needs to address why it's happening.\u00a0\u00a0I would eat a banana everyday and sip on Gatorade, and water. If it doesn't happen again, then you'll know it was dehydration. What did they tell you at the ER?\u00a0\u00a0They would have known if it was dehydration and rehydrated you.\u00a0\u00a0A report of this would have gone to your doctor, and then he would know.\u00a0\u00a0I would also google your medications and see what the side effects are, because if they have a diuretic affect on you, your doctor should have been monitoring your potassium levels every 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0My husband is diabetic, and they had him on a BP med with a diuretic in it for his high BP.\u00a0\u00a0He started to not feel well and I asked him if they were checking his potassium level and he didn't know.\u00a0\u00a0So they did and his potassium was very low.\u00a0\u00a0He now takes a supplement for this and has had no more problems.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps, it's very scary to be enduring what you are. I think it's good to question this, it doesn't sound like your doctor is taking it very seriously, maybe time to get a new doc? I wish you all the best and take care.",

    "question": "I am a 60 year old woman with Type II Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed at the age of 46 and have never had any real problems other than some low and high sugar levels at times.\u00a0\u00a0At least that was the case until nearly a month ago.\u00a0\u00a0I was home and realized my sugar was low.\u00a0\u00a0I checked it and it was sixty four (64).\u00a0\u00a0That is low enough for me to start to feel really bad and want only to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I needed to do some shopping but knew I could not go to the store with a level that low.\u00a0\u00a0So, I ate something and checked my level again.\u00a0\u00a0It was then at ninety four (94) but I felt able to drive to the store and shop for the few items I needed.\u00a0\u00a0Of course I went to Wal-Mart and after entering the store realized I could not focus on anything and my eyesight streadily became worse.\u00a0\u00a0That is all I remember until I heard my name called and found out I had been transported to the hospital by ambulance and was in the ER.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I accepted that diagnosis then but unfortunately, three days later I woke up at 1:30 am and realized I felt a little strange.\u00a0\u00a0I checked my sugar level and it was 164.\u00a0\u00a0Then before I knew it I was waking up, lying on my kitchen floor.\u00a0\u00a0I had no idea how long I had been out or remember anything after checking my blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Ten days later I had another episode, the same as the first two.\u00a0\u00a0I was hospitalized for four days, checked for heart valve blockage, and monitored.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing happened, however my physician believed all of this fainting was because of two medications (Actos and Bumetinide) I was taking causing me to dehydrate causing my heart to pump harder but lacking to supply my brain with enough oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0I am a little skeptible of this diagnosis and until reading some of the questions here was at a lost for what it might be.\u00a0\u00a0This much I know....just before fainting I experienced the worse feeling I have ever felt in my life!\u00a0\u00a0I am the mother of five children and I would rather go through all five childbirths at one time than to have that feeling again.\u00a0\u00a0It's that bad for me.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, are these diabetic seizures or is the doctor's diagnosis correct?\u00a0\u00a0I am desperate to know before another episode may happen.",
