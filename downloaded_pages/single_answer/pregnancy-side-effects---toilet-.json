            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.There is no definite number about the frequency of urination during pregnancy. During early pregnancy hormonal changes cause blood to flow more quickly through your kidneys which fills your bladder more often. If you are doubtful about pregnancy and miss your periods take up pregnancy test .Other causes of increased urinary frequency are urinary tract infection, diabetes mellitus, cystitis etc.Seek medical help if the symptoms are severe. If pregnancy test is negative get a urine examination done. Keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",
