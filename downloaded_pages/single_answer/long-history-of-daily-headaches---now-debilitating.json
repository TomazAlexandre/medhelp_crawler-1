            "answer": "Hi....I would get copies of the MRI and other testing and reports and have another Dr review it all to be sure nothing was missed, over looked etc...Many times things can be there, but not seen or noticed if not looked for....And there are times things are seen but consider the findings incidental, so the patient is told it is clear or ok when there is something there....get the MRI's, CT's, and all the reports this will help the other Drs in connecting the dots.All the best.",
