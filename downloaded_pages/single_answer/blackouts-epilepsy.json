    "question": "My brother is 30 years old. When he was 29 he began having seizures which continued weekly for about a year. The seizures have stopped but now he is always tired, irratable and experiences blackouts. He will pass out, always to the left and be out for about 15 minutes. I am afraid he will fall and hurt himself one day. These usually only occur when he is at rest - after he does a task (like farmwork). Two of my uncles and one cousin have been diagnosed with Epilepsy but the number of specialist tell him he doesn't have it. They just keep giving him different pills that seem to make him worse. Is there another test that could be run on him? It seems no one has the right answer or an answer at all. He has seen about three specialists who all say something different. Can you provide any hope for him or my family?",
