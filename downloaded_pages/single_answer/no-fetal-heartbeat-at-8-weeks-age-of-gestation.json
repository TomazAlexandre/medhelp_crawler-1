            "answer": "I'm very sorry. Unfortunately, statistic wise, miscarriage is VERY common. 1 in 3 pregnancies end in miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0Many things could have happened.\u00a0\u00a0You will probably never know. It could have been a chromosonal issue, a blightened ovum, etc. there are many things that can cause miscarriage and you did nothing to cause it.\u00a0\u00a0We lost one in Dec. at 13 weeks pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing I could have done differently and it does not make it any easier. If you want to wait a week and have another ultrasound then do it.\u00a0\u00a0Your doc. should be accomodating to this.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
