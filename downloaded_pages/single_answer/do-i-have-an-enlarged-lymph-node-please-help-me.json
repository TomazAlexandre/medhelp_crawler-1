    "question": "HelloIm Kurtis and 16 years old. I have this lymph node in my groin. It is 1 centimeter in diameter which is normal. It is not hard. It is not tender. It is very mobile. It sometimes sticks out a little bit when I look at in the mirror. It isnt very warm except when I have pants on of course then it gets warmer as expected. Im pretty lenky. Im 6' 3\" and 175 lbs. I am a football player and Im preparing for my college football career I will be pursuing. I started lifting weights and running and working out 2 or 3 years ago. Thats when I noticed the lymph node first, when I started growing faster and thinning out (I used to be chubby and I could never see that node) and losing some weight. Where my node is at, there is a very thin layer of skin, and then there is solid muscle right underneath it. On my left side, I have a node in the same spot. When I look in the mirror, you can kind of see it but like the other one, you can see it sometimes and sometimes you cant see it. I noticed that whenever I stand in certain positions it looks like its popping out more. I wouldnt be able to see it at all and then Ill rock my body forwards and backwards and when it goes forwards it sticks out more. My parents and grandparents both said its just because Im thin and there is nothing to worry about. My gram went through the same thing but I want a doctors opinion. I have no symptoms at all of lymphoma or cancerous things down there. I have no history of any disease in my family of any cancer, diabetes, etc. I should add that I am a hypacondriac. When I have a little ache or pain or anything, Im right on the computer looking at cancers and making sure Im okay. So my question is, am I freaking out over nothing (which everyone on other forums are telling me I am)?",
