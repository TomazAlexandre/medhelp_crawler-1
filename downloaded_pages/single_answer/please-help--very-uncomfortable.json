            "answer": "Hi,What you may be experiencing could be early menopause. Hormonal changes related to menopause may start from about 45 yrs age, depending on race, country of residence, food habits etc, but 43 is also a possible age for these problems.Other things that may be looked into are urinary tract infection, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism.Please consult a gynecologist for these symptoms, if menopause is not a possibility, then you may look at the other possibilities.Regards",
