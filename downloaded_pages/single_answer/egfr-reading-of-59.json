            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!EGFR or estimated glomerular filtration rate is an estimate of the kidney function. As you say, it does indicate a moderate decrease in kidney function\u2014not liver function. You must consult an urologist. Certain diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes cause decrease in GFR. Treatment can either reverse it or slow down the progress. Further tests would be required to assess the status of the kidney and to know the reason for the decrease in GFR. Also depending on the cause a diet recommendation will be given about the food substances you should avoid.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
