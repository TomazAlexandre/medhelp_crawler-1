            "answer": "It is tough to say what the mechanism is.\u00a0\u00a0It often involves mechanisms called early or late after depolarizations (EADs and DADs).\u00a0\u00a0Even on the MD level, it is hard to understand.\u00a0\u00a0I know it makes it easier to intellectualize a problem and ease the stress of it, but this one is very difficult to understand and in my opinion, looking on the internet for answers often leads to more fear.The truth is that with a structurally normal heart, PVCs post little harm other than symptoms.Congrats on the weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0That is hard to do and you should be proud of your self.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!Thanks for posting.",

    "question": "I occassionally get PVC's, my cardiologist is not concerned because I have had annual cardiac workups the past three years (Nuclear Stress Test, Echo, Blood work) and they have always been normal. I am a 50 year old male, workout daily (45 mins & 500 cals on a treadmill), I have lost 60 pounds but still need to loose another 50. I have no family history, have never smoked, no diabetes, controlled HPB and good cholesterol numbers (TC 151, LDL51, HDL 40 but Tris are right at 300, always have been).\u00a0\u00a0My echos have always showed a normal heart structure and my cariologist says the PVCs are harmless. I find that when I am having some PVC's I'll go work out and they go away, is this normal? I'm not complaining I just want to understand the mechanism that causes them and why exercise seems makes them go away.Thanks for your input.Jon",
