    "question": "Hi Everyone,I had my Glucose Tolerance Test on the weekend (saturday) and got very sick afterwards. It is now a couple of days later and I am still feeling sick and fatigued, I feel just awful. I got my results back and it was all normal!! My doctor told me the test shouldn't have made me feel like this, but the hospital said that it can be a normal reaction (although it should be out of your system in 24 hours. I was expecting to have gestational diabetes because my body is just feeling so terrible now.What else could be wrong? Why am I feeling so sick and fatigued? I can actually feel tiredness in my arms from typing this. I seem to be feeling very sick after eating. And I have just been really fatigued since saturday. Any thoughts on what might be wrong are much appreciated...or is this possibly a normal part of pregnancy (here's hoping!!).",
