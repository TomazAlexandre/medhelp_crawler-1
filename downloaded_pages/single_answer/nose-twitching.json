            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is probably the other way round. There may be a spinal nerve compression in the neck which is also causing your nose to twitch. Sinusitis, nasal polyps, allergies and gastric reflux can also cause nose to twitch. .\u00a0\u00a0Low calcium and hypoparathyroidism could be the other causes. Vit B and iron deficiency too should be looked into. Undiagnosed diabetes could be another possibility. Alternatively hypoglycemia too can cause tingling and twitching. Dehydration and electrolyte (sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium) imbalance too could be a cause. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss this with your doctor. A few blood tests to rule out the above mentioned conditions may be needed. At times kidney and liver function tests are required if direct tests for the above do not yield any results. You may also need to take an allergy test.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
