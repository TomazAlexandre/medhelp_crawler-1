            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. First get your blood pressure checked. This could be due to high blood pressure. The other possibility is clot in some blood vessel. This can also give out heat sensation without there being any temperature. Hyperthyroidism, diabetes, temporal arteritis are the other possibilities. It can also be an allergic reaction to some soap or oil etc.Other possibilities are tension headaches, TMJ, and anxiety and stress. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have anxiety and panic attacks. I also have a suspicion i may have TMJ. I constantly experience head pressure that seriously feels like i have a band wrapped around my head. It also feels hot ( not physically hot) and tingly. I know a lot of ppl who have anxiety experience the same head pressure, but could it be stress or tension headaches? Or maybe part of the TMJ?",
