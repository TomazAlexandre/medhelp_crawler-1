            "answer": "I was diagnosed with diabetes\u00a0\u00a0when I was 12 years old (2002).I remember my symptoms very vividly.\u00a0\u00a0Some of my red-flags were:drinking A LOT of water, Peeing\u00a0\u00a0very often (both of these have to do with a very high blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Your body wants to get rid of this excess sugar by flushing it out with water), sleeping all day and night, no energy.If your daughter has type 1 diabetes it is hereditary, which means her weight has nothing to do with it.\u00a0\u00a0It may be more likely that your daughter has type 1 because she is at a younger age.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 is also called juvenile diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If your daughter has type 2 diabetes it is caused by an unhealthy lifestyle and and unhealthy weight.\u00a0\u00a0Either way both types are completely manageable if your daughter does in fact have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0There also insulin pumps now availiable which makes managing type 1 much easier!You remind me of my mother and you sound like a very caring person.\u00a0\u00a0No matter what the outcome is, your support will mean everything!Take Care and Good Luck!",

    "question": "I just had a parent teacher meeting with my 7 yr old daughters teacher. The teacher thinks that we should maybe have her tested for T1 diaetes! I am just worried sick about this! I have app with her dr but not for another week and i just can't even function without having some questions answered before next week. First i have never noticed a problem. The teacher said that she asked to go for water about 2-3 time in the morning (Which i didn't think was weird)\u00a0\u00a0i myself have alway loved water and have never been told that was abnormal! My daughter is a little heavier but both myself and my husband were never small children but no where near over weight and we both grew out of it the dr has never said anything to be conceren with her weight either! My question is to all the parents that have had their children tested and had it come back + what are the chances that i would have never noticed that her drinking habits were abnormal? Or is there someting else that i have also missed?\u00a0\u00a0Please Help I am going to go CRAZY i can't stop blamming my self!",
