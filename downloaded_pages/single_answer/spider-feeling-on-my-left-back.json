            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The symptoms could be due to diabetes too which causes peripheral neuropathy. Is your blood sugar normal\u2014both fasting and two hours after food? Yes, fibromyalgia too can cause these types of tingling sensations. Vitamin B12 will help only if you have B12 deficiency. Another possibility is polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). PAN is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the arteries especially of muscles, joints and other organs. Tingling sensation and muscle aches are commonly felt.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
