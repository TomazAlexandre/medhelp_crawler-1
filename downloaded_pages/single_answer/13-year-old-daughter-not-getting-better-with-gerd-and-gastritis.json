    "question": "My daughter is 13 years old.\u00a0\u00a0She has for weeks if not months had increasing symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0They were, and are:\u00a0\u00a0nausea, \"chest pain\", severe stomach pains up high, coughing, lower back pain, some times pain in the side of the neck, feeling full soon after starting to eat, hungry often, headaches, and in general feeling awful.\u00a0\u00a0Any regurgitation is less than any of the other symptoms. She had an endoscopy and was diagnosed with GERD and gastritis.\u00a0\u00a0The specialist said that her stomach was inflamed and so was her esopha. where it meets the stomach.\u00a0\u00a0She tested negative for H-Pylori.\u00a0\u00a0At night, she will have joint aches and also is experiencing increasing frequency of a sore throat.\u00a0\u00a0She has been on Tagamet [prescription strength], and is on non-containing NSAID pain relievers that are prescription strength.\u00a0\u00a0The specialist put her on Aciphex last week, but it is not even making a dent in how she feels.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the foods are moving through her 'system' incredibly slow, and she is in pain when she uses the restroom.\u00a0\u00a0The gastro.specialist is now saying he wants to test her for anemia [due to dizziness], not from bleeding but because he believes that her slow 'system' could be causing a B12 deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0He is also wanting to check her for Diabetes 1, as he says that it can also cause a slow 'system' which could in return be why she is having gastritis and GERD.\u00a0\u00a0Last, but not least, she had a terrible school year and I found out that she had not been eating at lunch.\u00a0\u00a0She experiencing fainting spells at school, which now has decreased.\u00a0\u00a0We believe that she was under so much stress from being bullied by a teacher and kids, and we wonder if this could be the cause of all of this.\u00a0\u00a0Stress, I read, can cause an increase of acid production, and if it goes on for months then it can cause all the other things as well.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of the day, the Aciphex is not helping, she is miserable, and I want to know if there are any medications that can kill the pain in her stomach.\u00a0\u00a0And, what do you think I should be looking for beyond what the doctor is telling us? Could this be an autoimmune disease, such as Pernicious Anemia? Her quality of life is beyond ridiculous - she lives in her bed and gets out only on occasion, and we have stressed to the doctor how terrible she feels.Thank you.",
