It was in my lower backand would wrap around to the front and aaccompanied by a migraine on my left side of my head, at 3:30 I finally got up in took a hot shower which helped a little but not much. Now its been off and on all day, my migraine is still here and I took some fiorecet they prescribed me for them but its not helping. Still getting the back pains wrapping around to the front. Its now 5:30 p.m. so its been going on for over 12 hours and im not sure what to do. Im home alone with my 3 year old, dr. Office is closed, and ive been pushing tons of fluids and taking it easy incase I was dehydrated but nothing is helping. Help, advice, is this normal?
