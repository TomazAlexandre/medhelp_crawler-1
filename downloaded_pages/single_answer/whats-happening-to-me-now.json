            "answer": "Hello,The sensations in your feet may be related to diabetes, I am not sure. It is more likely if your blood sugars are not well controlled. You have had diabetes for several years now so it does put you at higher risk of having nerve problems from diabetes. You may have other things going on though like side effects of medications etc, so it is best to have this checked out by your doctor who knows you best.Having diabetes is not a reason not to become pregnant BUT you should have very well controlled blood sugars for several months before starting to try to become pregnant in order to decrease chances of birth defects and other potential serious issues in you or your baby.Ideally your A1C should be under 7% and as close to normal as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Some medications will need to be switched around if you become pregnant as well, so you should definitely speak to your doctor about this as wlel so that your pre-pregnancy medical planning can get underway soon.Take care.",
