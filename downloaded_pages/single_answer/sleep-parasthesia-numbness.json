    "question": "I\u2019ve been experiencing lightheadedness, panic/anxiety/confusion, cloudiness, dizziness, numbness/tingling limbs while lying down/sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0My face went numb after getting a hot flash while driving last week.\u00a0\u00a0Catscan of head = normal. Catscan of neck abnormal, but neck MRI came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0Followed up w/ neurologist, received general reflex/sensation/strength workup.\u00a0\u00a0Passed normal.\u00a0\u00a0Follwed up w/ general practitioner.\u00a0\u00a0Submitted blood work for Lyme/ANA/Sjogren\u2019s factor.\u00a0\u00a0Drs all think its anxiety.This morning I woke up in the middle of the night with a numb scalp. Last night I woke up at 3am w/ full facial numbness and tingling/weakness all over my body.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to go away as soon as I sit up.\u00a0\u00a0I went back to bed and woke up a few hours later with only numb lips.\u00a0\u00a0This immediately subsided as soon as I sat up.\u00a0\u00a0I have been getting anxiety attacks and feeling as I am going to pass out.\u00a0\u00a0Worse during sleep/early afternoon.I did have one episode similar on 05/2008 where I woke up w/ tingling and ended up w/ syncopal episode.\u00a0\u00a0Paramedics documented blood sugar @ 45mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugar has tested normal since.My stats: 27, 6'3, 190lb, normal bp, liver function normal, no anemia, no diabetes, (blood workup from ER came back normal)My history: mild/moderate sleep apnea, ocd/anxiety, ?possible sjogren's? (lip biopsy came back + but not sure this was accurate, waiting on blood work mentioned above to rule it out)05/2005 - Had a baseline brain MRI because I was complaining of headaches/cloudiness.\u00a0\u00a0Normal MRI.Family history: mom has NMO/Devic's, aunt has an autoimmune, mom's cousin has rheumatoid.\u00a0\u00a0Dad has diabetes (type 2).I want to rule out serious issues like nerve compression, onset of multiple sclerosis, brain clotting/tumors/bleeding, circulation issues, or even lyme disease, before attributing this to anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Should I get another brain MRI or a spine MRI?\u00a0\u00a0Get a new pillow (I\u2019ve been using an apnea pillow)?",
