    "question": "I have been losing my appetite recently. I just don't feel like eating at all before dinner time.There's days when I feel like throwing up after few bites and then there's days when I'm eating normally without any symptoms. Like yesterday, I ate quite a big breakfast in the morning and the next meal I had was a late dinner. I took few bites and already felt that I can't eat anymore. That was everything what I ate that day and didn't even feel hungry.I am 18 years old girl and quite skinny according to my height. (54kg/168cm) I've been feeling really weak for few weeks now and haven't had appetite at all. I'm feeling tired and extremely cold all the time.I don't have any health problems.The point is that I don't feel hungry, but I feel really sick. I haven't checked my weight recently but I am feeling that it might have gone down a bit.I just have no idea why I'm like this. I'm really afraid of losing more weight and becoming more weak.",
