            "answer": "First of all, who gave you the blood sugar test? A doctor? If so, he should be talking with you about what it means! Second, what type of test was it? Was it a fasting blood sugar? If so, that is in the range to be diagnosed with diabetes (anything over 126). However, the current standard for diagnosis is the A1C test which takes an average blood sugar for a couple months which is what your doctor should be doing next. What I suggest is you talk with your doctor, get an A1C, then find out if you are in fact diabetic or pre-diabetic and what you should do from there. But meanwhile, what you should do is lose weight if you need to (I have no idea if you are male or female and how tall), begin to eliminate sweets and reduce carbs and get regular exercise. Also, if your doctor diagnoses you with diabetes he should give you a blood sugar meter and show you how to use it. Testing your fasting blood sugar will let you know how you are doing, and testing two hours after eating will let you know how certain foods affect you. (You want to keep it under 100 fasting and under 140 two hours after meals)",
