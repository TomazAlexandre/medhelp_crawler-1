            "answer": "Hi,I understand that you cannot afford medical treatment. But since it is a matter that needs medical attention immediately, I would request you to find some means of consulting a good neurologist. There could have been a trauma to the skull, brain and nerves besides laceration of\u00a0\u00a0the scalp leading to the symptoms. You need to go for an MRI of the brain and spine and take treatment. I wish you all the best! May you find out a way soon. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",

    "question": "I have had headaches for years, at least\u00a0\u00a04 or more severe per month. But in the last year my headaches have become more often. I do know now my headaches range from being migrane, sinus, tension, and high blood pressure. I only go to a doctor once a year because that's all I can afford. My doctor calls me so she don't have to charge me a few times to see if the meds are working on me. Here are the medicines I'm taking already to control my blood pressure and my diabetes. (My blood pressure is now down to average 145/105.) except still goes to 200/121 on occasion. Benazepril Hydrochloride (40mg) Clonidine (0.1mg) Glipizide (10mg) Atenolol (100mg) Glyburide (5mg) & Metformin (850 mg) my sugar is staying between (145-225) The problem is appoximately yr or so ago at church a wire got under my sandal at back and I tripped and fell down backwards. My head first hit a speaker and then the floor. When I sat up there was a puddle of blood (I was the worship leader). They wanted me to ride in a ambulance but I wanted my husband to take me, so I went to the emergency room. I felt fine was only numb so I told them I didn't think I needed a mri. They stitched me up and sent me home. It hurt for a few days then got better. But for the last three or four months my headaches seem to never go away and worsen through the day. they are back where the cut was and run into my ear and seems like every where. Help I don't know what to do?Debbie",
