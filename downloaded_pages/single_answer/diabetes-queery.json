            "answer": "1.) Is a blood glucose level of 6.6 in an adult normal.?This depends on when you tested; prandial [before meal and fasting for 8-10 hours]; postprandial [2-3 hours after a meal]. Random anytime testing is useless and doesn't count. Post back so we can provide a precise answer.2.) metalic taste in my mouth all the timeRecent or going on for awhile? This has many causes such as different dental fillings interacting, a tooth infection, GERD [acid reflux], and also from antibiotics.3) thirsty more often than usual.Could be from high blood sugar, or from eating salty, sugary and spicy foods, also from obsessive dieting. Bottom line go see a doctor and get a full health checkup that includes diabetes testing.",
