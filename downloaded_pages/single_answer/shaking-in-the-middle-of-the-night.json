            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Sudden shaking could be due to Parkinson\u2019s disease. Consult a neurologist to rule this out.Waking up suddenly and feeling shaky from inside could be due to sleep apnea and other sleep disorders. Hence sleep studies must be done.Drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, stress and fatigue can all cause a similar symptom. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm 24/male 5'8, 192lbs and for the last month i have been waking up around an hour or so after i have lay down to fall asleep, and find myself awaken to me shaking uncontrollably in my chest/trunk area. Its like an internal shaking, and i have had my sugar checked, everything was fine. It was bad enough to where i went to the ER, and they couldn't do anything for me. I recently have had an EEG and MRI i get the results back next week, but i've seen other people around my age having the same problems. I've had an array of blood work all came back fine. It is causing me great anxiety, and stress. I have noticed discoloration in my eyes that comes and goes, this might be signs of MS so i've read. No history of it in my family. My dad has diabetes type II, my grandfather has Parkinson. No history of heart, neurological, or other diseases.This is causing me a great deal of stress as i haven't had a full night of sleep in several weeks. If anyone has any idea, please share.ThanksThis discussion is related to/posts/show/199072.",
