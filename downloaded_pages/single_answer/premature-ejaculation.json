            "answer": "Hello,Medical causes of premature ejaculation include abnormal hormone level, reflex activity of ejaculatory system, thyroid problems, diabetes, hypertension and neurological causes. In your case, hypertension or high BP is an important factor. So get your BP and medications regularly monitored.In stop start technique, near ejaculation withdraw from your partner and relax and think about something else. In squeeze- pause technique, squeeze the end or the tip of the penis for 10 to 20 seconds when you are close to ejaculation and then resume stimulation after withholding for half a minute. If the symptoms persist then desensitizing creams and SRRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) may need to be prescribed for which you have to consult a urologist.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I am 34 yrs old male, from India. I am overweight by 30 - 50 lbs. I try to exercise everyday and have developed fair stamina by exercising. I have an average to good physique. Till now, the only physical problem I have is Hypertension. I used to take Amlodopine 5 mg tablets fdaily or a long time [5-6 yrs]. Before 2 years the drug was chaged to 'Ramipril and Hydrochlorothiazide'. This is also a same 5mg tablet that I am taking daily. Recently my BP is more in normal range, even if I dont take the BP medication for a couple of days.I used to masterbate since I was 14. Have a very good sex drive. I think out of fear of impregnating my partner, whenever we do sex without a condom, I use to come very fast. But with a condom I can go on for 5-10 mins of thrusting apart from all the foreplay before it.- I used to follow the 'start and stop' method. Since last 2 months, I am noticing that, I do not have much control on my ejaculation. As soon as I proceed for penetration, I am coming too fast, even within 1 min. Sometimes as soon as my partner touches my penis.- Also, I am noticing that, I can not force the flow of my urine as I could do in past.Are both of these happenning because of weak PBG muscles?Can only kegel cure these? Should I stop my BP medication. Please suggest, what action should I take.Thank you very much Doctors for your help beforehand.",
