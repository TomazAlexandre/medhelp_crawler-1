            "answer": "Complex septated ovarian cyst may be really challenging for women who like to bear a child.Vaginal hysterectomy may preserve ovaries and not removed during surgical purposes.Problems caused due to cysts in ovaries can be managed by hormonal therapy and management of complications like Menstrual Disorders,infertility,Diabetes Milletus,Thyroid problems(Metabolic Syndrome) and masculinity which are seen in most of the patients suffering from cysts.As you are 54 years old it is advised to undergo a surgery called Ovary Drilling (puncture of large cysts) and change of diet and use of Hormonal therapy may actually help to control everything that you are suffering.Talk to your Doc about this.",
