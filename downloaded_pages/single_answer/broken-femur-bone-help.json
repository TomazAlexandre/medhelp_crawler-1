            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your grandmother\u2019s medical problems. The non uniting fracture can be due to low blood supply, poor mineralization, presence of diabetes, presence of infection, poor alignment, or too much space between the fracture ends. This is treated by bone grafts, immobilization with plates and screws, or removal of scarred tissue from fractured ends. Advanced age as in your grandmother\u2019s case, with loss of muscle elasticity, probably osteoporosis etc adds to the risk factors for non-union. Hence, all these factors need to be looked into in detail. However, sometimes despite all efforts, femur bone fails to unite. If she is in good health, bone graft can be tried. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "My grandmother about 2 years ago broke her femur bone, she immediately went to surgery. The first surgery she had the Orthopedic Surgeons put in \"plates\" as the doctors called it. My grandmother didn't feel a difference, she just laid in bed because the doctors said to give it a month or two. Around 3 months later the doctors discovered that the \"plates\" were no use and decided to put in \"rods\" this time. That didn't help one bit either, every time the surgeons try something different it doesn't work. They keep telling us that her broken bone will take time to heal, I trust the doctors but nothing is helping her. She had been laying in bed for 2 years now and my parents have spent a lot of money on her but nothing is helping. She is 75 years old and had over 5 surgeries just on her femur bone. All the surgeries have been done in top hospitals in India but the \"doctors\" don't know what to do anymore. I don't know the procedure for a broken femur bone in the US but in india they seem to be unknowable, I have lost all hope for her at this time.",
