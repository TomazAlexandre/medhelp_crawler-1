            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A lymphnode below the jaw or submandibular lymphnode can swell due to infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp and pharynx or upper throat. So if you have any such infection or even if it is something as simple as dandruff or poor oral hygiene or dental infection, then this needs to be checked. Consult an ENT specialist and a dentist.Apart from this hyperthyroidism, diabetes, carcinoid syndromes, and tubercular lymphnode should also be ruled out.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi there,I will try make this as brief as possible.4 weeks ago I noticed my right submandibular gland was swollen. Since then I have had the following symptoms at one time or another:- Flushed hot face- Pains everywhere from arms and legs randomly which dont last long- Lightheadedness- Feeling generally unwell- Right ear hot burning sensation- Pains in neck and throat- Jaw pain and tightness/discomfort on both sides- Inablility to concentrate and think- Numbness in underside of hands (last 2 fingers) when sleeping (like carpel tunnel)Recently I am having problems sleeping, I wake up in the middle of the night feeling very hot (not sweating) and need to remove all covers to cool down, and feel very thirsty.The gland has decreased in size, however its still swollen. I have had the following tests:- EBV- STDS- Full blood count- LupusAll came back normal. They found a 12mm nodule on my thyroid, had a biopsy done, came back normal. Now am having thyroid blood test done. My symptoms feel between between hyperthyroidism and Type 1 diabetes. I have no idea what else it could be, doctor said its some kind of virus...any ideas would be great.",
