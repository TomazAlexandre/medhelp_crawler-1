    "question": "Just wanted to share with you my thoughts about how diabetes has impacted my life -- particularily, with having more children.I always felt that I would have maybe 2 or even 3 kids but taking care of a diabetic toddler has diminished that dream. Some background -- my daughter was diagnosed with T1 diabetes at 18 mos. She is taking lantus with humalog. She has been honeymooning since the beginning but that has been gradually reducing as she is now 3.5 yrs old. Her blood sugars at night still need to be monitored about 2-3 times as they are sometimes unpredictable. Her A1c is 7.8 down from 8.5 when she was first diagnosed.The diagnosis was a shock to both my husband and myself even though we have T1 diabetes in the family -- my husband has had T1 since 4 yrs old and is, for most part, Is well controlled and in excellent health. We did not expect our child to get it as well and so young as the probabilities are not that high. However, upon diagnosis, the transition for us was relatively easy as we are familiar with the insulins, hardware and carb-counting. The emotional catch-up took time...At this point, I am basically resigned to the fact that given a choice, it would not be easy for us to have another child. This reality is especially poignant due to my husband being T1 diabetic and therefore, not 100 percent reliable which of course, is no fault of his own and which he himself has realized. He is a wonderful man with excellent management of his diabetes but lows happen which we have to accept and have learned not to place blame. The chances that our next child will have T1 diabetes is even higher and I'm scared that we won't be able to handle it as we would like to ideally.I'm just wondering if there are others who've come down the same road?",
