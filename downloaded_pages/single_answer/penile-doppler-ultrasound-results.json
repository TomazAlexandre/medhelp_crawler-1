    "question": "Hello,I am 30 year old male and I have erectile dysfunction.My general health is good and I have no diabetes,high blood pressure,atherosclerosis.A month ago I had a Penile Doppler Test.The urologist injected my penis with 40 mg of papaverine and after several minutes he touched my\u00a0\u00a0erection and was very satisfied by the result. From what I remember my penis felt very hard on touch along the shaft and a little bit overstretched (my personal impression) with some flexability at the base. Then he examined the penis with doppler ultrasound for a while and at the end he said there were no signs of\u00a0\u00a0blood flow problems. He wrote:after 40 mg of papaverine: normal blood flow.Left artery 55 cm/s\u00a0\u00a0by 3 cm/s, right artery 50 cm/s by 3 cm/s (injection was on the left side). No signs of organic ED.According to him 55 and 50 is quite above 30 cm/s which is accepted as a lower limit for normal arteries and 3 cm/s is below 5 cm/s which is the upper limit for normal venous function. He also wrote that after 40 mg papverine I had obtained a stable erection. 10 or 11 days before the test I took cialis.Can this fact influence the test?How long does it take for Cialis to be completely eliminated by the body?Does the intake of Cialis influence the doppler test any any way?I told the doctor about this but he completely ignored this fact and did not postpone the test.I also had been taking somewhat large doses of anti-oxidants alpha lipoic acid,evening primrose oil,vitamin e and i told the doctor about this but he considered those not relevant to the test.Can those anti-oxidants interfere with the results from the doppler test?I read on the net that usually the Peak Diastolic Velocity should be 0 cm/s or even negative.Other sources say it should be below 5 cm/s,but mine is 3 cm/s.Isn't this a sign of venous leak?Do you think the results show normal blood supply? Was the test performed properly?Can it be some sort of cavernous smooth mustle dysfunction or doppler shows tissue is fine?",
