            "answer": "Hi!The feet need to be dipped for 15-20 mins in warm water to which a few drops of hydrogen peroxide is added and cleaned well and the patted dry. It should be cleaned with betadine lotion or any other surgical cleaner. The pus should be drained by pressing the cracks and anti-bacterial cream applied. Once the infection dries up, a very good moisturizer or an emollient cream or petroleum jelly can be applied daily and at bed time. Once the cracks heal, regular pedicure will help keep the feet soft and supple. Also, since the cracks got infected, good personal hygiene should be maintained. Blood sugar should be tested as diabetes can make a person prone to infection. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
