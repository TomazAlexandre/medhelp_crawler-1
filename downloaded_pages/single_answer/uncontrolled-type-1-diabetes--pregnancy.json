    "question": "Hi All.This is my first ever post and I am hoping people will be gentle and supportive. I have been diabetic for 19 years, with an average A1c range of 8.0 - 8.5. My last result was 7.8 which is the best result to date since diagnosis. My partner and I are desperately trying to have a family but I am so afraid that despite this being my best result, knowing that this level is not considered good control if we were were to get pregnant, there would be detrimental effects on the baby.I am approaching 30 at what feels like warped speed and want to be a mum so much, but I don't want to end up harming my unborn child because of a lack of control.To be honest right now I feel hopeless and very stressed out about the whole situation and I'm just not sure what to do. Currently not under any specialist care and my GP does not have a strong ability to manage my diabetes.Please help ( and please try not to judge me too much).Thank you.",
