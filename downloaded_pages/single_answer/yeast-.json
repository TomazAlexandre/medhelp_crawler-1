            "answer": "Hello,There are some reasons for recurrent thrush infection. These include when symptoms may not be due to thrush, when thrush is caused by other strains of Candida spp. such as Candida glabrata( These may not be so easily treated with the usual anti-thrush medicines), you are taking antibiotics, or if you have undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes.You should get a fungal culture of vaginal discharge done and all these causes ruled out.For recurrent candidiasis, we use topical or oral antifungals but for longer than usual. This may be for 7-14 days for topical treatments followed by fluconazole tablet once per week. This is called maintenance treatment, which often prevents thrush from recurring. Sometimes it is followed for 6 weeks.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "For the past 3 months ive been having an itchy vagina. Went to the doc in september,got tested for yeast and evrry STD except herpes. and my test showed that i didnt,have an std but i did have a yeast infection. Took meds but only got a li relief. The itch continued so in october i went to another doc and was treated for a yeast infection. I got no relief that time so i went to a OBGYN and got tested for yeast/bactiria and they both came back negative. Then about a week ago (still with an itchy vagina) i noticed my clitoris swollen and very sensative. Ilooked down there and noticed a pin sized bump with white at the top. Went to the doc thinking i have herpes and she told me that it most likly wasnt but still took a test anyways. (Im still waiting on my results) . She also did another one for yeast/bactiria and they came back negative. Then a couple of days ago i noticed a cottage cheese disharge which only means yeast infection. But then why would my results come back negative ? Im sooo confused and worried ! Whatcan be wrong with me? I seem to always be itchy for months at a time !*Extra Info *Ive never had actual sex before, just oral sexPLEASE HELP !",
