            "answer": "Hello,Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a non-specific screening test for various diseases. It is usually found in pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal failure, heart disease, collagen vascular diseases, malignancy,infections,arthritis,connective tissue disorders and vasculitis.As only the ESR is raised with no other abnormality in lab investigations, so I think best would be to wait for a few days and then getting it repeated.If it is raised then all the possibilities esp polymyalgia rheumatic and arthritis need evaluation.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.Kind regards.",

    "question": "I had a full blood count & other various blood tests ordered recently by mr Dr due to her suspecting a TIA. Thrombo & others came back normal & only one that raised any concern was my ESR was 28 having come down from 120, 130 & 130 on various dates during April last year which was due to me contracting Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in my caesarean wound whilst in hospital. But the Dr is concerned as to why it's 28 almost one year after me having Pseudomonas. She asked me a series of questions over the phone tonight when giving me the blood results which were mainly toward bone or arthritic conditions. I don't have any problems there. I'm female, almost 40, period overdue, wisdom tooth impacted but not infected, have swollen calf which swells then goes away from time to time, dvt/thrombotic conditions ruled out, specialist who ultrasounded it says its fluid/haemotoma from bruising it once, I can't think of anything else. Has anyone got any suggestions/ideas on having an ESR of 28 whether that is really high, could it mean cancer somewhere in my body? My Dr wants to repeat it in 3 weeks as I have a CT scan Monday to check for problems after suspected TIA. Thanks.",
