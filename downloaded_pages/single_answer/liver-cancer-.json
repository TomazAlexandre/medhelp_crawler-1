            "answer": "Chronic hepatitis C can cause cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Researchers estimate that at least 20 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C develop cirrhosis. Liver failure from chronic hepatitis C is one of the most common reasons for liver transplants in the United States.After 20 to 40 years, a small percentage of patients develop liver cancer. Hepatitis C is the cause of about half of cases of primary liver cancer in the developed world. Men, alcoholics, patients with cirrhosis, people over age 40, and those infected for 20 to 40 years are at higher risk of developing HCV-related liver cancer.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------United StatesAlthough hepatocellular carcinoma is uncommon, comprising only 2% of all malignancies, since the mid-1980s the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma has been rising at an alarming rate. The age-adjusted incidence rates increased 2-fold between 1980 and 1998. Much of this increase is likely due to hepatitis C infection, a known risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. More recently, the tremendous rise in obesity and diabetes is also thought to be contributing to the increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatorrheic hepatitis, especially in men, may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.The American Cancer Society estimates that 26,190 new cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic bile duct cancers were diagnosed in 2011, with 19,260 cases in men and 6930 cases in women. An estimated 19,590 patients (13,260 men and 6330 women) were expected to die of hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic bile duct cancer in 2011.Mortality/MorbidityCure, usually through surgery, is possible in less than 5% of all patients.Median survival from time of diagnosis is generally 6 months. Length of survival depends largely on the extent of cirrhosis in the liver; cirrhotic patients have shorter survival times and more limited therapeutic options; portal vein occlusion, which occurs commonly, portends an even shorter survival.Complications from hepatocellular carcinoma are those of hepatic failure; death occurs from cachexia, variceal bleeding, or (rarely) tumor rupture and bleeding into the peritoneum.Hector",
