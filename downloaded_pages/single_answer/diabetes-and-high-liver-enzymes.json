            "answer": "Hi,Yes, being overweight and having type 2 diabetes can cause both the fatty liver and resulting high liver enzymes. I am not en expert in liver disease(or hemachomatosis) so I do not know how your carrier status may paly into this. but I am fairly sure that your diabetes, especially if it is not well controlled, is likely a culprit in your liver disease and high enzymes. Weight loss, dietary changes and getting your blood sugars under control(through medications if necessary, diet and exercise) should improve this substantially.Good luck and definitely give it your best shot. It is well worth the effort.Take care.",
