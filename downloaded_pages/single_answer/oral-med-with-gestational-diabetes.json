            "answer": "Hey Jess!I obtained the following information from the webpage www.dlife.com.\u00a0\u00a0I have no personal knowledge of gestational diabetes, as I am the mom of a 17 year old who was diagnosed at the age of 21 months with type 1.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a medical professional, so I'll give it to you right from the dlife website.\u00a0\u00a0\"Hormones produced by the placenta during pregnancy increase insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0As pregnancy progresses and the placenta increases in size, so do a woman's insulin requirements.\u00a0\u00a0Women with type 2 diabetes who control their disease with diet and exercise may be able to continue doing so, or they may have to begin insulin treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Those who take oral medications will probably be switched to insulin during their preconception planning.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, insulin is the only approved therapy for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes during pregnancy, although some promising clinical trials have been performed on oral medications for type 2 diabetes\".I would suggest that if you are interested in finding out more about this, you should inquire at your local teaching hospitals to see if they are participating in any trials that you can possibly participate in your area.\u00a0\u00a0New and improved therapies need people on the forefront to help others in the future.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you!",
