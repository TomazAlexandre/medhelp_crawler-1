    "question": "Hi,I'm 30 year old male uncircumsized and since Feb 2010, I've\u00a0\u00a0experienced redness on my penis glands at the\u00a0\u00a0no discharge, no burning, and until recently developed what i believe to be balanitis. When using a tissue to wipe the head of my gland, it appears that a dry discharge comes off the surface and is smelly. Some background information:I visited the doctor at the end of March 2010, to do a complete STD check which involved PCR of Urine, and blood tests and all was negative. So the doctor advised I should use some anti-fungal topical cream such as clotrimazole and apply it on the affected area. About two weeks later, Ive been searching on the web and read about false negative test results, so I went and got tested again. The tests came back negative again. I did a urinalysis and everything was ok too.I've been applying the cream about 2-3 times per day, and while the cream is on, there is no itchiness and the redness\u00a0\u00a0dies down, however as soon as I stop the cream or if it's been a while since applying, the symptoms come back. It's really bugging me. I'm going to take some diflucan as the next step...and also going to be getting another blood test next week for diabetes.. I've never had this problem before and it's stressing me out...A few questions:Would balanitis show up in the urinalysis?If I tested negative twice for STDs, is that a pretty good sign it's not STD related?Thank you",
