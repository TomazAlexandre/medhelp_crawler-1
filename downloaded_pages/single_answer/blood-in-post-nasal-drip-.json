            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The symptoms could be due to recurrent sinusitis, if it is accompanied by nasal stuffiness and facial pain or pressure. Post nasal drip could also be due to allergens. You will need to consult your primary care physician for proper assessment. In the meantime practice good breathing exercises, humidify your room and do steam inhalations.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Post nasal drip was sudden enough to wake me, I noticed it becoming greater to the point where it felt like I was bringing down a solid like a \"long piece of string\", when I tried to bring some up to spit out it was fairly clear with bright red streaks of blood. In years past I was plagued with chronic sinus infections until my successful surgery in 05. Worry some is the suddenness of this as I had not had noticeable post nasal drip for a long time. I have had mild high blood pressure for some time as well as borderline type 2 diabetes both of which are untreated with meds.THANKS",
