            "answer": "Your question is one that has been addressed by many clinical (medical) investigations.\u00a0\u00a0Most often these studies have not specifically focused on genetics and disease inheritance but rather on associations between major diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Specifically between what is probably the most common inflammatory disease, Asthma, and a group of diseases that include diabetes mellitus, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Coronary Heart Disease.\u00a0\u00a0The results of one such study, from the Mayo Clinic, are cited below.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to discuss it with your physician.To greatly simplify their findings, there was an association between Asthma and Diabetes or Coronary Heart Disease.\u00a0\u00a0They did not find an association between Asthma, Rheumatoid Arteritis or Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseThis investigation does not directly answer your question.\u00a0\u00a0The investigators looked to the likelihood that a given individual with Asthma might be predisposed to also having one of the four diseases.\u00a0\u00a0In your circumstance, the above suggests that, having asthma, your daughter would not be at increased risk of having R.A. but only the risk associated with mother-daughter inheritance.Mayo Clinic ProceedingsIssue: Volume 87(10), October 2012, p 953\u2013960Copyright: \u00a9 2012 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and ResearchPublication Type: [Original article]DOI: 10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.05.020ISSN: 0025-6196________________________________________1942-5546Accession: 22980164AbstractObjective: To determine the association between asthma and proinflammatory conditions.Participants and Methods: This population-based retrospective matched cohort study enrolled all asthmatic patients among Rochester, Minnesota, residents between January 1, 1964, and December 31, 1983. For each asthmatic patient, 2 age-and sex-matched nonasthmatic individuals were drawn from the same population. The asthmatic and nonasthmatic cohorts were followed forward in the Rochester Epidemiology Project diagnostic index for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary heart disease (CHD) as outcome events. Data were fitted to Cox proportional hazards models.Results: We identified 2392 asthmatic patients and 4784 nonasthmatic controls. Of the asthmatic patients, 1356 (57%) were male, and mean age at asthma onset was 15.1 years. Incidence rates of IBD, RA, DM, and CHD in nonasthmatic controls were 32.8, 175.9, 132.0, and 389.7 per 100,000 person-years, respectively; those for asthmatic patients were 41.4, 227.9, 282.6, and 563.7 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Asthma was associated with increased risks of DM (hazard ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.43\u20133.13; P<.001) and CHD (hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.05\u20132.06; P=.02) but not with increased risks of IBD or RA.Conclusion:There have been numerous studies concerning the etiology of asthma, but the effect of asthma on the epidemiologic characteristics of other chronic diseases has been relatively underinvestigated. There have been studies that assessed the relationship between asthma and chronic conditions (ie, proinflammatory conditions), such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA),7\u20139 inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),9\u201312 diabetes mellitus (DM),8,9,13\u201316 and coronary heart disease (CHD).14 However, most of these studies were based on cross-sectional studies using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for asthma and chronic diseases as outcomes. To our knowledge, no population-based cohort study has examined the effect of asthma using predetermined criteria on the incidence of these proinflammatory conditions. Considering the major burden and major effects of these proinflammatory conditions, the study results have important implications on clinical practice and public health.ConclusionAsthma does not reduce the risk of proinflammatory conditions but increases the risk of CHD and DM. Physicians need to be aware of these study findings and address symptoms of CHD and DM in asthmatic patients during asthma follow-up visits. Also, given the considerable proportion of people affected by asthma, public health communities may need to carefully monitor the potential impact of asthma epidemiologic features on the epidemiologic mechanisms of the chronic diseases assessed in this study. Further studies that assess the association between asthma and individual chronic inflammatory conditions are needed to confirm these study findings.",
