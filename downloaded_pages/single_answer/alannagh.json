            "answer": "Hello.Do you recall having injured or twisted your ankle ? And do you get the sharp pains on walking ? If yes, it could be a ligament injury.What looks more likely is a neuropathic pain. Though there are no other symptoms of neuropathy, do you have diabetes ?Such pain can also be brought on by vitamin deficiencies. Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor if you are already consulting one.Regards",
