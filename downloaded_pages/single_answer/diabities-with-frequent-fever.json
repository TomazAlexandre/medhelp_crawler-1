            "answer": "The important question that comes to mind is how are your mother's blood sugars? Does she test when she has the fever? Is she high? Does she have other flu-like symptoms along with the fever? Unfortunately, diabetics are subject to infections and take longer to heal. It's very important she maintain her blood sugar control and test at least once a day to make sure this is the case. If her blood sugars are well controlled, the fever may be unrelated to her diabetes and she should see her doctor to determine what is going on.",
