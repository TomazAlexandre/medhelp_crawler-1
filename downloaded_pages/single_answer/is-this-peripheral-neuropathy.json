            "answer": "The theory at the moment from my physiotherapist and doctor is that there is 'neural tension' - ie muscles (particularly in my neck which are very tight) are compressing the nerves. When the physio twists\u00a0\u00a0my arms in certain positions it triggers pain and tingling in the fingers. She's given me exercises to do which haven't really done anything, but some neck massage/stretching definitely seems to help.Has anyone here had anything similar and have any suggestions?",

    "question": "Hi,I've been having pain and tingling in both hands/arms - it's mainly the hands and forearms, though my shoulders sometimes ache. The pains/tingling are mainly around the ulnar nerve (last two fingers and u to the elbow), but I also get pain and tingling in the radial nerve\u00a0\u00a0(thumb and first few fingers). The symptoms are definitely worse in some positions (ie arm out straight, flexing the wrist) in both arms. To complicate matters, I've also been getting pains in my heels/feet and tingling in the toes sometimes, but it's much less severe and doesn't seem to be brought on by a particular position.This started at the beginning of December, along with some other symptoms which have been improving (cold feet often, sometimes leg swelling, a feeling that my right leg isn't responding correctly when walking sometimes). I've seen my doctor who says it isn't peripheral neuropathy since the pain comes and goes and told me to take pain killers - he did do some blood tests (not sure what other than diabetes) and checked pulses in my feet. I've also been seeing a physiotherapist for about 3 weeks now, but the pains and range of movement before I get pain/tingling have got worse.Any suggestions? Should I hope the physio works or should I persuade my doctor to refer my to a neurologist or for other tests?Thanks",
