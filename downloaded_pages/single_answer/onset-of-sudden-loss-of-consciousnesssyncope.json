I was leading a life devoid of fat,intoxicantsMedications- lasix,cardivas,eplerenone,Clopidogrel.aspirin, statins,alprax were taken on time.Dietary control and strict adherence to exercise pattern(30 minutes of walk during the morning and during the evening) were maintained.However things went astray with me falling in faintness in the morning bruising my jaw and teeth.The episode was quite an unexpected one.What would have probably caused this event.Is it syncope(faintness) due to sudden cardiac failure? OR poor glycemic performance on account of diabetes.?",
