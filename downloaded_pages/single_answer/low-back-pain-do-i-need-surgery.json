    "question": "Hi I am a 56 year old male 5ft 8in 280lbs. Type 2 Diabetes on lantus insulin 50 units a day.My left leg is numb and now my right is also going numb. With sharp pains going down my right hip most of the time and left some of the time.also my right groin and testy hurts to. My MRI. report says I have a spondylolisthesis/vertebra slippied forward at L4 and a disc protrusion at l5-S1. Formaina narrowing is identified at L4 there i compression on the spinal cord. I had a shot in that disc but it didn't help. The Orthopedic Surgern said I need\u00a0\u00a0a fusion with rods and schews.I take a lot of other meds also. I am scared to death how many people die with this surgery. Can any one shed some light on this. Thank you. BigDan.",
