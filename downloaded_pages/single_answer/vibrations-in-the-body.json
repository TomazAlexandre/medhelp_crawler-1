            "answer": "Hi,Given that your Mom has had diabetes for a few years, it is quite possible that the \"vibration\" sensation as well as the palpitations are related to nerve damage from diabetes. High blood sugars can damage the nerves in many parts of the body, including the feet and hands, and give strange feelings--sometimes vibration as you described, and also burning, pain, tingling, pricking or crawly feelings.There are a number of medications used for treating this, and likely your doctor has chosen one of them for your Mom. Keeping her diabetes well controlled will help as well. If your doctor is sure this is from diabetic neuropathy, then a referral to a neurologist is best.However there are a few other things that need to be checked as well. Your Mom has anemia, as you mentioned, and that can cause palpitations and fatigue. She should also be screened for thyroid problems, as well as have a stress test done. Speak to your Mom's doctor about these and ask for other possibilities that need to be checked out, just to be sure.Take care.",
