            "answer": "It sounds like it would help to work closely with an endo and/or diabetes educator to help figure out your insulin:carb ratios and how to alter your doses for what you are actually eating. But first you should find out if your basal rate (your long lasting insulin) is right, because you will be high all the time otherwise. An endo or cde can help with this as can the book Using Insulin by John Walsh. You also need to learn how to safely do corrections after meals if you still end up high. Relax, take a deep breath and learn what you can to help you manage your numbers, and know it takes time and so go with \"progress not perfection\" to give yourself a break. If you continue to be anxious all the time, or feel like giving up, you might want to ask your doctor to refer you to a therapist for awhile so you can talk about how this has been affecting you. It isn't easy, but it will get better!",

    "question": "I was diagnosed in 2009 right on St. Patrick's Day (ironically the day I stopped drinking). I have been a diabetic for a year now but only really began looking into diabetes recently. Now all I feel is anxiousness and had a couple of panic attacks. I feel left in the dark about the whole ordeal. I mean, I have really tried to keep with my insulin but my readings are always high and I don't know what to do. I am used to working out a lot so I don't know how to rule this out and on the days I don't work out. I take 26 units of long lasting insulin, and i use fast acting insuline as well. However my blood sugar levels don't seem to want to drop no matter how much insulin i use. It's quite frustrating really. All i feel is anxiousness and it progressively gets worse. All I feel is guilt to my family and friends who I seem to stress out.I try to relax but nothing seems to work. I dont know what to do.",
