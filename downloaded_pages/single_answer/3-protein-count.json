            "answer": "Hi,Proteinuria or abnormal amounts of protein in the urine occur when the filters of the kidney, called glomeruli, are damaged. Other conditions that can damage the glomeruli and cause proteinuria include diabetes, hypertension, and other forms of kidney diseases.\u00a0\u00a0This can also lead to cardiovascular diseases.I would recommend that you have another test done and if you have persistent proteinuria, additional tests must be done to evaluate your kidney function.\u00a0\u00a0If you have diabetes, hypertension, or both, the first goal of treatment will be to control your blood glucose and blood pressure. Having a low salt and low protein diet may also help. Take care and keep us posted.",
