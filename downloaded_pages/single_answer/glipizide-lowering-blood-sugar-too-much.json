            "answer": "First, there are no doctors on this forum. Second, asking someone on a public forum about changing medication dosage is dangerous as we are not privy to your medical records or history. Please consult only with your doctor about adjustments to medication/s.Yes, anything <60 mg/dl is considered hypoglycemia and not wise to continue in that state. For emergency situations like this take a half a glucose tablet - can be purchased at your local pharmacy/drug store - to raise your glucose levels. Test 30 minutes later. Don't\u00a0\u00a0over do it.Are you testing preprandial [before meals]? Are the postprandial [after meal] levels you posted 2-3 hours after dinner? If you have a dinner loaded with carbohydrates one can experience reactive hypoglycemia [low glucose] - a carb crash. As a diabetic it is very important to restrict your carb intake as digested carbs react the same as eating sugar. Good luck",

    "question": "I have Diabetes II and taking 2 tablets of Metformin (500 mg) in the morning and 1 tablet of Metformin plus 1/2 tablet of Glipizide (5 mg) at dinner time. My blood sugar level goes down after dinner (around 7 p.m.) to 45, 50, 55 and feel very weak. Could it be that Glipizide is too strong for me? Should I stop it? My A1C is 6.9",
