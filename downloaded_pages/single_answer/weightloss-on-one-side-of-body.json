    "question": "I have lost some weighIt recently, but have noticed that my right side of body, face, arms, torso, legs etc all seem to be smaller than left, as if ive lost weight/muscle/fat from only that side of body. My doc told me she didnt \" buy\" what i was saying, and others say that theres not much of a difference. I can feel it and see it myself and know im not imagininig it. Feels like I can pull a lot more fat from ledt side of body than right and right side just feels week and almost like its shrinking/getting weaker.Is it possible for this to be just down to uneven weight loss? Been diagnosed with diabetes (im 24) but seems a weird symptom for it.Its a really weird feeling to have and its hard to forget about it, can almost always feel the difference between my two legs and arms etc.",
