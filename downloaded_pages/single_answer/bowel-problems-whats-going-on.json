            "answer": "Hi, IBS can produce a feeling of incomplete defecation. Then again please check for Diabetes as this can affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves leading to bowel symptoms. This can be detected by a simple blood test. Also local pathologies in the rectum like growths or inflammatory diseases can also leave a feeling to defecation. For this a proctoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy will help detect the lesion. So, would advise you to discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time. Regards.",

    "question": "Hello,I've been trying to search for some answers but end up with no luck. Maybe y'all can help me.Okay on a day to day basis, I usually have a burning sensation inside my butt. It is extremely uncomfortable especially when walking. Sometimes, there is blood during the time it is burning. I assumed it was an anal fissure. I went to see a colon-rectal surgeon and he said it was not a fissure nor hemorrhoid. So, now he wants to do a colonoscopy to see inside of my large intestine. He also wants me to see G.I specialist as well.Also, sometimes when I have a BM, it is the worst 15-20 mins ever! When these bouts happen, I am nauseous, lightheaded, dizzy, feeling sweaty, and having the worst stomach pain WHILE having a bm. Once that passes, I'm like a new kid again. It doesn't happen all the time, but when I do have a bm, sometimes I feel some stomach pain or that sick to my stomach type feeling. Other times, I have the urgency to have a bm and either not much or nothing comes out. That's uncomfortable too because I leave the restroom knowing that I still need to go but can't. What do you think is the problem?Any suggestions would be GREAT! Thanks in advance!",
