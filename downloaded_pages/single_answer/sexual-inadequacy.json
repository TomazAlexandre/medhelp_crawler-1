            "answer": "Hello,First of all we have to understand why you are having this sexual inadequacy. It can be due to erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, lack of sperms or abnormality of sperms and its physiology. Common causes causing erection problem are stress and anxiety,poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, which make sex a task rather than a pleasure,negative feelings about non performance,smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord injury, nerve damage (for example, from prostate surgery), or neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease).Medications such as blood pressure medications (especially beta-blockers), heart medications (such as digoxin), some peptic ulcer medications, sleeping pills, and antidepressants may also cause erectile dysfunction.I would suggest you to consult your doctor and get this evaluated. Treatment depends on the confirmation of diagnosis and examination is needed for that. Without examination confirmation of a diagnosis is tough.I hope it helps.Take care and please do keep me posted.Warm regards.",
