            "answer": "Hello,There are a few possibilities for itchy skin without rash which should be evaluated. These include lice, scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods.I suggest you to get an examination done from a dermatologist. Till that time, use a mild soap like dove, apply calamine lotion and take some oral antihistaminic like Benadryl or Claritin.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. Treatment can be started only when the diagnosis is confirmed. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
