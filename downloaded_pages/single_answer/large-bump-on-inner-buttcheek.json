    "question": "Ok I've been experiencing yeast infection like symptoms. The skin near my vagina was irritated; I change soaps causing my skin to be irritated.I went back to my normal soap (specialized for the vagina) and the itching is starting subside. The problem is my skin near my vangina is discolored and I found a quarter sized bump underneath my skin located on left inner butt cheek. It's deep under the skin and it hurts grabbing it or touching it. It feels like a super sized pimple. What could this be? I had my annual exam done, so I've been tested for all stds and I had negative results. I have a good hygiene habits.I went over a friends house and set on his couch were his dog slobbers and chews everyday and had on a thong on so my bare bottom was on the couch I wonder if that caused the bump?",
