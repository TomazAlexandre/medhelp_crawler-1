            "answer": "Hello, there!There is no direct correlation of recurrent skin infections and early HIV infection.\u00a0\u00a0There might be a link in the late stages of HIV when the immune system has been severely affected, which would certainly not be your case. Have you been tested for diabetes? There is certainly a direct relationship of this condition and recurrent boils, cellulitis, etc.Even though HIV infection would be highly unlikely, you definiteily should be tested for HIV because you had unprotected intercourse, during which you contracted genital herpes, and in presence of a herpetic outbreak, the risk of HIV transmission is increased.Best wishes,Dr Jose Gonzalez-Garcia",
