    "question": "So about 3 months ago, a brown spot shiwed up on my stomach, and ever since, more have showed up, on my inner/upper thighs, they are a sort of lightbrownish color, and they are of different sizes, however they are a\u013al very round. From what I understand, it could be a symptom of diabetes or prostate cancer. They don't itch, so I've ruled out fungus. They feel like velvet when I touch them, and they are softer than my normal skin. I just don't want to draw any hasty conclusions, but I still would like other opinions, on what to do. I'm 16, so it's most likely not prostate cancer, but I thought I'd ask anyways, to see if anyone might know what they are. It could be Diabetes, because I haven't been eating very healthy lately. Pictures of them are in my photos. Any response would be greatly appreciated, thank you for your time.",
