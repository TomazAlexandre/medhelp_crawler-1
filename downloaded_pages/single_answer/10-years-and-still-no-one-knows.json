    "question": "Im a 33 year old male. Active, i work hard, i do smoke though not alot, i used to drink alot in my early 20s but no longer do. im a big guy, 250pounds but as i said i work hard too, keeps me active.Since my early 20s ive had stomach problems, before then i had nothing and the number of doctors ive seen, none has found out what it was.I dont have diabetes or any other illness, im not on medication for anything. Ive had ulcer tests and blood tests and besides bp being a little high im fine. I can eat about anything no problems.My problem is i have to eat every few hours, or at least drink something. If my stomach gets empty to growling stages i go into really bad dry heaves. Most of the time i feel it beginning in my stomach, especially in the morning. Milk does help at times so my doctor assumed i had acid reflux disease. I dont and was on double doses of prevacid with no results. Thing is its not just from my stomach, my throat can cause it too..if i have a dry throat it will start, and if i have eaten then i will vomit. Cold air in winter can trigger it. when i go to the dentist, sitting in the chair with my mouth open for a few mins will trigger it as it gets dry, nerves can cause it too.My next step is to go to a gastroenteroroligist?, to have the tube with the camera put down there. But im just wondering if anyone has ever heard of this? Diet change didnt make a difference i quit smoking once and didnt notice much either.. My diet now isnt great, my biggest bad habit is a drink way too much soda pop.Ive had lots of theories from doctors as to what my cause it, my GPs last guess coming up is some kind of hernia, where part of my stomach is pushed up, though he said generally this causes problems in eatting whereas i have no problems.Any thoughts or ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.",
