    "question": "I am not sure why this is happening but I have had this problem for almost 3 months now. I started getting a really bad taste in my mouth in the beginning at which point I started worrying it was diabetes as I am a black male but being only 23 and in good shape I was rather confused so I went to the doctor and got a blood and urine test covering everything from diabetes, iron levels (as I had also developed serious exfoliative chelitis after this taste appeared), I even went so far as to get tested for infections like HIV. So all the results showed that i was perfectly healthy. That's when I decided to make an appointment with the dental hygienist (especially as my gums had started bleeding during brushing). I brush my teeth twice a day before bed and in the morning, use mouthwash and floss frequently. When I went to the hygienist she mentioned that I had a minor gum infection on the left side of my wisdom tooth as it's growing slightly slanted. It causes no pain whatsover. I got a good clean and maintained good hygiene after (flossing every day, using mouthwash often). The bad taste went away for a while but I would wake up every morning with a white film on my lips and lips severely chapped (infact now I'm losing the skin on my upper lip which isn't a good site at all and is absolutely killing my confidence around people). It also seems that after brushing my teeth and rinsing with water especially in the evening a very fast and bizzare reaction occurs where a thick white substance forms on my lips (I usually get a tingly sensation first)...this has also happened when I drink water whilst in bars or at a friends house (several times). This thin layer also forms after I have been out for extended periods of time (day out/night out). What tends to happen is my slaiva starts feeling thicker, a rather yeasty smell forms in my breath and this film forms on my lips (sometimes tingling on my lips too) leading to severely chapped lips and having to peel the skin.",
