    "question": "Re: Lost bladder sensation?[ Follow Ups ] [ Post Followup ] [ The Urology Forum ]Posted by HFHS M.D.-MS on February 24, 1998 at 17:31:52:In Reply to: Lost bladder sensation? posted by Lou on February 15, 1998 at 11:58:13:Hi,Just a quick question:What could be the cause of a loss of sensation in my bladder?\u00a0\u00a0Off and on over the past year I have seemed to lose the feeling - only knowing to go to the bathroom when my kidneys(?) start to ache.\u00a0\u00a0After a long period of this I went to the walk in clinic - no infection, no kidney stones - essentially ok - but still this back pain.\u00a0\u00a0I seem to have a decrease in urination as well so I have increased my intake of water.Later on following this first initial \"attack\" of whatever I began having a whole slew of neurological symptoms - could this be related?Thanks in advance=================================================================Dear Lou,Thanks for your short question.When a urologist interviews patients with symptoms you describe, they ask about diabetes mellitus ( long-term), strokes, back injuries, bulging disc, sciatica, multiple sclerosis, congenital defects to the spine and cord, etc.\u00a0\u00a0all which affect the nerves to the bladder.\u00a0\u00a0I think I would see a neurologist first\u00a0\u00a0for your neurological symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Ask them if they feel these symptoms are related\u00a0\u00a0to your bladder after he/she\u00a0\u00a0examines you. If so he /she may recommend you seeing a Urologist to help manage the bladder.\u00a0\u00a0Nerves are\u00a0\u00a0not like downed powerlines, the damage can be permanent if not repaired soon.\u00a0\u00a0 If your bladder stays stretched to long it will decompensate and not be able to empty.\u00a0\u00a0Also not draining your bladder can be a set up for a urinary tract infection or possible kidney damage. Frequent urination is encouraged until you get this straightened out.You are welcome to see one of our Neurologist or Urologist\u00a0\u00a0by calling Henry Ford\u00a0\u00a0Hospital at (1 800 653 6568).This information is provided for general medical education purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult your physician for diagnostic and treatment options pertaining to your specific medical condition.Good Luck!Sincerely:HFHS M.D.- MS* Keyword: Insensate Bladder",
