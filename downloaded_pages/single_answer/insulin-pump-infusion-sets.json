            "answer": "If you don't mind... where does she insert the cateter?? I've learned that your site and the angle you insert make a difference. Also maybe her bolus have to be corrected. For example, I have 6 different basal rates and 4 different bolus ratios because my body absorves insulin differently as the day goes on.For my insulin/carb ratio for bkf is 1 unit for every 6 carbs, then it changes for lunch, afternoon, dinner and after dinner.Also, the fact that the site goes fast probably it is related to the fact that she exercises and this probably causes the cateter to move from the site and she is not getting the insulin she needs... do you have a Diabetes Educator that could spend time working with you and your daughter?? It took me months to finally get my settings tuned up!I hope it helps.",

    "question": "my daughter has a problem absorbing insulin, she uses the quick sets with her minimed pump , when she changes her site it takes a long time for the numbers to get in range, 12 hrs or so, the sites goes rather quickly sometimes in 24 hrs or less, her skin is thick, she is very active, does gymnastics 20 hrs /week. i'm\u00a0\u00a0at a loss we've tried different pumps, different sets but we continuously have this problem.\u00a0\u00a0for instance she woke up today at 104, we then changed sites because i was changing her cannister so it was a good time, she did not eat breakfast, she went to school and before lunch at 12 her glucose was 182 - so in 5 hrs w/o eating and a basal rate if 1.15 she went up almost 80 pts - doesn't make sense - she should have dropped low, after lunch she bolused 7 units for 70 carbs, 3 hrs later when she came home she was 490 - why? she had 7 units plus a basal of 1.15 - the site was new the coannister new too - i can't explain it other than the site and cannula do not work for her. i'm going to try the sure t sites, anyone have any opinion?",
