            "answer": "Hello there,I cannot confirm anything without a clinical examination.HSV 2 causes fever, aches in the lower back, buttocks thighs or knees. Once a person has HSV2 it remains within the nerve cells and remains in the body. It can remain dormant for a long time. If it is not due to HSV2 then it is possible that you could be suffering from sciatica. There are several conditions which can cause sciatica like herniated discs, a tight piriformis muscle, pelvic injury or fracture and tumors etc.It can be a dull aching mild tingling sensation and numbness in the hips or calf and sole of foot. Other possibilities are diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 defficiency; deep vein thrombosis etc.It is advisable to consult a doctor to detect the exact cause of your symptoms. Only then can the exact treatment be decided. Do keep us posted.Take care and best regards!",
