            "answer": "Your distortion can is probably due to a macular problem.\u00a0\u00a0This could be from fluid under the retina from CNVM (due to myopic or age related macular degeneration) or idiopathic central serous retinopathy.\u00a0\u00a0There are also other rarer conditions.\u00a0\u00a0The distortion can also be due to an epiretinal membrane or macular edema from a retinal vascular disease such as diabetes or a branch vein occlusion.Dr. O.",

    "question": "I'm about -18 in my left eye, -13 in my right.\u00a0\u00a0Been to about 8 different doctors over the course of the past 3 years after noticing some small flashes in my sight when going outside.\u00a0\u00a0But a slight annoyance but nothing serious. All doctors told me they had no diagnosis but nothing to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0This past weekend, I started getting what I described as \"flashes\" in my left eye but are more like quick distortions when my eye moves.\u00a0\u00a0I've also noticed wavy lines when I read and very small blind spots near my center of vision.\u00a0\u00a0My field of vision test was normal, my retinal exam was normal, the only thing they found was a blood vessel somewhere in my eye (need to find out more about this) but said it is nothing to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0They said it doesn't affect the retina and they see it frequently in people with diabetes, which prompted me to be checked for diabetes which came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0Went to a retinal specialist again the other day with these new distortions.\u00a0\u00a0He dilated me and said everything looked normal.\u00a0\u00a0I then looked further into my symptoms online and came across Myopic Macular Degeneration and it seems like a very good possibility.\u00a0\u00a0I live in Boston and have seen many respected eye doctors at Mass Eye and Ear and none of them have even mentioned MMD.\u00a0\u00a0I have a follow-up visit in 4 weeks with the retinal specialist.\u00a0\u00a0I've searched this board and google and can't seem to find out - how is MMD diagnosed?\u00a0\u00a0Is it purely by symptoms or is there something that all these doctors would have already seen by now?\u00a0\u00a0I want to bring this up to my doctor and make sure it is seriously considered.",
