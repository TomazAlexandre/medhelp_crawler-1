    "question": "It is five years since I have been diagnozed with type 2 diabetes. I have difficulties to keep my fasting sugar low- it has been between 120 and 125,and occationaly in the130s.\u00a0\u00a0A1C\u00a0\u00a0is b/w 6.5-7.2. At present I take Metformin and Amaryl (glymepride). I also take Atacand to regulate high BP and Vytorin for the cholesterol.Recently I started experiencing tingling tongue sensations and started worrying that it can be already some kind of nerves damage. Is it possibe? Did somebody else experienced something similar?I will see the doctor next week, but I am curious about other fellows-diabetics.Many thanks.PS.",
