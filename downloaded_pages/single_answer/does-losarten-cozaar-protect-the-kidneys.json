            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Cozaar tablets contain the active ingredient losartan potassium which belongs to the angiotensin II antagonist group of medication. This drug is used to treat high blood pressure, reduce the risk of stroke in people who have high blood pressure, as well as delay the progression of kidney disease in people with type 2 diabetes who have related kidney complications. Blocking the actions of angiotensin II reduces the action of aldosterone on the kidneys resulting in an increase in the amount of fluid removed from the blood by the kidneys. This decreases the amount of fluid in the blood vessels and lessens resistance and pressure in the blood vessels. This suggests kidney protection to all especially to diabetic patients. Hope all is well. Take care and do keep us posted.",
