            "answer": "Difficult to say without evaluation.Being a diabetic, checking your sugars on a regular basis should be done, as fluctuations and low levels can cause some of the disorientation you are feeling.Various neurological causes should also be evaluated for, including head imaging with a CT scan or MRI.\u00a0\u00a0The carotid arteries should be looked at for blockages, and can be evaluated with an ultrasound.Finally, arrhythmias, or an abnormal heart rhythm, can lead to feelings of disorientation and pre-syncope.\u00a0\u00a0If suspected, an echocardiogram as well as a Holter monitor should be performed.These options can be discussed with your personal physician, or in conjunction with a neurologist.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin Pho, M.D.www.kevinmd.comwww.twitter.com/kevinmd",
