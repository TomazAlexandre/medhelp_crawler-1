    "question": "Hello. I went in for a CT scan of my face/sinuses yesterday. I have recurrent sinus infections. The test came back fine except for showing that I have a lingering sinus infection and calcification around my eye bone. The doctor did not elaborate on this, except to say that the xray tech suggested a test for diabetes. I had a physical in December and my blood sugar test came back fine and showed no diabetes. The doctor did say that she would research this more.My question is what causes calcification of the eye bone? Thank you for any help you can give.",
