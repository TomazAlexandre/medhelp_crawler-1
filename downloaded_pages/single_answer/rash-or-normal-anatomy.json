    "question": "I seem to have a bit of itching going on or around my rectum.\u00a0\u00a0I took a good look at it the other day (sorry to get graphic) and when i spread the cheeks open I notice 5 or so purple lumpy areas on the outside of the rectum.\u00a0\u00a0After some research I thought maybe they were just hemorrhoids because of their appearance and the fact they are itchy and a bit sore.\u00a0\u00a0They dont look like they can be popped by any means nor are they filled with puss. I have applied hemorrhoid cream to it for 3 days now but it is still itchy.\u00a0\u00a0i checked today and I noticed that when I spread my cheeks there is a circle redness starting from the rectum and spreading out with a 1 inch radius. I just want to mention I have never had any sexual activity take place in or around my anus.Does this sound like hemorrhoids and can you get 4 or so at a time or are the purple areas normal?Is this a potential rash or infection in the anus or is it normal for it to be a bit red around the rectum when the cheeks are spread (could the cream be the cause)?How long do hemorrhoids typically last like this?Thanks for the help",
