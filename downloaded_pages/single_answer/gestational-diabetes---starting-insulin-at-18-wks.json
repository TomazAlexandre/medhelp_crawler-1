            "answer": "Hi!I can understand your concerns. Diabetes can be managed well with the right combination of diet, exercise and medication. So along with the insulin dose, you need to eat and exercise right. I would suggest you ask for a consult with the dietician and chalk out what and how much you can eat through the day. As a tip I would say eat frequent (5-6) small meals of healthy food options. Then ask the diabetes educator, regarding the exercises you can do during pregnancy. Along with this, you need to record your blood sugar numbers for a few days so that your doctor can adjust the insulin dose. If you are not able to make it to the clinic, then arrange with the diabetes educator or the concerned person for a telephonic report daily.\u00a0\u00a0After a few trials, most patients can get the right insulin dose. Also, it is important to have a regular routine. So, eat regularly at regular timings, exercise regularly and take insulin as instructed. Once in a while you can let go and eat what you crave for, and naturally the sugar may be high the next day, but this will be temporary and settle without a need for dose adjustment. Please discuss all this in detail with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes at about 12 weeks pregnant because I took my blood sugar on my own (knowing I had GD last pregnancy) and it was high in the morning (average was 110). I went to the Endo once and was told to keep checking with a new monitor (I guess he didn't trust my Rite Aid brand monitor) and come back in a week. Well I missed that appointment b/c I couldn't get there and missed a 2nd appointment also b/c of transportation. So they called today and asked to just hear my #'s over the phone. Fastings are 90-102 usually and once was 114 because I ate like crap the day before. Well they called me back and said they want me to come in tomorrow and learn how to use insulin which I will give myself nightly before bed. I think they said \"long-acting\" but not 100% sure.questions:1) If she did say long-acting insulin, is that safe during pregnancy? I read that it wasn't.2) I feel like I could have been trying harder with my diet and now I'm worried that IF I try harder to eat better and/or start exercising while doing the insulin that my blood sugar will go TOO low. What do you think???3) There are times that my blood sugar is very unusually low (for me), like today at one point during the mid-morning it was 69 and my monitor beeped and said \"below target.\" This also makes me nervous that if I were on insulin that I would have to worry about it going TOO low randomly. Also, one time AFTER giving birth to my last baby... I was maybe 5 months PP, I was unusually active (nothing crazy, but I was running and pushing the kids around the merry-go-round) and an hour after I was home my blood sugar dropped to 54. I felt sick suddenly and felt super duper tired and just so happened to think maybe I should take my blood sugar just out of curiosity. Thank God, or I would have just tried to go to sleep. I ate some honey and it came up after a few minutes. But, again, these strange lows worry me about taking insulin. Should I be concerned??4) Would exercise help my fasting numbers in the morning, or does that not effect those so much?Sorry about the novel. Thanks for reading all that!",
