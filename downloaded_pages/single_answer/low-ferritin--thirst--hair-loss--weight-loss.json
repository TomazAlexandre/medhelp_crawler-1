    "question": "Long story short. Last year I was confirmed as having Hashimotos. I am on 100mcg synthroid pretty stable. I am also a runner. I never had B 12 checked. But Two months ago I had ferritin checked and it was 27 and now it is 21. I take 325mg elemental iron everyday. I am also always thirsty (checked negative for diabetes) and I have lost 3-4 pounds (not on purpose....but may be due to running too much?) and have hair loss. I cannot get into the doc until Dec 18th. Does anyone have any ideas about what may be casuing this or what I can do to increase ferritian. Thanks",
