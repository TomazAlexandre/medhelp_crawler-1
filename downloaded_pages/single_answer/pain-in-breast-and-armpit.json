            "answer": "If you have that kind of family history, I'd suggest going to the doctor. I don't know about the pain and tenderness being a symptom; I've never heard that. I've heard of women getting a rash and that being a sign (I know because I had a rash that freaked me out for that reason). It could possibly be a kind of lymph node inflammation, but if you have that kind of history, you should do regular breast exams and report to a doctor if you have any kind of abnormality (such as this tenderness). Has it been going on long? Breast tenderness is normal.You're probably just fine, I would just urge you to keep on top of it. I have a history of diabetes in my family, and that's something I like to keep on top of.",
