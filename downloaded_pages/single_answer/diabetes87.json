            "answer": "Hi,In general a family history does put you at higher risk of developing diabetes in future, but not all people with diabetes have a known family member with the disease. You did not mention if the bloodwork was fasting or not. If it was, then you have what is called impaired fasting glucose, and should have a 2 hour glucose tolerance test as a follow up. If the test was a random blood test , then you should do one fasting to see what your sugar level is then.You are currently not overweight and you are doing a wonderful things by walking every day. Keep an eye on your diet as well. Take care and let me know if you have other questions.",
