            "answer": "Hi!There are various conditions which can cause a blister. These include excess heat or cold, herpes, diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition. Do not burst any blister on your own. Apply any moisturizer or calamine lotion on this to soothe the pain and take any OTC painkiller such as ibuprofen. You can take an anti-allergic pill for the itch. Consult a doctor to find the cause. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm a 16 yr old girl. Yesterday when biking really hard, I saw little clear bumps on my skin. All over, pin size and when I popped them, water burst out. It was on my chest, stomach and back.\u00a0\u00a0When I showered I scrubbed them off but then they got super itchy at night. Is it alright to pop them? and how can I get rid of them safety, without having to sterilize needles or something weird and long-winded?extra note: I was biking 3 hours nonstop! Something I don't normally do. I don't normally bike at all.and I'm still really itchy!",
