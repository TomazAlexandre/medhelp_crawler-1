            "answer": "Hello,Hives (medically known as urticaria) are red, itchy, raised areas of skin that appear in varying shapes and sizes. They have a tendency to change size rapidly and to move around, disappearing in one place and reappearing in other places, often in a matter of hours.Many cases of hives are \"idiopathic,\" meaning no cause is known. Others may be triggered by viral infections or medications.Even emotional stress,sweating and hot and cold temperatures can trigger hives.Diabetes in general is related to itchy skin.So it is very difficult to determine what is triggering the hives.I hope that helps.Kind regards.",

    "question": "I have dealt with hives and off for a year and half. My original trigger was being allergic to adhesive. Since then, I have had reactions to other things, but have not been able to figure out\u00a0\u00a0what?\u00a0\u00a0 Tonight I got motivated to do some picking up, cleaning and laundry and I got sweaty and the itching became alive. I would like to do major itching.Why do hives keep coming back?\u00a0\u00a0I never was allergic to anything.\u00a0\u00a0I was always careful about not using scented things, because I knew my mom was very allergic to stuff like that.\u00a0\u00a0Also, there was always the belief scents were one of the causes of acne.I\u00a0\u00a0take generic allegra each day in hopes of preventing or making itching less of a bother if I should get hives during the day. Also, I am on levothyoxine, Diovon HCT, Progesterone, Lexapro, Aderall,\u00a0\u00a0Adrenal Gland Supplement, Vitamin C, Vitamin D with Calcium and Welchol.\u00a0\u00a0I just got done coming off of Hydorcortoidisone- which was taken from chronic inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0Since I have been off it, the discomfort i have felt in back, hips, hands, and shoulder\u00a0\u00a0has come back.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone back to taking either Extra Tylenol or Arthritus Tylenol.Possiblities are:\u00a0\u00a0Some type of autoimmune disease, result of having Diabetes 2 - which i have had a official diagnosis for a month, Gluetin Intolerance(I have gone through Saliva testing and it was one of things it says I have.\u00a0\u00a0Saliva testing is not\u00a0\u00a0recognized by most of the doctors i have gone to., New allergies because the original adhesive reaction or the fact i am getting older and more things bother my system.I like being able to just go and live my life.\u00a0\u00a0I feel a real need to get a bottom line answer to why.Ann",
