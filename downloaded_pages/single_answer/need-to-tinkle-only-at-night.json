Some of them are:\u2022\tDiabetes, pregnancy, and prostate problems\u2022\tBladder conditions such as infections\u2022\tMedications such as diuretics\u2022\tIncreased intake of caffeine or alcoholCompletely stopping the intake of sugar is not advisable as it could lead to hypoglycemia.

    "question": "I have read some of the other forums. But not seen anything that sounded exactly like what I have been going through for about 2 or 3 months now. At night.. and literally only at night when i lay down to go to bed. I will need to get up with an urge to pee like I am holding a lot right at the tip of expulsion. However every time I go to the bathroom it is literally just a little. Sometimes nothing more then a couple drops. I will sit there and try to push to get anything I don't feel after that out.. then return to bed to literally wake up 30 minutes to 2 hours later with the same exact urgency and the same lack of any much urine. I have recently made a huge change in diet. 5+ months ago I stopped eating sugar.. literally All together. None. Very little fruit as well. This was at first to test myself for hypoglycemia and continued after just because I have felt alot better having cut all processed and most natural sugars even honey and molasses from my diet. Could this be an affect of the diet change, a simple UTI or something that may need to be checked out (note no insurance so hoping for the former rather then the Later)",
