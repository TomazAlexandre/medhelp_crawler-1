            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I cannot tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.There are multiple causes for the so called :scattered foci T2 prolongation/periventricular white matter\u201d. Most often, these are due to what is called \"chronic small vessel disease\", literally meaning diseased small vessels that supply blood flow to the brain. This is not an uncommon process in the brain and increases with age. This is not a disease in and of itself but rather is a reflection of unhealthy blood vessels, damaged by years of plaque build-up. This is most often due to a combination of several factors including the following: high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol. If these factors are well controlled, the damage to the brain can be stabilized and further damage prevented.The reason they did the MRI was to rule out an acute stroke. An acute stroke often shows up as a lesion with positive restricted diffusion. In your case there was no restricted diffusion according to the report so that is good.The report indicated that you have minimal chronic white matter disease which is good since it is minimal. It is important to control risk factors like stop smoking if you smoke, take medication to control your blood pressure (which you are), cholesterol, and diabetes, eat a healthy diet, and exercise.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "..I had an MRI after experiencing some minor right side facial tingling 2 1/2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a problem controlling my blood pressure for several years now.\u00a0\u00a0I have been prescribed a number of medications for this which seem to work for awhile,\u00a0\u00a0BP creeps up, increase dose, works awhile, creeps up, get to max dose, change med to something else, then start over with the cycle again.When the facial tingling occured, I went to emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0By then the tingling had stopped, but they did an MRI with the following findings:Few scattered foci\u00a0\u00a0T2 prolongation\u00a0\u00a0periventicular white matter.\u00a0\u00a0No restricted diffusion, mass, mass effect or midline shift.\u00a0\u00a0No hydrocephalus or extra-axial collections. Patent intracranial flow voids. Paranasal sinuses, orbits mastoids normal.Impression:\u00a0\u00a0Minimal chronic ischemic white matter disease.\u00a0\u00a0No acute process.I don't know if there are areas of concern and no one gave me an interpretation.\u00a0\u00a0Any info would be appreciated.Thanks, Carol .",
