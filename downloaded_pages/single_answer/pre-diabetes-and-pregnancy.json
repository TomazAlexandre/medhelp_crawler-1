    "question": "I am pe-diabetic, I am on a diet for it. I am 5'4' tall and I weight 120lbs. After I had my daughter, who is now almost 3, my period has been right on the dot. I am now 4 days late and I took a home pregnancy test, the result was negative. Should I re-test. I check my sugar levels twice a day everyday and they are normal. I'm not under stress or anything irregular like that. Can I be pregnant?",
