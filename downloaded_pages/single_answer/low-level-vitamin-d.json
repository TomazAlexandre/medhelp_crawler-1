            "answer": "Hi. NO it does not mean you have cancer. It means you have low Vit D and high cholesterol! VERY common with any thyroid patient!!!I had Hurthle Cell adenoma so I know what you are going through.Did you doctor do the Free T3 and Free T4 tests as well. Only having a TSH test is not going to tell the whole picture if you medication is working or not. Most doctors like to keep the TSH down to under 1.0 when a person has had a cancer. But again without the other tests you won;t know if your medication is actually effective.I hope the doctor now has you on some Vit D supplements? You would find your calcium would be low if that was tested too, a Vit D is responsible for you body absorbing calcium, without it you will more than likely be low on calcium too.Having high blood sugar is something you need to discuss too, as that could be a warning of diabetes.Good luck.",
