            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!It is difficult to comment without examining. It is possible that you had a vasovagal attack or sudden low blood pressure. Another possibility is that it is a transient ischemic attack or TIA. Especially if you have predisposing factors to TIA like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc. Please get a prompt evaluation by your PCP.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
