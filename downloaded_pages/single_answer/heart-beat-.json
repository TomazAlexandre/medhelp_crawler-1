            "answer": "Hi,If you are concerned about your Husband's health, he should be seen by his Doctor. As he is a Diabetic and has High Blood Pressure, I assume he is on medication. Therefore I assume that a Doctor oversees his medication. If he is taking the medication, and his Diabetes (and Blood Pressure?) seems to be under control, your Husband must be concerned (willing to be responsible for) about his own health. No one on this group, including the Doctors, can diagnose a patient by a description of his/her problems. Your husband should be seen and be given tests appropriate to his symptoms and history. After that, it is likely that medication can be prescribed.As a side note, if your Husband is taking Diuretics for his Blood Pressure, some of the medication used for this reduces the Potassium in the blood, and the reduction of Potassium can cause irregular heart rhythms. Phone His Doctor and ask for advice about your Husband's condition.Wish you and your husband well.",
