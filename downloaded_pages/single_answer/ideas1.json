    "question": "Hi, I'm a 35yr old male 6'2\" 205lbs. About a month ago I started getting a weird taste in my mouth (sort of like a pill taste, maybe metallic not sure) I thought maybe allergies. Anyway a little over a week ago I started having numbness/ tingling in bottoms of both feet and fingertips of both hands. I went to primary and he ordered blood tests for vitamin deficiencies, zinc, lyme and thyroid problems. All these are normal with the exception of zinc which lab report just says \"test not performed\". My doctor also ordered MRI of head and sinuses, emg/vcl and eeg. I'm still waiting for these tests to be done. I thought maybe diabetes or my very bad back (lots of slipped discs L5 pressing on S1 nerve) but dr. said no to both. My questions are: what are these tests looking for? does this sound like MS?",
