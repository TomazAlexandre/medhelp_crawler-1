    "question": "My 7 month old Beagle, Deegan, recently started peeing in the house. He has been house broken for about 2 months now.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I have been traveling more often recently so Deegan is not getting 100% of our attention.\u00a0\u00a0Last night is when this all started.\u00a0\u00a0We were playing with Deegan but when we had to stop playing Deegan jumped on the sofa and peed.\u00a0\u00a0Later on when we went to bed Deegan wanted to get in bed with us.\u00a0\u00a0He always sleeps in his own bed that is right next to ours.\u00a0\u00a0I said \"no\" so Deegan went to his bed and peed in it. I took him outside immediately and he didn\u2019t have to go. So this morning while I was getting dressed to go to work I couldn\u2019t focus all of attention on Deegan.\u00a0\u00a0 The next thing I know he is peeing on the staircase.\u00a0\u00a0This was the third time in less then 24 hours!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0What is wrong with Deegan?\u00a0\u00a0It seems to be happening when we are not paying full attention to him or when we say NO.\u00a0\u00a0 What can we do to make this stop?",
