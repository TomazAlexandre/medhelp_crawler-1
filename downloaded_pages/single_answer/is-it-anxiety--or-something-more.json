    "question": "Hi everyone, I'm hoping I can somehow find some answer to all my problems. I've had an enormous range of symptoms over the last few years which have gotten worse, gotten better and stayed the same throughout an ever changing cycle. I'm 20 years of age, Male and I'm around 11 stones, and standing 5.3 feet tall.On a regular basis I get numbness down my left side, sometimes causing tingling in my left hand. Sometimes I also get a strange \"burning\" coming from my muscles in my ankles, calves and sometimes my left arm, neck and shoulder. I don't have very good coordination and I'm no good at all with balancing on one leg and closing my eyes.For most of my day I feel very fatigued and sometimes get panicky with palpitations that come and go. I find it hard to understand things and solve problems, and I don't know of this is to do with the fact I have ADHD for which I am taking 40mg per day of atomoxetine.I get extreme sweating all over my body on a daily basis, and I constantly feel a pressure in my head and neck, which feels like I've damaged my neck at some point.In 2010 I had a massive set of different scans, tests etc...I've had the following so far:Physiotherapy sessionsNeck X-raysNeck MRIsBrain MRIC-spine X-raysC-spine MRIFull blood testsDiabetes testsLiver function tests24 hour ECGNormal ECGEvery specialist and doctor I've been to has said there is no problem. All tests have come back clear and I really don't know what to do, it's really worrying me and makes me worse by worrying.Any help guys?",
