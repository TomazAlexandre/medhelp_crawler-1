            "answer": "It sounds like you are being held in a hypothyroid state rather than at your optimal hormone levels.If you have never been tested for antibodies the doctors have been lax in diagnosing you. If they failed there, they may not be very good at reading thyroid test results, either.The lab ranges for hormone tests are very broad, and so is the range for TSH. \"normal\" or \"within limits\" does not mean healthy.If you have copies of your tests, you could post the results and the lab limits. If you haven't been in the habit of getting copies of your tests, you might consider getting a copy in the future.Welcome to the forum.",

    "question": "I have had problems with my thyroid for more than 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0I was first diagnosed with an enlarged thyroid in 1995.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid levels were slightly on the hypo side.\u00a0\u00a0Endo found a number of nodules and performed FNA biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0Results were inconclusive.\u00a0\u00a0Due to difficulty swallowing, my dr. removed part of my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Pathology was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I was placed on synthroid to prevent further development of nodules.\u00a0\u00a0Several years later, more nodules were found.\u00a0\u00a0Again, biopsy was inconclusive and surgery was recommended.\u00a0\u00a0Entire left side removed.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I have had various problems that doctors have diagnosed as a variety of things:\u00a0\u00a0reynaud's syndrome; diabetes (which, after 3 yrs and new doctor was ruled out); lyme disease (even though tests were negative) and now fibromyalgia (even though I don't have the trigger point pain required).\u00a0\u00a0This has all been since the last surgery in 2003.\u00a0\u00a0I am cold all the time (despite living in Florida), my hair has been falling out, my skin is very dry, I am exhausted all the time, have brain fog and find it hard to concentrate, joint pain, difficulty sleeping, restless legs, anemia, slightly higher than normal cholesterol levels, weight gain/inability to lose weight, no energy/muscle weakness and, oddly enough, my knees crackle when I walk or stoop, lock up and ache.Hypothyroidism seems to run in my family: my mom, two aunts and now my 20 yr old daughter was diagnosed with Hashimoto's and insulin resistance.I have been to several doctors and they all say that since my thyroid levels are within the \"normal\" range, it isn't my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I wrote down everything so I wouldn't forget something and one doctor looked at the list and said \"Good God, you look pretty good for having all these problems!\" and then he laughed.\u00a0\u00a0To me it isn't funny.\u00a0\u00a0I had no problems whatsoever before my thyroid surgeries and now it is like I have been diagnosed with everything under the sun.\u00a0\u00a0I get plenty of sleep and eat very healthy foods.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabetes in my family (although my mother was falsely diagnosed as well when she was a child) to place me at risk of that.\u00a0\u00a0 My remaining thyroid is becoming more enlarged (I can feel it when I swallow and my husband reports frequent snoring/sleep apnea-type issues).\u00a0\u00a0I do have nodules on the remaining side which have been monitored.\u00a0\u00a0They are more numerous as time goes on.Could this be thyroid related?\u00a0\u00a0I have never been tested for Hashimoto's like my daughter.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be the cause?\u00a0\u00a0I an very frustrated by all of this and would just love to have answers.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
