    "question": "-Whenever I lie down to sleep I get this awful headrush thing, I can't exactly describe it but it feels like a lot of pressure on my skull, dizziness, extreme confusion, the same weird sensation I usually get before fainting, and I have this distinct certainty that I am about to die.-I am not sure if it's related, but it is very similar to these strange spells I've been having after eating; I thought it was dehydration for a while but drinking significantly more water for several days didn't help at all. Basically if I have anything sugary (soda, coffee, sweets, etc.) especially in liquid form I get incredibly dizzy and mildly confused when I stand up or try to walk, and I have to sit down and drink water before I'm well enough to move around. (I noticed that diet soda doesn't give me this sensation, though, it seems to be only legitimate sugar that affects me)-I have also been experiencing this sensation immediately after smoking.-I have also fainted a few times in the last couple weeks, and had varying degrees of nausea. At one point I didn't faint, but my vision went completely black and the ringing in my ears got so bad that I stopped being able to hear entirely; this didn't go away until I'd sat down for ten minutes.-I also have to use the restroom constantly; if I drink 1/3 of a water bottle for example, I'll have to urinate 3-6 times during the next hour.-I'm going to a doctor about this but can't see him for two weeks; basically I'm asking if anyone knows what could be causing these strange symptoms so I can bring those possibilities up with the doctor when I see him, or at least if anyone knows how to mitigate all of this. I am primarily concerned about the issue with sleeping; I've been having a lot of trouble in my classes lately because of the insomnia these weird feelings are giving me.Things that might or might not be important/related:-I smoke (0-15 cigarettes a day)-I am 19-I have bipolar disorder and PTSD-I am slightly underweight(Thank you for reading and hopefully replying; I'm really concerned about how to manage all this for the time being.)",
