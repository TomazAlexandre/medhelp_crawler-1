    "question": "I started experiencing a mild sensation in my palms and fingers ( mostly on the left side) about 8 months ago. I didn't pay much attention to them but they have become more frequent in the past 2 months. My occupation requires me to work on a computer constantly. I first thought this was the issue but i'm not so sure now. My feet are begining to have this mild sensation as well. I saw my Primary Care Doctor and he did all the blood tests that would be relevant to this and they were negative. He set up an appointment with a Neurlogist and I will see him on the 5th of August. The symptoms are very random, some days I don't have any symptons and other days may just be a breif occurance and they vanish. I have had a few times that the tingling was occompanied by mild aches in my forearms, clafs and ankles. Some weakness in legs with onset of tingling in feet, but still slight. I understand these symptoms have a wide range of possibilities. Any ideas before the appointment? Or what questions to ask at the appointment?",
