            "answer": "I think you are asking if you will have to have a C-section. The answer to that is no, it is not genetic weather you will have a C-section or not. It varies on womens bodies and of course how the baby is positioned and weather there is an emergency situation. My mom had to have a C-section because I refused to turn around and was trying to exit in a very ackward position, and I had a natural birth.\u00a0\u00a0A womens body is designed to streach and accommodate for a baby, even a large one like 9-10 lbs. It is really going to depend on your body and of course if there are any complications that call for a C-section.",

I am not pregnant as a point.My mother has polycystic ovaries and had a lot of complications with me.
