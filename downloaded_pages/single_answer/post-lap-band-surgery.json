    "question": "I'm concerned over my daughter in law's eating habits after her lap band surgery. She had numerous counselings prior to procedure & we were told she would not be able to drink carbonated beverages, eat sweets or pastas or breads. Since the surgery she says she has problems with eating protein foods as meat or foods that would be good for her. She will eat a small amount & then proceed to vomit up food in bathroom. She then eats ice cream, cake ,chips & dip, carbonated sodas,\u00a0\u00a0candy & so forth without any trouble. Today for instance she has had a large bowl of ice cream for breakfast , chips & dip & soda later & numerous chocolate candies. Thats all by noon. I thought eating sweets could make you diabetic after this surgery. She hasn't been back to her surgeon in 6 months or more. Is this ok or should we be worried? Thank you.",
