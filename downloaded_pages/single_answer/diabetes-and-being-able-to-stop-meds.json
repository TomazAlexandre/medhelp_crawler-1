    "question": "I am a 50 year old man and have been diabetic for 5 years now, I have also been diagnosed with hypertension about a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0When I was diagnosed I was 5'9\" and 180lbs. and in decent shape.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is rampant in my family with both my parents and half of my grandparents and plenty of my uncles and aunts are and were diabetic so I know genetics is a big factor here to.\u00a0\u00a0I have just started a diet and exercise regime where I'm eating less than a thousand calories a day( no starches, pasta or other high carb food only oats and lean meat and green veggies) and working out with weights for 1/2 hour the running for a half hour ( I can still bench 250 and run a 6 1/2min mile).\u00a0\u00a0My next A1c check is in June and I'm hoping that my A1c will be under 6 but half of this one will be before the diet started so I will be patient and also wait till the next and hopefully it will be closer to 5.5. I am on glyburide 5mg 2x a day and metformin 1000mg 2x a day and just started losartan 50mg once a day.\u00a0\u00a0Was taking lisinopril hctz 20-12.5 once daily but had some side effects that I didn't like.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if by doing this I could put my diabetes into remission like some of the participants in the Newcastle study did or if genetics might have me screwed.\u00a0\u00a0Has anybody else had any experience with being able to get off there meds with a lifestyle change.\u00a0\u00a0I know according to the charts I was overweight by about 12 lbs back then,I wasn't going to the gym at that time but I was far from a couch potato.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure what is causing my insulin resistance and hbp.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just very unhappy with how things have turned out.\u00a0\u00a0Turning 50 has caused me to rethink my thoughts on taking meds and winding up like my most of my relatives who take 10 or so meds daily.\u00a0\u00a0Three to me is three to many.\u00a0\u00a0I was hoping my biggest mid life crisis decision would be what type of sports car to buy not this.\u00a0\u00a0Any personal experiences with being able to get off meds or not would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
