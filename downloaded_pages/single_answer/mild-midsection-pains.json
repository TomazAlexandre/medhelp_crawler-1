            "answer": "Hi Jay,How are you doing?The abdominal cavity contains many internal organs.\u00a0\u00a0The part of the abdomen (epigastric-left upper quadrant of abdomen) you described contains the stomach, part of the liver, pancreas, spleen, part of the colon.\u00a0\u00a0So the pain could be coming from any of these organs, as well as the abdominal muscle itself.\u00a0\u00a0It could also be a referred type of pain originating from other source/s.As for the frequency in urination, most of the time, the initial urinalysis will already reveal the cause.\u00a0\u00a0If it turned out to be negative, I think there is a need to investigate further what caused the symptom.\u00a0\u00a0Again, there are a lot of causes for this symptom, ranging from urinary tract infection to systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus, or even an emotional etiology.It would be best to consult your doctor for reevaluation.Good luck.",

    "question": "What's up.OK, let's see, i'm not sure if this is the best place to post this and i know that nothing or some random really minor something could be casing these symptoms, but reading around on the internet i kept finding cancer as the worst case scenario cause, so i figured i might as well shoot for the top.Anyway, the issue is what i guess would best be described as mild, wandering midsection pains. Not constant, but they seem to visit me fairly consistently during the day, and more so at night. Excluding one time, where i was actually woken up by pretty intense pain in my stomach area (after a few minutes the pain would go away if i was sitting or standing up, but not if i was laying down, and i could feel it if i was moving), the pain has been really mild and it could mostly be massaged or stretched out if it didn't disappear almost immediately on it's own. I'd say it's mostly contained on my left midsection but not exclusively so. And lastly, since last night, a new symptom could be some very mild queasiness, but i don't know if the only reason i'm noticing that is because i'm just thinking about all this way too much or what.Oh, and I'm 19, if that's relevant.And i guess i should mention that about a month ago now i was experiencing very frequent urination, went to the doctor and got checked out, he didn't find anything wrong after an examination, the urine test came back clean and he sent me home with orders to see the family Dr if it persisted. A couple days later everything seemed back to normal and it's remained that way for the most part until now with a little more urination than usual like maybe 1 or 2 days here and there. Not sure if that's important but i figured i couldn't hurt to mention it.That's it i guess. Thanks.",
