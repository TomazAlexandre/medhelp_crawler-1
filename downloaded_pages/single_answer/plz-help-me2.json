    "question": "last week my father touched some food which belonged to some poultry and he saw a pigeon that seemed infected of bird flu. so he's so scared of being infected. and he doesn't want to see a doctor but he needs to know the famous symptoms of it and the period of the disease. I'm afraid about him cuz he has diabetes and blood pressure and he has phobia from death. so his condition becomes worse day after day cuz he read the symptoms on the internet and thought that he has most of them.",
