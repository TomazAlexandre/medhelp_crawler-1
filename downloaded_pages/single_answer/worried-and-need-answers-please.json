    "question": "Hello,Hi i'm a 25yr. hispanic female and its been going on five days that i feel this tingling half numbness feeling on my left hand. First what happened was that it was about 3:30 in the morning when I was awakened my a really Bad leg cramp on my left leg. These occur about twice every other year. And I have no idea why. But to me thats normal, what was abnormal was that I woke up with the tingling on my left hand. Its the left side of the hand, pinkey and ring finger. It's kind of scary and since I don't have any health insurance\u00a0\u00a0at this moment. Oh yeah I had a baby last year and while I was pregnant they found gestational diabetes and they put me on insulin. When my baby was born my diabetes went away. My family does have history of diabetes but I check my sugar often so I don't think this is why. Hopefully someone can help me and put me at ease. I've been reading some stuff that the numbness tingling symptons that I have can be this problem that can be fatal and that's so scary. Please help.... Thank You",
