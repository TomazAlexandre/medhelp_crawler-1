    "question": "My question is this...... Has anyone ever used Lipozene or Glucofast and had results? I just ordered some Lipozene (I never used before) but I have been doing some reading and see alot more positive about Glucofast (never used either). Has anyone tried these, any information would be very helpful. I am a 33 y/o mom of 3 girls and I am now 230 pounds, this is the most I have ever weighed and I am very upset over this. I work on average 50-55 hours per week and I am very active, on my feet all day but nothing seem to help me. Thank you for any input",
