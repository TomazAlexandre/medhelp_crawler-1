            "answer": "HiReally sorry to hear that.Yes, you are right. You do have a kidney problem (stones) as you are passing them and since there was blood too, maybe infection in urine. You need to see your urologist at the earliest and get some blood, stool and urine tests done.Also you need to rule out diabetes, thyroid problems and get your hormones and cholesterol tested. Maybe they are the reason you are not losing weight. Please get your blood pressure tested too. Low back pain can be due to pressure on your spine due to overweight or due to kidney involvement or infection in your pelvic area or urine.Consult your neurologist, gynecologist and general physician at the earliest.Let me know what your doctors say. If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries.",

    "question": "I am losing copious amounts of urine, bowel problems as well.\u00a0\u00a0I am gaining weight and am tired all the time. My level of comfort is a thing of the past.\u00a0\u00a0Even my skin hurts, joint pains, etc. I am 62 years old, female, overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I have back pain when I stand for more than 3-4 minutes to where I have to lean on something for support.\u00a0\u00a0Losing weight is obvious but haven't been able to accomplish that. I am concerned I have something more going on. I have pains in my right kidney frequently, urine is foul smelling and I've noticed some blood. I recently, last year, had lithotripsy for a large kidney stone.\u00a0\u00a0I have been passing several stones for some time.\u00a0\u00a0Wondering if I have kidney disease.\u00a0\u00a0What do you think?",
