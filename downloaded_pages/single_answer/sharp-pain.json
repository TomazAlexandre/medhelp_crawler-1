            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Your symptoms could be due to a number of causes. You could possibly be suffering from glove-and-stocking neuropathy or from Sjogren's Syndrome. Please consult a neurologist at the earliest. There are many causes of this nerve disorder including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc.Your condition could also be due to transverse myelitis (infection of spinal cord at a particular level) or due to spinal cord compression at higher cervical level.You need a comprehensive investigation taking all these points in consideration. Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
