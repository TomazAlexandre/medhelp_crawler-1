You may try calamine lotion on the bumps.You should also maintain hygiene and try to keep the area clean and dry, wear loose-fitting cotton clothing. Also use an antibacterial soap or mild soap like dove.Avoid any kind of cosmetics.You can also use a barrier cream with zinc oxide paste or a mild steroid cream like dermacort on the rash.Regarding the increase in frequency of urination at night,try not to drink any fluids 2 hrs before bedtime.If the symptoms still persist then pls get yourself evaluated for Diabetes, interstitial cystitis, interstitial\u00a0\u00a0nephritis,lupus,hypercalcemia,hyperthyroidism,hypopituitarism,hypoaldosteronism,hypokalemia,renal glycosuria,Addison\u2019s disease and polycythemia.Pls consult a urologist and get these possibilities ruled out.I hope that helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",
