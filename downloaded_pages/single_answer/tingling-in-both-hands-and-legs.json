            "answer": "Hi there.The symptoms and character of the pain that you have described may be neuropathic in nature.\u00a0\u00a0Neuropathic pain can indeed be caused by stress especially if all your work-ups turn out normal.\u00a0\u00a0Other possible causes includes micronutrient deficiency such as deficiency in the B vitamins (B1, B6, B12).\u00a0\u00a0Metabolic conditions such as diabetes can also present with this kind of symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that you relax and avoid stress as much as possible (though this may sound easier said than done) and have a balanced diet with possible supplementation of vitamins and minerals.Regards.",
