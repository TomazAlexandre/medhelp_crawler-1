    "question": "I am 32 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I had gestational diabetes and hypertension when i was pregnant with my fourth child who is now three.\u00a0\u00a0In March 2011 I found out that I have diabetes type II as well as hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0In June I went back for normal blood work and was told that my calcium was high.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know the number, but it was high enough that they admitted me in hospital for observation.\u00a0\u00a0At this time they took me off of almost all my meds to see if that was why my calcium was high.\u00a0\u00a0The meds were ruled out, so they did two chest x-rays and ruled out sarcoidosis.\u00a0\u00a0They took a bunch more labs and apparently found that my ACE levels were high as well.\u00a0\u00a0After checking my PTH 3 times finally ruled out a parathyroid problem.\u00a0\u00a0I have been sent to a hypertension specialist for my BP and am now seeing an Endocrinologist and still have not found out what is wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0I experience constipation on a regular basis and have to take stool softeners to aid with this.\u00a0\u00a0I am tired all of the time and sometimes have a hard time just getting off of the couch due to muscle weakness and pain.\u00a0\u00a0I am not in extreme pain but feel sore on a constant basis as if I have been training for a marathon or something.\u00a0\u00a0I have been experiencing headaches daily in all different parts of my head.\u00a0\u00a0I get dizzy easily\u00a0\u00a0and have to hold on to something for a moment to catch myself.\u00a0\u00a0My feet are extremely painful to stand or walk on.\u00a0\u00a0I know that I have to try to stay active and the best way for me to do that has been for me to park on the other side of campus so that I will have to walk to my class and back and to take the stairs instead of the elevator to the second floor.\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully I attend a small college and don't have too terribly far to walk.\u00a0\u00a0Grocery shopping is a chore and I have found myself sitting on the floor in the bread isle because I was so tired and hurting.\u00a0\u00a0My doctors won't come out and tell me I have cancer I guess because they don't know for sure yet but I am going crazy waiting to find out what is wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0All of my research has pretty much pointed toward cancer so is it safe to say I have cancer?\u00a0\u00a0That I am just waiting to find out which kind?\u00a0\u00a0Why is it taking so long to find out what is wrong with me?\u00a0\u00a0When will they start doing more than blood tests?\u00a0\u00a0I have been having blood test regularly since June.\u00a0\u00a0Isn't it time to look deeper?\u00a0\u00a0I am so stressed out.\u00a0\u00a0I am tired of crying and worrying.\u00a0\u00a0I have 4 children to take care of, I\u00a0\u00a0don't have time to be sick.\u00a0\u00a0Please, can someone give me some kind of advice, etc.Thanks",
