            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Neuropathic pain can be caused by a variety of issues such as nutritional and metabolic deficiencies, infection, hormonal issues, medical conditions like diabetes and even immunologic issues that could also lead to allergy symptoms. There are certain neuropathies that can develop quickly or slowly, and chronic forms can exhibit a pattern of alternating remission and relapse. Try to identify possible triggers for your allergic rhinitis and avoid them. At present, take your medications as prescribed, and if symptoms persists, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper management. Take care and do keep us posted.",
