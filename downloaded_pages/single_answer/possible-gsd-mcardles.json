            "answer": "It sounds like you may need further workup such as more specialized neuromuscular blood screening tests that include CK, aldolase, and for metabolic workup: ammonia, uric acid, and lactate at rest and after exercise as well as urine studies to look at myoglobin. Also, an EMG would be helpful if you do have a muscle disorder.TO answer your question, yes ketosis is present in some of the glycogen storage disorders, not McArdle's specifically, but some of the others. But also, if you are being overtreated with the diabetes meds, you can get an acquired glycogen disorder that would lead to your symptoms. You do need a neurologist to help guide you through the proper studies. Unfortunately, your current doc may have already made up his/her mind about you if they thought you had poor effort. Try to talk to them again. If you meet with resistance, you'll have to get your PCP and insurance company to let you have a second opinion. Best of luck.",

    "question": "I have had chronic leg pain/exercise intolerance and am curious about McArdle's as the source. I've only had one slightly elevated CK, but it has never been taken after exercise.\u00a0\u00a0My calves swell/get hard and painful when I walk, and my other muscles get tired if I use them repeatedly.\u00a0\u00a0A vascular problem has been ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know if McArdle's causes a chronic persistant elevation of blood ketones without Type I diabetes/starvation/low carb diet?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said he \"doesn't see how they can be connected\".\u00a0\u00a0I've had basic biochem and I see how they can be connected, but maybe I am wrong. I am a newly diagnosed mild Type II diabetic, and the ketones are higher when my blood sugars approach normal (I use the sticks and they go up to the darkest color).\u00a0\u00a0My endocrinologist did not believe the ketones/muscle pain are related to my diabetes.Also, (the same doctor) gave me an ischemic forearm test.\u00a0\u00a0There was no rise in serum lactate.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of further followup, he wrote on the report to my primary care physician that it was \"most likely due to lack of effort from the patient\".The nurse watched me and I squeezed as hard as I could (it was painful), so his interpretation of the results and his recommendation of no followup bothered me.I am just trying to find out if anyone else has heard of a connection between blood ketones and glycogen storage diseases?\u00a0\u00a0Should an abnormal test be ignored?\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to decide how to approach this neurologist about further testing (my insurance required me to go to this clinic).Thank-- Ashley",
