            "answer": "Sounds more like periodontial disease, however you may have Xerostomia.\u00a0\u00a0Xeriostomia is a lack of saliva, usually due to excessive medication use.\u00a0\u00a0It's extremely damaging to the teeth, often turning them yellow and more often causing destructive cavities to form.\u00a0\u00a0More often than not, teeth are lost as a result of this devastating condition.Your gums bleeding as much as they do is usually a sign of periodontal disease.\u00a0\u00a0IF this is left unchecked by a professional dentist you could ultimately lose some/all your teeth over time.\u00a0\u00a0Make an appointment with your regular general dentist or Periodontist, they can determine if this is the cause and how to get it under control, just remember it's like Diabetes, it can't be cured only controlled with proper professional dental care and education on your part.\u00a0\u00a0Sinusitis and nasal congestion can cause a funky smell in your mouth but usually that's it.\u00a0\u00a0See a dentist asap!",
