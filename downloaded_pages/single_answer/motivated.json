            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear that. Weight loss should make you more agile and alert. Probably you have lost too much weight or are anemic or have some other medical problem like diabetes. Please get this investigated. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
