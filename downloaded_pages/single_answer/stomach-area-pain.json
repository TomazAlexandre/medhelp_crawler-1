    "question": "I have diabetes type 2 for about 20 years. I have neuropathy problems. Right now I have pain coming from center right on back to front to almost my breast bone. It feels like nerve pain like I\"ve had before. It is starting to cause severe nausea and I don't like to even smell food. Could the nerve to the stomach be causeing this or could it be related to pancrease problems. If its the nerve to stomach what can be done. I have had x-rays and cat scans and nothing seems to be wrong on those.",
