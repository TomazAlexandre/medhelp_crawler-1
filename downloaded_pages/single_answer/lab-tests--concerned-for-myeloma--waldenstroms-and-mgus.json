            "answer": "Hi, infections and inflammations are the main reasons for increased protein levels. Just protein levels are non specific as all the antigens and the antibodies are proteins.\u00a0\u00a0But when in doubt\u00a0\u00a0serum protein electrophoresis would be more specific as it will show the different 'bands' of proteins and help distinguish the origin of the protein spike. Broad diffuse spikes indicate a more generalized infection or inflammation. More specifically if the M-spike is raised\u00a0\u00a0then it may be significant. Then again it depends on the levels of M spike if it greater than 3g/dl then it is likely to be multiple myeloma. If the levels are less than 1.5 then re evaluation at intervals is advised as a follow up. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance. Regards.",

I do have a referral to a rheumatologist the first week of November for the joint and muscle pain. What should I ask about at the rheum. - I'm beginning to think these may not be signs of just arthritis. I'm 38 and female.Tests were as follows:Elevated AST/SGOT 38Low Albumin: 3Elevated Protein: 8.7Low Creatinine: 0.19Low BUN: 6High Neut: 68.1High MPV:\u00a0\u00a013.4Low MCH:\u00a0\u00a026.9elevated ESR: 55No Rheum.
