            "answer": "Hi.Your symptoms seem to suggest a possible nerve compression or impingement which is causing the hand and finger twitches. A nerve impingement could be anywhere along the nerve path or could be secondary to disk herniation or vertebral malalignment compressing on the nerve root.However, other conditions that could possibly cause such symptoms cannot be ruled out at this point, including a shoulder injury, vitamin or mineral deficiency, diabetes, etc.You should have your symptoms assessed by a physician to determine whether there is indeed an underlying condition that has caused your symptoms.Good luck.",

    "question": "I am wondering if a trip to a neurologist is warranted. I have been experiencing shoulder pain, and from time to time, a general aching in the same arm.\u00a0\u00a0I had an x-ray last year that did not detect arthritis or anything else for that matter.\u00a0\u00a0Now over the past three weeks a muscle in my right hand has been twitching enough to move my middle finger back and forth for short periods of time in ever increasing times throughout the day. At first I thought the twitching would go away but now it seems as if it is getting worse and I am getting concerned.",
