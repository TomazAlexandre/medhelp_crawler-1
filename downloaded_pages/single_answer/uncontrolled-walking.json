    "question": "My Dad was bed-ridden for 5-6 months last year because of severe pain in his legs. All his investigations were normal including the CT scan & MRI. Diabetes was also ruled out. The doctors could not diagnose his condition and told it might be because of his spinal nerves being compressed. After taking some herbal medicines, the pain was much better and he was able to walk again slowly, first with support & then without support. He goes for morning walks everyday & usually takes 5 rounds\u00a0\u00a0with rest-stops in between in a local garden. This is his routine since last 4 months now. But, today morning, he did not pause after the first 2 rounds & decided to complete 5 rounds in one stretch. When he completed his 5th round & wanted to stop walking, he could not control his leg movements & infact walked faster than his usual speed until he fell down. Then with support from others, he was able to get up and walk back home. This never happened before, so I told him to avoid going out for walks for a few days & to walk inside the house & observe. Any suggestions?",
