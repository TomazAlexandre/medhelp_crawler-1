            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include nerve related conditions such as compressive neuropathy, neurofibromatosis, diabetes related neuropathy, a few auto-immune conditions, psychological causes, hormonal/ endocrine causes, electrolyte imbalance, micronutrient deficiencies, metabolic causes etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an internist or a neurologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "i'm 49yr old male...Type 2 Diabetic, with anxiety. i have this wierd nerve feelings. BUT, these \"sensations\"\u00a0\u00a0occurring for almost 25 years......i wentto my doctor back then and he told me i had a irratated nerve. It's not really pain. and it seems to run from my eye to my foot. (also i'm a above the left knee amputee). not related to diabetes. (accident when i was 15yr of age.but back to my nerve. it comes and goes...and it seems to feel better when i massage the spot where it bothers me...... sometimes it relieves the aching when i rub my eye or try to pop my neck.......or sometimes i have to rub the outside of my leg between my ankle and knee. or rub betweeen knee and upper hip on the outside of my \"good\" leg (right). also rubbing the back of my neck and head (right side) relieves the \"sensation\"..\u00a0\u00a0once again when i say \"sensation\", its not exactly pain, but maybe a dull ache. its almost always on my right side, but i have also experience some pain on my left side.i recently had a massage. and the woman who gave me a massage told me i had a knot on my left side of upper back. she dug her hands and put alot of pressure with her elbow......and when she finished i had a pain in my left arm between my elbow and wrist. it was like a straight line of pain that felt better when i rubbed the area....it actually felt better when i stretched it.\u00a0\u00a0( i extended my left arm, picked up my left hand and pulled my left hand and fingers back with my right hand.i dont know if these are nerves or what it is....... i also have a bone spur on my right foot, big toe. the doctor said\u00a0\u00a0there was no cartliage between where i been my big toe........sometimes my foot gets numb and a shooting burning pain shoots through my foot. ive had this spur for a long time. probably close to 5 years. and the doctor told me its compressing against a nerve that is causes pain throughout my foot. so i dont know if the pain/numbness is from the spur or diabetes.......i'm on medication and my AC1 was at 7, when i got my blood work results last week.........",
