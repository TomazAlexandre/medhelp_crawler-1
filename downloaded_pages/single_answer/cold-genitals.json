            "answer": "Hello,Charcot marie tooth syndrome is characterized by degeneration of the motor and sensory nerves that control movement and feeling in the arm below the elbow and in the leg below the knee.Erection problem seems unconcerned with it.However various other causes can be attributed to difficulty in maintaining erection. Common causes causing erection problem are stress and anxiety,poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, which make sex a task rather than a pleasure,negative feelings about non performance,smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord injury, nerve damage (for example, from prostate surgery), or neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease).I feel that an evaluation by a urologist will be the best.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
