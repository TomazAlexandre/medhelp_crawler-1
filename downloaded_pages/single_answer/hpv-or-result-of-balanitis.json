            "answer": "balanitis is almost always caused by yeast build-up or bacteria on the foreskin. it is usually an easy fix. it can also be caused by chronic problems such as diabetes,exema,and psoriasis. using soap or body wash with too many dyes or perfumes can cause an allergic reaction which can also cause balanitis. most of these events are usually one time problems and are solved with ointments or meds provided by your doctor. however,for men who suffer chronic repeated balanitis,research has been done to see if there may be viral causes,such as HPV. while there have been no accepted conclussive results indicating HPV as a catalyst,skin samples taken from chronic sufferers seem to indicate a link to viral components from type 6 HPV virus. which ever is your case,it rarely gets better without some kind of medical treatment. see your doctor for antibiotics,anti-fungals,or steroids.",

    "question": "Hi, about 8 months ago me and my current partner started having unprotected sex. As she was my first sexual partner i knew i was clean so felt ok about it. however frequently after sex i had little red dots on my penis that disappeared very quickly. this stopped happening after the first 3 or 4 months. 6 months after i hada very strong red rash on my penis with only a mild itch. this went away on its own - but a month later i developed lines on my penis raised. one set of lines have stayed same and are very tiny, however the other raised area has got a litte worse. it kinda looks like a scar. the lesions are long and thin with a scaly surface. is this a result of balanitis or damage to penis or does it sound like hpv that has teaken 7 months to show symptoms. please help me.",
