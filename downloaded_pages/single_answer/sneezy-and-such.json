    "question": "our dog recently had trouble breathing for about a 30 second span.\u00a0\u00a0He was sitting next to us and suddenly started breathing heavily only through his nose and making loud snorting noises.\u00a0\u00a0We thought he was having a heart attack or a stroke.\u00a0\u00a0I had him lay down and after this episode, he was fine, but shaken up.\u00a0\u00a0He also sneezes alot and occasionally, while sleeping, will overheat and pant upon awakening, or if asleep, will have rapid breathing through the nose.\u00a0\u00a0He has also had an occasional runny (clear) nose and discharge from right eye (which seems to be gone today). He has diabetes, is on 17 units of insulin 2x per day, and is a bit overweight.\u00a0\u00a0He gets tired easily while playing at the dog park. any ideas of what may be going on with our friend?\u00a0\u00a0thank you, in advance.",
