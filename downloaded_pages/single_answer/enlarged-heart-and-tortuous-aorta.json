            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.An enlarged heart can occur due to high blood pressure or cardiac failure. The tortuous aorta could be due to atherosclerosis, a disease where the 'fatty' material in the blood gets deposited in the walls of the blood vessels. Certain conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking and sedentary lifestyle promote this. Liver enlargement can occur with cardiac failure. The other causes could be due to hepatitis or blood disorders.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "During a recent test for TB, my 59 year old mother was told her \"heart appeared enlarged and the aorta appears tortuous\".\u00a0\u00a0She has had liver swelling in the past and high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0All of those symptoms have been gone for the last 1 1/2 years and her liver panels are normal, her blood pressure is normal and she is not on any medication at this time.\u00a0\u00a0Is this related at all to her previous liver problems or would past high blood pressure cause this?\u00a0\u00a0Is an enlarged heart with low blood pressure normal?\u00a0\u00a0Any information or suggestions would be appreciated.",
