    "question": "My dad has been tired for approx. a year. He has diabetes, is not too active and has always been overweight by about 40 to 70 lbs. Recently he had an episode and passed out while walking the dog. He hadn't walked the dog in quite awhile, went further than normal and hadn't eaten a thing. when he started feeling bad, he was 2 blocks away, so he tried desperately to get home. I feel that he started panicking, hyperventilating, which led to him passing out. I feel that this was an isolated incidence. However his doctor is really digging trying to find the cause for his fatigue. All blood work, and testing has come back normal. His sugar is checked every morning and is also good. He recently had an mri of the neck and head. They found that the spine is closing on 2 of the \"c\" vertebrae. He has no symptoms associated with this. No head aches, no numbness in arms or legs, no neck pain. I realize that if he has an accident and trauma to the neck he could have serious problems, but do you think this is why the fatigue? Would surgery help? Does this cut oxygen to the brain? I just think that they are jumping into this, I know a few people who have had surgery to back and neck and the recovery is long term. Also depression it present in his family, which I feel is another factor.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a medical expert, and just think that they are not getting the proper information. I was also present when the mri was reviewed by he primary physician and she stated when she read it as normal deterioration in the spinal column for a man of 73 and felt it didn't warrant surgery, however, she was not a neurologist and should see what he had to say. any input of yours will be greatly appreciated.Thanks",
