            "answer": "As you've mentioned and already know, you are pushing your liver pretty hard by adding alcohol on top of your already chronic fatty liver disease. Fortunately you're able to resolve both problems yourself, by working closely with your doctor in developing a proper treatment and monitoring therapy. And getting your diet under control will likely benifit your diabetes problem as well.Fatty liver disease can be resolved fairly quickly. Sometimes in as little as six months. But it takes real doetary change and a commitment to exercise as well. That's why you should be working with your doctor, given your other systemic issues.As far as the hep tests, I would get it done just to be certain that there isn't any other underlying diseases that haven't been addressed yet. Then you can move forward into a new healthy lifestyle. Take care.",
