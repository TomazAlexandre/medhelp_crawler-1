            "answer": "As you know we are not medical professionals on this forum but volunteers with experience in either living with or caring for someone with diabetes.First of, let me congratulate you on keeping your three month glucose levels normal! I know what a challenge that is. I've been diabetic for about 11 years now and I can tell you I understand how you feel. My levels are also generally normal but I too get jittery sometimes when my sugars are in a normal range, 80-90. In talking to my endocrinologist,\u00a0\u00a0as well as reading about the subject, I found that the body does in fact become less tolerant to normal glucose levels, especially if the sugars were not well-controlled for a period of time. I also believe there is a psychological factor to it. As diabetics, we tend to be more sensitive about how we feel all the time and worried about our glucose levels. I know I'm usually anxious, especially when I'm not home, or I'm in an environment in which I may not have access to medications or food if I need it ,and I have to admit, at times in these situations I would rather knowingly run higher than be under 100 (which is after all still a normal glucose level). So I think sometimes it's our underlying fear of hypoglycemia that makes our body react in this way to normal glucose levels. But, like I said before, it is also true that, after living with diabetes for a while, our bodies will adjust more to the slightly higher glucose levels and consider them \"normal\", since we usually tend to run higher than a non-diabetic person.I am also wondering about the fact that you say this happens at the same time each day. This may mean you might need your basal rates adjusted. Are you on an insulin pump? When I first started on it I noticed I was getting low around the time I would leave work everyday and would worry about hypoglycemia on the way home. Doing a basal rate test (when you fast at different times throught a day -on different days) helps to determine if your basal rates are set correctly. Please talk to your endocrinologist about checking that out. This may also be helpful in determinig what happens to your glucose levels at night and why you say your fasting range has gone up. Sometimes basal rates need to be re-checked and adjusted as they don't always work the same. Even a slight change in your lifestyle may have an impact on the shift in glucose levels you have been experiencing.Please check with your doctor and good luck!",

    "question": "tks very much for the followup post. I have a main qiestion/concern. I tend to get nervous or jittery when my blood glucose levels get to 88 - 95 range moree so at the 90 range i start to feel anxious, shaky legs etc ... almost hypoglycemic. My three month levels are normal but my fasting has gone up to 110 range. I am 40, male, not overweight although could loose 5 lbs but thats about it.Question: is my body becoming intolerant to low or what I deem normal glucose levels? Is this hypoglycemia? What is this? Always happens at the same time each today around mid afternoon.Pls explain- thanks",
