    "question": "Hey i have been told by the Dr that i might be developing type 1 diabetes... do i need a script in New Zealand to get insulin, or can i get it over the counter?? i want to get some just in case anything happens, and it will give my mum some comfort as well, but the Dr said to just wait and see what it turns into because it might not be diabetes... i am very confused at the moment and very very concerned about this as someone in my family (although they were very extended) died of diabetes. I just want to be safe rather than sorry and have to rush off to the emergency room and also it would give me some peace of mind that if something did happen i wouldnt have all my friends and family freaking out about me. Oh and if i can get it over the counter, what should i ask for and what cost am i looking at?",
