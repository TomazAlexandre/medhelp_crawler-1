            "answer": "HiApart from lingering infection, diabetes is the most important cause for a wound not healing. First you need to get your blood tested for diabetes both fasting and 2 hours after meal. If this is normal, then a surgeon or skin specialist should be consulted. If the report is not ok then your physician will help you with medication. Maybe you will need to undergo a biopsy of the wound, at the end.Hope this helps. If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries. Please keep me posted.",

    "question": "I had a small cut on my head that started out small and now is the size of a quarter. It has not healed in over year of putting neosporine on it. It seemed to have gotten better about six months ago but since then it just does not seem to get any better. A friend of mine said it was because I should have gotten a couple of stitches when I originally bumped it. Anything I can do?",
