    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with mitochondrial disorder/dysfunction. To be specific disorder of mitochondrial metabolism. My dr said that I do not have a mitochondrial disease but instead dysfunction. What is the difference between the two? In addition he said they were sending my biopsy to do additional genetic testing. What are they looking for? Are there different types of mitochondrial dysfunction? I have been sick for over a year with chronic headaches, muscle/body pain, exercise intolerance, fatigue, and gi issues. They dx me through the biopsy, emg, and a urine organic analysis. They just started me on l-carnitine, alpha lipoic acid, coenzyme q10, vit C, multi-vitamin, and b-complex. Your help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks",
