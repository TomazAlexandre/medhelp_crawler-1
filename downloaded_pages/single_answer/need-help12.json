            "answer": "Hi Ninja27!I've had the same symptoms as you: shaky (tremors in hands and body), anxiety, body aches, twitches, insomnia.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors ruled out thyroid, ms, Parkinson, diabetes and low vitamin b deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0i was feeling really crappy, so I took matters into my own hands.\u00a0\u00a0Magnesium deficiency is what I came up with, and it's hard to detect if you're deficient, so doctors don't test for it. I've been taking magnesium supplements, and mag oil for a few days now, and though I'm not 100% okay, I can tell you I definitely feel better.\u00a0\u00a0Try magnesium, it really helped me so far.",

    "question": "Hi guys, its been over 2 months without any improvement of feeling like crap, constant dizzyness nausea on and off! Eye twitches, headaches, tiredness, body shakes, none of these symptoms have improved, I'm giving up hope! I've been to doctors without them knowing what's wrong with me. I've had ct scan which was fine. Ecg scan fine andnbloodbtest came back all fine. I also have an irritating throat but it not sore it feels like a lump. Heavy breathing that sometimes goes shallow. I'm worried that thus isn't anxiety :( my doctor put me on lazapram for no improvement in my health! I been taking them for 6 weeks now! I am scared of maybe it being cancer or some major illness! :(",
