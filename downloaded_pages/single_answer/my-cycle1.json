            "answer": "Hi!If you want to start birth control and you are overweight, and your cycles are irregular, then please consult a gynecologist to rule out hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary and diabetes. Adrenal gland problems and severe anemia are the other possibilities. Please discuss this with your mother and consult your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
