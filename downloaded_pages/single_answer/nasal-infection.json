            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Looks like the infection\u00a0\u00a0is spreading. For it to heal the diabetes needs to be controlled and antibiotic coverage needs to be adequate. If there is an abscess it needs to be completely drained. Also, have a culture and sensitivity test done to find out the correct antibiotic that the infecting organism is sensitive to and taking this medication for the required amount of days may help to clear infection.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
