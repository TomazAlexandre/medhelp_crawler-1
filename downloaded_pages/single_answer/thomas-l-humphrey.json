            "answer": "Upper left abdominal area symptoms usually stem from the large intestine.\u00a0\u00a0Are you having any intestinal symptoms - increased gas, pain, change in bowel habits?\u00a0\u00a0Is it sore when you push on the area?As for the diabetes, did your neuropathy just start recently?\u00a0\u00a0If it were me, I would talk to my doctor about starting a low carbohydrate diet (if you are type 2 diabetic).\u00a0\u00a0If you are on insulin, you MUST tell your doctor if you want to do the low carb diet - they have to adjust your insulin according to your diet.\u00a0\u00a0When you eat a low carbohydrate diet, you don't need much insulin from your pancreas to help with blood sugar elevations, because your blood sugar should stay pretty level on this diet.I've mentioned to several diabetics I know to try the gluten free diet (gluten is in wheat, barley, rye and possibly oats) for their neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0At first, their neuropathy hurt more.\u00a0\u00a0But it improved with time.\u00a0\u00a0They were amazed!I hate to see diabetics rely on medications to control their symptoms, especially for the neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe, if you'd like, read up on the gluten free diet and see if you'd like to give it a try.\u00a0\u00a0You might find that your \"swelling\" feeling goes away on the above diets.I hope this helps or someone is able to help you.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there.",
