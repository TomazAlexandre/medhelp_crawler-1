            "answer": "Hello,It is best to seek medical advice before taking any medication and deciding the duration of therapy. The management of Bells palsy aims to speed recovery and to prevent corneal complications. Physical therapy, corticosteroids and antiviral agents (if needed) form the mainstay of treatment. Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory action which minimizes nerve damage and improves the outcome. About 70% of patients with Bell's palsy have motor function recovery completely within 6 months without treatment and by 6 months all patients with Bell's palsy usually show some improvement. Presence of old age, impairment of taste, complete facial weakness, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are associated with poor prognosis. Regarding the duration of therapy a clinical examination is must before taking the decision. Do keep me posted.Best wishes and luck!",
