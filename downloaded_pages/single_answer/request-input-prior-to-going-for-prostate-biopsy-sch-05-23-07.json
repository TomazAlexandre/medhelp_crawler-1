            "answer": "Given your kind of family history of prostate cancer (father), it may have been advisable to get a scereening done.When a PSA is done as a screening tool it is done to detect an abnormality. Having done it- it is reasonable to follow it through with the course suggested by your urologist.Biopsy has its risks, but obviously is being done with the aim of picking up something, the benefit of which will be more than the risks. Re-biopsy if required later can be done, and generally is not much harder.",

    "question": "This is a follow-up question to my previous post. Previously I had not seen a Urologist, but just saw one on 05/15/07. My vital statistics and hx are as follows: Age: 38; Sex: Male; Ht: 5' 5\"; Wt: 162 lbs; Father: recently passed away at the age of 73 2ndry Prostate Cancer which got metastasized and as a result he had bone cancer as well; Mother: has diabetes and previously has had benign tumor removed; Older Brother: Healthy; Race: Asian-Indian.On 04/23/07 as part of routine check-up had blood test done and the results indicated PSA level of 3.5, subsequent to this at the request of my doctor had lab work done for FreePSA on 05/04/07, and results were as follows: PSA level: 3.68 and based on some some chart scoring had a value of 8 indicative that I probably have a 24% chance of having prostate cancer.Visited Urologist on 05/16/07 and was advised PSA level of 3.68 is not much relevant unless the Free PSA value was between 4 to 10. The urologist also showed me a chart stating for Asians even though 38 is not an age group on the chart as it begins from 40, the normal value range is 0-2. A Digital Rectum Exam was conducted and I was advised it felt normal; however; the Urologist still recommended a Biopsy.My concerns are:1) Would you agree with the conclusion to proceed with a biopsy? 2) Since I am having my biopsy at a young age of 38, will it impact the prostate in terms of scar tissue formation that subsequent biopsy attempts may be harder?3) Does the prostate regenerate tissue following a biopsy?4) Any complications or signs I should be prepared for or be on the look out for post biopsy.5) How long does it take to heal from the biopsy and what to avoid during the healing period?6) If biopsy is negative - what kind of future follow-up would be prduent course of action?Given the above I would just like an independent opinion of another doctor from this forum. I am just slightly hesitant to get myself sliced and diced if it is not necessary. Of course, I do believe in prevention and pro-active approach, and I do understand the tissue sample is microscopic in nature.I understand without the benefit of examining me and/or looking at the lab results first hand it would be hard to provide an accurate opinion. Never the less, if you could please provide your feedback and analysis I would greatly appreciate it.I thank you in advance for your assistance and look forward to your feedback.Sincerely, Concerned Patient",
