            "answer": "Hi.It would appear that you are experiencing erectile dysfunction (ED) which is the inability to achieve/maintain an erection.About a third of men over 50 years complain of some degree of erectile dysfunction. ED may be caused by disturbances in the brain and nervous system, the arteries/veins in the penis, and the penile spongy tissues.Are you currently taking some medications? Some medications such as those for hypertension and hypercholesterelemia may have a negative effect on erection.Other conditions that may be associated with ED include hypertension, diabetes and Peyronie's disease. However, in Peyronie's disease, there is initially\u00a0\u00a0painful erection secondary to the bent penis. Excessive intake of alcohol and drug abuse are other known causes. Also, psychological factors may play a significant role in the etiology of ED.Treatment of ED can be as simple as counseling and it may be of benefit\u00a0\u00a0in relationship issues that could be causing the ED. Some medications can be given if the underlying medical problem causing the ED is identified. Surgery is usually a last option.You should have a urologist evaluate your condition so that proper management can be instituted.Good luck.",
