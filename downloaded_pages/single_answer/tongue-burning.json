            "answer": "Hi!Menopause and hormonal imbalance can cause burning tongue syndrome and it is often refractory to any hormone replacement therapy. Antidepressants and antianxiety drugs such as nortryptiline and clonazepam are found to treat such burning tongue or burning mouth syndromes caused by menopause. One thing that I can think of is a Vit B 12 deficiency. You may not have any other symptom of Vit B12 deficiency if it is in its initial stage. Iron deficiency and Vit B6 or pyridoxine deficiency may also be associated. The other possibility is allergy to some food preservative or to propylene glycol which is found in some food items, drugs and cosmetics. Maybe your dental paste has it. Check this out. I can see that you have been testing for allergies by food elimination, but this alone may not be helpful. You may still need to take an allergy test and see. Possibility of any drugs causing it or dry mouth, oral cancer, damage to the lingual nerve, and diabetes are the other causes for a burning tongue and if nothing else is found these should be explored. It can also be gastric reflux. I hope this helps narrow down the cause and treat your problem.\u00a0\u00a0Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
