            "answer": "I am sorry but I do not recommend weight loss pills due to medical side effects. That is great you are going to the gym 3-5 times a week. Muscle weights more then fat. Do not use the weight scale because as you build lean body muscle mass it will not show you are losing weight. Use a measuring tape and measure your bust, waist, and hips for trimmer waist and hips. Your clothes are a great indication that your getting trimmer and not the scale.",

    "question": "Why is lipodrene bad for people with a history of diabetes? I can't find out anywhere and I want to know! My mother had adult onset diabetes as well as my grandfather, but I want to take lipodrene. How bad would it be if I did it anyways? I'm 21, healthy, and work out 3-5 times a week but I'm not getting the results I want. Will someone please help me out on this one??",
