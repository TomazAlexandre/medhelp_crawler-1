            "answer": "Hi!If you are not in menopausal age group, then it could be due to hormone imbalance or PCOD. You would need to consult your gynecologist regarding this. Hormone replacement therapy usually helps. Alcohol, certain drugs, allergy to food additives, heat intolerance, hot beverages and food, anxiety, orthostatic hypotension, certain endocrine disorders like hyperthyroidism, those involving the adrenals, diabetes etc all cause facial flushing. If there is a flush only during the day and after sports then it could be heat sensitivity. Apply cold compress on and off during the day. Splash a lot of cold water (not freezing cold but cool) on face on and off. See if this helps.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor/gynecologist regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
