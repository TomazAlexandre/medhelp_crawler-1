            "answer": "Nearly 6 wks ago I gave birth to my first child, Charlotte Grace. She was taken from the hospital I delivered her at and taken to our capital city,s major childrens hospital. Charlie has been home twice and had to be re-admitted to hospital. eventually Charlie was given an mri scan\u00a0\u00a0which indicated admormatities in\u00a0\u00a0certain areas of her brain. Of course I was devastated but told there was no syndrom or diagnosis, we should just wait and see. One week later charlie was admitted again and after 2 wks in hospital diagnosed initially with Diabetes Insifidus and now Multiple Pituatqary Gland Disorder. She also needs twice daily doses of throxine, decom and another drug which is a replacement of t hormone produced by the pituatry gland. I feel very strongly that not only do I need further information on her condition but perhaps be recomended to support groups for children with this condition.",

    "question": "Hello,\u00a0\u00a0I am a 35 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0I got diagnosed with a 3mm pituatary gland tumor a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have been lactating for about a year and a half.\u00a0\u00a0In general I don't feel very good fituge.\u00a0\u00a0My concentration is so bad and also memory is too.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to 2 specialist in the last year.\u00a0\u00a0And both say that my Prolacten levels are fine and they also did a run of test on other hormones and all come back ok.\u00a0\u00a0So they are not going to treat it.\u00a0\u00a0They told me if they stopped 100 people walking down the road that 25 of those people would have what I have and not cause any problem.\u00a0\u00a0But as far as I am concerned I do have problems.\u00a0\u00a0My menstrual cycle is messed up but I have an ovarian cyst which is going to be operated on in 4 days.\u00a0\u00a0The lining of my uters is 25mm.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, is this normal treatment just to do nothing?\u00a0\u00a0And also could the pituatary gland tumor be causing the ovarian cyst and uters lining to be thick?\u00a0\u00a0It all sounds so hormonal.",
