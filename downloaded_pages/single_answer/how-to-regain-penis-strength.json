            "answer": "Hello,Masturbation has no permanent effect on the size of the penis and the srotum. If a man gets erected, his penis will fill with blood and grow in size. Impotence can be due to physical, psychological causes or a combination of both. Physical impotence can be due to an imperfect blood supply to the penis, an age-related loss of male sex hormones, diabetes or high blood sugar levels, medical drugs, or various neurological conditions. Psychological factors like lack of confidence, desire, depression, or fear of failure can cause impotence. Seeking the opinion of a physician and a counselor may be helpful. Keep me posted.Take care and regards!",
