I have contined to havesevere low back pain and left leg pain.\u00a0\u00a0The MRI shows degenerativedisc disease at that location.\u00a0\u00a0Have had numerous injections, therapy,with no success. Now using a back brace. My neurosurgeon said if thebrace helps considerbly, then he propably would do a spinal fusion.The brace helped reduce the pain, but you can't wear it all the time.One of my problems is that I have a right leg fusion(doesn't bend) andthe limp puts tremendous stress on the back. Would you give me youropinion and explain about a spinal fusion.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I am a insulin dependentdiabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Would this be a big problem concerning infection and healingafter the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is unbearable, and medications are no longerworking.\u00a0\u00a0I'm leaning toward the fusion.Thank you for your comments and help..",
