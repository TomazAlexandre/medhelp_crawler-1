    "question": "I was just diagnosed with type II diabetes. I have been taking 500mg of metformin 2X a day. I took my medicine this morning at 10am. I felt thirsty and had dry mouth about an hour afterwards. At 12:30pm I took a glucose reading. It was 149 mg and I had nothing to eat prior to that. Is my blood sugar high? Do I need to go back to the doctor and have him up my metformin? I don't want to be like this and I am worried sick about it. Please advise. Thank you in advance.",
