            "answer": "First off I think the diabetic diet is a good one for everyone to follow, well balanced and good portions.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diabetic for 25 years and have two children.\u00a0\u00a0I had worries like yours about my children getting diabetes too.\u00a0\u00a0So far so good, no signs or symptoms of either child getting diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0There is no one else in my family with the disease.\u00a0\u00a0I am not an expert on genetics or if your son is more susceptable or not of getting diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am also no expert on gestational diabetes either.\u00a0\u00a0You could ask your doctor for advice-I assume you go to an endocronologist.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your son's pediatrician.\u00a0\u00a0You could go on-line and look for info-but be careful sometimes sites are only advertisements-I like JDRF.org or American Diabetes Association has some good stuff too.I also think you are doing a good job by being a good example of a healthy person-eating right--I assume you keep active and introduce your son to a variety of activities too. Exercise is also key to maintaining good control of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I walk everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I take my kids to the park, we play and I teach them how to swim, play sports.\u00a0\u00a0I love to be active and they love it too.If you keep up the good work and provide a good solid example of a well balanced healthy person your child will probably inherit your good habits too. I try not to worry too much about things I don't have control of but the things I can control I do the best I can.\u00a0\u00a0And I am trying to make sure I introduce more healthy choices in my own diet and my kids' diets too!",
