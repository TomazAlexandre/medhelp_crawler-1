            "answer": "Hello,It looks like recurrent boils and abscesses to me. Taking incomplete treatment and alcohol consumption while on antibiotics may have contributed. It is best to get this watery discharge cultured so that any sort of infection like bacterial infection is ruled out. Get a culture sensitivity of the discharge done and then start with those particular antibiotics which are sensitive to the infecting organism.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
