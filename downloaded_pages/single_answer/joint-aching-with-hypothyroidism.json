    "question": "I am a 25 year old female. I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism. I am on 125mcg and I have started experiencing joint aching in my hands, legs, and feet. I'm wondering what is causing this. It is so bad I have to take Advil before I can sleep at night. Also, since I was put on a higher dose of meds, I have started to swell in my hands and ankles. I asked my doctor and he told me he didnt think it was the medication, but all of this started when he switched my dosage from 100mcg to 125mcg. Now he is sending me to a diabetic doctor--I do not have diabetes. My sugar was checked recently and it was 108.",
