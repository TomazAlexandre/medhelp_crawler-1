            "answer": "Hi!The average statistical figures vary with geographic local and genetic descent but teens either suffering from or having a family history of obesity, heart diseases, and diabetes are at a very high risk for developing hypertension requiring treatment. Also teens who lead a stressful life, smoke or drink or lead a sedentary lifestyle are more likely to develop hypertension. All I can say is that there is\u00a0\u00a0a remarkable rise in teen hypertension needing medical intervention. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
