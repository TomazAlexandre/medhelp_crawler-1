    "question": "I have had this for going on 11 years now. In 2002 I had radiation to kill my thyroid to this day I still have my medication adjusted about every 6 months. I get sick very easily, I get so tired and worn down. If my thyroid levels become off I seem to retain water badly with major edema, my hair starts falling out, I also seem to now be getting extremely dry skin on about the first inch of my scalp under my hair. Is there anything else that I can do to help all of this. I feel like I am always sick and tired and I am sick and tired of being sick and tired.",
