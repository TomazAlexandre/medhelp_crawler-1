            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.You have a constellation of symptoms that are nonspecific. Since your chiropractor mentioned a neuropathy (i.e., nerve injury), I will elaborate on that.There are two types of sensory nerves in the body \u2013 large and small fibers. With small fiber neuropathies, symptoms include burning or buzzing or other vague symptoms starting in the feet and hands then in some cases spreading to other parts of the body. An EMG/nerve conduction studies (NCS) (tests done to check for neuropathy) will not show an abnormality, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a skin biopsy so that the number of nerve endings can literally be counted. There are other tests of the function of small nerves that can be ordered, such as QSART testing which looks at how much sweat the skin makes, since sweating is in a sense of function of these small nerves. There are several causes of small fiber neuropathy, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and autoimmune problems.The other type of sensory neuropathy is called a large fiber neuropathy. There are several categories of this type of neuropathy, and there are many many causes. Sensory neuropathies can involve just one nerve or several nerves in the body. The symptoms are sensory loss and weakness if motor nerves are involved (which can cause gait problems). Some types of sensory neuropathies occur and progress very slowly, others sort of wax and wane (with flare-ups) and some are progressive. One of the most common causes of neuropathy is diabetes, and sometimes only glucose intolerances, or abnormal rises in blood sugar after a glucose load can be the only indication (this is called a oral glucose tolerance test. Other causes include but are not limited to hereditary/genetic causes (such as in a disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth, in which there is a family history of sensory neuropathy usually from an early age associated with other clinical features such as high-arched feet), autoimmune problems (such as lupus (SLE), Sjogren's, Churg-Strauss (in which asthma also occurs), polyarteritis nodosa, which affects blood vessels), and demyelinating diseases (such as CIDP). Vitamin B12 and B6 deficiency, as well as excess vitamin B6, can also cause neuropathy. Some toxins, such as lead, arsenic, and thalium can cause large fiber sensory neuropathy. Other causes include abnormalities of protein metabolism, as in a type called amyloidosis or monoclonal proteinemia. In many neuropathies, both the sensory and motor nerves (the nerves that supply the muscles) are involved, leading to sensory symptoms as well as weakness.The diagnosis of large fiber neuropathy is made by findings on a test called EMG/NCS which assess how well the nerve conduct electricity and how well muscles respond. Rarely, in some cases a lumbar puncture provides useful in formation, and very rarely a nerve biopsy is required.I recommend that you continue working with your neurologist. He/she may order laboratory tests as indicated (particularly vitamin levels such as B12) and may order an EMG/NCS.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "I know I have been misdiagnosed, and I am more than frustrated. My symptoms are unsteady gait, slurred speech, wrong words coming out to loss of words, tremors in hands, arms, legs, headaches, blurred vision, (yes I had eye exam and it came back good, very little change in eyes), numbness and tingling in arms, hands, legs and feet, sometimes shooting pain in legs to feet, heaviness in arms and legs some days, feeling exhausted all the time even after a good nights sleep. The neuro I have seen once stated he was stumped and thought maybe I have migraneous vertigo and put me on topamax 25mg 2 tablets twice a day. I have been on the topamax for almost 5 weeks now with no relief of any of my symptoms. I have called him several times looking for some other options, tests to move this forward to figure out what going on. I have had a T1 MRI brain scan that came back normal, blood work that was normal, and also VNG testing that came back normal. I am not having dizziness, but it feels like I am floating, maybe due to my legs feeling like spaghetti? The only thing topamax has done for me is weight loss, taked away any appetite, and the taste for food. I have been seeing a physical therapist that stated I do not have vertigo and that I have a loss of muscle control in my legs. Started seeing a Chiropractor last week that did more of a neuro exam that the neuro doctor I had seen and also stated that I do not have vertigo, but he detected that I have a loss of feeling my feet that starts and my ankles and get worse towards my toes. Some of these symptoms started the first week in November of 2011 and then on December 19th things took a turn for the worse and I was no longer able to keep working. I made a doctors appointment for the 22nd of December and so far don't know much more now than I did then. I just want to find out what's wrong so I can get back to my life and my job.",
