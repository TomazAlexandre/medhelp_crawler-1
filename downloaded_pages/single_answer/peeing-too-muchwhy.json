    "question": "Hi and thanks for stopping,8years ago I had my first child, I had an episiotomy. Afterward I had incontinence issues, where I couldnt hold me pee very long or when I coughed or sneezed I would trickle on mtself a little...and oh dont let me be sick I would like full blown drain on myself. This has been an ongoing problem and the doctors have told me Im ok. I feel like I was cut to much or something for me not to be able to even hold my pee for long periods of time...Now its at a point when I can get up from standing and I feel a leak...I can be wet in my uinderwear and not even feel a trickle. Its messing with my confidence, Does anyone know what I can do about this?Second question is I have been peeing like crazy and when I feel it its like I have been needing to go for hours...I rush to the bathroom and because of this incontinence issue I can barely hold it, but literally I am peeing like 2 in the hours most days...I get up at least 2 times in the night peeing but the urgency is terrible...You know how you feel yourself have to go pee but you can hold it...I immediately have the feeling as tho Ive been holding it in for hours...Its terrible...Its been sometimes where I would go anf 10-20 minutes later I have the urgency to go again...It doesnt hurt me when urinating so I guess I ruled out the possibility of a uti...But I heard that my blood sugar could be up or down forgot which one. Some have even said that its sign's of diabetes, If so does that mean that I have or will get diabetes or can I reverse this...My doc hasnt done any checks on me and I dont know any other systoms for diabetes. PLease help",
