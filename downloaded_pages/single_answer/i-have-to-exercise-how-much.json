            "answer": "Hello!I would suggest you to come to a normal BMI along with the excellent report card of the vitals (BP, cholesterol etc)\u00a0\u00a0you have.Take this as a challenge, along with following proper clever diet changes, exercise and cardio. If you cannot do 1 hr high intensity exercises i would suggest you to do 30 minutes initially and gradually increase it. Do not exert yourself, do it in a sustained progressive way. Do not get stressed, enjoy your workouts, swim, go for trekking with friends and groups, cycling with your family members, sports with friends\u00a0\u00a0in a regular planned way. etc.Take care",

    "question": "At 48 years old, I am obese with a BMI of 35.1. Really gross and disgusting, I know, I know. I wasn't always this way. I used to work out six days a week for many years, in addition to hiking, bicycling (a lot), and walking. For one year straight I went to a 5:15 a.m. aerobics class before work, and then went back for a 90-minute class at 6:00 p.m.--and I did it five days a week, with only one class on the sixth day.Despite careful food control and all of the exercise, I was never thin. I was fit, but not thin. I couldn't care less about being fit. I want to be skinny and have a BMI of no higher than 20. Nobody ever once complimented me on my resting heart rate or my fabulous low blood pressure or my spectacularly wonderful cholesterol numbers. Never. Our culture doesn't value \"fit.\" It values thin.A series of physical and medical problems cropped up for me about six years ago. I was put on eight medications. Five of those medications list weight gain as a probable side effect, and gain weight I did. I put on almost 60 pounds in six years. When I had my annual physical two years ago, my family medicine/primary care doctor really berated me about my weight. He was kind of cruel, frankly. He said that because of my medications, I would always have to exercise--and more than before, not less. I had stopped due to constant fatigue and sometimes severe vertigo. I had knee surgery when I was a runner/cyclist, and even running and fitness walking are impossible for me.I said that even if I felt OK (and I don't), I don't have three hours a day--plus more--to spend exercising. The doctor was adamant. He said the bare-bones minimum I should be exercising is an hour or more of \"hard, heavy, sweaty exercise seven days a week--minimum.\" He went on to say that anything less would be a waste of time because it would be too insignificant to have any benefit.For what it's worth, I do not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, pre-diabetes, or anything indicating I'm a cardiac disaster waiting to happen--except for being overweight.Is what he said the unpleasant reality of the situation--that anything less than an hour a day of hard, heavy sweaty exercise is meaningless?",
