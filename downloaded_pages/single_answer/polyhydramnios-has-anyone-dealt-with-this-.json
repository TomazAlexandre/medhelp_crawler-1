    "question": "This is my second pregnancy but first time hearing about this. I'm 36wks and OB told me I have too much amniotic fluid. Since there is too much fluid baby keeps moving from head down position to breech so OB wants me to have a csection at 39wks. He said the risk of waiting until water breaks means that the cord could come out before the baby does.I read that this condition is more common in women who carry larger babies but OB keeps telling me my baby is measuring on the smaller to average size. Also read it's common in women who have gestastional diabetes but I passed my glucose test with flying colors and haven't had any issues with pregnancy thus far.Has anyone dealt with this before and can offer any advice??",
