    "question": "In Oct. of 2008 I found out I had a softball size tumor on my right kidney. I had to remove the kidney and i thought every thing else was alright. In Dec. I found out my left kidney only had a gfr of 36 and all the doctor did (a nephrologist) was put me on a blood pressure pill. I don't have high blood pressure or diabetes. What is the standard treatment of ckd with a level like mine? I feel like I should be doing more, but what?",
