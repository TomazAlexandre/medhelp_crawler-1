The standard therapy of erythrasma is antibiotics and antifungals because it is caused by a bacteria C minutissimum.Erythromycin is the drug of choice.Mild steroids are helpful in reducing the inflammation associated with it.

    "question": "About a week ago I noticed a fairly dark brown area in my \"private\" area. Its about the size of a grapefruit and expands onto my inner thigh. It is brown with a red outline, sometimes slightly scaly. It itches severly. I dont know if it matters, but I am a 27 yr old female. I have found some articles that refer a similar rash to Diabetes. I am a type 2 diabetic (insulin resistance). Can anyone tell me what this might be or something that will help? The itching is getting unbearable and its a little embarrassing.",
