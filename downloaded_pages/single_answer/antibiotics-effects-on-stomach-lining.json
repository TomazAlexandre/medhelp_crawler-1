            "answer": "Hi, your query is not clear. Do you have afib? But this will not cause stomach spasms. The symptom described by you could be due to neuropathy. It is a disorder of the nerves which causes numbness, tingling, unusual sensations and sometimes pain. Diabetes Mellitus can cause neuropathy. Other causes like vitamin deficiencies, alcohol consumption and certain medications can cause neuropathy. You may need to consult your primary care physician to detect the cause. Regards.",

    "question": "First, I suffer from heart pac's and atrial fibrillation which I believe are triggered by my vagus nerve.\u00a0\u00a0I often feel little pulses or spasms in the region above my naval while the pac's are occurring, which seems to be the stomach to heart nerve connection.\u00a0\u00a0These spasms can be started by eating something spicy, drinking something cold, belching, sneezing hard or doing something physical that involves my abdominal muscles, but recently the pac's start followed by the afib without feeling a lot (or any) spasms.\u00a0\u00a0Now to my question.\u00a0\u00a0Two times now, while taking antibiotics my pac's and afib episodes have disappeared for weeks.\u00a0\u00a0These were during times when I was having symptoms daily prior to starting the antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0The antibiotics were erythromycin and cephalexin, taken about 2 years apart.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that these antibiotics had some positive effect on my vagus nerve such that it is not getting stimulated as it normally is.\u00a0\u00a0It is as if they effected the stomach lining, perhaps killing bacteria and healing it such that the vagus nerve endings were protected.\u00a0\u00a0If that is not what was happening then perhaps the antibiotics were effecting the absorption of electrolyte minerals that my nervous system may be lacking in.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any other explanations for this effect?\u00a0\u00a0Are there any tests that could be done to reveal my condition?\u00a0\u00a0Should I be seeing a gastroenterologist or would a neurologist be better able to help me?",
