            "answer": "Hi, Shredder.\u00a0\u00a0First of all, I suffer from Fibromyalgia, CFS from the Fibromyalgia (those of us who have Fibromyalgia do not get the deep level sleep, hence, we're never wake up feeling rested and restored).\u00a0\u00a0I have Diabetes, Hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis, and a host of other medical conditions.My suggestions to you are this: consult with a good nutritionist, and seek out a good therapist.\u00a0\u00a0These are good support people for you.\u00a0\u00a0I have a wonderful therapist.\u00a0\u00a0It took YEARS to finally find the right one.\u00a0\u00a0When you do, you will be amazed at how beneficial counseling/therapy can be.\u00a0\u00a0I know what it's like to be tired all the time.\u00a0\u00a0It's something I have to live with.\u00a0\u00a0I also have to deal with chronic headaches and chronic pain.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried every treatment modality known to man/woman to try to deal with my chronic pain.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing, and I mean nothing, has helped.\u00a0\u00a0I just started seeing an acupuncturist, and she feels that Fibromyalgia is complicating the accupuncture treatments, and suggested I look into a Fibromyalgia protocol developed by Dr. Brice E. Vickery.\u00a0\u00a0It is a diet/supplement program, and is expensive.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think I can afford it.\u00a0\u00a0At least not now.Now back to you: why not try some of my suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0It can't hurt, and it may help.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!ettebette",

    "question": "Dear Dr,Every 3-4 weeks I become totally fatigued - transforming me from a highly active professional to a total zombie - exhausted & barely able to tackle simple daily activities and my mind is clouded with a dull headache. Usually the tiredness hits me first and then, through frustration, on comes the depression - it lasts about 5 days and then I'm back to normal again until the next episode.I've had a battery of biochemical tests completed and the only test that was slighly abnormal was my GTT which indicated a slight tendency to hypoglycaemia.The illness leaves me very 'detached', unable to do physical activities, etc - and can be worsened by any other stressor occuring at that time - i.e. additional physical endurance. This is a total contrast to me usual 'state' - it's very worrying when it happens, but I tend to 'deny it' when I'm over it.I swim twice a week and am on no meds. Should I be changing my diet, taking meds, having counselling, etc...?Thank you!",
