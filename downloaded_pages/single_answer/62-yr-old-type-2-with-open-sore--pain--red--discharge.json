Now he has a 2 inch open sore on lower abdomen. He says it is painful, turning black in center & red swollen around. It is in the fold of skin below belly. Should he be admitted to hospital? He is s/p heart grafts & stents over the last 13 yrs. If he should be admitted, I want to go to Heart Hospital ER. Local hospitals do not have \"good\" reputation.",
