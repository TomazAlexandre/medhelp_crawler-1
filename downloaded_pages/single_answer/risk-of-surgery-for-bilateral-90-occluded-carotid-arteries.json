            "answer": "The choice is ultimately up to your aunt to make the decision. There are risks and benefits to the procedure. What I would tell my patients is to think about there quality of life at this point in time. Are they in pain? Are they having trouble breathing? Are their symptoms prreventing them from enjoying daily life? Then perhaps it's time to do something about it. The procedures they have currently for occluded arteries are much less invasive and are considered much safer than they were years ago. They methods for preventing lots and strokes or other complications after the procedure. Your autn's doctor can go over the risks and benefits with her. But from what I can imagine, if sh has more than 1 90% occluded arteries, she's probably not feeling so good. What I can suggest is perhaps you do soome research about the procedure to unclog blocked arteries and read about its risks and benefits and some of the stories of patients that went through it. That can give you a better idea of what it's all about. But still remember, this is ultimately your aunt';s decision, and you must accept whatever she choses. I hope this helps, and I am sending good thoughts towards you and your aunt. I wish you with good luck and best wishes. Take care.Sara RN",
