    "question": "My dad is 70 years old. Has diabetes. He recently had hernia surgery to repair an umbilical hernia and now has phrenic nerve palsy. My questions are many and I'm not sure where to start. First....how could this have happened? I have heard that it is common for doctors to purposely crush the phrenic nerve during hernia surgery but if that's the case we were never told. Second....is this treatable? Can the lung start to function again? If not, what possible complications could he have? Other than the diabetes my dad is a relatively healthy man. 70 is not old in my family. Can you give me any insight into what we are to expect and what we should be doing as far as treatment is concerned?This discussion is related to/posts/show/283300.",
