    "question": "I've been taking accutane since august 2011 now in attempt to clear my acne. It has worked very well for a while, but I have started experiencing things like pink eye, mood changes (deppression), skin rash, pain in the liver area, difficulty swallowing, breathing problems, etc. I went to doctors and they kept on putting me on medications, but no real difference, until I read that all the symptoms that I have are possible side effects of accutane. It also states that it can cause diabetes and the Steven Johnson skin syndrome which really scares me.Is it possible that I have caused irreversible damage to my body for taking accutane for over 6 months? I have stopped now, but am very scared. The dermatologist that first put me on accutane and did not tell me anything about the side effects, now told me that it's impossible to have these health issues because of accutane, but I should stop taking it anyway.Can someone please let me know what I can do?",
