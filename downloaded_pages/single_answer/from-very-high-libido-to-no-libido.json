            "answer": "Hello,Decreased sex drive or decreased libido could be a natural consequence of ageing. It could also be due to psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety. Medicines used in the treatment of various disorders like depression, anxiety, hypertension etc. may also cause decreased libido. Physical problems like Diabetes, Neuropathy etc. may too cause a decrease in a man\u2019s libido. An evaluation from your family doctor and if possible a Psychiatric consultation could help.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
