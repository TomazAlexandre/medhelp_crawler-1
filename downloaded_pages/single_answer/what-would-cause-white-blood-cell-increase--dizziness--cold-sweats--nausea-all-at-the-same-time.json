            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!Well, all these symptoms together could be the side effect of any drugs or medicines your employee is taking. The high WBC could have been there due to another illness that he took medication for. A differential count of the WBC, to see which type are raised and a peripheral smear to look for any abnormal WBC should be done. WBC count is also raised after heart attack. Rheumatoid arthritis too presents in a similar manner at times.This needs a detailed investigation. I think you should discuss this with your company doctor or his personal physician. Your employee may need to undergo blood tests and other investigations.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
