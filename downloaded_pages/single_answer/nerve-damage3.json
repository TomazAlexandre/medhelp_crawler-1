            "answer": "Hi there!Erectile dysfunction can develop due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. When one of the factors is affected, it becomes important to check and rule out the presence of associated treatable secondary causes. You could start by avoiding stress, alcohol/ smoking etc., if involved. If this does not seem to help, I would suggest an evaluation by a urologist for a detailed evaluation and suggestion of an appropriate management plan.Hope this helps.Take care!",
