            "answer": "Hi,Hyperthyroidism and pheochromocytomas(or other catecholamine producing tumors) are truly the main endocrine conditions that would be associated with the tacchycardia that you described, with the later being rather rare.\u00a0\u00a0Other conditions can lead to cardiac problems that can produce arrythmias or cardiac dysfunction of some kind(e.g heart failure in Paget's disease, vitamin deficiencies and Acromegaly, autonomic dysfunction associated with diabetes etc) but that could actually be many diseases(some non-endocrine based).I am sorry I could not produce a long list for you. I think that if hyperthyroidism and pheochromocytomas are ruled out and there are no other signs/symptoms pointing to another endocrine disorder, a cardiologist should be involved to help determine the cause. Also note that some medications, anxiety and some dietary factors can influence this too.Good luck and take care.",
