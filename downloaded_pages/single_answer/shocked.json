    "question": "I just learned that the Fuchs' Dystrophy I have in one eye is getting much worse. The left eye has a lot of scarring from cataract removal & Lasik surgery (done in both eyes). The doctor is sending me to a cornea spec. to rule out damage from Diabetes before scheduling surgery to remove scarring. He hopes to at least keep my sight at the present level, which wouldn't pass a driver's license test. I had lasik about 5 years ago. At the last minute they found astigmatism & changed plans but never mentioned any danger worse than not seeing with glasses. My present doctor didn't mention any futher treatment if surgery doesn't work & I am very afraid. Any information you can give would be so appreciated. Thank you, CC",
