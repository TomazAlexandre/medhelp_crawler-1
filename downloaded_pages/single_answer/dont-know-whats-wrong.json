    "question": "My daughter has been diabetic for 15 years.\u00a0\u00a0For the past two years her control has not been good. She has recently started to control it much better and glucose levels are near normal. She has been feeling less energetic since her sugars have come down. She started having leg cramps and her skin is real tender to the touch on her ankles. This has been happening for the past 3 weeks\u00a0\u00a0She has also had period problems. She went to the gynocoligist last week.\u00a0\u00a0She has been without a peroid for a long time and so they put her on birth control pills to regulate this. Could these problems be due to better blood sugar control after being so out of control for so long?",
