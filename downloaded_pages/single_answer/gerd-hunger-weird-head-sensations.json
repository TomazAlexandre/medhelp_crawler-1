    "question": "Hi I've been diagnosed with GERD. For the past week I've been feeling extreme weird burning hunger feeling. The doctor took me for a blood test about hunger problem I forgot what it was for but the test resulted fine. I now don't have insurance and I am still on the Pill he prescribed me for the GERD. ive been feeling like extreme chest and like I have to cough out some mucus in my throat/chest feeling.\u00a0\u00a0I take every morning and says 30 min before eating food. It seems to help but other problems seem to come out of me.I hope that I post and if anyone know what I am feeling or what is wrong with me. I didn't have these feeling for weeks but now this is new feeling.I have this now weird lightheaded like feeling following with a weird euphoria like rush cold/ feeling in my head. the whole nights I've been dealing with this weird pounding like almost dizzy feeling. Also like my head wont sit still when I try to keep it still. Pulsing to the heart beat. Its hard to sleep that I might get really dizzy or something.In the morning I have a long time bowel movement also. right after like today I feel very hunger again so I ate food and at the time I am eating food I feel like that weird drugged out rush cold/sensations on my head. It is weird and irritating. After eating I feel like the lightheaded ness slightly goes away but it still persists. I feel the dang feeling and I am feeling uneasy. that weird euphoria\u00a0\u00a0I feel slight pressure also in my head.type head sensations is weird and very uncomfortable. I don't use illegal drugs or what not.what's wrong with me please anyone got a clue or similar to this?please anyone got any clues?",
