            "answer": "Hi,Some of the causes of uneven pupils include horner\u2019s syndrome, stroke and lung cancer.Apart from stroke other causes like nerve compression in the cervical spine and lower back and peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, B 12 deficiency and thyroid dysfunction.CT scan is as good as MRI though MRI is a superior test for looking at the soft tissues like brain. However CT scan with contrast is a good procedure for diagnosing brain pathologies.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "Recently I have been having a lot of one side pain in my right temple and jaw that radiates to my eye and my head as well as to my arm and shoulder. I aso have headaches that seem to be related to this pain. I also noticed that my pupil size is periodically uneven, with my right eye more dilated. My pupils change a lot and are normal some of the time or the left pupil occasionally larger so the difference is not fixed. This occurs constantly during the day, getting worse at night probably because of the dim light. I am noticing some bluriness of vision that I think is related to this.Yesterday I also started to experience cramping and numbness in my right calf and foot. I went to my primary care doctor and he checked my eyes but he didn't do any type of neurological exam. He felt that this type of difference in pupil size was likely an eye problem since it changed around and referred me to an opthamologist. Do you feel that this is the correct course at this point?My history is further complicated by having a defribulator for VT. I know this makes me unable to have an MRI. If I need further neourological evaluation, are my only options a CAT scan? How does this compare to the MRI? I know that an MRI is typically preferred for imaging the brain and I am very concerned about the possiblity of MS or a brain tumor. I am 34 female 5'7'', 168 lbs. I have recently been evaluated by my cardiologist so the pain is non-cardic.Thanks for your help,erica",
