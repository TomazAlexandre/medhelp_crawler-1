    "question": "Hi, My husband was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which we have been montioring daily, the other day we were lying in bed when he started to shake uncontrollably, he drifted in and out of consciousness and seemed very disoriented, I did a finger stick and it was 156 but his blood pressure was 198/138 which was very high, he recovered after a while but I have never seen anything like it and am very concerned for his safety. If anyone has ever experienced anything similar I would greatly appreciate your thoughts.Thanks!",
