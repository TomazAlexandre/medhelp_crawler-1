            "answer": "Hi,Your fasting blood sugar was JUST above normal(the new normal range goes up to 99). The test is in the range of what is called \"impaired fasting glucose\" which is a risk factor for diabetes in the future(it does not mean you will definitely develop diabetes). The fact\u00a0\u00a0that your father has diabetes is also a risk factor. However, your test was so minimally elevated , I suggest re-doing it before you get worried at all. In general, given your family history you should try to stay within a healthy weight, watch your diet and exercise atleast 30 minutes a day. That will give you your best chance of not developing diabetes in the future.take care.",
