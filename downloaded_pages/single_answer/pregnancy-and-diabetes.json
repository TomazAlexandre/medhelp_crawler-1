            "answer": "I'm sorry for the extremely late reply.\u00a0\u00a0As your doctor may have already discussed with you, diabetes can have many effects on your developing baby.\u00a0\u00a0Some issues that might occur include growth problems (either too big or too small), abnormal development of the heart, abnormal development of the intestine, and limb and spinal problems (these last are more rare).\u00a0\u00a0In general, the better that your diabetes is controlled, the lower the risk to the developing infant.After birth, your baby will be at risk for low blood sugars, possibly requiring extra glucose (the main sugar used by the body) using IV fluids.\u00a0\u00a0If any of the previously mentioned developmental problems have occurred, your baby's doctors will be assessing those problems also.In terms of your high blood pressure and liver enzymes, the main risk for the baby is if you become seriously ill from these problems and the baby needs to be delivered early.\u00a0\u00a0Issues of prematurity might become an issue.\u00a0\u00a0Maternal high blood pressure can also sometimes slow the growth of the baby.Hopefully, your health and diabetes management will allow the delivery of a healthy newborn infant.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctors will be weighing the relative risks for both you and your baby as the pregnancy continues.",
