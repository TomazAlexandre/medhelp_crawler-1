            "answer": "Hi there,Yes this problems can be very frustrating. I have struggled with trying to understand why some people have trouble and other people do not.There are some classic risk factors for wound healing problems that include:diabetes, obesity, smoking, collagen vascular disease, poor nutrition, immunocompromised state.but sometime, we just do not know. It sounds like you are doing all the right things. Now this is the hardest thing to do but you have to figure out how to allow time to pass and let your body heal at the pace that your body has.bets wishes",

    "question": "Me again........It appears I am experiencing wound separation for the 2nd time on the same incision location.2 yrs ago it only opened on the middle about 2 inches and closed after 12 weeks of everyday cleaning and packing at the Dr's office. This time he left the staples in longer, surgery was 2 and 1/2 weeks ago and I still have some staples. This time my incision started separating in the middle and now one side has joined. I am NOT a happy camper and am very frustrated. My husband is to clean out the wound twice a day and I go back to the Dr everyday next week for treatment.What causes this? He thought that last time was a fluke and everything would be ok this time. Things even started out better this time. I have been on bed rest and not moving around much. I am so careful about washing my hands and changing/bleaching my sheets often.What can I do to help the healing? I am not diabetic and have never had a problem other than these 2 experiences.I am 38 yrs old with an extensive history of Endo and have had several surgeries.\u00a0\u00a0My path report came back clean.\u00a0\u00a02 yrs ago was a partial Hyst and this time it was removal of cystic ovaries and clean up of endo.Thanks for any advice you can give.",
