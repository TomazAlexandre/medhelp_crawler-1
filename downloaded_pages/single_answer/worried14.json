            "answer": "You are probably just prone to having large babies. I never had diabeties while pregnant but I have large babies. My first was born at 36 weeks and weighted in at 8 plus pounds. I have been induced three times after that due to a big baby and had to practically starve myself at the end of pregnancy to make sure that baby did not grow too much. I did not do the starving thing with this baby and I am now 41 weeks measuring 44 weeks. They have been doing weekly scans on baby and he is measuring between 9 and a half pounds and 10 and a half pounds. It is kinda scary that he is so big but hopefully things go well.you very well could be diabetic but I would not be too concerned until they test you and the results come back.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck mama.",
