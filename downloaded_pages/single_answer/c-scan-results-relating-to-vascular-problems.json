            "answer": "I am not certain what you mean by \"c-scan\" but presume the test was a CT scan (computed tomography, also known as a CAT scan). This could indeed show up atherosclerotic plaque and calcifications in the arteries. This plaque is a manifestation of the same problem that can lead to heart attacks. Atherosclerosis affects arteries throughout the body, not just in the heart. Somewhere between 20 and 40% of patients with coronary artery disease also have peripheral artery disease (PAD; plaque in the arteries supplying the legs such as the iliac arteries). As many as half of these, however, will not have symptoms.Risk factors for PAD are similar to those for CAD, however diabetes and smoking are particularly associated. You don't mention if your husband has diabetes, hypertension, or if he smokes, but if so, these risk factors need close attention. If he had some of these risk factors in the past, it is possible that what you are seeing is the result of this, even if his cholesterol is now well controlled. There are also complex and incompletey-understood genetic factors that lead to some people with few or none of these risk factors developing heart disease or PAD.Treatment of PAD is usually with exercise training and medicines such as aspirin, Plavix, and statins. It is likely that your husband is on these medications if he has had two heart attacks. Angioplasty, stenting, and surgery can be used in symptomatic cases. Treatment of renal artery plaque is similar, with angioplasty, stenting, and surgery generally used only in cases where the narrowing is severe and associated with uncontrollable blood pressure or some types of kidney failure.So what you are seeing is likely a manifestation of atherosclerosis, which can affect other arteries as well as the heart arteries. The treatment is similar - exercise, healthy diet, and medicines such as the ones mentioned above. I would encourage your husband to discuss these findings with your GP on his return, and review his risk factors to ensure that each is being aggressively treated.",

    "question": "My husband recently hads a c-scan done for upper and lower abominal pain. the reports says renal vascular califications bilaterally, significant plaque in the Aorta and Iliac vessels. Our G/P' office called and said everything was fine but we received copies of the repoort it certainly does not seenm fine at all. I know our G/P is on\u00a0\u00a0vaction so I have no idesa who read the report.My husband is 73, had two heart attacks, the first 6 years\u00a0\u00a0ago, the 2nd was 5 years ago after being taking off plavix with a stent . He had tests done on his legs arteries and everything looked fine, gets a stress done every year and his total cholestrol is 102. He has been on statins for 10 years, but I certainly am not seeing them doing any more than lowering the chol. numbers, where did this plaque come from with chol. readings that low.I am looking for some insight and a direction to follow with these findings.Thank you for this site\u00a0\u00a0nand your time.
