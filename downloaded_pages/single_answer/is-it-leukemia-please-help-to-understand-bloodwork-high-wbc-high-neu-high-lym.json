            "answer": "Hi there.From the blood picture alone, I believe that there is insufficient evidence to say that this is lymphoma.\u00a0\u00a0Even the level of WBC elevation is not that high compared to the usual leukemia cases that we see in the clinics.\u00a0\u00a0Also, in leukemia, there is the presence of abnormal white blood cells called 'blasts' and other immature forms.I won't be surprised if your hematologist will dismiss the consideration of leukemia or other primary hematologic disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Your symptoms of fatigue and pain may be related to your cardiovascular status and I suggest you get your heart and lungs checked.Regards.",
