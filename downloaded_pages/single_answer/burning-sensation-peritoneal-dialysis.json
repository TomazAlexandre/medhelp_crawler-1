    "question": "Hi,My father is a chronic renal failure patient and has been on CAPD for 6 yrs with two reported cases of peritonitis. From few days my father is complaining about burning sensation in his upper abdomen and subsequently i find a drop in his Blood pressure. Our Doctor is currently out of town, so before visiting him that i wanted to know what could be the possible cause of this burning sensation. Fluid is all clear, no sin of peritonitis. Symptoms are similar to those of GERD but my father has history of diabetes.Thanks",
