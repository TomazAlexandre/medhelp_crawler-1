            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Your symptoms seem to indicate nerve compression or peripheral neuropathy. Nerve compression can occur due to pinching of the nerve in the cervical region due to disc herniation or prolapse, carpal tunnel or cubital tunnel syndrome.Peripheral neuropathy can occur due to diabetes and vitamin B12 deficiency. Peripheral arterial diseases (PAD) also cannot be ruled out.Please discuss these possibilities with your PCP as soon as possible. Meanwhile you can take OTC pain killers and B complex supplements.",
