    "question": "My dad is insulin dependant(most of the time)& he has chronic pancreatitis.He has had multiple surgeries including the removal of his appendix, gallbladder, 1/2 of his pancrease, and a bowel surgery.All this has caused scar tissue/adhesions to build up and he is now in extereme pain because his bowel is restricted causing a narrowing of the bowel and partial blockages.He also seems to have trouble getting enough nutrition.To deal with the blockage he is suppost to eat liquids but then he looses wieght. What foods are okay for him to eat?? Are there any foods that are NOT okay?This may not be the right page for this question but he has been trying to deal with an obstruction at home(under doctor's suppervision)but it seems to come back as soon as he returns to eating again.His doctor is talking about another surgery to remove the scar tissue/adhesions but we are told that they will probably just come back and may be worse, have any other suggestions besides surgery?We have heard about Pfrimmer Deep Muscle Therapy but are having a hard time getting much information, any suggestions?Thank you for your time!!",
