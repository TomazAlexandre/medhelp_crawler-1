My opinion is that kids that age want to be just like everyone else and often rebel against diabetes control. On the website he can meet other teens who he can relate t and young adults who went through the rebellion stage themselves. Your son is doing a great thing for his friend by encouraging him to change his lifestyle; that way at least one peer is on his side. (and supporting his friend, your son might eat healthier too if he doesn't already!)",

    "question": "My Son's Friend Struggling With Diabetes ....My son has a friend, D (16 years old), who was recently diagnosed with diabetes. He just started giving himself shots in his stomach several days ago.We are very concerned for this young boy, who doesn't take his condition serious at all. He can, and sometimes does, drink more than a dozen cans of soda in one day, and eats lots of junk food, fast food, and is not very active at all.My son visits his friend often and wants to encourage him to change his eating habits and lifestyle, so that he will be able to hopefully get his diabetes under control.I would like to find information that I can share with the boy, and try to encourage him to take his condition seriously.Any suggestions and resources would be greatly appreciated!",
