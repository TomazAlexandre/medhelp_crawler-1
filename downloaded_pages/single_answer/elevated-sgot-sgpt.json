You seem to be suffering from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. Lifestyle changes may be helpful. You should refrain from taking alcohol, as this will cause further injury to the liver. Hemoglobin A1c provides an average of your blood sugar control over a six to 12 week period and should be used in conjunction with home blood sugar monitoring for making adjustments in your diabetes medicines. Diabetes should be treated and control obesity..Adopt lifestyle changes like weight reduction, exercise etc. Indulge in exercise daily and avoid fried fatty foods. It is best to have a frank discussion with your attending doctor and get your doubts clarified. Keep me posted.Kind regards!",
