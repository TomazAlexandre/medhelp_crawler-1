    "question": "I am a 56 year old female, just entering menopause, completely healthy, fit, and physically active.A few month ago, some change occurred in the mucus membrane of my mouth. It looks the same, but it feels like there is not enough mucus being generated, and there is a feeling of \"friction\" between the gums and the inner surface of the lips, and between the tongue and the inner surfaces of the mouth. What can this be? and how can it be treated? It is quite uncomfortable.",
