            "answer": "Hey there,Not sure of the terms you use or the meds you refer to but I can tell you that nearly every anti depressant has fluid retention, oedema, as a side effect. This is certainly on the road to diabetes etc and must be watched carefully as some of the damage is irreversible.I had oedema about 5 years back from a med and din't notice it until too late. I lost feeling in the balls of both feet and have had leg pains ever since. Diagnosed as peripheral neuropathy. The fine nerve endings died and will not regrow pending the G nome project.Most think fluid retention is nothing and so did I. But it's a nasty, nasty problem. Diuretics don't fix it either, they just relieve it now and again.CHeck your meds online and see if oedema is listed. Likely it is.",
