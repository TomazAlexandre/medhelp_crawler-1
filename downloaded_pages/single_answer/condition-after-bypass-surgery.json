            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. I hope diabetes has been ruled out, if he is a diabetic, this could cause repeated infections. It needs to be adequately controlled. Also, assessing the extent of infection and clearing out the whole abscess is mandatory, this can be assessed by CT scanning. Have a culture and sensitivity test done to find out the correct antibiotic that the infecting organism is sensitive to and taking this medication for the required amount of days may help to clear the infection. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "My dad has undergone bypass surgery with DOR procedure in June 2011. He After that he got infection the next day when he got discharged from hospital. At the time of discharge also, pus was coming...so doctor stitched it and said it will be ok in few days..It got heeled after some days..but same condition happened few weeks later...stitch automatically got dissolved and pus came out..while visiting the hospital, doctor suggest that some of patients got infections becoz of the body type...some of the patients bodies are allergic to the steel threads used during bypass to tie the bone...so doctors suggested that we need to wait for another six months to remove the steel threads...so in between this six months, again same condition reoccurred. Pus came out from the stitches and while revisiting hospital, doctors used to give high dose antibiotics against staphylococcus aureus and re suture the stitches. And once he was also treated with Vacuum process. In the month of Dec-2011, again he was operated and threads were removed...but again after that..he got infections...now even doctors are not sure whether why he is getting repeated infection and they are also not giving any surety whether he will be fine or not.. Again he got admitted to hospital last week, and re operated to open the infected part from where pus was coming..they cleaned it and saying we need to wait until it get heels completely.So please suggest what may be the reasons and do I need to continue in the same hospital?",
