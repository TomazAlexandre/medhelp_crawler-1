    "question": "I had my baby 14 months ago. At the time I had carpal tunnel in my hands which my doctor said was normal. I had an emergency c-section and my blood pressure spiked to 200 over 140. I did have an epidural. I got back on my feet fairly quickly. But now, I have intense pain and tingling in my feet that shoots up my legs. It mostly happens after I've been sitting or lying down. When I stand up, it hurts to stand on my feet. It's now moving around my body and my arms are starting to have the painful tingling as well. I still exercise daily as I'm trying to lose weight. I've never had a thyroid problem, don't have diabetes, but have had high blood pressure and weight issues for several years now.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound familiar to anyone? I had an MRI for an ear problem they tell me was probably caused by the high blood pressure episode during pregnancy but it didn;t show anything abnormal.",
