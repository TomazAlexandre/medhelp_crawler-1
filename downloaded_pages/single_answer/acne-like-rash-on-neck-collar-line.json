    "question": "I recently developed about two dozen raised, red pimple-like bumbs on my neck, all right about on my collar line. They are red and some of them are painful when touched. Some of them have developed white heads (which makes me think they are some form of acne). However, they are also somewhat like the kinds of raised red bumps that you get from skin irritated after shaving (say, with a dull razor).Anyone know what these can be? Is it something to get checked out? Theyve been there for about 3 days now and have gotten progressively worse.",
