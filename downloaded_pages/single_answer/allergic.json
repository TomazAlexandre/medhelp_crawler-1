            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms are suggestive of marijuana side effects.Marijuana is one of the most commonly used and dangerous drug to be used.It has the same CNS depressant properties as alcohol.It causes CNS depression, increased heart rate, impaired coordination and balance, delayed reaction time,diminished short-term memory,anxiety and panic,nausea,vomitings,tremors ,sleepiness and altered body temperature.The other possibilities to be ruled out are alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium,calcium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes) and hypothyroidism.Without examination,it is very difficult to confirm a diagnosis.So I sincerely advise you to consult a physician and discuss these possibilities with him.Also pls try to leave smoking marijuana.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing or\u00a0\u00a0if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "When I smoke weed everything turns into slow motion and I get very light-headed. My feet feel very heavy off and on, and even sometimes I feel I cant move. I tried to stand up and I kept blacking out about three times, my friend would catch me because I was almost felt like I was passing out those three times. While I was blacked out I could talk and hear everything, so basically I would go blind for a couple of minutes. I felt like I couldn't breathe half the time and my body would get really bad muscle spasms- to the point where I thought I was going into a seizure. My body felt on fire almost and I wasn't hungry at all. After it started to where off, I ended up puking, and falling a sleep.\u00a0\u00a0This happened to me three times. The last time was the worst.Why did this happen to me?",
