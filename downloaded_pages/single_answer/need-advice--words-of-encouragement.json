            "answer": "Hi, am sorry you are feeling so bad.If it is neuropathy, I have good news.\u00a0\u00a0it is reversible (though this can take weeks to months).\u00a0\u00a0However the bad news, is that to reverse it you need to get your blood sugars normalised as in get them back to nromal range of say 70 - 100 at all times.\u00a0\u00a0Not easy, but may be worth it.I am also diabetic, on insulin and 26 weeks pregnant with my second.\u00a0\u00a0The best way I have found to nromalise blood sugars is using information in Diabetes Solution book by Richard Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0This describes how to best use insulin as well as how to follow diet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don't like to follow his diet and recommendations, but it really works.\u00a0\u00a0Considering your are so young and maxed out on meds I reackon this is you best bet.Hugs",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with Diabetic neuropathy from my last pregnancy, because it all started with carpal tunnel. I have Celiac Disease also and been Diabetic since I was 7.. I have been taking low doses of Norco for the past couple years for the pain but it has been getting a little better, but not by much. I got pregnant in March with my son! I felt so happy and great to know I have been blessed to have another child being in the condition that I am in.. with the Celiac and the Diabetes and the pain medication. Well, come to find out my dr said it was ok to continue the norco. She said it is ideal to be taking nothing but she has been my dr since day 1 from when I was diagnosed and knows I need it or I can't even open a door (neuropathy was in my arms and neck, bilateral). Well the first couple months were great but 2 months ago when I hit 7 months pregnant I started getting horrifying back pain going down one side of my butt, and horrible pain in my hips and legs. I just thought it was sciatica because all other women said they got it too.. I knew something wasn't right becuase I was geting to the point where I am collapsing on the floor and I have fallen in the store 3 times already. I was getting really depressed because I had to take more norco for the pain in order to walk, I am now up to 8 pills a day. I feel like a monster!!!! I would NEVER take anything unless my doctor approved.. which she did and so did my high risk OBGYN so before anyone begins with I should talk to my dr, believe me, I have. I feel so bad and I know this isn't healthy but I have no other option.Today I explained my situation to an endocrinologist which took this long to see because my health insurance ***** and she tells me that I have now more then likely developed Proximal Diabetic Neuropathy. PROXIMAL NEUROPATHY?!?!?!? I feel outraged.. why me???? Why now????!?!?!?!?? I am only 26 and I am in the worst pain every day!! I can't take anymore pain meds... for the love of GOD I can't.. I feel like I know it is ok.. but I can't take anymore I know it is bad.. I am having my baby next week via c-section at 38 weeks. I am hoping this helps my pain but it didn't when I had my daughter, why would I get a break this time either.Does anyone else have any words or encouragement or have had this problem?Does anyone have this type of particular neuropathy and how have they dealt with it...?I just got this news and don't have anyone to really understand my pain.. my husband is there for me but he really doesn't understand my pain or diabetes. Sometimes I feel like this website is the only way to get my feelings out there...Thanks.",
