    "question": "I'm wondering If I'm the first in the group :-O)Failed Gestational Diabetes Test @ 13wks3days. I've been insulin resistant for about three years so this was not a big surprise.After 10 days of logging blood sugars and food diary we've came to the conclusion bedtime insulin was required. Have been on it since Thursday night, 4 units, will have to be increased a tiny bit I think but so far giving myself insulin injections has been a breeze (I requested a pen and since I'm something of anomoly they gave me one...probably cause I have at least 22 weeks of this)Heart beats have been good at exams.We go for an elective u/s for gender on Monday, May 18thMy level II ultrasound got changed into a fetal echo u/s (which also does the level II u/s) because of the rist of heart defects if mom has high blood sugars early in pregnancy :-O(I should get the results of the quad screen test in a week or two, they don't do any results after the first bit here (not sure if they do that for the usa people or not) we don't get the triple screen + nuchal translucency test here unless you're 40 or over (I'm 39) and can only get an amnio if something goes wonky with the quad screen results.Before GD test ob said I'd be delivering in my 39th week but I've been doing some reading and it seems I'll be lucky if she doesn't move that to my 38th week.That's my update,Joanne",
