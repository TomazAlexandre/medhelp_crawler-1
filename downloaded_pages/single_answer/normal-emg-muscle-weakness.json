            "answer": "Hi there. You have weakness limbs, with fasciculations, and these symptoms aresuggestiive of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. usually EMG, NCV studies show up the relevant positive results and MRI is inconclusive usually ruling out other causes of similar symptoms like spinal cordtumor,cervical spondylosis, disc prolapsed, multiple sclerosis etc. get a repeat EMG and NCV done and also rule out nutritional problems like B12deficiency and alcoholism.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes and hypothyroidism also should be investigated forperipheral neuropathy. so go back to your neurologist and insist on MRI and certain blood and other investigations. Take care.",

    "question": "Hello-I'm a 36 year old woman. The last 3 month's I've been experiencing muscle weakness and twitching in arms/legs/body. My Neuro said not to worry because all the EMG/MCS results were normal (left arm and leg). Yet it doesn't explain my muscle weakness(when I walk and squat my legs feel weak, wobbly), my hands/arms feel stiffness, clumsy, achy, and lifting a cup makes my wrist strain and hands shaky, grasping feels weak.The Neuro says the objective tests are fine and has no explanation for my weakness. I went to second Neuro at a MDA/ALS clinic and that Neuro looked at my normal EMG/NCS report, did a Neuro exam, and told me not to worry. I am at a loss and full of worry and don't know which direction to go, as my symptoms are real and I feel like no one is taking that weakness seriously. Both opinions seem to say, don't worry, but it's easy for them to say when I am the one feeling what is not normal for me. Neither Neuro gave me further guidance about my muscle weakness/tremor/twitching and what should be further pursued.-Should I have another EMG/NCS in a certain time frame, what are your thoughts about my situation/symptoms?-Would the EMG/NCS I've had already be showing abnormal changes if I had ALS/muscular disease, since I am experiencing weakness?Thank you.",
