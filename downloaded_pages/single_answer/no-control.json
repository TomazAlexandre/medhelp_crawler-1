            "answer": "Blood sugars between 15 (270) and 30 (540) can have devastating effects longterm such as blindness, loss of limbs and kidney failure. Sustained numbers over 300 can cause DKA, coma and death within days. If you are working with a diabetic educator who does not recognize that danger, I would fire her. You need to be speaking with an endo and show him those numbers (all meters keep a history) and proceed to court while this child is still around to be fought for. Any of us with Type 1 diabetes would be deeply disturbed to hear this.",

    "question": "My husband has joint custody of his 3 1/2 year old daughter who has type 1 diabetes, she was diagnosed when she was a year old. While in her mother's care her blood sugar is consistantly between 15 mmol and 30 mmol, she refuses to count her carbohydrates and lies about the food that she does feed her. Whenever we get her for our custody time she always has infections (for example her chin is infected at the moment and the size of a golf ball, and yes we are bringing her to a doctor first thing in the morning to get antibiotics).What are the long term effects that this complete lack of regard for her health possibly have? How can we get her diabetes educator to finally listen to us and reconize our concerns so we may move ahead with her support for full custody so my step daughter can finally be taken care of properly 100% of the time? We are tired of being ignored by the people who are supposed to be there helping her.",
