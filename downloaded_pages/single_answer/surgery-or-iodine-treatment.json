            "answer": "Surgery or Iodine (RAI) will produce the same results, hypothyroidism.Surgery is more evasive, some thyroid residue will be left behind so antibodies still can attack causing havoc with symptoms and levels, as well as the thyroid can grow back with you ending up at square one and having to do Iodine (RAI) after all.Surgery does not save a person from thyroid eye disease if prone to getting it.RAI, if not high enough dose to totally ablate thyroid, it will be just the same as with surgery, except thyroid is still there and doesn't grow back.Surgery or RAI is just a matter of preference.Good luck with your decision.",
