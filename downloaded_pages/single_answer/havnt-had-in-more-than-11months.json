            "answer": "Hi!If weight is the cause of your loss of periods, then hypothyroidism, diabetes, and polycystic ovaries, adrenal gland problems and severe anemia should be ruled out. All these can cause weight gain, and can also affect the menstrual cycle. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
