    "question": "My child has had a series of test ran to determine if some of the symptoms that I noticed may determine if she had diabetes. Her A1c came back at 6.4 (recommended 6.0), glucose 80, and it showed that she had a trace of Ketone in her urine. This is confusing to me because a 5 hour glucose test was performed and there was only one hour where her levels went out of range to 128. I am not sure what to do next because some tests show good signs and other not so good. Is there a doctor out here that can clarify this for me?",
