            "answer": "Dear\u00a0\u00a0Laura,Here is some general information concerning angina.\u00a0\u00a0Angina is due to a lack of blood flow (ischemia) to the heart muscle.\u00a0\u00a0It is typically pressure like and in the center of the chest.\u00a0\u00a0It may radiate to the left arm or jaw.\u00a0\u00a0It is often accompanied by shortness of breath and a cold sweat (diaphoresis).\u00a0\u00a0It is often precipitated by exertion or cold but may occur at rest. It may last for as short as 10 to 15 minutes or longer than several hours.\u00a0\u00a0Pain that lasts only a few seconds is almost never angina.Risk factors for developing angina are high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, poor fitness level, age greater than 45 for males and greater than 55 for females and a family history of heart disease in male relatives younger than 55 or female relatives younger than 65.The work-up for chest pain usually includes an ECG, chest X-ray, blood tests and often times a stress test or echocardiogram.\u00a0\u00a0The definitive test for blockages is a heart catheterization.Other potential causes of chest pain are musculoskeletal, pericarditis, pulmonary problems, gastrointestinal problems and anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0The best course of action is to have all chest pain evaluated by a physician.\u00a0\u00a0Pain that lasts only a few seconds can be evaluated as an outpatient.\u00a0\u00a0Pain lasting for more than 20 minutes should be evaluated in an emergency department.",
