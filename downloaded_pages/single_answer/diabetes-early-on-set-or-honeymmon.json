    "question": "I have a 7 yr old son that is ADHD he is 4ft 3in and 59lbs. He has some of the signs of diabetes Thirst, urination, moody, and weight\u00a0\u00a0loss. I spoke to the doctor about this in August of 2006 so we started to monitor him. This month he lost about 6 lbs. So I started checking his blood sugar a lot. His fasting rage was\u00a0\u00a098 to 193. His range before meals was anywhere from 74 to as high as 193. I also took his levels sometimes while sleeping and had one as low as 69 and as one as high as 153. When I took him back to the doctor he had large ketones in his urine. So they ran some labs. His A1c came back 5.2 witch is good. The doctor thinks he may be in the honeymoon stage or is at early on set of type 1. They did not put him on any melds. at this time. Has anyone else had similar experiences Honeymoon or early onset? How long do we have before thing go one way or the other? At this point I feel like we are in a boat with a hole in the bottom, in the middle of the ocean being circled by sharks.Thank you for all of your help in advance.Sherry",
