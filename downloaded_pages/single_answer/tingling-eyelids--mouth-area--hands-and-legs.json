            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Tingling in head region (mouth, lips, tongue etc) is seen in peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes. It is also seen in peripheral vascular disease.Compression of cervical spinal nerves too can cause it. It can also be due to cold and sinusitis. In all probability it is cervical nerve compression as you feel it here and there too. It can also be a condition like fibromyalgia. Electrolyte imbalance is also a possibility. Without examining you it is difficult to access the situation. Please do not ignore it. Get a neurological consultation ASAP.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
