            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. Knee injury and cellulites are not related unless there was an open wound which got contaminated during injury and lead to infection. Cellulitis is usually infection of the skin including the deeper layers of the skin commonly affecting lower limbs and then arms. Casuative organism is staphylococcus.It can occur due to conditions which compromise immune system like immunodeficiencies, HIV, on chemotherapy, diabetes etc. Also, certain conditions where circulation in veins and lymph vessels is not normal like in obesity, venous insufficiency and pregnancy.Discuss with your doctor regarding these issues and follow his advise.Best.",

    "question": "Hello I am new to this forum and would like to ask for some advise or opinions.I injured my knee jan 2 ( contusion with inflammed bursa sack) I used naproxen per my docs recommendation and the problem went away. On feb 16 my knee became swollen and on the 17th my whole leg became swollen. I have been diagnosed with cellulitous and given antibiotics however my doc (co. doc) said that this is in no way related to previous contusion.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had any knee problems before and am reluctant to accept this. Is it possible that this is related??any response is appreciated. Thank YouMichael",
