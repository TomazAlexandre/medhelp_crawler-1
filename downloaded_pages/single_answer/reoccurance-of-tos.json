            "answer": "Dear MJ Peterson:I would doubt that you have TOS syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Since you have no EMG findings and your cervical rib has already been removed, it makes it highly unlikely that you have TOS.\u00a0\u00a0The normal studies would make one think that the common things are not causing your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0In light of the EP and EMG studies, I am hard pressed to come up with a possible diagnosis, especially given the normal lab results.\u00a0\u00a0There is a remote possibility of a vitamin B12 deficiency if the level was low normal, but a simple trial of oral Vitamin B12 would take care of this.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry, I am unable to come up with an answer for you.\u00a0\u00a0But, I do not think TOS is a possibility.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "I am a 40 year old womna who has been experiencing pain, numbness and tingles in my left arm and hands. WHen I was 19 I had 2 cervical ribs removed, and suffered quite a bit of post-op pain, also required lots of PT. The arm never really felt right.I remember at the time the surgeon said I might have more problemd down the line from scar tissue, etc.\u00a0\u00a0 With the advent of my recent symptoms, I have ha da clear/norma;l brain & cervical MRI, EMG, evoked potentials, and blood tests for a varitey of things ( lupus, RA, diabetes) .I know from this forum that true TOS is rare - what do you think the chances are that this could be it \" again\"/ My Dr. has schedules a spiral CT scan. What other tests should I seek? Thank you.",
