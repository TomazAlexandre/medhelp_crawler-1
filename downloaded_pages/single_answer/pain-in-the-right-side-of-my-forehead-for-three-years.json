    "question": "I have been having chronic facial pain for three years now. At first i chalked it up to sinus pain, but after an ENT visit and a ct scan, it is not so. I have had a low grade fever, throat and neck pain and swelling (on and off for three years), fatigue, and forhead pain on the right side that at its worst extends down that side of my face all the way to the chin. Bending down/standing up, walking, talking, computer work, and reading do not make it worse. If i do excessive exercizing it hurts momentarily but subsides quickly. My blood pressure is normal, sugars are fine, cholesterol is good, no diabetes or anything like that. My doctors tell me i'm making it up. Allergies, sinus problems, blood tests, all rule out any problems. what could be wrong with me?",
