            "answer": "Hi.A spine injury would result in a variety of symptoms depending on its location and severity of the injury.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms of back pain with numbness in the buttocks and upper legs is possibly a result of the injury you sustained previously.While there are many conditions that could result in impotence such as hypertension, diabetes, parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and drug adverse events, it would be more likely that your erectile dysfunction is related to nerve damage secondary to a spine injury.Before a treatment plan can be proposed, it would be better to ascertain the diagnosis by consulting a neurologist and having an MRI done to identify the underlying neurologic injury.Good luck.",

    "question": "A few years back I injured my lower back. I didn't seek medical treatment, thinking it would improve on it's own. It hasn't. The painful area is from about 3 inches above the belt line to about 3 inches below. I have periodic numbness in my buttocks and upper legs. It remains stiff constantly, preventing me from twisting my hips. This makes going down stairs a real trip, although going up is no problem. I occasionally have a sharp pain in my groin area( above my scrotum), which I had thought was unrelated, but now believe it is from the injury. Shortly after the injury I started to be stricken with erectile dysfunction. It has now gotten so bad that my sex life is non-existent, placing a major strain on my relationship. I initially thought the ED was unrelated, but now feel it is all a result of the back problem. I also have developed tremors in my hands, only when I am using them doing task, and mainly in the right hand.Can anyone shed some light on my condition? Can Erectile Dysfunction be related to an injury in the spine? Pleas help me, by giving me guidance on treatment. My life has become miserable as a result.",
