    "question": "Hi all, I'm nearly 22 - I've had type 1 diabetes for 20 years, A vomiting syndrome, Angeodima Urticaria (A uncontrollable swelling/rash problem) and I also have M.E - Just wondering if there's anyone with any of these problems and how are you/did you cope through pregnancy. I'm finding the M.E tiredness to control, which sets off my swelling problem because I'm run down, which THEN sets my vomiting off, which then sets my diabetes blood sugars crazy because I'm feeling so ill and can't keep food and drink down. vicious circle!\u00a0\u00a0X",
