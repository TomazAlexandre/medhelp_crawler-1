    "question": "I am a 50 year old male, failed hep-c treatment alpha interferon and ribov, now at end stage liver, also have type 2 diabeties. My Doctor has suggested its time for SS disability, and get affairs in order. I just recently injured my back,herniated disc lower back, for the last 2 years my main complaint has been stress and fategue, and now with the back problem i spend three quarters of the day laying down and what little I do get done I seem to get lightheaded and tired quickly. I sleep in the am and pm. I cant seem to get going in the mornings without some kind of help from pills, either vitamins and/or pain meds. I feel like I am in limbo as to waiting for blood work to show its time to get ready for the list and transplant. I want more out of my time while I am able to do things now.\u00a0\u00a0I am looking to those who are or have already going through the transplant process for some advise as to pushing through all this and making my time count for something other than looking forward to my next Dr. appt.Thank you in advance for any comments or advise.",
