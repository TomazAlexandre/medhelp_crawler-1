            "answer": "I am experiencing an extremely similar issue! I had had an ongoing problem for almost 2 years now. Along with the pain when I wee, afterwards I also get signs of thrush. After about an hour I calm down and the pain eases. Each time I've been to the doctors they just tell me to drink more, that's it, basically they are useless! I have had a kidney scan however that showed up clear aswell. Nothing seems to be visually wrong with me, I have been tested for diabetes also to see if that could have had impact. I am so fed up of this problem reoccurring and I can't seem to find out why it comes and goes. Am I eating/drinking something that sets it off? It's driving me insane that I don't know! But once I have it, it will take months to go away!! Agh :(Have you got your problem sorted out yet? And if so, how???Thankyou, Sarah",

    "question": "I have been struggling with very frequent urination and high urgency since November 2010. I sometimes have to urinate up to 20 times a day, probably about 15 on average. I have type 1 diabetes and hypertension, both controlled. I also have a high level of anxiety.The urinary symptoms began with a lot of pain in my sides around the rib cage and frequent trips to the restroom. This came soon after a traumatic event in my life. I went to a hospital emergency room in December, where a pelvic and abdominal CT scan were ordered as well as a variety of bloodwork. I was told that nothing unusual was seen in the CT scan or any of the other tests and was sent home. My primary care doctor put me on two rounds of antibiotics (Cipro and Bactrim) with little effect. The pain in my sides subsided, but the frequency did not. I then saw a urologist, who performed a cystoscopy and prostate exam, finding nothing wrong. He prescribed oxybutinin, which I took for a few days but did not seem to change anything and produced unpleasant side effects. My primary care doctor then prescribed tamsulosin, which I took for a few days with little effect. I was then sent to a nephrologist, who found mild hyponatremia and low urine osmolality. He said there was little concern of anything serious and thought that the hyponatremia could be related to fluoxetine, which I take. My primary care doctor found a low TSH hormone (with normal free T3 and free T4) and ordered a brain MRI. The brain MRI showed a small pituitary growth (about 2 mm in size). I then went to an endocrinologist, who was asked to analyze the data available at that time. He said the pituitary growth was likely a benign cyst and probably not a problem. He asked me to collect and measure urine for 24 hours. I voided 18 times in 24 hours, totaling 3000 mL. The endocrinologist said I did not have diabetes insipidus and told me he did not have any other ideas. The urologist then ordered urodynamics, which showed nothing unusual except for muscle tension of the urinary sphincter muscle (he diagnosed it as \"sphincter dyssynergia\"). The urologist prescribed terazosin 2 mg once per day, which I have been taking for almost 2 weeks with no effect on frequency or urgency so far. I also took Detrol LA for about two weeks, with little to no effect. This is where I currently am.I tend to have to the use the restroom at least every two hours, about every hour or hour and a half while working. Typical volume ranges from 100 mL to 200 mL on each void. At night, I usually void about 3 or 4 times, interrupting sleep. Post-void residual on urodynamics was 5 mL. Bladder capacity was shown to be normal. I do not have any kidney damage, according to every test that has been run, and my blood sugar is generally well controlled. Urine tests have not shown any evidence of infection each time they have been done. The urologist said my prostate is \"fine.\"This problem is affecting many areas of my day-to-day life. It makes it hard to sit through meetings and take part in activities that involve traveling or long intervals between restroom stops. My primary care doctor is suggesting that it may be a direct or indirect result of high anxiety, which I am also treated for. I worry about having to go to the restroom, and that seems to make the problem worse. But it has been going on for over a year, and the symptoms have not improved much in that time. I am wondering if anyone in this forum has any thoughts or advice. I would be very appreciative of any thoughts that anyone might have, especially if you have seen or experienced this kind of problem before.Thank you for your time.Jay",
