            "answer": "Hi. Haven't had that surgery performed and can't imagine considering it.\u00a0\u00a0Go to the Complementary Medicine Forum on MedHelp.\u00a0\u00a0Google your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Go off researching on all the trails that are provided.\u00a0\u00a0There are many other health forums to scrutinize, too.\u00a0\u00a0Your health food store employees are extremely well informed on matters pertaining to conditions that don't result in successful allopathic (regular AMA schooled) medicine.\u00a0\u00a0They can point you in directions to different answeres to the same problem.\u00a0\u00a0Some work for some people, and not for others.\u00a0\u00a0Research, research, research, because the buck stops with you.\u00a0\u00a0You're the one who agrees to a certain treatment, and only you.\u00a0\u00a0 Check out all that alternative medicine has to offer, including naturopathic, holistic, chiropractic; investigate the damage that can be caused by vitamin and mineral deficiency and adjust your intake of each.\u00a0\u00a0Chiropractic helped me immensely.\u00a0\u00a0I do not believe I'd be walking without assistance, and might be in a wheel chair, were it not for some excellent chiropractors and massage therapists.\u00a0\u00a0I have also benefited from electric microstimulation of the nerves.\u00a0\u00a0Wish I had one of the gizmos here at the house to use.\u00a0\u00a0Don't underestimate the benefits of chiropractors and massage therapy.\u00a0\u00a0Chelation IV's and a high magnesium and B intake, with heavy multi-vit/min has minimized my neuropathy remarkably.\u00a0\u00a0At times, I'm totally without pain.\u00a0\u00a0I read of a surgeon in Newark, NJ who removes tiny nodules that cause neuropathy in difficult cases, quite successfully.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, were I to consider surgery, that's where I'd go.\u00a0\u00a0I'm considering going for decompression because the first chiropractor I saw had a hand-fashioned piece of equipment that looked like a torture machine and scared me significantly the first few times, but I began to wish I had one at home to use at least a couple of times a day, because of the relief it offered.\u00a0\u00a0I would consider his equipment to be a forerunner of the current chiropractic decompression equipment.\u00a0\u00a0Stopping the chelation IV's and high magnesium and vit/min intake results in increased pain for me, but it's costly and not covered by my insurance.\u00a0\u00a0Still, without it, I huddle in pain.\u00a0\u00a0Ya gotta do whucha gotta do!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "Anyone had it?The relationship between hypothyroidism and peripheral neuropathy is established - (mayo clinic, wrongdiagnosis.com) but what have folks done?\u00a0\u00a0I've had a normal TSH and neuropathy pain for 3 years and getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes and b12 check ok.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 50 y.o. Going to have the EMG (nerve conduction study).\u00a0\u00a0Already on methodone and vicodin for back pain.\u00a0\u00a0These don't help the hands and feet much.\u00a0\u00a0Neuro prescribed amitryptiline - an antidepressant which is supposed to help nerve pain.\u00a0\u00a0Some anti_seizure meds do to.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to try these, but if they only mask the pain, and don't stop the nerve death, I'm going to consider surgery on all wrists and ankles.Anyone done it??PamelaBelow is kind of technical, but it does show that 19.3% of the patients were hypo, and 13% where hypo with diabetes.Relationship Between Loss of Pedal Sensibility, Balance, and Falls in Patients With Peripheral NeuropathyAbstract: The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between balance and foot sensibility in a population of patients with impaired lower extremity sensation. The hypothesis was that increasing impairment of sensation correlates with impaired balance. To date, no report has investigated the relationship between loss of balance with the degree of sensibility in the foot in a population with neuropathy. Ten control subjects and 35 patients with sensory abnormalities and balance problems related to a neuropathy were evaluated. The MatScan Measurement System was used to measure their ability to stand still, maintaining their balance with their eyes open and then with their eyes shut. The degree to which the person moves while attempting to stand still is defined as \"sway,\" which was recorded for normal and neuropathy patients. Sensibility of the foot was measured with the Pressure-Specified Sensory Device, which is noninvasive and nonpainful. The 1- and 2-point static touch thresholds are measured for the pulp of the big toe, medial heel, and the dorsum of the foot. Loss of 2- or 1-point sensation was recorded as sensibility score and compared with controls. Statistical analysis of data and their comparisons for the 2 groups was completed. There were 55% females in control and 64% in neuropathy patients, whereas average age was 50 and 62 years, respectively. Neuropathy was the result of diabetes in 64.5%, hypothyroidism in 19.3%, their combination in 13%, and of unknown etiology in the remaining 19% of patients. Controls had significantly lower mean sway than neuropathy patients (22.9 \u00b1 9% vs. 189.5 \u00b1 180%, P = 0.006). Likewise, sensibility score for normal and neuropathy patients was also significantly different (31.4 \u00b1 9% vs. 232.8 \u00b1 59%, P = 0.0001). When compared with the controls, 99% upper limit of confidence, sensibility in the neuropathy group at the hallux pulp was abnormal at a level consistent with axonal loss in 52% and was completely absent in the remaining 48%. Similarly, at the heel, sensibility was normal in 6.5%, abnormal at a level consistent with axonal loss in 71%, and absent in the remaining 22.5%. The correlation coefficient between sway and sensibility score was 0.36. The results of this investigation for the first time document the intuitive relationship between increasing loss of foot sensibility and increasing loss of balance. These measurements can now be used prospectively to evaluate whether restoration of sensation to patients with neuropathy, through peripheral nerve decompression, can improve balance and reduce falls/fractures in this patient population.",
