            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Recurrent flu like symptoms with swollen gland and no temperature could be due to allergic reaction to pollen, dust, animal dander etc. It could also be a lingering EBV or mono infection.Infection will cause fever which you do not have. Hypothyroidism causes low body temperature but your\u2019s is pretty low. Since you have chills, a viral pathology is most likely.Also a high blood sugar makes it impossible to control infections. Since you had a high blood sugar on one occasion, you should get it tested once. Please consult an ENT specialist regarding this.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been sick with a sore throat and stuffy/runny nose, swollen/tender glands for almost 2 weeks now- it seems to get better (never completely gone) and then flare up again... I am feeling extra cold today so I just checked my temp and it is 94 degrees F... I have hypothyroidism and take Levoxyl to treat it (every day)... my temp. is usually between 96 and 97.6 degrees F on a regular basis... I was told my sugar was a bit higher than normal when I went to the hospital this past March dehydrated with a stomach flu- they told me to get tested in a month but I never did (b/c I have been tested b4, prob. like a 2 years ago and I wasn't diabetic so I hate wasting money on negative blood tests!)So what do you think is wrong with me- what do you suggest I do?",
