    "question": "My boyfriends son has level 1 juvenile diabetes. He was diagnosed five years ago. His father seems to have everything under control. (I think!) I am new at this and learning so, please bear with any ignorance I may display.His son is nine and on an insulin pump. I don't really ask questions because I don't feel like I understand enough.He has lots of sugar cereals, sugar snacks, etc. in the cupboard. Isn't this bad? He keeps telling me that it is the carb count that is the most important.His son wakes up 3/4/5 times a night. He has a protein snack before bed at 8pm and he will fall asleep about 9 - if we're lucky. Throughout the night, he is up all night long.\u00a0\u00a0I am curious how this boy is not totally exhausted? I understand that diabetes will cause a person, a child to wake up through the night but, after five years, shouldn't this situation be under control? He monitors his sons numbers each and every day. He has a binder where he records everything and he shows the results to a pediatrician. The pediatrician says everything is fine.So, can someone please tell me why, at 9 years old, this kid is still getting up so many times in a night? His dad says it is because of his diabetes but part of me thinks that is not the case and that he is just doing this for attention from his dad. (each time he gets up, he uses his dads bathroom, not the hallway bathroom-everytime. He leaves the light on so his dad has to yell at him to turn it off-everytime. And then he needs a hug from his dad or needs to be tucked in by his dad - YES! everytime!)I am an adult and I need a certain amount of sleep to function. This \"issue\" is definitely a problem with me. We are going to begin the process of either building or buying a house and blending our families. Please HELP ME!!!\u00a0\u00a0My six year old does not get up, his five year old does not get up but, his nine year old, all night long!!!! Help me make this stop. There has to be a solution. Is it a diabetic thing or simply just a nine year old being a nuisance thing???",
