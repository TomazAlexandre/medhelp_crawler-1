    "question": "I just had a kidney stone 3/4\" in diameter, blasted. It was the worst pain I have ever had. They had to put a stent in so all the dissolved stones could more easily move out. Now I have to have the other side done. I just was wondering if anyone has had stones blasted and is this a good way to get rid of stones? I would love to hear other's thoughts on this subject. Thanks",
