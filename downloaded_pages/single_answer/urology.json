            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to comment on the situation. Possibilities that may need to be considered would be urinary tract infection/ inflammation, gynaecological issues such as endometriosis/ endometritis, growths/ masses, hormonal/ endocrine issues, neuro-muscular causes etc. It would be best to have this evaluated by a primary care initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, this can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 45 yr old female, no pregnancies, not sexually active with a constant feeling of a full bladder regardless of whether I need to actually urinate. When I apply any pressure at all to my pelvis the feeling gets a lot worse. It started off just having to urinate more frequently and now these other symptoms have been present for the past 3 days to the point where I am having to significantly curtail my activities.\u00a0\u00a0I have previously tested negative for diabetes. Could this just be a UTI? What are the treatments?THanks!",
