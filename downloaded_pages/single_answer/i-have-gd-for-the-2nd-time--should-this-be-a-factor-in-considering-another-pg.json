    "question": "I just got confirmation that I have GD yet again with PG #2. It showed up at 29 weeks with DD and now at 24 weeks with ds. I was kind of expecting this but I really would like to have at least one more child after DS. Is it safe to keep getting PG and have GD every time? I had it well controlled with diet and exercise last time and plan to do the same again. I am also worried if this means that I am just destined to be a type 2 diabetic. I am a fairly healthy eater, exercise and not overweight unless I am PG. The stats on the internet are kind of confusing on this one as to whether I will get it or not. I really want 3 kids!!! Has anyone had GD with multiple PG and did any of you develop type 2? Thanks",
