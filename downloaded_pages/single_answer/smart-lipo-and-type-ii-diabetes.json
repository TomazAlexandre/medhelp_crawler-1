            "answer": "Smartlipo is usually recommended for areas of limited fat to better contour an area.\u00a0\u00a0It is unlikely that you would be a candidate for this procedure of that it would be of any significant benefit for you.Liposuction in general (of any form) is not recommended as a method for weight loss. You may be a candidate for some form of large volume liposuction or a panniculectomy to remove the excess abdominal apron of fat, both of which require general anesthesia.\u00a0\u00a0Without examining you, it is not possible to give you a proper recommendation.\u00a0\u00a0See a local board certified plastic surgeon to determine what technique is best for you.\u00a0\u00a0Your diabetes will not necessarily exclude for a procedure",
