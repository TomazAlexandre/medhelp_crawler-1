We are patients helping other patients when time is available.Glucose levels of 500 mg/dl anytime of day are dangerously high. If your husband is not on insulin he should go to the ER if his levels elevate over 400 mg/dl. BUT...The real question is why is his levels getting this high and what is being done to control and manage his diabetes? I strongly suggest that you and your husband get educated on how to control and manage diabetes. You can start by reading other threads on this forum as the lifestyle changes required to do this has been discussed often. Lastly, he needs to see an Endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in diabetes care and treatment to see what medication - oral and/or insulin - is needed.Post back if questions arise.",
