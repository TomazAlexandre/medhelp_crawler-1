            "answer": "I'm seeing a lot of people just on this forum with spotting like yours, including me. I'm almost 6 weeks. I read that its common to spot during early pregnancy. As long as the bleeding doesn't get heavier or have cramps with it. Brown blood is old blood. How far along are you? If its real early the spotting could be from implantation. I had that as well, and so did a couple friends of mine. Take good care of your diabetes and good luck with your pregnancy. :-)",
