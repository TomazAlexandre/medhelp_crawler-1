    "question": "It started at work 2 years ago my cheeks and hands were numb and tingling, i looked down and my hands were really white, i looked in the mirror and i was as white as a ghost. My hands involuntarly began to cramp, they were stuck, i couldnt move them. i felt weak and instantly had the urge to use the restroom. I had diarrhea and vomiting for a hour. It was the 3rd day of my period. I thought possibly a vitamin D diffiency, but my labs are all normal.it happened again a month ago, not as bad as the first, this time started with tingling in my hands and face, hand cramping, lasted a half an hour...but this time my entire torso was tingling and tight, like i was flexing. this lasted a few minutes. i continue to get tingling sensations in my cheeks.Does this sound like anything you've heard before?",
