            "answer": "I went through surgical menopause at the age of 37 due to early staged ovarian cancer.\u00a0\u00a0I am not able to take hormones, so my experience was sudden and dramatic.\u00a0\u00a0If you can take hormones after the surgery, you probably won't experience the changes that I did.\u00a0\u00a0But, without hormones it has been very hard for me.\u00a0\u00a0In the three years since my surgery, I have developed osteoporosis, lack of libido, vaginal dryness and noticed an overall aging of my body greater than would be expected for my age.\u00a0\u00a0In the beginning, my hot flashes were very intense and frequent!!!\u00a0\u00a0 But, I do not have them anymore.\u00a0\u00a0It was really hard to deal with the changes.\u00a0\u00a0Since you are only 39, I would absolutely recommend that you take the hormones if you have the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Studies have shown that women are at greater risk for long term health problems like heart disease and diabetes due to the loss of estrogen.\u00a0\u00a0It is protective for our blood vessels, skin and brain.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, though, having your ovaries removed can't be avoided.\u00a0\u00a0Your cyst that is 6.8cm should definitely be removed surgically and I doubt that ovary can be spared.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you!Shelly",

    "question": "So I have been having problems with ovarian cysts, it is 6.8 right now having alot of pain. Suffered with endo for years now, had a hysterectomy 3 years ago and now my endo is back with all the pain especially in my back.\u00a0\u00a0Still have my ovaries but my gyno feels I need to have my ovaries out now.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid of what it is going to be like once I go into surgical menopause.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure there is someone out there who has gone thru this and I was wondering how their experience was, and if they had to go onto hormones or not?",
