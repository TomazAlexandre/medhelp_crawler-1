            "answer": "Hello,Your symptom is called polyuria (excessive frequency of voiding). It can be due to many reasons which can be physiological or disease-related, and include excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones.I suggest you to take opinion of your doctor who would do a clinical examination and advice for other needful tests (such as routine urinanalysis, blood glucose test, blood & urinary osmolalities, ultrasonography of renal system, etc).It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello,I'm new to this forum. I went to a urologist last week because for months I've been experiencing an increase in urination frequency...it actually started w/ anxiety and for awhile I just chalked it up to that. But then my anxiety sort of calmed down but my bladder didn't so I went to a uro-gyn first recommended by my regular gyn. I wasn't thrilled w/ the doctor in general but she said it was just anxiety and stress. I decided for a 2nd opinion at a urologist and she agreed stress was the biggest culprit but thinks I could also have an OAB. Mind you I had a clean UTI at all the doctors, a good exam at my gyn but she sent me for ultrasound which was normal, and I had blood work done for all things including diabetes. Although my glucose came in at 101 and under 99 is the norm it wasn't cause for concern. I was worried about Intersitital Cystitis but both uro's dismissed it. So here I am on day 3 of Vesicare. Anyone have experience with this? I feel like since on it my frequency is actually up a bit. I was told to give it atleast one week but two is better to see improvement so I want to stick it out but I keep thinking can Vesicare make your frequency worse before better? I am not sure what's going and since it's the weekend kind of hard to call and ask!",
