            "answer": "Hi,An interesting question.\u00a0\u00a0I think that if blood sugar levels are controlled overall with this proposed method that the damage caused by high sugars will be kept at bay. I think it is unlikely to work out that way because most individuals have better control of blood sugars with dietary changes than exercise, if they are forced to chose one and not both methods of lifestyle changes.Take care.",

    "question": "Hello Dr.,I have a hypothetical question - if someone with diabetes, pre-diabetes or other sugar control issues decides to eat a large number of carbs on a daily basis but engages in moderate aerobic exercise after each high-carb meal such that the postprandial blood sugar never rises very high (eg, peaks at 100-120 and comes down immediately /rapidly with exercise), is that acceptable?Thanks!",
