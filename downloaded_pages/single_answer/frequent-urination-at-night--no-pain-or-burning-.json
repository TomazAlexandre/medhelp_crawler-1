    "question": "I keep having to pee more frequently than usual and even after I go I still feel like I have to. it's mostly just the pressure. I can't be pregnant, I haven't done anything remotely sexual since July. I had an abortion in late June, however if it wasn't successful I'm sure I would've noticed by now. I went to the walk in and had my urine tested, no signs of infection. What could be up?",
