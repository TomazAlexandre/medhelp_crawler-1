            "answer": "Hi Betty,How are you? I understand your concern regarding your eyesight. There are many factors to consider regarding your eyesight such as your medical history of diabetes, age, overall health and even intake of medications. At this point, it is best that you discuss this with your attending physician and be referred to an ophthalmologist for proper evaluation. Hang on and stay positive always. Take care and do keep us posted.",
