    "question": "Hypothyroidism runs in our family. Late onset diabetes as well as high cholesterol and high blood pressure, too. I am seeking a qualified endo in the south Florida area. I wish to secure the services of a skilled and knowledgeable physician who will accept that a 50+ year old individual KOWS their body. I live in the Charlotte, NC area, but my\u00a0\u00a0brother is in FL. It is for him that I am asking. He's so frustrated at this point. I had him to take blood tests for TSH, T3, T4, etc, but he overlooked the antibodies. 2 years ago his thyroid was actually burning in his neck. If there is a Dr that would be willing to chat with me for a bit, you could very easily have a few extra patients come your way. Not to mention, saving my younger brother. Thank you. Sincerely, Vicki C.",
