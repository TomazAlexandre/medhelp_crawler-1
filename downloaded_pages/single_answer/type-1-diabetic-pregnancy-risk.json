I suffered some severe complications during my pregnancy eye complications ( left eye retinopathy) we have done several surgery) I can still see out of the eye but not very well all 3 of the doctors (endocrinologist\u00a0\u00a0, Ophthalmologist, and high risk Obstetrics all stated this could happen, even to myself who was very healthy and had great A1C for several years before coming pregnant to say the least I was under very tight control. I also has part of my cervix removed due to dx; severe high Cervical dysplasia . I love nothing more than being a mommy and I would love to have another one, I am so blessed with one and dont want to sound selfish, I was just wondering if anyone else had any of these problems and if they had any more children and if so how was the pregnancy and your health.",
