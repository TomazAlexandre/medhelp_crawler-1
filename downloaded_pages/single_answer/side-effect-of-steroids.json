            "answer": "You may have polycystic ovarian syndrom (PCOS). This some general information from my website\u00a0\u00a0www.integrativefertilitymd.com:PCOS can affect 5% of all women and common symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, increased growth of hair on the body, loss of hair on the head, acne, and weight gain. Based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM sponsored Consensus Workshop Group, PCOS is diagnosed in women who meet two of the three following criteria: ovarian dysfunction (not ovulating regularly), hyperandrogenism (increased male type hormones on lab testing or clinically increased hair growth), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries which show multiple small cysts on ultrasound). PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose tolerance test.I would suggest that you see a gynecologist or better-- a Reproductive Endocrinologist to do a work up and check what hormones are imbalanced; and place you on something to regulate your periods, decrease hair and help with weight loss.",

    "question": "I had Bell's Palsy when i was 12 or 13 and now i'm 24. During the recovery the doctor had prescribed me steroids and other physiotherapy. It has been more than 10 years since i had the steroids but the side effect is still in me. Since then i had irregular periods, hair loss, weight gain and facial hair growth because it makes my hormone imbalance after ending the treatment. I have to shave every day whenever i'm going to work or just going out. I'm getting tired and sick of doing this every day. It really bring my self confidence down. I'm free of the Bell's Palsy within 3 weeks at that time.",
