            "answer": "Hi, your symptoms could be due to Syncope, which is temporary loss of consciousness and posture, described as \"fainting\" or \"passing out.\" It's usually related to temporary insufficient blood flow to the brain. It can occur due to cardiac disorders or blood pressure fluctuations. Metabolic abnormalities and anemia may also cause syncope. Check with your doctor to rule out anemia and metabolic disorders like diabetes. Regards.",
