You should be a doctor to diagnose what type of fatty liver disease you have and treat it appropriately.The de\ufb01nition of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) requires that (a) there is evidence of hepatic steatosis, either by imaging or by histology and (b) there are no causes for secondary hepatic fat accumulation such as signi\ufb01cant alcohol consumption, use of steatogenic medication or hereditary disordersIn the majority of patients, NAFLD is associated with metabolic risk factors such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia.NAFLD is histologically further categorized into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).The natural history of NAFLD is fairly dichotomous \u2013 NAFL is generally benign whereas NASH can progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer.Cheers!Hector",
