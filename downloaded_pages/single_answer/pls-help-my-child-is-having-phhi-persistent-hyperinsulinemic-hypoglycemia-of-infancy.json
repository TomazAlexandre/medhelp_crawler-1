            "answer": "I am so sorry that your little one is having this problem. I am not aware of any treatments that stop this from happening, although I have read of other children who have persistent hyperinsulin production. All parents who have written to us about this kind of thing sound as desperate as you are, and I wish I knew of some easy solution. Those of us who monitor this site are not doctors, so only know what we read about and what we have experienced with type 1 diabetes. The best thing that I am aware of that the doctors can continue to do is to check him or her often and continue to try to work to normalize the situation. I do know that this is not a situation that is corrected by surgery unless a tumor of some sort is causing the pancreas to overproduce. I have read about babies who have trouble keeping glucose levels up the first few days, and usually they grow out of it. I hope your child gets better in time.If anyone else on this forum can offer more information to reassure this parent, please speak up.",
