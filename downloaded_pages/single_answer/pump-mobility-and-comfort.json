            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0And my kid happens to be on the pump, and know a lot of people on a pump.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, it is great for anyone.\u00a0\u00a0Athletes wear the pump, usually except when they are competing.\u00a0\u00a0Jason Johnson is a major league pitcher who wears his pump during games.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter plays soccer and wears her pump while playing.\u00a0\u00a0But we know someone who is a free safety on my alma mater's football team, and he doesn't wear his pump, but he does leave his infusion site in during the game.\u00a0\u00a0Lifting weights and working out can actually be easier on the pump.\u00a0\u00a0The reason is that with a pump you get insulin in two ways, with basals and boluses.\u00a0\u00a0Basals are a fixed rate that you get all day long, and that rate can change based upon time of day.\u00a0\u00a0Boluses are what you get for meals or corrections for highs.\u00a0\u00a0With taking a long acting insulin, if you work out hard you cannot stop that long acting insulin from working, and that can create the conditions for a low.\u00a0\u00a0With a pump you can stop that basal rate so that the exercise you do (which causes you to use up carbs without the need for insulin) does not cause a low.\u00a0\u00a0Much more flexible.I don't wear a pump, but my daughter says it is comfortable.\u00a0\u00a0The sites go in the same places where you can give a shot (arm, stomach, leg, rear end), and the site itself is low profile and confortable.\u00a0\u00a0The pump can be worn either like a cell phone or you can get special cases to hold them.\u00a0\u00a0I've seen people who have purchased cell phone cases to hold their pumps.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter has a case with a strap that she wears around her waist.\u00a0\u00a0It's a very pretty pink case (she's 10, these things are important).\u00a0\u00a0She does sleep with it.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, the only time she takes it off is when she takes a shower and when she goes swimming.Yes, pumps are effective.\u00a0\u00a0The reason is because it is most like your pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0With the basal rates it counters the continuous action by your liver where it dumps glucose into your body.\u00a0\u00a0And it also provides you the immediate bolus of insulin that you need to cover a meal or lower a high.\u00a0\u00a0Generally people who switch to a pump are able to lower their a1c significantly.\u00a0\u00a0You remove the long acting insulin which works very well, but is less flexible with lifestyles.\u00a0\u00a0You only use fact acting insulin, as there is only one reservoir for insulin.\u00a0\u00a0You can use any fast acting, be it Humalog, Novolog, or Apidra.Now, this may sound like a pump is the best thing since sliced bread.\u00a0\u00a0It's not.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's more work, there are more things to keep track of because of the basal rates.\u00a0\u00a0Some people just don't like having something attached to them 24/7.\u00a0\u00a0It is expensive, as every site change will cost you anywhere from $12 to $20 in supplies, and you have to change your site every 2 to 4 days.\u00a0\u00a0It's not for everyone.\u00a0\u00a0You can get your endo to prescribe a pump trial, where you do everything you would when on a pump, but you just put saline in the reservoir.\u00a0\u00a0That can give you a feel for whether or not it would work for you.",
