            "answer": "Hi!Well, strange as this may sound, post-traumatic stress can cause strange physical symptoms including temporary blindness.The other possibility is that she gets blackouts. These could be due to postural hypotension (falling with change of position), internal ear problems, cervical spondylitis, anemia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. Get her blood pressure checked.This also looks like an episode of transient ischemic attack wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. Otherwise it could be due to ophthalmic nerve compression by a tumor or an aneurysm or a cyst. It can also be a symptom of retinal migraine. This can cause repeated episodes diminished vision or blindness. This may precede or accompany a headache. Do discuss this with your God Daughter's doctor. Take care!",
