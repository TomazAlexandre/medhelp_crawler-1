            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The report says a mild disc bulge. Unless the disc bulge is causing narrowing of the spinal canal or if the foramina through which the nerve comes out are narrowed significantly to cause nerve\u00a0\u00a0compression, your symptoms may not be due to the changes in the vertebra. The dizziness could be due to the inner ear problem. The numbness and tingling in the face could be due to neuropathy. It is a disorder of the nerves which causes numbness, tingling, unusual sensations and sometimes pain. Diabetes Mellitus can cause neuropathy. Other causes like vitamin deficiencies, alcohol consumption and certain medications can cause neuropathy. Please discuss this with your doctor, he may ask for blood tests to rule out the above mentioned causes.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "My MRI results:C 3/4- Right unconvertebral and facet hypertrophy. Moderate right foraminal stenosis. Mild disc bulge.C 4/5- Mild disc bulge. This flattens the ventral sac.C 5/6- Mild disc bulge.C 6/7- Left uncovertebral hypertrophy. Mild left foraminal stenosis.MRI of brain w/o contrast showed severe sinusitis- everything else was fine.I was having problems with dizziness, balance, ringing \"whine\" in left ear.I was doing vestibular rehab exercises 2 times a day for 3 weeks trying to help BPV my ENT diagnosed. And I was doing the Epley maneuver at home as well.Didn't help at all, but I think (in my non-doctor opinion) I have caused a problem with nerves in my neck from repetitive neck movements.\u00a0\u00a03 weeks after beginning these exercises I experienced tingling and numbness on left side of face, ear, pressure left side of neck, tingling and numbness left arm and hand, tingling in left thigh.These symptoms persist after 9 weeks although there is slow improvement occurring. I don't feel like I'm suffocating from tight neck muscles anymore and I have periods where the numbness is minimal or gone. It does always come back-\u00a0\u00a0especially after I have been sitting down- riding or driving car, working on computer, etc. Upright, walking around- I'm better.Doctor doesn't think my neck MRI results are part of my numbness tingling face and neck problem at all- just part of aging. I'm 52. Up until now I was very active and fit- running 15 miles a week, doing Pilates, riding bike, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Now- I'm too troubled by my symptoms to\u00a0\u00a0do too much moving at all.Any help would be so appreciated!",
