    "question": "I was recently diagnosed w/type 1 diabetes, last November.\u00a0\u00a0In May, one of my lymph nodes on the (L)side of my neck grew to the size of a golfball.\u00a0\u00a0The node was resected and the final diagnosis was Kikuchi Disease.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, I was given Augmentin before the node was removed and I had an extreme reaction to the augmentin.\u00a0\u00a0I have blistered and peeled my entire body 3times, my feet and toes are on their 5time, and feel like they will continue to blister and peel again.\u00a0\u00a0I have been being treated by an ENT and Dermatology.\u00a0\u00a0After 8weeks, my skin still hurts and itches.My dermatologist determined that the rash I have been experiencing is related to the augmentin.\u00a0\u00a0Kikuchi can also have a rash.\u00a0\u00a0I have had multiple blood draws during the last 2 months.\u00a0\u00a0Even though my WBC's are w/in normal limits, my lymphocytes remain high.\u00a0\u00a0My dermatologist going through my medical records noted that my lymphocytes were high before I got sick w/Kikuchi.I have now seen a Hematologist, who did a complete Leukemia blood workup.\u00a0\u00a0One of his nurses called me to state that my WBC;s were normal, but my lyphmocytes were 4900.\u00a0\u00a0What does this mean?\u00a0\u00a0My md has not called me back yet.\u00a0\u00a0Any answers?",
