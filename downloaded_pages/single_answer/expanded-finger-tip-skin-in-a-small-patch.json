            "answer": "Another note: As I said before each line in the fingerprint is a split in the skin that goes down into the dermis. When the skin is dry it appears to be a normal callous with a wider grain. It seems like it is forgot how dense to grow. The skin is more water permeable than the surrounding area. It has been like this for two months with little change.",

    "question": "I have a pea sized patch on my right middle finger. The skin when wet is spongy and much thicker than the surrounding skin. If it were just a callous it wouldn't be a problem. It reaches all the way down into the dermis and will crack and sometimes bleed. It follows the exact pattern of the finger print. Imagine a thick shag rug next to a berber carpet. It pushes normal fingerprint grain out of the way. I have tried pulling a strip of it off (yes it hurts) and it is well attached. It isn't oozing, ulcerated, red or painful for the most part. If I press on it hard It hurts a little more than normal. I don't feel any material in my finger. It's just a weird chunk of fingertip that growing thicker than normalI think I may have jabbed a drywall screw in that location and I wasn't able to keep it clean due to my job. I have been tested for diabetes and liver function recently and I'm fine. I take verapamil, hctz and lisinopril. I could post a high resolution picture if you like.",
