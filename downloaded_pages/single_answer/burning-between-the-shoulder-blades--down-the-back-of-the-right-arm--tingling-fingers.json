            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your symptoms could be due to peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, B12 deficiency or due to nerve compression in the cervical region and upper back.Positive ANA does not necessarily mean lupus especially since you do not have any characteristic symptom. However the possibility cannot be ruled out completely since one of the symptoms is tingling numbness of hands and feet.This requires further evaluation. Please consult an experienced neurologist. Take care!",

    "question": "I have also seen a physician with similar symptoms. I have a burning sensation between my\u00a0\u00a0shoulder blades, and burning down the back of my right arm, sometimes the left, but mostly the right. I also get tingling and numbness in my ring and pinky fingers on the right hand. I have a lot of migraines and have had a positive ANA, but no other abnormal labs. Any ideas?This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/293356\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/293356</a>.",
