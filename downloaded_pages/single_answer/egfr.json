            "answer": "Your GFR is pertaining to your kidney function correct? A GFR of 58 is on the lower side but\u00a0\u00a0not anything major right now...my GFR is actually lower.\u00a0\u00a0You need to find out what is causing your GFR to drop,, certain meds are hard on the kidneys, including over the counter NSAIDS like Ibuprofen, Aspirin, Aleve, etc. Do not take any of these meds anymore, or take them rarely. Tylenol is ok as it is filtered through the liver. Drink lots of water, and I would discuss this with your doctor and have him review ALL of the meds you take. Fish Oil is also very good for your kidneys and organs in general.\u00a0\u00a0It won't hurt to see a nephrologist either for an opinion. I would get blood work done every year or so and monitor your kidney function too,, such as creatine, etc. Us humans can survive on reduced renal function with no issues but you dont want it to continue dropping.",
