            "answer": "it could be hypoglicemia. was that the first time during camp or did she have few episodes like that. if by any chance she is faking it she is looking for attention which means she has a problem. her foster parent's reaction makes me believe that she might be very mean to the child",

    "question": "I am working at a summer camp and we have a camper who had these symptoms today: After a period of activity sat down for a break and became groggy, fell asleep, was very difficult to wake, even was asleep on her feet while being helped to walk inside.\u00a0\u00a0We gave her juice, fruit and then some other lunch, and even had to keep waking her and instructing her to drink/eat.\u00a0\u00a0About 15-20 minutes later she slowly revived and had energy again.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like it could be diabetic shock?\u00a0\u00a0I talked to her foster mother, whose response was: She is just faking, she does that alot, thanks for your concern. click.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions as to what I can do tomorrow\u00a0\u00a0at camp (the last day) to help prevent this from happening tomorrow?\u00a0\u00a0I had gestational diabetes, so I am wondering if the same principles apply - regular snacks ballanced with protein and carb?\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could do more to help her, but when a parent is in denial I don't know what I can do.\u00a0\u00a0We pray and do all we can.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, any thoughts would be really appreciated.",
