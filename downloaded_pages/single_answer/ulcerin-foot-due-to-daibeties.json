            "answer": "Hi there!Diabetic ulcer formation occurs due to a number of factors, the important ones including lack of sensitivity to injury due to neuropathy and high blood sugar levels. Uncontrolled diabetes may further hamper the blood supply and the healing process.While strict diabetic control is essential for ulcer healing; management would also depend on the extent, severity, associated complications etc. and may range from antibiotic coverage and control of blood sugar levels to amputation. Without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to comment specifically on the situation. It would be best to have this evaluated by an internist or a general surgeon for suggestion of an appropriate management plan.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
