            "answer": "I take it you've been tested for P.A.D.? Pain and swelling in the legs can be caused from several things. Diabetes, heart problems, P.A.D. Have you had a stress test done? That's a better test than an EKG to check your heart. What are your blood sugar levels? How much salt is in your diet?\u00a0\u00a0Remar",
