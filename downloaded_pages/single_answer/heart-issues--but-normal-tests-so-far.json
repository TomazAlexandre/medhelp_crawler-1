            "answer": "If I got those results, I'd celebrate.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a health professional, but after dealing with some serious heart issues the last fifteen years I'd had dozens and dozens of tests.When you see 'normal' attached to your report, that is just that.\u00a0\u00a0When we see the word 'Trivial', this is to my thinking normal, especially referring to regurgitation.\u00a0\u00a0There probably isn't a person on the planet that has a 100% tight seal, everyone leaks a little bit.\u00a0\u00a0It is only when the valves get cholesterol coated that you see more advanced disease.\u00a0\u00a0Cardiologists use the words Trivial, Mild, Moderate, Moderate-Severe, and Severe when referring to conditions.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure you have had blood tests; how are your cholesterol levels, diabetes readings, weight?\u00a0\u00a0Do you smoke?\u00a0\u00a0What is your stress level?\u00a0\u00a0These are things to lead to heart problems.Yes, there are additional tests, the next thing will be a nuclear stress test, and perhaps an angiogram where a wire is inserted through your groin to the heart and radiation is used to view your heart function.I'd trust the doctors diagnosis, work on physical/diet issues and see if your symptoms disappear.\u00a0\u00a0I was where you were 30 years ago but didn't improve my lifestyle which led to serious heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0I find it hard to walk to the mailbox 100 yards away.\u00a0\u00a0I'd stay away from the popular over the counter 'cures', follow the doctor's diet and exercise ideas.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us informed.",

    "question": "For the past two months I've had heart palpitations, felt short of breath often, and had no tolerance for exercise. My heart pounds from walking up the stairs. I've also felt dizzy and had pain or heaviness in my left arm at times.I have had the following tests so far:EKG: normalChest xray: normalCT Scan: normal48 hour Holter monitor: Some ectopic beatsechocardiogram: normal, trace mitral regurgition and trace pulmonic valvular regurgitationI am quite concerned about all of this, but my doctor seems to think that the echo rules out any possible heart problems. I am not overweight and previously had a good level of fitness.Are there any additional tests that can be performed? What should I do next?",
