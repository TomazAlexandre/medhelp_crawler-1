    "question": "I have had bad cystic ancne since I was 19, I am a 24 yr old female. I acquired staph first on my chin and have a horrible scar, then I get it mostly on my chin and cheeks. I have terrible pit scaring, that I want to save up to have laser removed someday (I'm disabled and dont have the money now) I have tried bactim and doxycyclene several times for lengthy periods of time with no results, and also clindamycin pledgelets. I need to know how to kick it. I sterilize everything and wash my hands very well. I'm really careful with that. I also have lyme disease and type 1 diabetes. I need it gone, I hate my skin and the way my face looks. I've seen several dermatologists",
