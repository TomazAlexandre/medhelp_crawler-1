            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Albumin is the main protein that is excreted in the urine due to kidney failure. When the kidneys are working properly, albumin is not present in the urine. However, when the kidneys are damaged, small amounts of albumin leak into the urine. This condition is called microalbuminuria. This can occur in chronic kidney disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, SLE, heart failure and cirrhosis etc.Microalbuminuria is diagnosed either from a 24-hour urine collection (20 to 200 \u00b5g/min) or, more commonly, from elevated concentrations (30 to 300mg/L) on at least two occasions. So i would suggest you to get checked again.As all the other diseases like diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia have been ruled out, there could be chance of either kidney failure or UTI. In renal failure if it is a long standing disease there would be changes in creatinine levels also. Normal values of creatinine is 0.5 - 1.2mg/dl. And also there could be fluffy face, edema in the whole body, decrease in urine output, flank pain etc. As your levels of creatinine are normal and there are no symptoms of kidney failure, I think it is just a UTI.I would suggest that you get a ultrasound done and visit a urologist. Continue antibiotics.All the best.",
