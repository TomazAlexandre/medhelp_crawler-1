            "answer": "The recovery from surgery is variable for all types of procedures and eye surgeon is no exception.\u00a0\u00a0Causes of healing slower than normal include corneal swelling (edema) due to weak cornea, hard cataract removal, also corneal astigmatism due to stitches or the incision, there can be other problems in the eye such as glaucoma damage, diabetes in the eye, etc.\u00a0\u00a0A very common problem is fluid that accumulates in the reading part of the eye and interfers with vision (cystoid macular edema). This usually goes away over a period of several weeks.If the surgeon is \"okay\" then I would not be concerned until 4-6 weeks after the surgery.JCH IIII MD",

    "question": "Dad had an intraocular implant one week ago. Surgeon says surgery went well. After patch removed vision not improved. Dad says everything is foggy. Surgeon says it may take a couple of weeks to see improvement. Is this true? Why is the vision not improved immediately? Dad is using antibiotic drops, steroid drops, usual glaucoma drops. No symptoms of retinal detachment. (no light flashes or decreased field of vision) Dad very discouraged that vision not better 1 week later.Also says sees horizontal surfaces are lower on the left (the surgery eye) than the right. What is that about? Surgeon says this is normal and will get better. Is this a failed surgery or is this a possible post op course? Thanks",
