            "answer": "Stress fractures of the foot usually occur as a result of repeatedly carrying too much weight or doing too much \"pounding\" on the lower leg and foot.\u00a0\u00a0Weight lifting, jogging on cement or tarmac, marching(stomping), jumping, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The risk is higher if there is a disease process present such as diabetes or osteoporosis.\u00a0\u00a0When this fracture occurs in the foot it usually occurs in the metatarsal bone of the second toe and you will get a small bump in the center (ish) of the forefoot.\u00a0\u00a0These fractures rarely show on an initial xray because the bone is not displaced, but will appear\u00a0\u00a02-3 weeks post-injury when\u00a0\u00a0healing is occuring.\u00a0\u00a0An xray is the only way you will know for sure if a fracture occured.\u00a0\u00a0If this is a stress fracture, I suggest you ask the doc for a DEXA exam.\u00a0\u00a0This will test for bone density and set your risk for future fractures.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps",

    "question": "I think I may have a metatarsal stress fracture. I looked up all the symptoms and they pretty describe it perfectly. Although, before I run out to a doctor, is there any way I could feel it? 'Cause right over where the pain is I feel this 'lump' and it's not on my other foot. Thanks for any advice you can give me.=]",
