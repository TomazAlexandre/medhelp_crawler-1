            "answer": "It is quite normal not to be able to get an erection without ejaculate after doing it once.It takes time for the prostate to make the fluid again.Women can have multiple orgasms one after another, but this is not the case for a man.Thinking about doing it will also add more stress on you to achieve, and that too can dampen your desires.\u00a0\u00a0Being tired, having too much alcohol, some medications can also have an effect on your performance.Diabetes can cause nerve damage where loss of sensations can be lost.If you are concerned, your doctor can check your blood for a hormone imbalance and also if you have diabetes.",

    "question": "I'm 33. 5'9\" 235 pounds. I started masterbating at 10. I've been a premature ejaculator Since I started having sex at 20. I've been with my fiancee for 2 years now and pretty much stopped master bating . She has a back injury & when it gets to be too long I go at it.. I stopped watching porn.\u00a0\u00a0When I got with her.\u00a0\u00a0I dont have problems getting hard but after i ejaculate it takes about 4-6 hours before my next hard on.We tried condoms and i'd go soft. My thoughts were on pleasing her. First we tried the drmax for her pleasure. The first one i lasted 15 minutes was great. Everyone after that i went soft instantly.we've tried different brands. All i'm thinking about is getting her off. it's gotten to the point i cant feel anything when wearing a condom. I trust twice & am smaller then my thumb. And now with out a condom when iI pull out using that method to try & stimulate her I don't feel the urge to ***,.\u00a0\u00a0just start ejaculating. this is new .\u00a0\u00a0I am good at oral, i have an average size 5\"-6\". Was my idea to use condoms, before i get told it's all mental what else could it be? I asked yahoo answers, nobody could tell me what it was but 1 person did tell me it wasn't ED so what is it?",
