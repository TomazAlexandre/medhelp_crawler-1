    "question": "I've been married for about a year, and since I've been married, I have had increasing pain during menstruation and there have been several times when I've spotted in between menstruations (never had that before).\u00a0\u00a0Also, I have had several pregnancy signs (sore breasts, darkening of the areolae, extreme fatigue, nausea...), but every time I take\u00a0\u00a0pregnancy tests, they come up negative.\u00a0\u00a0Before we have a blood test done, is there something else we should be looking into that has the same or similar symptoms as pregnancy, like diabetes or something along those lines?\u00a0\u00a0Would appreciate any insights.",
