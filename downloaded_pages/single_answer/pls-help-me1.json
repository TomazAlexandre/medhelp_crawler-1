Recurrent or chronic fever is seen in typhoid, tuberculosis, hepatitis, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and other auto immune disorders, UTI, drug fever, sinusitis, glandular fever, otitis media, IBS, HIV, STDs, endocarditis, parasitic infestations (like malaria), fungal infections, lymphomas and other cancers etc. It can even be diabetes and hyperthyroidism.Since you have idigestion, H pylori infection, GERD or gastric reflux, IBS, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's, celiac etc should be ruled out.In women, even polycystic ovary, menopause, PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) should be investigated for.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
