            "answer": "since you had a transfusion before they began testing the blood supply for it, you probably got the exposure there. However if they found antibodies, they should have run further RNA test to make sure antibodies were ALL you had.Hep A and B can clear on their own, and Hep c as well but rarely.you need to find out what type and subtype you have and have the best Viral Load tests accurate to 10 viral cells per millileter of blood to say definitely you are free of these virus.even if you get the \"all clear\" on these, I'd still advise retesting every 3 years just to make sure you didn't get an inaccurate test or have an emerge from non-detectable to full blown, which can happen.yes you should tell your doctor you had a transfusion. the mono weakens the spleen, and can make liver virus harder to fight, but the main thing is to say you had transfusions because otherwise they may assume you have no point of exposure and hence not fully test.Not to try to scare you, but if you had any IV drug use before 77 you need to tell the doc that too as your children can be exposed through the birthing and nursing processes, my son was. He also cleared the virus on his own, which is rare, but thank God.My take, is it's better to really know exactly whats going on with you and your family, not to wait and wonder. Learn what questions to ask and what tests to get. See a hepatologist if you possibly can.hope that helps.",
