    "question": "I have dark patches behind my neck, the area under my breasts and under my armpits. They aren't absolutely black...just brown and dark and looked like dirt, or as if i didn't wash/bathe that area. Thing is, i've tried scrubbing it off like hell everytime during a shower, sometimes til my skin on that area bleeds, but the patches still stays.I tried finding remedies for skin lightening and stumble upon Insulin Resistance (IR) and Acanthosis nigricans (AN). I was quite worried then and went to see a local doctor. I was told that it's just dirt from sweat and will go away if i regularly wash it. The doctor gave a cream (Dhacort) and even laughed and said i don't have IR or AN, or diabetes.Although i'm really hoping what the doctor say is true, there's a nudging feeling in me that it's not. It's been 2 weeks since i used that cream and it's finish, and the skin is still like that. I've scrubbed like hell everyday, in fact since i first found out i had it, and still it won't go away.I am not sure if i should see a doctor again. Because somehow i know they are just gonna tell me the same thing. If it really isn't IR or AN, i hope there is some remedy to get rid of this dark patches.Those with experience, pls pls advice. I am getting married next year and it saddens me that i can't wear a halter, bareback or put my hair up because of this.Thnks in advance.",
