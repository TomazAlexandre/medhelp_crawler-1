Do you have other medical conditions such as diabetes, vasculitis, vitamin deficiency?\u00a0\u00a0If MRI was not yet done, this could help in determining the underlying cause.\u00a0\u00a0If pain does not resolve with pain medications, you may need stronger prescription pain medications or try complementary and alternative medicine such as biofeedback therapy and acupuncture. Check with a neurologist also for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",
