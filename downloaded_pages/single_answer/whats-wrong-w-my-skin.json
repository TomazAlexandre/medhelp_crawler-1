            "answer": "Hi,This seems to be cellulitis, though nothing can be said with surety without having a look at the lesions.You need to wash the areas several times with fresh water. Do not use any cosmetic products at the sites.Apply calamine lotion at the site of the lesions and see if it helps. You could take some oral antihistamine medications like cetrizine or loratadine. You need to maintain a good personal hygiene .Anti-itch drugs, often antihistamine, may reduce the itch during a flare up of eczema, and the reduced scratching in turn reduces damage and irritation to the skin.Treatment consists of resting the affected limb or area, cleaning the wound site if present (with debridement of dead tissue if necessary) and treatment with oral antibiotics, except in severe cases, which may require admission and intravenous (IV) therapy.Do get your blood sugar levels checked to rule out diabetes. Wear lose comfortable cotton clothes.The prognosis with uncomplicated cellulitis is good. Antibiotic regimens are effective in more than 90% of patients.Some patients may require admission for intravenous antibiotic therapy. Early discharge utilizing parenteral antibiotics on an outpatient basis has been shown to achieve cure of infection and improved patient satisfaction.The exact time frame for this cannot be specified. It would be best to reconsult with your doctor and get a review clinical examination.Prophylaxis for recurrent cellulitis may be achieved by treatment with oral penicillin or erythromycin twice daily or intramuscular benzathine penicillin monthly.It would be best to consult a doctor to find out the cause of your symptoms.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "What could this be?\u00a0\u00a0I am an african american of medium pigmentation tone.I noticed a place of rough dry skin under my bra strap (left shoulder), innocently picked it and it began to swell and puss began coming out until it spread over my whole shoulder and was terribly inflamed & miserably itchy. My shoulder turned terribly black and scaly.I was given the topical solution called ASAP which immediately drew out the infection and within 3 days it begun to scab over and peel.\u00a0\u00a0My shoulder was left black and the main area continued to itch but was once again smooth.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of days ago, I noticed the same rough itchy place under my bra strap again.\u00a0\u00a0I've applied the ASAP again and it's peeling again.\u00a0\u00a0What could this be?\u00a0\u00a0I first thought it was a spider bite, but since this is recurring within 2 months time, not sure.Any ideas?",
