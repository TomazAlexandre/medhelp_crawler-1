            "answer": "These are two different animals. Lantus is a very slow-acting insulin, generally prescribed for use before bedtime, once a day. Novalog is, on the other hand a fast-acting insulin. I really urge you to get in touch with a nurse-practicioner who spedcializes in diabetes. Or find a diabetic clinic. I am concerned they have prescribed these two medications without thoroughly explaining how and when they bare to be used. With Novalog, you generally must eat after an injection, and have a good chance of developing very mlow blood sugar if you don't. Novalog is not to be used before going to bed because you may develop a hypoglycemic coma while sasleep. In any event, it is impossible and inappropriate for me to compare and contrast these two mmedications in a single post. Many physicians will not prescribe Novalog unless the patient is under close supervision.",
