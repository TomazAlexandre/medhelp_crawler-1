            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Recurrent or chronic fever is seen in typhoid, tuberculosis, hepatitis, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and other auto immune disorders, UTI, drug fever, sinusitis, glandular fever, otitis media, IBS, HIV, STDs, endocarditis, parasitic infestations (like malaria), fungal infections, lymphomas and other cancers etc. It can even be diabetes and hyperthyroidism.In women, even polycystic ovary, menopause, PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) should be investigated for.With repeated infection, I am sure your diabetes status has been checked. Other than that it could be due to persistent infection. If you have been to tropical kind of climate, then malaria, schistosomiasis, Brucellosis and other worms in stool should also be ruled out. Kidney infection, genital tuberculosis, inflammatory bowel disease etc are some other causes that should be looked into. Dehydration is another cause of low grade fever so increase your fluid intake and see if it helps.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined for causes not looked into. Take care!",
