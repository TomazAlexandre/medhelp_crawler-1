            "answer": "Hi Joshua!I can understand your concerns and will try my best to address them.If you are a right handed person, then the right side of your body will be the dominant side and you may feel that the right toes or the right grip is stronger than the left. Hence, when there is no apparent weakness or muscle loss, you feel that the left toes are weaker than the right. You may also notice this difference with your grip.Muscle twitching on left thigh or knee could be due to muscle or ligament strain caused by sitting or standing in a particular position for long. The other possibility is a pinched nerve. If you are over weight or wear tight belts, then superficial nerve in the thigh (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve) gets pinched. This can causes twitches and spasms. Exercising, losing weight and wearing looser belts can help relieve twitches.The symptom could be due to anxiety. Moving your leg and doing deep breathing exercises or distracting your thoughts from the twitches will help subside them.This does not sound like ALS.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss with your doctor. If your doctor does not find any weakness in the leg muscles, and there are no brisk reflexes then chances of ALS are more or less ruled out. Chronic fatigue syndrome, electrolyte imbalance, hypothyroidism, low iron, diabetes and dehydration cause perceived weakness in one or more parts of the body.If the symptoms persist even after this, then ask your doctor regarding getting the blood levels of these checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes, Lyme's, lupus or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health.Hope twitches and toe weakness subsides! Good Luck and take care!",

    "question": "My name is Joshua Nichols. I am a 22 year male and a hypochondriac. I currently take Celexa and Lorazepam to help deal with my anxieties and for the most part it takes away the physical symptoms of anxiety. I know I am an anxious person which makes me very aware of my body. Ive notices I have has muscle twitching in my left thigh/knee which has happened on and off no more than than a few times per day or rather a\u00a0\u00a0few days per week. My concern is that I have dealt with some discomfort in my left for sometime and I notice that my toes on my left foot are weaker than my right. I have no muscle weakness in my calves of my leg it self just a odd sensation in my left foot with what appears to also have weaker toes. Is it normal for ones toes to be stronger than the other foot? Or is this loss of muscle in my feet--could this be the start of ALS? To point out it doesn't seem as though the weakness is in the foot but rather just the toes. I can still stand on my tiptoes with no discomfort and run/sprint and jump---I just don't know why my left toes are weaker than my right foot---is this common--is this ALS---is this my mind playing tricks?\u00a0\u00a0Your help would be appreciated as I am a hypochondriac just trying to get through every day and be there for my family. I greatly thank you for your knowledge and expertise.",
