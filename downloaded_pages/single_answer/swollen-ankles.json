Are you takingmedication such as calcium channel blockers? reducing such medication can help.There is medication which will trigger the kidneys to remove more fluid from the body,reducing the swelling. You should have this addressed because long term it will compress body tissue, arteries and veins. Is the swelling painful?You mention numbness in your leg from the vein removal but this is not uncommon.My leg is still numb from a vein removal in 2007.",

    "question": "I had quad bypass surgery August 2005 - since then I have felt fairly good, although I can not be as active as I once was. I have gained weight from a low (right after surgery) of 185 to my present 230. In the past month I have experience swelling in my ankles, so much so that it scared my wife when she saw them. So obviously, they have changed a bit recently.\u00a0\u00a0When they did the bypass they harvested the vein from my right leg using laproscopy, which I was gratefult for, and I have had numbness on the shin of that leg ever since. I have also had a great deal of tingling in the arms and legs, although recent test do not indicate any diabetes (several months ago).The swelling is slowing me down and making my wife fearful. I am 60 and she seems t want to keep me around for a while. Any suggestions?",
