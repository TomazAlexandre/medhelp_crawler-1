            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The MRI may be normal and yet you may have nerve compression symptoms. This needs to be tested by nerve conduction studies to find out which level is affected.Since there is thigh pain and the feet are cold, deep vein thrombosis should be ruled out. Color dopplar or duplex ultrasounds are usually done for this. Other causes could be peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme's or even lupus. Blood tests should be done to rule these out.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
