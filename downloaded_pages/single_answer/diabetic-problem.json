            "answer": "What medications are you talking about - name them? Type 2 diabetes medications fall into several classes, each class has several brands of medications under them. Knowing which ones ail you can help us help you by identifying the class which may suit you best. Then you can discuss these alternatives with your doctor.What you have described are not commonly associated with diabetes but could be other health issue/s triggered by high glucose levels. Cardio disorder is one that comes to\u00a0\u00a0mind. Have you discussed this with, or been seen by your doctor? You really need to.Also, are you eating a diabetic diet free of sugary foods and liquids, low in carbohydrates, no starchy foods, and free of foods made with white flour? Do you have a home glucose meter and test as directed? I suggest getting an education on diabetes care and treatment. For starters go to page top>click Health Tools>scroll down to Diabetes.
