            "answer": "I'm glad you posted your concerns. Your husband needs to see an Endocrinologist - a diabetes specialist - for an evaluation and testing. Having levels of 45 could put him into a diabetic coma, and high levels of 455 does nasty things to his cardio system. There may be a hidden disease causing these fluctuations [such as thyroid and/or pancreas disorder] which testing can reveal. If so, no need to panic as these are easily treatable. Call his primary doctor and ask for a referral.Make a written list of all his medications and supplements taken and present them to the Endo. Include the dosage and times when taken. These are important items the Endo needs to know. Ask about testing and whether he needs to fast [no eating or drinking colored liquids for 8-10 hrs] before the test/s. Good luck -",
