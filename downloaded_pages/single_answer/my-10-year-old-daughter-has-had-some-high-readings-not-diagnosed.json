            "answer": "Hi, I'm not a medical professional, just a parent of a child with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Our endocrinologist told us that any reading over 250 is an automatic diagnosis of diabetes, so you are right to be concerned.\u00a0\u00a0Scores can go back to normal on their own because things like adrenalin release from physical activity cause the muscles to absorb glucose from the bloodstream without the need for insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Being overweight and having diabetes is only relevant to Type 2 diabetes, the concerns you are expressing are about Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know of any known links between gestational diabetes and the child getting diabetes, but maybe one of my fellow staff members here might know.\u00a0\u00a0Research has also noted that there is a genetic component to diabetes, but there is more to it than that.\u00a0\u00a0There is some environmental factor which also seems to be a trigger.\u00a0\u00a0But remember, I'm not a medical professional, I just read a lot.I would ask your doctor to do a more thorough diabetes screening.\u00a0\u00a0The simplest of those is a urine test, the more complex involves a blood test to check for antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0As far as I'm concerned, you can't be too cautious when it comes to the health of your children.",

    "question": "I have a 10 year old daughter,I tested her a couple of times and random tests were 218,114,179.Her two hour level was 275.It seems to come down to within normal range on it's own,I haven't tested her fasting level yet and will be doing that in the morning.She is not overweight.She is about 4ft 8in and weighs 68 pounds,very active.Eats well.How concerned should I be with these levels,what questions should I ask her doctor?We do have diabetes in our family mostly type 2,I had gestational diabetes with all three of my pregnancies the last one I was on insulin for.Thank you Heather",
