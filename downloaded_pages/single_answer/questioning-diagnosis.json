I do feel that your physician should not ignore your requests for answers but do take it seriously.\u00a0\u00a0I was gestational diabectic with both of my children and with my daughter she was born at 36 weeks and was in the NICU for 10 days because her lungs were immature.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps in some way.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know if you have any other questions or if I can help.",
