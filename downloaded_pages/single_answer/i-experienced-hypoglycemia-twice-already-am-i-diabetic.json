            "answer": "What type of diabetes runs in your family?\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 is usually the type of diabetes that is hereditary.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 is adult onset and Type 1, which we as volunteers have more knowledge, is generally not as linked to being a hereditary disease.If you had tests and the doctor does not think you have diabetes from the test results, then I think you can stop worrying.\u00a0\u00a0If the doctor thought you were pre-diabetic I think she would have let you know because this would have been determined in the test numbers,\u00a0\u00a0 In the OGTT test, a person's blood glucose level is measured after a fast and two hours after drinking a glucose-rich beverage. If the two-hour blood glucose level is between 140 and 199 mg/dl, the person tested has pre-diabetes. If the two-hour blood glucose level is at 200 mg/dl or higher, the person tested has diabetes.(taken from the American Diabetes Association website)Okay now back to your hypoglycemic question.\u00a0\u00a0If you think you may be hypoglycemic I think you should visit www.hypoglycemia.org.\u00a0\u00a0I think it offers useful information.\u00a0\u00a0Watching your diet and what triggers the hypoglycemia are good places to start.",
