            "answer": "Bruising is associated with pain as it is physical trauma to the capillariesthat causes the bruising.Weakness could be indirectly linked to the bruising, as it requires energy,which in most cases when dealing with chronic issues is already in short supply, to repair the damage.Mitochondial dysfunction, inflammation and infectious conditions are usually the common causes of weakness and fatigue.In your case the weakness or lack of motor control could be causing the original injury to your capillaries and resulting in the bruising.It's not crazy to take a break from docs, but please do not take a break from your healthy ways of living to strengthen your immune system.I know you've been going through a lot, hang in there and stay in touch,even if you\u00a0\u00a0just drop a line once in a while.Hugs,Niko",
