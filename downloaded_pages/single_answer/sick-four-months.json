            "answer": "Hi, understand your predicament. You have to tackle both the infection and the blood sugar levels, as raised sugar levels can increase the susceptibility to infections. Work with your doctor to reach euglycemic levels with medications and dietary control. And the best way to get to the bottom of your sinus issues is to see an ENT.\u00a0\u00a0A good examination inside the nose with a camera might give the ENT more information as well as a CT scan of the sinuses.\u00a0\u00a0If it is a chronic sinus infection, 4-6 weeks of antibiotics are pretty standard in addition to nasal steroid sprays, oral steroids, and salt water irrigations of the sinuses.\u00a0\u00a0If this fails to solve the problem, sinus surgery is usually recommended.
