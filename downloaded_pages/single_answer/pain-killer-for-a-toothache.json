            "answer": "Hello and welcome to the forum.Tramadol is useful for treating moderate to severe type of pain. You have already been taking Metformin and simvastatin for your diabetes and lowering blood cholesterol respectively.Tramadol usually has no major interaction with both these drugs.Tramadol itself can cause nausea,vomiting,constipation in few patients. But if you are taking tramadol for toothache you can also try other painkillers which may be more safe and effective. Do talk to your doctor before taking any pain killer for your toothache. Take care.",
