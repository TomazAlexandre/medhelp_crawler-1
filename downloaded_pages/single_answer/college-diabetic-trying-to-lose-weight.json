            "answer": "Unfortunately weight management is not as easy as we'd like.\u00a0\u00a0And sometimes it doesn't make sense.\u00a0\u00a0keep up with the exercise and healthy eating.\u00a0\u00a0You may need to further reduce your carbs to get weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0 But do make sure you are eating enough calories (too few calories will put your body into starvation efficiency mode, which will make it even harder to lose weight).Can you get them to check your thyroid function: TSH, FT3, FT4?\u00a0\u00a0Low thyroid can also contribute to difficulty losing weight.Another possible culprit is gluten.\u00a0\u00a0Some people find they can't lose weight until they eliminate gluten from their diets (even if they're not celiac).A third possible culprit could be high fructose corn syrup, which is added to many many foods in place of sugar and can hinder weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0Check labels of everything you eat to make sure you don't consume this.\u00a0\u00a0It is far better to eat real sugar than high fructose corn syrup.Best wishes",

    "question": "Well, like many other people on here... I'm trying to lose weight.Here's some background info: I'm 19, and have had diabetes since I was 3. I've always been on the bigger side, not obese, and my doctors have never said I *HAD* to lose weight, but it was recommended. I've been on a pump for a little over two years. I take a multi-vitamin everyday, as well as I'm on birth control (I'm not sexually active, I took it to keep my cycle regular and to lessen cramps, Midol doesn't work). I do NOT drink. And surprisingly, unlike most college students... I eat very healthy.Last semester, I worked-out six days a week, and pretty hard - 45 min to 1 hour on treadmill and then some weight training. I quit eating pasta, fries and pizza (because of the high carb factor, and they always shot my blood sugar really high), rarely eat dessert. ALL this, and not a single pound was lost. I took a fitness class this summer, and still no weight was lost.A few months ago I switched from counting calorie points to counting carbs, which allowed me to take less insulin, but no weight loss has occurred.Any advice?",
