            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Well smoking, high far sightedness, retinitis pigmentosa, air pollution, heavy alcohol consumption and glaucoma should also be looked into apart from diabetes. Please discuss this with your ophthalmologist. This is beyond the expertise level of an optometrist.The brain lesions could be responsible for your other neurological symptoms. Hence please take a second opinion from another neurologist. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi there,Over the past year I have had some health issues. It all seemed to start in August 08 with painful eye movements and then moved on to severe Fatigue, Headaches and Vertigo.I started noticing a change in my vision about Jan 09. At that time I had several things going on including blurring, jumping and what I have been told is tunnel vision. I also became very sensitive to light and had strange sensations in my eyes. I seen a optometrist about that time to rule out\u00a0\u00a0neuritis. No neuritis and only later did she tell me that very small cataract was seen in my left eye.Over the next five months my health problems have only gotten worse. I suffer with neuralgia(numbness tingling, stabbing shocks and severe pain throughout by whole body, My whole right side has gone numb.I haven't had a hot shower in 7 months, hot water is like fire to me. I have memory problems , joint pain as well as gastrointestinal issues that have caused me to have 6 severe vomiting episodes in 5 months. I have heartburn and diarrhea(which I have Never had any problems with before). My hands and feet feel swollen (which they don't seem to be). I have difficulty swallowing and am short of breath, but not all the time. I have pelvic pain when urinating, bloating and lower back pain. My periods are irregular. I have Raynaud's.\u00a0\u00a0All of my symptoms come and go.June 1st I had a MRI which found two lesions one in my frontal lobe and another in my Mid brain. At that time my GP felt I did have MS.I went back to the optometrist the end of June because I felt my eye sight had become much worse. Nothing was found on exam. I was finally seen by a Opthamologist end of July. At that time he found Cataracts in both my eyes.He was very shocked as I have no family history,no major sun exposure, no tramua and no Steroid use. I have tested negative for Diabetes several times.I have agreed to have the surgery as I believe that my vision is effecting my life.\u00a0\u00a0It's so bad I can not drive without my sunglasses even on cloudy days and I no longer drive at night (problems with headlights). I was confused why the optometrist never seen the cataracts. I called her a she said she only saw a very small one back in Jan but nothing new at my last visit in June. I wonder if this could be a very fast growing cataract?I am now seeing a new GP who has tested me for Scleroderma and Porphyria and I will get those results in two days.I will finally see a neurologist on Monday but my gut is telling me this is NOT MS .I really feel whatever illness I am suffering from is connected to the cataracts and hoping someone could give me insight into any diseases that might fit with my symptoms and cause cataracts.Thank you so muchCheryl",
