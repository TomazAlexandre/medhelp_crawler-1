            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!It could be due to reactive arthritis which develops in reaction to some injury or problem. Gout is another possibility. Peripheral neuritis as is seen in diabetes or hypothyroid state is also possible. Generally an injury exacerbates an already existing asymptomatic condition. It could also be a tendon or muscle injury.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "About a week ago one of my co-workers didn't understand the concept of dry mop or putting up a wet floor sign. Next thing I know I'm on the floor with a bowl of salad on my head. I laughed it off and got up with a bruised left knee, left elbow, and left palm. Not bad bruises though. More visible than painful. I didn't hit my head, but my left eye hurt for a few minutes I guess like minor whip lash.A few hours later I was on my way home from work and was completely grossed out by the way my left big toe felt. (I get grossed out easily). It was numb and tingly like it was sleeping, but wouldn't wake up. When I got home I looked at it and it looked perfectly fine. It moves, it's not swollen, it's normal color....It's six days later now and my toe still feels the same with some random shoots of stinging pain occasionally that feels like I have a cut on my toe (which I don't) and someone is squeezing a lemon in it. Yesterday my right toe started to numb up and today it's starting to get painful like the other one. It's driving me INSANE!Does anyoe know what it could be????",
