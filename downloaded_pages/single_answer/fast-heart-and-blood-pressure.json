    "question": "Dear doctors and members,I am 27, male, 178 cm and 79 kilos and generally in fit condition.Lately, for last 3 consecutive days, I have been having fast heart rate, about 102 bpm. I measured this rate at other times, it was 100 bpm approximately, right now as I type its 96bpm.We have minimal medical facilities where I am, for next week or so. However, upon having my blood pressure checked by the nurse, it was 140/90.I have family history of diabetes and blood pressure. I have also been having plenty of coffee ( 6 cups) almost on empty stomachs every day for last few days.Also going though anxiety due to relationship issues.Can someone please help me find a cause of fast heart beat and blood pressure,\u00a0\u00a0with those above symptoms. Is it something that is a matter of concern and should see a medical practitioner? Or Can I just wait, to relax to lower level of anxiety and then visit a doctor?I dont smoke and drink very little alcohol.Thank you.Steve",
