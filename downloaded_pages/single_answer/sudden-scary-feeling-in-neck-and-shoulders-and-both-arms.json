            "answer": "I would go right away to a doctor or emergency room. My husband awoke one morning a year ago, saying his arms felt \"weird\". He couldn't really explain the feeling. We had been moving furniture and boxes because of water damage in the house, and we thought it could be that. Because his Dad died at age 52, and younger brother age 65, and I knew that can be a sign of a heart attack,even though He had no other signs or pain.I called the doctors office. Because of his history, they had him got to the emergency room, where they found a 85% blockage in his artery, and he had a stent put in the next morning. They said had he not gone in, he probably would have had a massive heart attack. He has had no problems since.",
