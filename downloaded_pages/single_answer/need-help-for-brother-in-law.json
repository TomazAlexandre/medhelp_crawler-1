            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. Cerebral atrophy occurs when brain tissues lose cells (neurons) or in simple language brain shrinks.\u00a0\u00a0Common reasons could be stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, brain infections, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. Common symptoms could be dementia, fits, and language disorders. Unfortunately there is no permanent cure of the condition, rehabilitation is the only effective way to help the patient regain function to the possible extent and prevent from permanent losses. If rehabilitation program is appropriately instituted, most of the stroke patients can regain maximum functions with appropriate therapy, training and support services. For coordinated rehabilitation program a team of a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist and a speech-language pathologist, a nutritionist work together to help you in your recovery. Therefore, I would suggest following the suggestion made by them and recovery will be although slow but most of the functions may be restored. Hope this helps.",
