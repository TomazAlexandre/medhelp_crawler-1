    "question": "Hi everyone. Recently I had blood work done by my endocrinologist. He did a whole thyroid panel, diabetes panel and hormone testing. Everything was fine, except my A1C was just a bit high, two numbers over the normal, and I had an elevated dhea. My gynecologist also got the results and they are both thinking pcos. I do have some pcos symptoms such as weight gain and facial hair. But my periods are completely normal. Heavy but normal. Right on time every month. I thought to have pcos you had to skip periods. I'm confused. Any feedback would be appreciated.",
