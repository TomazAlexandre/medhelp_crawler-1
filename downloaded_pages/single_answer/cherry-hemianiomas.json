            "answer": "Hello,Cherry angiomas are benign lesions and are not skin cancer but the sudden appearance of multiple cutaneous lesions always should raise concerns that the lesions may accompany the development of an internal malignancy. Also sometimes malinomas may resemble cherry hamangiomas and so biopsy should always be done for suspicious looking lesions.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
