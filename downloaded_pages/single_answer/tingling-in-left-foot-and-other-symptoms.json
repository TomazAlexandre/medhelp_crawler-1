            "answer": "Hi,For the tingling in your left foot, I think peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes mellitus, Hypothyroidism, alcoholism, lupus, kidney and liver diseases, tarsal tunnel syndrome could be the causes.Dizziness is due to diseases of the ear, infections, Meniere's disease, decreased blood supply to brain, diseases of the eye.As a combination, yous symptoms do not point to one disease. Please consult a neurologist.RegardsRegards",

    "question": "I am a 26 year old male, with no medical history until 4 months ago. Good health uptil then.I have had now tingling/buzzing sensation under the front of my footh for two weeks. It feels kind of like a cell phone vibrating, then going away for a second, then vibrating again. It is constant.I would normally not think to much about this, but I wonder if it is related to some other symptoms I am having.About 4 months ago I felt sick and had a headache for 3 days straight (24/7 would wake up at night and it was there), then when the headache subsided I got dizzy. With dizzy I mean both a weak vertigo sensation, like being on a boat (but not strong feeling).\u00a0\u00a0I cant stand with my eyes closed and one feet in front of the other for much more than 10 seconds.I also feel \"brain-foggy\" and my visual seems \"off\" without being able to pinpoint it. Tired. I also just feel bad when I wake up, like hungover. I frequently get very dizzy and uncomfortable after a large meal.Sometimes I get this feeling that I am not getting enough air (which gave me panic attacks). I have no problems excersising and I am just as strong as before, but after a heavy workout my head feels really hot INSIDE and like there is pressure. I can best describe it like working out after a cold or influenza.My troath feels dry and sore sometimes, like the beginning troath infection, but never seems to break out.I also have some issues with my right eye, busted bloodvessels, from an eye infection (chlamydia trauchoma) , that causes it to feel dry/hot and causes muscle tension, but that could possibly not be related.My family doctor put it down to anxiety, and I would love it to be just that, but I dont really feel anxious. I dont get panic attacks either. I had some bloodwork done (No STD's, blood pressure ok, no bug bites). Honestly some of it is probably worsened by thinking about it, but the fact is I just feel like **** many days.Could this be neurological?",
