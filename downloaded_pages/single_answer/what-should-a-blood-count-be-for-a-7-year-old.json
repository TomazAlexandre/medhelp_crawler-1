            "answer": "I have been a type 1 diabetic for 35 years, and I assure you that she can have a long and healthy life as an insulin-dependent diabetic. I was diagnosed long before the breakthroughs in treatment that we have nowadays, and even so have maintained wonderful complication-free health, went off to college, have a wonderful career and marriage and two now-grown children. As the family adjusts to the routine, I assure you that this child can have a very normal and wonderful life. I would encourage your daughter to go to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) web site and send an e-mail using the \"newly diagnosed\" link. There is a wealth of information and support available and our online diabetes support team can match your daughter up with another mom of a child about the same age for mentoring and support as she learns about how to care for your granddaughter's diabetes.Now to answer your question. Different doctors state slightly different goal ranges for a child's blood sugar, and in active children usually tend to want the glucose slightly high rather than slightly low, for hypoglycemic episodes are frightening for all concerned. But I am going to give you the numbers considered by most to be the optimum goal for diabetics:Before meals, between 70-126 is the ideal, although some doctors raise the 70 to an 80 to prevent hypoglycemic episodes. Again, I warn you that children are usually not kept as tightly controlled as teens and adult type 1 diabetics. So your daughter needs to ask the pediatric endocrinologist what his goal is for your granddaughter, for it probably is slightly higher than the numbers I quote.Fluctuation is to be expected throughout the day, for it is IMPOSSIBLE to keep a child's blood sugar in the perfect range at all times, for activity levels change throughout the day. If your daughter were to do finger pricks every 3 hours, she will see a wide range of numbers as glucose levels go up and down all day. So tell your daughter not to panic over glucose numbers that bounce around... we simply treat the highs with appropriate insulin and the lows with juice or other quickly-digested carbs to raise the glucose, and then we move on to the next glucose test. It will get easier in time and in a few years the routine will be just that: routine. High or low numbers are simply information that allow you to adjust the child's food and medication, so don't fall into the trap of beating yourselves up over high or low numbers. The overal AVERAGE of all these numbers is what matters, not one particular test.Please do tell your daughter to check out the JDRF web site, for we can help her, one-on-one, through our Online Diabetes Support Team.
