            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, the symptoms could be due to anxiety disorder. However, please discuss with your doctor. You should rule out the possibility of anemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes, lupus and low or high BP. You may be tested for other conditions like MS if your doctor feels you could be suffering from it. Going to the doctor may help reduce your anxiety if your tests are fine and in case something is caught, it can be treated.Please consult your doctor regarding this and also regarding anxiety issues. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "So it all started out of the blue. I was fine for a couple of years, then I has a panic attack one evening (didn't feel particularly anxious about anything in particular) and during the following days, I had a few more. This then turned into a feeling of dread and anxiety for a few weeks later. Around this time, I also had breathing difficulties and dizzines at times and felt pretty bad.For a few weeks after, the symptoms got better but came and went and others seem to come along. I get this buzzing feeling in my hands and feet, I feel anxious for no reason, detached and in a dream, quite tired and all my muscles seem to shake when I use them (but no actual weakness). All these symptoms seem to come and go - even on days when I don't feel too anxious. Are these symptoms typical of someone with an anxiety disorder or possibly something else causing them? I am quite a hypochondriac and I sometimes wonder if these symptoms are due to lyme disease / ms etc. Any reassurance would be great! I am seeing my doctor soon",
