            "answer": "Hi and welcome,I really don't know very much about either condition, we've had people over the years that thought their symptoms might be MS but have ended up being diagnosed with a Thyroid conditions, Sjogrene's or peripheral nervous system conditions. I don't know if this will help but Sjogrene's has an association with sensory neuronopathy (Ganglionopathy)\u00a0\u00a0see link below...http://www.news-medical.net/health/Sensory-neuronopathy-and-Sjogrene28099s-syndrome.aspxIn relation to the LP results, assuming \"paired obands\" means the same number of obands was found in both your blood and spinal fluid serum.....Obands associated with MS are unique to the serum or in other words 2+ additional obands that were not in the blood.Reflexes are graded from 0 to 4, 0 is absent reflex (hypo reflex) and 4 is repeating reflex (hyper reflex ie clonus) both are always abnormal clinical signs.\"Hyporeflexia is an absent or diminished response to tapping. It usually indicates a disease that involves one or more of the components of the two-neuron reflex arc itself.\"\"Peripheral neuropathy is today the most common cause of absent reflexes. The causes include diseases such as diabetes, alcoholism, amyloidosis, uremia; vitamin deficiencies such as pellagra, beriberi, pernicious anemia; remote cancer; toxins including lead, arsenic, isoniazid, vincristine, diphenylhydantoin. Neuropathies can be predominantly sensory, motor, or mixed and therefore can affect any or all components of the reflex arc (see Adams and Asbury, 1970, for a good discussion). Muscle diseases do not produce a disturbance of the stretch reflex unless the muscle is rendered too weak to contract. This occasionally occurs in diseases such as polymyositis and muscular dystrophy.\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK396/Hope that helps.......JJ",

    "question": "Hi. I hope no one minds me being here for a short while.\u00a0\u00a0I have many of the symptoms of MS but my main autoimmune disease is one called Sjogrens Syndrome, although I'm hypothyroid too.However I'm struggling to find others who share my MS-like symptoms i.e. Severe fatigue, widespread small fibre neuropathy, disequillibrium, bladder, bowel and sexual disfunction and something my neurologist calls Ganglionopathy - which is making my arms feel increasingly leaden and weak. I also have tinnitus 24/7 now and never know which symptoms are neurological or not.I'm waiting for further nerve conduction tests to see if my large nerve fibres are now being involved. Told this could be months away though.Can anyone here tell me whether having no reflexes in arms is particularly significant and how paired o bands differ to what is usually found in CSF with MS?",
