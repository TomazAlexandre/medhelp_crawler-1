    "question": "I am feeling that I am dripping, but it is just\u00a0\u00a0a sensation. When I get the sensation, I go to the bathroom and I can urinate, but nothing in the amount that would suggest the feeling of urgency that I experience. After urinating, the sensation goes away, but it often returns about 15 minutes later and I usually continue to have the sensation until I urinate again. I get the sensation most often when I am at work sitting at a desk or leaning over a table. What may be the problem and what should I do? What is the remedy?",
