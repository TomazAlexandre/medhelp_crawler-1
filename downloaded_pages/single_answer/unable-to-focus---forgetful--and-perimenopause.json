            "answer": "There are many things that can cause memory loss; perimenopause is certainly one of the main ones given your other symptoms. The most common reason that memory is affected by menopause is the lowering of estrogen levels. That in turn affects REM sleep, a part of sleep needed for restfulness.The easiest way to find out if the problem is due to perimenopause is to try to get some sleep. Either using a sleep medication such as Lunesta or Rozerium, or by trying a course of estrogen, either as a birth control pill or other combinations that\u00a0\u00a0your doctor could discuss with you. Things should be noticeably better in a few weeks or so if that is the cause.However, other causes such as anxiety, depression, thyroid disease, diabetes, and others can be the cause of your symptoms as well. It is also important to discuss these possibilities with your doctor to be certain you sleep, feel better, and have a better memory, especially if estrogen does not make you feel much better within a month.Machelle M.
