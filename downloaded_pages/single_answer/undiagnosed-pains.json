            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Well, the pain can be due to diabetic neuropathy. It can also be due to ViB12 and Vit D deficiency. Another possibility is compression of spinal nerves at the cervical level causing generalized body pains. Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome is another possibility.The pains can also be due to peripheral vascular disease which is common in diabetes. This possibility should also be seriously considered as the pain is mainly in legs, feet, hands and arms. Doppler studies or angiograms can be diagnostic. Also get gylcosylated hemoglobin done to know whether the blood sugar control over past 3 months has been good or not. At times poor sugar control can be the cause.Please discuss this with your diabetes specialist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
