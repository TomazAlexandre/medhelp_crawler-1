            "answer": "Hello,the 100 is 'prediabetic', the 132 would be considered diabetic.Sounds like she is really at risk with her being so overweigth at her age.Does she live with you?To address this it would be necessary to change her diet and to increase her physical activity level.\u00a0\u00a0Would be very helpful to her if these changes can be done by the whole family instead of just targeting her.Please cut out sweets, and cookies.\u00a0\u00a0If she does have sweets they should be portion controlled (to small amounts) and not every day.Soft drinks and fruit juices and other sweetened drinks are a easy target for weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0 They should be eliminated in her case and replaced with water.Focus on meals that include vegetables, proteins, and lower carb choices.\u00a0\u00a0Would be great if she can be involved in the meal preparation and ehlp in the choices for the whole family.Has she seen her doctor about this?\u00a0\u00a0What is the feedback from the Dr.",
