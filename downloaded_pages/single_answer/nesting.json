    "question": "Is almost done! I have been at it since 8am few.more loads of clothes to wash then i'm going to bed. It was a bad idea to be lazy this whole time! Oh and my friend had a good idea not to wash baby clothes until I have my last ultrasound so I know how big baby will be. I look small so I don't think she will be that big. Considering I have diabetes that's a good thing.",
