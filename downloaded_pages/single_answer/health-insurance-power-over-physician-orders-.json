            "answer": "Hi there!This insurance company does not have the legal authority to deny medication to a patient citing side effect or drug interaction as a reason. The prescribing physician is responsible for the side effect/ drug interaction of the medications prescribed. In the situation, you could either try to discuss this with the insurance people; or take it the legal way and discuss this with a lawyer.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "My father has type 2 diabetes and has been onseveral medications which did not lower his BS.Metformin caused problems with his kidneys, gilpizide which bottomed out his blood sugar and he ended up in the ER. He was started on Januvia and Actos which helped but my mom was worried about the bladder cancer scare with actos so the doctor discontinued the actos.She gave us some samples of Victoza and hehas been on Januvia and Victoza for several\u00a0\u00a0months and it has worked well and we arehappy with the combination. Yesterday we called the pharmacy to see if his RX for Januvia wasready for pick up he said the insurance has denied the claim.\u00a0\u00a0Dad has Humanna Gold,so I called them and they said that when the Victoza was added ther combination threw up a safety alert because they are both in the same class.\u00a0\u00a0I called his doctor and she said that theyact on the liver in a similar action but that those medications are commonly given together with\rgood results. So I called the insurance company and they said they put me on hold and came back and said they would review it and to call back in 24 hours. The doctor called me backto tell me they called her and told her that theywere going to deny the claim due to duplicate drugs. She said she has documentation to show that this combination works for my dad where no others did and she would send it to them.\u00a0\u00a0Hisresponse was \"I am not interested.\"My question is how much power does the insurance company have to interfear with thephysician and the client?\u00a0\u00a0Is there a state or federal insurance commission that oversees the conduct of the insurance company?\u00a0\u00a0The decision to deny this claim could not have been reviewed by a board of physicians while I was put on hold on the phone.\u00a0\u00a0The person whocalled dads doctor was not a doctor and he\u00a0\u00a0denied the claim on the spot. What can we do?",
