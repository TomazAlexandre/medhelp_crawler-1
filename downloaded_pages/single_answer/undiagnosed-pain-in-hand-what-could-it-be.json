            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Curved pinky finger that needs to be straightened can be Mallet\u2019s finger. In some cases this is an inherited disorder, especially if the pinky finger curves toward the fourth finger. This can also be confirmed if there are other family members who have this problem.The numbness could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar nerve at the elbow level. Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause numbness of little finger. In your case diabetes could be the cause. Generally there is an associated Vit B12 deficiency. Vitamin supplements, keeping blood sugar within check, pain medications, steroid creams, and other medications are helpful. A neurologist would be able to guide you better regarding the treatment\u2014also you can consult an endocrine specialist for good diabetic control.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Within the last two months, I have developed an extreme pain in my left hand. If I bump the side of my hand or my pinkie finger I go thru the roof. I have a very high tolerance for pain, so this is concerning me. Usually wake with my left pinky frozen curled up and have to literally use my right hand to straighten it out. The knuckle in the middle of my pinkie snaps like a hinge and also the side of my hand has a clicking feel (is the best way to describe it). This is a sudden onset and I don't remember bumping my hand. I am diabetic, so this is another concern of mine.Both hands will go numb to the point I don't feel my fingers or they tingle, like they are asleep. What causes these problems. What type of doctor should I consult?",
