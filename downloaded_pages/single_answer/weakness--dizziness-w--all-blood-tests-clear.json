            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!What you suffer from is probably a vasovagal syncope or a vasovagal attack. The complex group of symptoms are mediated by the vagus nerve. This nerve is irritated by prolonged standing, standing up suddenly, stress, pain, hunger, dehydration, intense emotion etc.\u00a0\u00a0The responses are more after gastric bypass surgery. A tilt table test, holter monitor, echocardiogram etc are done for confirmed diagnosis. Discuss this with your doctor.Since it does not always happen, go back to the few episodes and see what the trigger was. Try and avoid the trigger which may be as simple as standing up suddenly on an empty stomach. Sit down immediately and place your head between the knees. Let the episode pass.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I should first say that I had gastric bypass in 2005 so things affect me much differently now.Earlier this year, I was diagnosed as anemic and started on a thyroid medication as well as monthly B-12 shots.Off and on for about three years, I have been having unexplained spells where when I stand up, it feels like I can't move.\u00a0\u00a0I break out in a cold sweat and get extremely nauseous, occasionally I vomit or get diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0I get blurred or tunnel vision.\u00a0\u00a0If no one is around to help, I usually fall and have to sit on the floor until I feel better and can see.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes food helps, sometimes it doesn't.\u00a0\u00a0I have blood tests regularly as well as being tested for diabetes...everything has come up negative for any undetected issues.I'm trying to narrow it down to what could be causing the spells I seem to have.\u00a0\u00a0They are rare in occurance but I feel dreadful after they happen and really weak.Any ideas or questions as to what might help me narrow it down would be helpful.",
