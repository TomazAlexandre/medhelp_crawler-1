            "answer": "I can't answer all your questions. Diabetes in not my area.But I do know a few things about phlegm.Like when you have a cold, the phlegm is produced by the body as an attempt to coat your throat against the virus getting in, and I guess other reasons like to trap it, as then it get blown out. Thus the worse the cold the thicker the phlegm. Maybe some virus or bacteria would be the culprit here?phlegm in the throat and lungs happens when there is an irritant present. Being breath in.Example: 2 guys \"saw this on TV\" smoked different plants in a bong to see if they would get high from something. As they walked through the woods they came across some poison ivy, and didn't know it was ivy. So they put it in the bong and smoked it. after 2 hits each, this was so much an irritant that within a minute or two their lungs fill with fluid and they drowned to death.Something to think about to add to your quest is all this is.",

    "question": "I have a lot of phlegm in my throat. I also have type 1 diabetes. I have gone to allergy dr, eyes, ears, nose and throat doctor and gastroenterologist. They all think I have GERD. The problem is I don't have the heart burn or any of the other common symptons of gerd. My gastroenterologist wants me to have Nissen surgery but the surgeon isn't\u00a0\u00a0sure my phlegm is coming from gerd. The surgeon has scheduled an upper GI for me. Will this test show if I actually do have acid reflux and this is actually what is causing the phlegm?\u00a0\u00a0It seems to me that the phlegm is worse if my blood sugar is high. I was wandering if my diabetes could be causing this problem. I do also have phlegm when my blood sugars are normal but every now and then I will get a high reading. I actually think I started getting this problem about 8 years ago when I started taking Fosamax. Could the Fosamax be the cause and if it is then what can I do. I have been on Nexium and it didn't seem to help. I am now taking Kapidek. It seems to be working a little better. Please HELP!!!",
