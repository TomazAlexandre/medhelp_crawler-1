            "answer": "Hi, I can understand your worrying concerns about recovery. Unfortunately, rehabilitation is the only effective way to help the patient regain function to the possible extent and prevent from permanent losses. If rehabilitation program is appropriately instituted, most of the patients can regain maximum functions with appropriate therapy, training and support services. For coordinated rehabilitation program a team of a neurologist, a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist and a speech-language pathologist, a nutritionist work together to help you in your recovery. Therefore, I would suggest following the suggestion made by them and recovery will be although slow but most of the functions may be restored. In addition, it is essential to know that risk of recurrence may be reduced such as by quitting smoking and controlling blood pressure. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "Hi, my mom,59, had met with a car accident 4 months back and sustained multiple injuries on her right hand and leg and contusion of spinal cord at C5,6 and 7 with quadreparesis. She had been operated for hand and leg but as spinal contusion did not show much of negative effect then, conservative treatment was prescribed. She was discharged from hospital and is currently under physiotherapy and can walk now. She had been given neck collar and after sometime had been allowed to remove it for a period during the day. However for the last 3 weeks she is complaining of muscle contractions of right hand and right feet with involuntary knee bending and stiffness of forearm muscles at fracture sites. She has been prescribed baclofen 5mg t.d.s. However the complaints are gradually increasing. She is getting the contractions of muscles(only stiffness) when she is lying down or changing posture while lying. Also note she is under treatment for diabetes and hypertension.Please advice.",
