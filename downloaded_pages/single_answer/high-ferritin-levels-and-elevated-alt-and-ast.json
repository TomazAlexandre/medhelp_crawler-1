            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.High ferritin is a marker for iron overload disorders like hematomochrosis. But this along with raised enzymes will not lead to\u00a0\u00a0a diagnosis of NASH. As, NASH is diagnosed with a biopsy of the liver which shows fat along with inflammation and damage to liver cells.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I'm a 28yr old male, 5'8\" and 205lbs. I've had a history of elevated ferritin/ALT/AST in the past with slightly elevated triglycerides I had an ultrasound done and was told I had NAFLD. My most recent test results came back with increases in all of my levels with ferritin at 620, ALT of 121, and AST of 56. I drink less than 3 drinks/week. There's a history of diabetes in both sides of my family. I'm waiting for test results to come back on iron, but in the meantime, has anyone had a similar experience and a definitive diagnoses? If the test comes back negative for hematomochrosis, could this be simple NAFLD, or with the increased ferritin does this already sound like NASH?",
