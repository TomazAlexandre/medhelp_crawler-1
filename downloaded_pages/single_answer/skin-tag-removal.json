    "question": "Ok, first off let me mention that I had a circumcision about 5 months ago. Everything seems to be normal except there are several skin tags all lined up on one side where it was cut. The circumcision healing process is pretty much complete and the skin has bonded. I do want to get rid of those annoying skin tags though and I read about a removal product called Dermatend. Should this product be trusted?",
