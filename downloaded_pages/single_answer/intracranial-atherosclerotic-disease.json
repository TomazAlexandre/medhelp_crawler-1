            "answer": "Hello,Atherosclerosis is a disease of the vascular system, where the blood vessels get thickened. It is considered to be a natural phenomenon in the process of ageing. Increased cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, obesity, family history of the disease: all of these increase the risk of atherosclerosis, i.e., these persons develop more severe and early atherosclerotic changes, but then everyone above the age of 10 is supposed to have some changes of atherosclerosis. Age, and post-menopausal status in a female are also risk factors, which you have.Scans detect these changes in the brain because the occlusion of small blood vessels causes death of some tissue, and is followed by gliosis, seen as scattered foci of changes in the subcortical white matter. Also, atherosclerosis in your case has affected the internal carotid blood vessels.As far as the cisterna magna is concerned, as long as there is no comment on the presence of any space occupying lesion or atrophy of the cerebellar tissue, it is supposed to be an incidental finding.The major area of concern for you would be the cerebrovascular atherosclerosis, specially the change in your internal carotid. This means that you have an increased risk of stroke. Age and postmenopausal status are non-modifiable risk factors. So, you should now adopt a healthy lifestyle. Exercise regularly. Eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Decrease the total amount of fat you consume. Stop smoking, in case you are a smoker. Get your cholesterol and sugar levels checked regularly. Be aware of the symptoms of stroke, inform persons around you about the possibility and contact the ER in case you have one.Do come back with other queriesRegards",

(I had been having severe headaches for many weeks).\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway, I was taken into emergency with a spiral fracture of my humerus but doctors also discovered I had lost the spinal fluid around my brain.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with spontaneous intracranial hypotension and had a blood patch which stopped my headaches.\u00a0\u00a0However,\u00a0\u00a0I am looking at my CT reports and don't understand what this means and if I should be concerned:scattered foci of decreased attenuation in the periventricular and subcortical white matter likely reflect sequela of chronis small vessel ischemic disease.\u00a0\u00a0Atherosclerotic calcifcation of the paracervical internal carotid arteries.\u00a0\u00a0Mild prominence of the cisterna magna.\u00a0\u00a0Impression:\u00a0\u00a0intracranial atherosclerotic diseaseI have never had high blood pressure nor high cholesterol (my good cholesterol is excellent) and am not overweight.I would appreciate anyone who could help clarify the findings of my Head CT.",
