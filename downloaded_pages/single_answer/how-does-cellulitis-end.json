    "question": "I've had cellulitis infection in my L. lower leg and ankle for 3 1/2 weeks. First I was given Keflex for 7 days.\u00a0\u00a0I was\u00a0\u00a0 told to elevate the foot and wear compression socks.\u00a0\u00a0 I did both, but not enough. Infection mostly went away in lower leg.\u00a0\u00a0But TONIGHT there is still some pooling in my ankle.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE ANKLE\u00a0\u00a0 EXCRUCIATINGLY ITCHES more than ever before and is painful around the ankle all the time. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s healing, and fear it is getting worse. What should I do?(Additionally, for last 2 months there is pain in BOTH ANKLES\u00a0\u00a0 only on WALKING or STABDINBG IN PLACE. I don\u2019t know if this is from venous insufficiency or an extension of arthritis in my knees which I have had for exactly 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0How can I overvcome this\u00a0\u00a0longer term pain on walking? )",
