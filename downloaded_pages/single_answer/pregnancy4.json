            "answer": "I would talk to your obgyn or a fertility doctor.. i also have pcos (and many other fertility \"challenges\") we were unable to get pregnant initially without help.. Also most people with PCOS that have trouble getting pregnant, get put on an oral drug called metformin - its a diabetes pill, but helps the insulin resistance of pcos.. i didnt' have insulin resistance, but took the metformin anyways (it couldnt hurt, just help!) and we are 29 weeks pregnant.. Good luck, the good news is that you know what the issue is and there are very simple fixes for it! : )",
