            "answer": "Hi, water in the lungs is referred to as pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema is often caused by congestive heart failure. When the heart is not able to pump blood to the body efficiently, it can back up into the lungs. This fluid makes it difficult to breathe and may cause respiratory distress. It can occur due to other causes like ARDS or kidney failure. Treatment is focused on the cause and on reducing the fluid in the lungs. Please discuss with her treating doctor, based on the test results and her clinical symptoms, he will be able to brief you about her present clinical status. Regards.",
