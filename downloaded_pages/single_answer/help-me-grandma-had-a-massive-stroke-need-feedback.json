    "question": "My grandma is 90 years old as of Dec 3. We had a great party and went out an all the family was there. She is very intelligent and at 90 was still completely independant. She could drive, hear, walk, excercise, run, do all the house maintenance, etc. she was very happy and strong and opinionated. On Monday the 10th she had a huge stroke that took the whole right side of her brain. We think it was because she had uncontrolled Diabetes and didnt take her insulin that day. After only 4 days they said her brain swelling was killig the remaining part of her brain because since she was so smart she had a healthy full sized brain and the dead brain had no room to swell. It's also bleeding. But that was from the scan on weds. They suggested we move her to pallaitive care and wait for her death. HOWEVER. She still moves all of her limbs and up until the swelling started she was responsive and laughed a bit and knew where she was and who everyone was. Now she has been sleeping non stop for 3 days. In her trust she doesnt want to be on life support or feeding tube. The neurologist said the best case outcome would be that she is bedridden. I guess what I want to know is. Will she be able to recover in pallaitive care or is this really the end for her. Everyone but me seems to have given up on her chances of recovery. I also dont want her to be bedridden though. I have her a hug yesterday and she seemed to frown and she moved a bit. She's still moving all her parts!! Just sleepig for a long time. Shes off of everything now, the tibe the meds the scans. I'm so worried. Please help in any way!!",
