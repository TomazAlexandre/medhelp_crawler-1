            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but the symptoms that you are having can be due to dysgeusia. Dysgeusia is the distortion or decrease of the sense of taste.A very common cause is deficiency of zinc and vit B3.Try taking some multivitamin-multimineral supplements for some days and see if the symptoms persist.If the symptoms persist then other possibilities have to be probed.These include poor oral hygiene,fungal infections on the tongue or in the mouth area,endocrine disorders like diabetes,hypothyroidism and cushing\u2019s disease,anxiety,hepatic and renal causes and neurologic causes. I sincerely advise you to consult a physician/neurologist and get yourself evaluated for these.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
