    "question": "Since I was about 16 I've been dealing with these symptoms:Nausea, Light headedness, blurry vision, dizzyness, weakening of muscles( mostly legs and arms), and then sometimes leading to uncontrolled crying, fainting and convulsions.I started to realize that these symptoms came on when I haven't eaten properly throughout the day or if I'm in a hot shower or out on a hot day.My doctor tested my fasting blood sugar and my lymp nodes but didn't come up with anything.I'm worried that my symptoms my be something serious. There is history of diabetes in my family but only in great aunts and uncles.I don't know what to do or how to get a doctor to run any tests of me besides taking blood.My biggest concern is the low heat tolorance I experence. As soon as I reach my limit I become dizzy and I feel a differnce in my breathing.Any information will be helpful. Thank you,Alix (19 years old)",
