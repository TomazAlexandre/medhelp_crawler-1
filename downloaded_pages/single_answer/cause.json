            "answer": "Hi,Although I cannot say this definitely without further testing, lab tests, possible biopsies etc, it is possible that your liver abnormalities are related to your diabetes. Individuals with diabetes can develop fatty liver disease which can appear abnormal on scans and cause elevations in liver tests. An enlarged spleen however is not commonly related to diabetes itself. Be sure to follow up with your doctor soon and have the appropriate referrals sent in the near future so that a diagnosis can be made and appropriate treatment started.Take care and best of luck to you.",
