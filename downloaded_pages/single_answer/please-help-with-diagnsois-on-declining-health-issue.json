It is good that you are finding people to talk to. Also, have they looked at a pituitary problem as well? Hope you find what you are looking for.",

    "question": "I am fast approaching the desperate stage trying to get help with my health problems. I know a lot of people self-diagnose themselves these days via the internet, but I have been convinced for several years now that my multiple illnesses are all thyroid related.\u00a0\u00a0Even most of my doctors have all initially suspected a thyoid condition, but when tests come back \"boderline\", it's dismissed.\u00a0\u00a0Essentially, over the years my health has declined rapidly.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 51 years old and up until about 3 or 4 years ago, was relatively healthy, energetic and bright.\u00a0\u00a0Several years ago, I began gaining weight, felt sluggish (my nickname used to \"the energizer bunny\").\u00a0\u00a0I had all the symptoms of a thyroid disorder and every time I went to the doctor for some other illness, brought up these annoying symptoms (tired, dry skin, sluggish feeling, problems concentrating, etc) but dismissed as old age.\u00a0\u00a0Two years after having \"boderline\" sugar levels (was also tested for diabetes with fasting tests), I made an appointment with an endocronologist and she did an Ac1 test and said I definately had type 2 diabetes (even thought my primary care's tests indicated just boderline) and that was a factor in how any sores on my feet didn't heal well (example, 2 years earlier I had scratched a mosquito bite on my ankle till it bled, it never healed, got infected, standard antibiotics didn't work and I needed 6 weeks of IV antibiotics (and an amputation scare) before the wound finally healed.\u00a0\u00a0Even the nurses at the IV clinic suggested I be tested for type 2 Diabetes, but my primary care doctors results always just showed \"boderline\", so I eventually made an appointment with an endocronologist to get those results.\u00a0\u00a0I am now on Janument for that illness.\u00a0\u00a0But, since then, I've become ill with a host of other \"auto-immune\" problems and am seen by a host of other \"specialists\" but I keep thinking they are all related to thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I had severe, prolonged periods where I passed clots so large I was house bound for days on end.\u00a0\u00a0Was given a hysterectomy.\u00a0\u00a0I My hair is brittle and just breaks off.\u00a0\u00a0My nails are so dry they crack and actually split.\u00a0\u00a0And my skin\u00a0\u00a0have skin is so dry I have people actually say to me \"Oh my god, your skins is dry as a bone\".\u00a0\u00a0That's with respect to the dry skin that feels like cardboard.\u00a0\u00a0My fact is another story.\u00a0\u00a0I have developed this bumpy, itchy rash on my forehead, sides of my face and down my neck that has become unbearable.\u00a0\u00a0I've been to a dermotologist who, after finally ruleing out contact dermatitis and a host of other illness, finally did a skin biopsy and told me he doesn't know \"what it is\" ... just what it \"isn't\".\u00a0\u00a0And it isn't anything he has a name for... but the biopsy showed \"auto-immune\" charateristics so I should see a Rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0(In addition, all my doctors keep suggesting Lupus too because I've developed sore muscles and joints to the point I'm awakened in my sleep night after night with pain in my hips and joints... and when xrays didn't show anything... was given sleeping pills so I can make it through the night).\u00a0\u00a0My pulse and temperature are so low and slow over the years I've had nurses tell they can't even find my pulse and had to bring in somebody else (joking I needed to wear an alert bracelet to make sure nobody thinks I'm dead if I pass out).\u00a0\u00a0I've now developed osteoporosis and am on medicine for that.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on medication for diabetes now, osteoporis, 8 mg of Ibuporpren for muscle pain, and am dependent...truly dependent on antihistamines 24 hours a day (benadryl for the evenings and misc non-drowsy for the day) to just \"help\" with the horrible itching.... and the itching on my face is so severe I am damaging my skin.\u00a0\u00a0I used to be pretty a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0Now I look like I've been severely burned.\u00a0\u00a0I see countless specialists and my primary care who are treating multiple illnesses and symptoms and although all different, only one has all those individual symptoms but don't explain the inability to concentrate (I used to be extremely bright and quick learning..straight A's, type A personality and now I can't remember what I learned 10 minutes ago and walk around like I'm in a fog half the time), or the tiredness, or the extremely dry skin that no amount of creams can fix.\u00a0\u00a0I live in Sarasota, FL and would go anywhere and pay any amount to get well.\u00a0\u00a0Right now...even with all my different doctors treating different illnesses, I'm not anywhere near \"well\" and feel worse day after day after day.\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully I have good insurance but my employment is beginning to suffer because of the countless sick days.\u00a0\u00a0I'm desperate and scared at this point.and I believe I've just not been properly diagnosed for the route cause of all my problems.\u00a0\u00a0If you were me, what would you do??",
