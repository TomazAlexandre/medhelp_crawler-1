            "answer": "Sweating is not a sign of oxygen desaturation.\u00a0\u00a0There are many causes of excessive and/or seemingly inappropriate sweating, many of which are benign; not an indication of a disease state.\u00a0\u00a0Excessive sweating can be systemic, such as whole body sweating, or localized sweating, such as yours, or as another example sweating of just one side of one's face.\u00a0\u00a0In the former group, of generalized increase in sweating are diseases such as diabetes, neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's disease and metabolic diseases such as tumors of the adrenal gland, called pheochromocytoma.\u00a0\u00a0In the localized group are many neurologic diseases of the brain and tumors or other causes of compression of the spinal cord.If your sweating really is localized to an area \"over the top of\" your lungs, you should see a neurologist to see if the cause of the sweating can be localized to a particular place in your nervous system.Good luck.",
