            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0If you had a blood clot in 2011, and have pain and burning sensation in the head then you need to consult a neurologist to rule out the possibility of a recurrence.Other things that should be looked into are high BP, pinched nerves in neck, diabetes, hypothyroidism and lupus.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
