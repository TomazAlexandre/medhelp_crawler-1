            "answer": "Dear Rene01:\u00a0\u00a0The duration and schedule for chemotherapy was determined based on research.\u00a0\u00a0That is, in large groups of people, a particular regimen was superior to another.\u00a0\u00a0In an individual, it is impossible to say whether there will be any repercussions from three vs. four cycles.\u00a0\u00a0I am certain that your physicians are monitoring your organ function, including your liver and kidneys, although these drugs tend to be more toxic to other organs.\u00a0\u00a0It is uncommon to stop chemo before completion except in the very frail.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, the only reasons chemo would be stopped early is patient is too ill (not usually just from side effects - this usually results in dose reduction), a major complication has occurred, the cancer progresses, or the patient decides not to continue.\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately, it is your choice, but I would recommend a very frank discussion with your doctor first.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps these side effects could be better managed.",

    "question": "I am an early stage breast cancer patient (neg lymph nodes, 1.4 cm tumor, ER+, Her2+, grade 3) who has completed three of four rounds of A/C chemo.\u00a0\u00a0The effects of the chemo (and possibly the side effect meds) have been very harsh (my oncologist says less than 10% of her Northwestern U patients have as severe a reaction).\u00a0\u00a0I have been very sick with each chemo on average for 14 days following the treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I was hospitalized for fever and neutrepenia for four days during my second round.\u00a0\u00a0Given how harsh the chemo has been on my body, given that my lymph nodes were negative, and that I am a candidate for tamoxifen which will stop the growth of remaining cancer cells, I am seriously considering passing on the fourth chemo.\u00a0\u00a0I am very worried about long term side effects.\u00a0\u00a0My \"body\" intuition is that my liver or kidneys may be getting damaged in the process. I also am concerned about possible onset of diabetes (I appear to have the key symptoms and will be requesting a blood test). My questions are 1) what are the risks vs. benefits of the fourth chemo; 2) what questions should I be asking my oncologist; and 3) is it common to stop chemo before completion and under what conditions?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks very much.",
