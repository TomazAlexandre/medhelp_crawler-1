            "answer": "Hi there!If your doctor believes the ischaemic white areas to be unrelated to the symptoms, he/ she is most probably correct. Also while these are unlikely to be related, there is the risk of development of further ischaemia and expansion of these lesions if the risk factors such as diabetes, increased blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, stress, blood hypercoagulability syndromes, smoking etc. are not controlled effectively. Also the tongue twitching may or may not be related to neurological causes. I would suggest considering a detailed evaluation by an internist initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
