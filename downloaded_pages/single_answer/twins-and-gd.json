            "answer": "It is most likely that you are dealing with gestational diabetes brought on by the hormone changes during pregnancy that make a pregnant woman more insulin resistant than she was before pregnancy. Some women do become diabetic while pregnant because of this, and it would not have been an issue until after you became pregnant. The good news is that this usually only lasts as long as you are pregnant and goes away once the hormones are back in their usual balance. Your babies should be fine as long as you test your glucose levels often (you will probably be given a glucometer... if not, ask for one) and respond according to what your glucose levels are doing. If high, then go with a fairly low-carb meal, etc.",

    "question": "I have twins after IVF -\u00a0\u00a02 embryos were put in. I am 17 - 18 weeks pregnant and last week's gluocse tolerance test came out. The number was 203. I've made an appt for Diabetes teaching at the hospital and two weeks later for consultation at Maternal Fetal Medicine. I wanted to know if and why this sugar did not show up in the other routine sugar tests that were done before. And also, how can i avoid all those complications for my babies.",
