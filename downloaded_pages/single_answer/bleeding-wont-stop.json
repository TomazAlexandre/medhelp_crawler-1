    "question": "How long is too long to bleed? It's been 9 weeks and I'm still bleeding. Is this normal for menopause?Last time I was at the doctor (a follow up on my diabetes) I told her that my last period lasted 6 weeks and was very heavy. She said since I'm 46 I'm probably starting early menopause, she said heavy prolonged bleeding is normal and she'll only worry if I bleed when I'm not suppose to.Well how do I know when I'm not suppose to be bleeding when it's irregular anyway? That period lasted for 6 weeks, very heavy with clotting. My next period came on time and lasted 1 week. Then I skipped the next period. Then when the next one was due it started on time but now it is still going. The first 2 weeks were very light, then the next 4 weeks were very heavy with clots. Then 1 week of medium flow. Then the last 2 weeks were light to spotting. I thought it was going to finally stop because I had slight spotting yesterday and then nothing all day. But NO it didn't stop. Last night right back to heavy again!Is this normal for menopause or is there something else going on? I don't want to go back to the doctor and feel silly if she again tells me this is normal. I don't have any other symptoms at all, just the continued bleeding and a little tired. The heavy part doesn't concern me but the 9 weeks does.",
