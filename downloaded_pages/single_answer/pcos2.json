            "answer": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0I also have PCOS and was told how important it is to lost weight (especially because I am experiencing infertility and women with PCOS who lose at least 10% bodyweight typically start ovulating more regularly).\u00a0\u00a0Weight loss is a real struggle with PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor gave me a drug that is used to treat diabetes called glucophage (also called metformin).\u00a0\u00a0It has helped me to lose weight - but VERY slowly.\u00a0\u00a0And it definitely won't do it on it's own, but it can certainly help.\u00a0\u00a0PCOS causes insulin resistance (that's why the diabetic drug helps), but be sure your diet is low carb (not carb free, but low, and stay away from refined carbs like white sugar, breads, pastas, ects...do whole grain instead, and in moderation).\u00a0\u00a0Also be sure you are physically active.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard, and even harder for PCOS women!\u00a0\u00a0But it's possible :)\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!\u00a0\u00a0Ask your GYN about going on glocophage.",
