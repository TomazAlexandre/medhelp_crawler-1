            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your daughter\u2019s medical problems. Yes low blood sugar or hypoglycemia is a cause of worry. Skipping meals, feeling hungry and waiting to eat, giving long gaps between meals, eating very low calorie diet, dieting etc can cause hypoglycemia. It can also occur if you are taking insulin or other medications for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It can also occur in liver diseases and hyperthyroidism. Hypoglycemia can be the side effect of certain medications. It can also result from drinking alcohol. Another possibility is autoimmune hypoglycemia which occurs due to interaction of endogenous antibodies with insulin or the insulin receptor. Please discuss these possibilities with her doctor to find the cause. Treating the cause will prevent low sugar attacks. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
