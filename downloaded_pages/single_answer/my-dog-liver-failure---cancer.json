            "answer": "An adult dog can safely be fasted for several days, (unlike cats).\u00a0\u00a0So I would not worry about 3 days of fasting.\u00a0\u00a0I would be worried if he were not drinking.\u00a0\u00a0His albumin is within normal range, so he is not dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0His blood work shows that he does not have kidney disease or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0High calcium has several causes but most commonly it is high due to medications or cancer.\u00a0\u00a0What is worrisome is that he has abnormal liver enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0Abnormal liver enzymes could be secondary to taking prednisone or other medications, such as pain or arthritis medication; or, the elevations can be due to liver disease, liver and gall bladder disease, other gall bladder problems (gall stone) or liver cancer and/or other abdominal cancer.\u00a0\u00a0The CBC seems normal so the spleen does not appear to be affected.\u00a0\u00a0Has your dog been on NSAIDS (non steroidal anti-inflammatories, such as Rimadyl, Previcox, etc) for arthritis?\u00a0\u00a0Has your dog been on prednisone?\u00a0\u00a0If he has been on these medications, they could elevate liver enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0These medications can cause gastric distress and as a result inappetance.\u00a0\u00a0Your veterinarian could give GI protective agents, and other GI medications under these circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0If your dog has not been on medications than the next diagnostics step would be to have Chest and Abdominal X-Rays performed and/or an abdominal ultrasound to see if there are any masses in his abdomen or chest.\u00a0\u00a0Tumors in the abdomen can be benign or cancerous.\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroid disease can also elevate liver enzymes, so a thyroid check could be helpful.Good Luck!",
