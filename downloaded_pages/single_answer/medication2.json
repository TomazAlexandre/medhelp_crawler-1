There is evidence for efficacy in a range of other autoimmune diseases, including idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Pure red cell aplasia, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)[4][5], Evans syndrome[6], vasculitis, multiple sclerosis,[7] bullous skin disorders (for example pemphigus, pemphigoid), type 1 diabetes mellitus, Sjogren's syndrome, Devic's Syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, although there are significant concerns about PML infection in SLE patients[1].",
