            "answer": "How are you? How long have you been diabetic? Its good that your EKG is normal. Diabetic neuropathies are nerve disorders caused by diabetes. People with diabetes over time can develop nerve damage throughout the body and may be asymptomatic at first then may have symptoms such as pain, tingling, or numbness in the hands, arms, feet, and legs. The risk rises with age and longer duration of diabetes. The goal of treating diabetic neuropathy is to relieve discomfort and prevent further tissue damage. It is important to bring blood sugar levels under control by diet and medication. It would be good to discuss your worries with your doctor and he may give you proper medications for pain management.I hope this helps. Take care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "shooting nerve pain at start of armpittdf520Member since Jun 2008I've been getting a shooting nerve pain at start of my armpit which happens when I move or lean on my left arm. The pain goes from the armpit, down my arm to my fingers and a little into my chest. It's a stinging pain (nerve?) which really hurts, I have to put my arm into a different position to stop the sensation. My doctor thinks it might be arthritis in my shoulder. He gave me a muscle relaxer and percocit (?). I had them do an EKG, which turned out perfect. I am 41, diabetic, and overweight (5'9\" @ 250 lbs.) The pain really hurts. What else could it be? He mentioned something about Conn's disease in passing but I don't think so. I also get the stinging pain when I do semi-circles with my arms in exercise and I have to stop from the pain. What else could it be?",
