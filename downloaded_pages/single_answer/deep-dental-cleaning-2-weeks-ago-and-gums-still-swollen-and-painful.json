    "question": "Approximately 3 weeks ago I had an abcess on my lower left tooth.\u00a0\u00a0My dentist put me on antiobiotics for 7 days.\u00a0\u00a0I went back a week later for a deep cleaning on my lower left quadrant.\u00a0\u00a0I was told to rinse with warm water and salt and to massage the gum. I was also told that it would take about a week to heal.\u00a0\u00a0After a week my gums were still swollen and painful.... I then called my dentist and he said that it was normal and sometimes it takes more than a week to heal and not to worry.\u00a0\u00a0Well, it is now two weeks after the procedure.\u00a0\u00a0Some days it looks like it's healing and other days it's swollen to the touch.\u00a0\u00a0The tooth that was originally acessed\u00a0\u00a0looks worse.\u00a0\u00a0It is red and inflamed looking doesn't look like it's improved much.\u00a0\u00a0If it is infected wouldn't it be super painful??\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't hurt the way it did before I took the antiobiotics\u00a0\u00a0Should I wait a little longer to see if it improves?\u00a0\u00a0Why is it not healing? When I went in with the abcessed tooth my dentist said I should be checked for diabetes?????\u00a0\u00a0why would he say that I didn't ask\u00a0\u00a0I mentioned that I had a complete physical, which included blood work....which was done 2 weeks prior and everything checked out fine! my glucose level was about 104\u00a0\u00a0a little high, but my doctor didn't think anything of if.\u00a0\u00a0I am really worried :-/",
