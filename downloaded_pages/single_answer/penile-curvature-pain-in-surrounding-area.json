            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Peyronie's disease is a disorder affecting the penis and may\u00a0\u00a0cause a lump and pain in the shaft of the penis and abnormal angulation o. Not all of these are necessarily present though. It is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. It is aso important to rule out sarcoma, which can present in a similar way. Factors such as history of\u00a0\u00a0injury, medical conditions like diabetes and circulatory disorders like hypertension should be considered. Take care and best regards.",

    "question": "Hello, I am really hoping you could help. I am 23 years old. The following symptoms began getting worse over time after frequent masturbation and stretching my penis quite hard to the right (while flaccid) and very stupidly masturbating when something felt wrong. My penis curves to the left, although I'm not sure it is peyronie's, as it doesn't look like any picture I've seen of it and I can't feel a scar. When I get an erection, it feels and looks very much like blood is only filling the right side of my penis. It becomes lopsided. I can achieve a full erection (although difficult), but the left side is harder than the right. Along with this, there is pain extending from the base of the left side of my penis, down to behind the testicle, but not the testicle itself. The pain also shoots into my inner thigh. The pain is all along this left area. Additionally, my penis is always going from a hard flaccid to soft flaccid and the left testicle is often dropping and contracting. I'm convinced there's some sort of blood flow issue going on. I also feel pain maybe once a day in the penis head. Based on these symptoms what is your professional opinion? A vein? nerve? Torn ligament? If peyronie's, why would the pain extend down behind my testicle and into my leg? I am currently taking natural anti-inflammatories and supplements that produce nitric oxide for blood flow as well as applying infrared heat to the problem area. Thank you very much for your response.",
