            "answer": "LAHB is an impairment of transmission of the cardiac electrical impulse that contracts the heart's chambers has been blocked and that interrupts the conduction of the electrical impulse. There can be partial block or complete block and there is a a form of heart block in which the electrical stimulation of heart lower chambers that pump blood is interrupted at either one of the branches of electrical pathway along the septum (wall separating right and left sides of the heart) prevents the simultaneous pumping of the two ventricles and often of no medical significance. If a problem there can be a procedure on the septum to correct.The symptoms given on the post could be due to thickening of the heart wall that can impede or delay chamber contraction. Also, there can be an artifact, but a lead that is not properly placed or conducting is almost always picked up the the tech and the lead is repositioned.Hope this helps and if you have any further questions or comment you are invited to respond.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.Ken",

    "question": "A person suffering from shoulderpain on the left side and when the pain comes, it radiates though the left arm and the left side of the chest. Movement of the left hand becomes difficult when the pain comes. Hot application and use of balm reduced the pain.The pain comes down throug te left side of the left ear. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus for a very long time, but the symptoms of left shoulder pain is very recent.There is imflammation on the left shoulder, similar to a sft stone.Right side has no pain. Under such conditions, an ECG was taken, and the doctor comments that there is a Left Anterior Hemi Block. The question is, is this because of the presence of left shoulder pain which descends to the left chest and downwards, and is it dangerous ? The person has no noteceable problems or inconveniences which may have resulted due to a possible heart problem. Please explain the problems which may have caused the LAHB. Could it be also due to a mecanichal problem of the ECG machine or its different probes which are glued to the chest without much grip.Thank you.",
