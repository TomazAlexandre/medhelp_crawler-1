            "answer": "Hi mommy_of_3_in_al,Let me first say how brave you are for being so honest here about your dependancy on the sleeping pills.\u00a0\u00a0I understand addiction well myself.\u00a0\u00a0It's not a character defect or a moral deficiency my friend, it's an illness.As a nursing student, what would you tell a patient who's suffering from diabetes who refuses to take their injections?\u00a0\u00a0Obviously you'd tell them that their health is nothing to screw with, that they need the treatment to maintain their quality of life and prevent their illness from progressing.Well, it's the same with people living with addiction.\u00a0\u00a0In order for us to have any hope for a healthy future that includes good quality of life, we need to seek treatment for our illness.\u00a0\u00a0Addiction is a progressive condition, just like diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You've seen that progression yourself already; in the wanting to take the pills earlier in the evening, taking larger doses, combining them other meds, not eating to maximize the high, having your husband get his own scrip for your use... Those are all symptoms of the progression of the disease of addiction.I am an addict myself mommy_of_3_in_al, I have been in recovery from my illness for for over 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0The treatment for addiction my friend is abstinence but I'd encourage you to talk to your doctor about quitting cold turkey to make sure there aren't any dangers in that.\u00a0\u00a0The other benefit about sharing your dependency with you doctor is to enlist his support in your recovery.\u00a0\u00a0He'll hold you accountable by not giving you any further prescriptions.You know it's not all that uncommon for nurses and/or doctors to have issues with prescription drug addiction.\u00a0\u00a0There's nothing to feel shameful about.\u00a0\u00a0I would highly recommend you find a local 12-step meeting.\u00a0\u00a0The 12-step program for drug addiction will teach you that we're not resonsible for our addiction, but we are responsible for our recovery.If you want to have a future in nursing, you need to address your problem with addiction.Take self-care seriously & God bless.~Trish:-)www.ChangingPaces.com",

    "question": "I am 25 years old, married and a mother of three wonderful children, ages 6, 4, and 3. I have been taking Ambien regularly for about 18 months but on and off for almost 3 years. I began taking it when i was having trouble sleeping..my mom gave me some of hers (and she has been taking it for 15 years), and i then asked my doctor about it. He gave me a prescription with no questions asked. It helped me to sleep well, and i felt much better. After a while though, the quality of sleep was deteriorating and i was taking more and more, sometimes with alcohol or other pills to get the same quality. I then started to realize that I was freaked out when i would run out, and would start finding excuses to take it earlier..i even began putting my kids in the bed earlier so that i could take my pills earlier. I take about 60 mg a night, sometimes more, and usually with something else...usually klonopin or codeine. I have generalized anxiety as well, and have started having panic attacks recenly. I am a *****...I am preoccupied with taking my pills, and i have resorted lately to doctor shoping, pharmacy hopping, and ordering them from the internet, so i dont run out. I ran out three days ago, and have no options right now to get any more. My mom hides hers because i started stealing them from her. My husband has actually gotten a prescription himself so i can have 30 more a month. I cut them up or chew them to get the high quicker. My kids are being affected because i am preoccupied with pills and dont give them the attention they deserve...although i will be quick to say i DO NOT neglect my children. They are fed, clothed, bathed, played with, etc. I am just recently admitting to myself that i have a problem..because i am starting to realize the things that i have done while under the influence and have no recollection of. I am a second year nursing student, and although my grades arent affected yet, im sure they will be. The biggest problem with this is that i know eating will affect how the medication works, so i wont eat. I eat in the morning, and up until lunch time, but after than i refuse to eat..i am 5 ft 7 in tall and weigh less than 100 lbs...I have always been small, but people are beginng to point out how bad i look and that i am too skinny, so i know that i am developing more of a proble than i will admit to...I am going on three days with no pills, and i actually feel better..although i am preoccupied with it still, and i havent slept in three days. I dont know what i am actually asking here...really im just venting...but any advice is welcome!!!",
