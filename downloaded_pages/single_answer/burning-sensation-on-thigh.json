    "question": "I'm a 30 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0I've only worked in office/call center environments.\u00a0\u00a0This may be the 3rd time I've experienced this issue over the past 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like I sat a hot iron on my leg & just let it sit there.\u00a0\u00a0Right now it's the front of my right thigh that burns. Now that I think of it, so far it's only happened in this spot.\u00a0\u00a0There's no visible injury, rash, redness, bruise, flakiness, etc... The skin looks normal.\u00a0\u00a0Cold & pressure makes it hurt more than ever and low-dose aspirin are no help. There's no itching, tingling, or numbness.The only thing I have is asthma & allergies. I'm not on any medications. I've been tested for every possible STI/HIV-AIDs & I donate blood regularly. I'm not pregnant, unless you believe in immaculate conception. I'm not hypo(er)tensive and I don't have diabetes. I still use the same detergent, Tide (no bleach) and same bounce drier sheets. I'm at a loss for the cause, solution, or temporary relief options.Please advise, any assistance is appreciated.",
