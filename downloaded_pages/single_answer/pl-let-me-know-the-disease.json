            "answer": "Hi!The lupus anticoagulant test is usually ordered if you had previous miscarriages, thrombotic events, biologically false-positive VDRL, a positive antinuclear antibody test, or doctors suspect that you have antiphospholipid syndrome or lupus. Increase antithrombin III activity can be due to anticoagulation therapy or low vitamin K. Your prothrombin time, INR, and APTT\u00a0\u00a0 are within normal range. Activated protein C resistance is seen in genetic protein C deficiency and genetic mutations leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation, purpura etc. It can also be due to prolonged anticoagulant therapy. Hence your doctor advised you to stop it. Fasting glucose of 127 is also high and should be followed up further. Diabetes is also a leading cause of thrombosis. Deficiencies of certain proteins (like protein C), increased homocystine, factor VIII and/or fibrin in blood, abnormal fibrinolytic system are some examples of hypercoaguable clotting disorders which have a genetic origin. On the other hand these clotting disorders can be acquired in certain disease states like cancer, HIV/AIDS, obesity, lupus, antiphospolipid syndrome, nephritic syndrome, heart disease, polycythemia vera, and IBS\u2014to name a few. Hence all these possibilities lupus need to be ruled out. You should consult a hematologist along with an internal medicine specialist. Also Take care!",
