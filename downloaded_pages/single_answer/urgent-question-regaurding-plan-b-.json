            "answer": "Hello,Being a smoker definitely puts you at an increased risk of thromboembolism but for these leg pains, other causes need to be ruled out. It can be due to prolonged standing during the day, dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium, calcium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease(narrowing of the leg arteries which causes poor circulation),sarcoidosis, excess alcohol and nerve compression.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
