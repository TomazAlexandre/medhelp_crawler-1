            "answer": "Hi sam,In my next life, or if I have enough time (and desire) in my present life , I''ll become an Autoimmunologist, a specialty which does not exist, so far.In all seriousness, I would highly recommend you find a good Holistic/Functional Medicine/Naturopathic Doctor.Otherwise you run the risk of dealing with numerous specialists who unfortunately do not converge in any practical manner.On top, there's what I call professional bias in each field, not to mention any of the limitations on procedures imposed by their governing medical boards.If you seriously value your health and want to avoid being medical limbo,that's the route to take, in my humble opinion.The conventional system could be used for standard routine tests and if you have an open minded co-operative PCP, he can help with this as an intermediary.I can offer you suggestions how to make some improvements, however you still have to get some ongoing competent professional medical care.Let me know more about yourself and your conditions, if you feel up to it.Best wishes.Niko",
