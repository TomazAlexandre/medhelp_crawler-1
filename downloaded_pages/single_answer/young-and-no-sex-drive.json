    "question": "Im and 18 year old male and in the past 4 months I've had a huge loss of libido. I've stopped masturbating, I only do once every 2 weeks about and its very hard to get aroused and ejaculate. The head of my penis and testicles are usually very cold feeling. I also have had a large loss in appetite.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the doctor a few times to address the problem and the tests came back fine and he referred me to some counseling thinking it was a mental issue. So I've been going to counseling hoping that maybe it will get better, I don't think its an anxiety problem because I never really have any sex drive anymore.\u00a0\u00a0I just have no idea whats going on and feel like I've exhausted all of my options. Thanks for your opinons",
