    "question": "HiI went to the Dr for unexplained weight loss of 12 pounds in a three month period, severe fatigue, and weakness. My over all health is good except for liver fibrosis which is stable. I dont have diabetes, or heart problems. All of my blood work was normal except the MVP, which has never been high. Previous reading going back to three years have all been stable between 8.8 to 9. My platelet count is normal 219. I also do not have iron defficiency, or any other factor that could play a role. Please let me know what you think.thanksFemale 34 years oldnon smoker, dont drink never done drugsno medications",
