    "question": "I am 25, female, not married, not pregnant, never had sex. For about 2 years now I've been getting extremely nauseous doing normal things (sometimes dizzy). I've always had motion sickness when I was a kid but that would only happen on long road trips, or when I would play in one of those games that spin.Almost overnight I started getting very nauseous 2 minutes after getting in a car, I thought it was weird & just took a motion sickness pill. It's worse now. I can't watch TV or use a computer more than a couple of hours without feeling really sick, & if I don't take motion sickness pills (or taken them before) I will throw up. Even on lazy weekends I have to take one by midday or I know I'll be feeling very nauseous by evening. I have no other symptoms, it is basically, motion sickness times 50.I've done several tests & I keep getting all kinds of nonsense diagnoses'es'. Even checked my ears, but there's nothing wrong with them. I am living on motion sickness pills, without them my life would be hell (I am perfectly fine when I take them). I've never had any serious medical problems, except anemia, which I also tested & wasn't the cause.If someone has any idea what might be causing this, please let me know, I don't want to live like this forever.thanks.",
