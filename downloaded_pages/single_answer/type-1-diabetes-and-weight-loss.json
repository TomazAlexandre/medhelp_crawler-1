    "question": "I am a 23 year old female with type one diabetes. I've been diabetic since I was 3 years old. I am extremely onto health and fitness, and have been most of my life. ,As I'm sure most of other diabetics I've always struggled with weight loss. Currently I am 5'9 and 188 pounds I have probably gained about 40 pounds since I was 20 years olddue to lack of nutrition from the age of 18 to 20. I exercise five days a week I run I wait live for about an hour and a half to two hours a day.\u00a0\u00a0 I am on the Paleo type of diet and eat around 1600 cal per day I cook all my meals to eat fresh vegetables nothing processed and a very rigorous with my diet but yet I have still been gaining weight uncontrollably. Now I know I am by no means I did not look overweight but this extra weight is just not normal for me has anyone else been having issues with losing weight and being a type one diabetic my blood sugars are and moderately decent control and I put a good amount of effort and taking care of it this weekend has been a huge burden on me I put more effort in that most people I know with eating and exercise and I'm not getting the desired results that I want it or even any type of weight loss.",
