            "answer": "Hi there and welcome! First thing you need to do is call your drs office and get a copy of your most recent thyroid lab test results and post them here with the ranges. Just because they say you are in the normal range doesn't mean you are optimal for living symptom free. For example: someone with hashimoto's should have their TSH supressed to a .50-1.0...no higher...or your body cannot heal properly. Being undertreated causes patient to remain sick and get sicker. So, I would first consider finding out exactly where your levels are at. Also, did you have all the important tests done? TSH, Free T4 and Free T3? Without ALL these 3 tests you cannot get a complete picture of what is going on with your thyroid.",
