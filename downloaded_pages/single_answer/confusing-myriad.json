            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Fasciculation or twitching can be due to various reasons. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress (is positive in your case), alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Try cutting down on alcohol and caffeine if you take these. Peripheral neuropathies as associated with diabetes and hypothyroidism are also a possibility (however this may not be in your case as your status is normal regarding these).Poor sleep patterns and parasomnias should also be looked into by a sleep specialist. Pinched spinal nerves at higher cervical spinal level too can cause twitching sensations on and off.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 32 yo male with a collection of interesting symptoms for which I was hoping to receive input. I am within normal healthy limits for weight.\u00a0\u00a0I have bilateral fibrillations of my forearm and arm muscles with expenditure times six months, with recent progression bilaterally to my thighs, legs, feet, and facial muscles. These minute fasciculations are worsened with activity, but nearly always present.\u00a0\u00a0I have generalized weakness, but with concentrated exertion, such as weight training,\u00a0\u00a0have not noted any excessive loss of strength.\u00a0\u00a0There are no sensory defects.\u00a0\u00a0No difficulty swallowing or speaking.\u00a0\u00a0Light cramping is notable on use.\u00a0\u00a0I am areflexive in the biceps and brachioradialis tendon, with normal patellar tendon reflexes - all bilaterally.\u00a0\u00a0No visual defects.\u00a0\u00a0No cognitive defects (apart from the distraction of this condition).\u00a0\u00a0Blood tests reveal no elevated thyroid hormones.\u00a0\u00a0No vitamin/electrolyte def.\u00a0\u00a0CRP/ESR are within normal limits.\u00a0\u00a0Slight elevation of AST on initial workup that was within normal limit on second enzyme test.I do live a very stressful life, and sleep apnea is a concern.\u00a0\u00a0I am also prehypertensive, but currently modifying lifestyle to combat that issue.My greatest concern is naturally ALS.\u00a0\u00a0The absence of hyperflexive changeshave managed to keep me from too much excessive worrying.\u00a0\u00a0I have a consultation with neuro for EMG/conduction studies, but was hoping for some input from a forum.
