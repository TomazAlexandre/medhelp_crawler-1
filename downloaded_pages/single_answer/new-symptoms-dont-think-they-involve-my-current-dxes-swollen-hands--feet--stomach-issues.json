    "question": "I usually post on the MS forum but I'm pretty sure this doesn't have anything to do with that. Only aggravating it.Run down on my diagnoses. Multiple Sclerosis-progressive, Ehler's Danlos Syndrome III, diabetes type 2 (diet controlled).My stomach issues began in November. Got to where I couldn't eat anything. Gastro specialist did endoscopy in Feb. and found inflamed stomach, took samples, but no findings.\u00a0\u00a0I have found that I can eat dairy pretty well but anything else leaves me suffering for about a day and a half. Just bloated and really upset stomach. Pepcid does ease it some and other medicine he gave me but, not totally.In the last few weeks, my hands and feet have been swelling, like noticeably when I get out of bed. Have to take rings off. I don't have a high sodium diet. And have ruled out a few other things.Just curious if any of this goes together or if it's separate? Wondering which person to go see...Any answers would be very helpful and appreciated so much...oh, and I'm not pregnant...Thanks,MostlyShell",
