    "question": "The cuticles on two of my fingers are missing and both are constantly dry and cracked. Recently I've been using a moisturizing balm meant for diabetes patients with dry/ cracked heels to treat the dryness and it's working better than the lotions that I have been using in the past but it doesn't completely heal and stop the dryness and cracking. The cuticle on one finger grew back but now it has receded again. I have a feeling that the missing cuticle is letting whatever bacteria in that's causing the dryness. What can I do to remedy this problem?",
