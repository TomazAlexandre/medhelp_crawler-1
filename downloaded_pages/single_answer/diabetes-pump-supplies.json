            "answer": "You might search web for Montel Williams program to help with meds. Also check to see if state has medical assistance available for medicare patients (Texas does, not sure about other states). I have a friend who found herself in same boat (for seizure meds though) and these were two resources we used to get help for her. Also check with your local pharmacy, they may also have a program to help. I will be praying you find help in your area. Ps if you are in Texas check with local council for aging to get assistance information.",
