            "answer": "Hello,After reading your symptoms,the possibility of fungal infection(tinea cruris/jock itch) is coming to my mind. Wash your groin daily and then dry thoroughly by pat drying,not rubbing.The damp groin is an ideal site for fungi to multiply.Also wear cotton underwears and do not share other people\u2019s towels. Most forms of jock itch respond to over-the-counter products, which contain any of several basic ingredients: miconazole, tolnaftate, terbinafine, and clotrimazole.http://www.thirdage.com/exercise-fitness/tinea-cruris-aka-jock-itchOther possibilities are xerotic eczema,senile pruritis,atopic dermatitis,contact dermatitis,parasitic infestations,diabetes and liver or kidney pathologies.Without clinical examination,making a diagnosis is tough.So pls consult a dermatologist to rule out these possibilities one by one and reach a confirmatory diagnosis.Treatment is diagnosis specific.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "About a month ago I started to itch on my inner right thigh and it stretches into the crease between thigh and private area. It has gotton worse sometimes I will get red bumps that look like a mosquito bite when its swollen. Over time it has developed into a pattern its a big red circle only the outline of a circle bout the size of a golf ball. The skin is a little flakey it itches and burns sometimes but I think that is due to the scratching. Its not on my private area at all. Please help its driving me insane and I have no medical insurance at the time to see a doctor.",
