            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Fatty liver changes along with an increase in Gamma Glutamyl Ttansferase (GGT)\u00a0\u00a0levels indicate that the fatty liver changes are most probably due to alcoholism. The normal value is 8-38. The stomach inflammation could also be due to alcoholic gastritis. As there is a problem with the cardiac sphincter, this can cause a reflux of acid leading to GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease). This could be causing the sensation in the throat.Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. This can progress to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. So, prevention or cure is by avoiding alcohol and treating diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
