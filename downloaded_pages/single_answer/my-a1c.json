            "answer": "Hi there!An HbA1c of 6.1 is more consistent with a pre-diabetic value than over diabetes. A better profile would be this being less than 5.7. Diet control/ modification and regular exercise along with medications (if advised) are the mainstay of treatment. Testosterone supplements and other such supplements should be avoided since these would also derange the blood sugar values and make diabetes worse as a side effect and are also not advisable, unless prescribed by a doctor. With the lifestyle changes, you should hopefully be able to get control of your diabetes.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
