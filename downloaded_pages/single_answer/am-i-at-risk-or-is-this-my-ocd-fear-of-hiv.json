    "question": "Hi theresorry to bother u with this but i am very anxious atm. i am currently suffering from health anxiety/ocd but im not sure if i was at a risk herebasically my mum has diabetes and uses a lancet pen to test her blood sugar levels daily, back in march i used this pen as i wasnt well and my mum thought i may have diabetes.I thought nothing of it until the other month until i heard my sister used the pen back last september and this freaked me outonly because i know that she hasnt always been safe sexually in the past, and i was scared if she could have HIV and transfered it to my mother and now me!I went for a HIV test last july which would have been about 2 months after i 1st used it and was negative.I read sooo many diffrent reports online that HIV cannot be trasnfered via a lancet, some say it can, some say that blood dies as soon as it hits the air, and they the lancet isnt a hollow needle so there is no chance.... so many diffrent stories and im scared what to believe.I forgot about it but it has comeback in my mind as i did a search online and got scared. My mum assures me that she changed the pen needle way before i used it but im not sure if she is just saying that to keep me quietis it possible to catch HIV this way? i worry about blood all the time and the net has really scared me.
