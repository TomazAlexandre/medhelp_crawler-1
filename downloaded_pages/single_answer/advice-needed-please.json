            "answer": "Hi!The problem seems to be repeated thrush infection. This can be due to incomplete treatment. Often the treatment needs to be continued for weeks after the original infection has gone. This includes both local applications and oral tablets. Apart from this a bad acid reflux can also cause recurrent thrush flares. Since your brother is already on medications to control the problem certain lifestyle changes should be incorporated such as: rink cold milk. Avoid heavy meals and eat frequent small meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, smoking, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Avoid lying down for least 2 hours after food.Apart from this there is a possibility that he has diabetes. This can also cause persistence of thrush. I am sorry but beyond this it is not possible to comment on net. Please consult his treating doctors and go over all the possibilities. Take care!",
