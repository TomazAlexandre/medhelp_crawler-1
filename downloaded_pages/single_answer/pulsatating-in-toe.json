            "answer": "\"I am having a pulsation sensation in my 2nd toe of my right foot.\"I suggest you go see a Podiatrist to rule out muscle or ligament damage, a bone spur, a cyst, and so on. If negative, what comes to mind is Peripheral Neuropathy, possible nerve damage caused by diabetes. An Endocrinologist - PCP's have limited knowledge - can help you to better understand how to manage and control your diabetes. Do you have a home glucose test meter? Test more often to understand where your levels are throughout the day.",
