    "question": "I am not sure of what condition I may have, but I recently done research and it seems to be an issue with gastroenterology. It began on Sunday when I started feeling cramps and shortness of breath after eating a large meal. I am 23, jog regularly but not recently...Is there something I should be more worried about?

I will go see a doctor straight away.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/234117\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/234117</a>.",
