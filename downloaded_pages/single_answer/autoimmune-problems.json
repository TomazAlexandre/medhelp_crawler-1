            "answer": "Hi, Welcome to the forum.\u00a0\u00a0I am a retired physician here, but was not a neurologist nor a rheumatologist and am no longer practicing.\u00a0\u00a0Your problem is a difficult one and is one that I knew nothing about - EXCEPT - my cousin developed RA a couple years after being treated with Interferon alpha (chemo) (not the same interferon they use for MS) in high doses for melanoma and was told that the RA\u00a0\u00a0was caused by the Interferon.So, today\u00a0\u00a0I did a very quick Google search and found immediately that Pegylated Interferon alpha is known to precipitate and/or cause a whole host of autimmune disorders including thrombocytopenia (low platelets), Hashimoto's Encephalopathy, psoriasis, Rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune liver disease, autoimmune lung disease, Type I Diabetes......I stopped looking at that point because I knew the answer to your question.I believe that known autoimmune disease is a relative contraindication to interferon (meaning you have to carefully analyze the risk of the disease your are treating and the risk of the autoimmune diesease worsening).\u00a0\u00a0Interferon alpha (NOT beta as is used in MS) is used to treated some pretty deadly diseases like melanoma and Hep C.Multiple Sclerosis has not been shown to be a pure autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0That is, there is no single antibody that has been demonstrated to \"kick\" it off as there is in proven autoimmune diseases like Type I diabetes or psoriasis.\u00a0\u00a0Rather, MS appears to have a combination of triggers (ethnicity/genetic, latitude of childhood, previous viral infections, etc.) that trigger the immune attack on the central nervous system.\u00a0\u00a0However, MS is more common in people with certain autoimmune diseases like Type I diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I found a study that hypothesizes a link between the MS and RA, stating that since they are believed to have similar causes that having MS might predispose one to developing the other.\u00a0\u00a0They thought this becasue almost all of their patients with both conditions have MS before developing RA.Looking at the older literature, though, there are case reports (1 or 2 cases at a time) where the person had both diseases and each article commented that this was rarely seen.\u00a0\u00a0So there has not historically been a link seen between the two diseases.\u00a0\u00a0However, autoimmune phenomena are on the rise world-wide.In the presence of an established \"autoimmune disease\" and MS there have been warnings against the use of the meds for treating RA which fall into the category of \"anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor\" (anti-TNF drugs, like Remicade and others) becasue of a potential for severe worsening of the MS and severe neurological damage.Now, you know about as much as I do about this topic.\u00a0\u00a0It has come up before on this forum, so it is something I need to learn about.As the cause of Fibro is not known, though there is a suspicion that it will be found to have an autimmune basis, I can't tell you if it is related.Welcome to the forum.\u00a0\u00a0We have several people here with PPMS, SPMS, newly diagnosed MS and people with undiagnosed neuro problems.\u00a0\u00a0It's a great bunch of people and I invite you to stay and get to know us.Quix, MD",

    "question": "This is my first time here at this forum. I have a question that maybe some one else might be able to help me with. I have PPMS,fybro,and RA. I was treated aprox. 7 years ago for HEP C at that time I did not know about any of the above, after I was finished with the treatment of 12months on the interferon and rebatrol which is just like chemo.( I thought I was going to die.) My body hurt so bad. I started almost 2 maybe three weeks after treatment going to rummy doc. and nuro. and that is when they said I had Fybro. I am not sure but I think that is what they say when they don't know. I still have a lot of pain and everything that MS has to offer. I no longer have HEP C problem and still walking so I really look good.( Ha.Ha.) I was diagnosed with PPMS 3 years ago at the Barrows Inst. In Phx. Az.If anyone has any thing that might help figure out if one has anything to do with other let me know.",
