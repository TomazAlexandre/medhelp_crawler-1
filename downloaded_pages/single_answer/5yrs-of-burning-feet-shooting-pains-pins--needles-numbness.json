    "question": "Hi my name is Graeme 36 years, MY Story-I have had the following Burning Feet/Shooting Pain/Pins & Needles/Numbness for 5 years started off slowly however has altered my life dramatically! The pain is that unbearable, I am moody/rude, low tolerance level due to pain! The intake of medication has to stop. Tramadol-1800mg daily and 2400mg of Lyrica. This only reduces the pain!\u00a0\u00a0I am sure this medication for long periods cannot be goodI am asking for help with pain management and a possible diagnosis! As the following have not been able to help!As the lists reads so far-4 different General Practitioners- Referred to podiatrists after blood tests for diabetes and low vitamin k in body Results Good however I am overweight. All 4 GP's have no idea2 different Podiatrists- Given inserts for soles, Outside that they have no idea1 Physiotherapist- Has no idea2 different Chiropractor-Regular Chiro refers me to a Neurologist after 2 years of treating now admits he has no idea1 Neurologist \u2013 Says No to Peripheral Neuropathy, he suggest possible Tarsal Tunnel(but unsure) XRAYS reveals nothing, No to Morton\u2019s Neuroma. In all has no idea2 Different Surgeons1st Surgeon \u2013 Suspects Tarsal Tunnel, no Xrays or MRI but is prepared to operate, he does not like the success rate & had only done a few before! So I decide to see another! As he had no idea2nd Surgeon - Says no to surgery as he feels it is not Tarsal Tunnel! Sends me for a MRI of the Feet (Results Good) NO TARSEL TUNNEL. SO he suggests MRI of the whole spine (reveals nothing in MRI) SO I am now booked in for a CT guided Cortisone injection to the S1/L5. This will determine if it is coming from above or below the HIP?I feel this surgeon is eliminating diagnoses! In Summary it is not Tarsal Tunnel, Morton Neuroma, Peripheral Neuroma, Diabetes, No obvious back issues, Not low Vitamin K levels.Help Bigfoot73",
