            "answer": "There are a couple things that could cause this. If this is a new issue, you may have a bladder or urinary tract infection. This causes one to feel urgency...like they have to pee all the time and only a little comes out. It is typically very painful to pee as well. Some women equate it to peeing razor blades. If this is something that has been going on for a while, you may have a variety of issues such as: over active bladder; reflux of the urethra (where unrine splashes back up into bladder and does not completely empty leaving you feeling like you still have to go); diabetes; kidney infection or disorder; or interstitial cystitis or IC (chronic inflammation of the urinary tract). I would take a trip over to you doctor and discribe your symptoms. Have them do a URINE CULTURE, not just a urinalysis. Go from there. Your doctor may also want to run a few other tests. Drink cranberry juice and eat yogurt in the mean time (these foods are good for urinary and feminine health). If these foods bother you more which is possible with IC discontinue. Hope this helps!!",
