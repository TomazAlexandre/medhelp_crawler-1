You should stick to the diabetic diet.\u00a0\u00a0There are plenty of low impact exercises--walking, recumbant bike cycling, swimming-you can try.\u00a0\u00a0Look in your yellowpages for a YMCA as rates are reasonable.

    "question": "Wanted to give you overview before asked my question.\u00a0\u00a0I've been dieting for the last two years because I gained over 90 pounds during my pregnancy and have only added weight on after it even with dieting (I stuck to weight watchers and then tried LA Weight Loss and nothing worked).\u00a0\u00a0I found out in addition to my autoimmune disorder (mixed connective tissue disease which for awhile the docs thought was lupus then fibro), I also have diabetes type II and PCOS which causes insulin resistance which doesn't help the diabetes, the weight gain, or any of it.\u00a0\u00a0Doc thinks with diabetic meds, the weight will start to come off now.\u00a0\u00a0Am on Metformin, and once the doc can code my medical condition right so my healthplan will cover it, I will also be on Byeta which is another diabetic drug which helps weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0She will not prescribe any diet drugs, and has told me to stick to the diabetic diet, and that weight loss will be slow.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 220 pounds!\u00a0\u00a0I just want to cry so badly.\u00a0\u00a0I started Lyrica back in the fall for my joint pain problems and gained weight with that.\u00a0\u00a0My joints have not hurt as much, and I won't stop the medicine because I need it to function to chase after my 2 year old.\u00a0\u00a0I think the weight gain with the Lyrica has stopped, though.\u00a0\u00a0So 220 pounds is what I'm staying at.\u00a0\u00a0The diabetic stuff was just discovered quite recently.So, how long does it take to lose weight when you're a diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0Is South Beach diet or low carb diet safe if I'm on medication that controls my blood sugar levels?\u00a0\u00a0And will walking be enough exercise?\u00a0\u00a0I thought about buying that Sweating to the Oldies tape, if it's still sold (I remember from when I was a kid they advertised it on TV with Richard Simmons).\u00a0\u00a0I can't afford a gym membership, or an excercise bike or treadmill, especially now since I can barely afford all the medication I'm on (there went my husband's raise this year!) and recover from the money I spent between Weight Watchers and LA Weight Loss which did nothing because of my medical conditions.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I hadn't spent the money then, because now that I have the diabetic meds, and the doc thinks the dieting will work, now I need them.\u00a0\u00a0I guess if I hadn't used them, though, I would be heavier than I am now, so guess have to count my blessings where I can, huh?So, will diabetic diet and dancing to the oldies or whatever excercise tapes I can find that are not too damaging to my joints be enough to lose the weight?\u00a0\u00a0And what is a safe weight loss goal?\u00a0\u00a02 pounds a week?\u00a0\u00a0That was what Weight Watchers had said.\u00a0\u00a0Is more too much?\u00a0\u00a0I was 140 pounds before I got pregnant 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0And now 220.\u00a0\u00a0That's 80 pounds heavier!\u00a0\u00a0And most of that was put on when I was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0*sigh*\u00a0\u00a0Just feel not myself.\u00a0\u00a0I hate pictures taken of me nowadays.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I've aged 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone else feel like that too?\u00a0\u00a0And how do you stay motivated when nothing has worked in the past two years?",
