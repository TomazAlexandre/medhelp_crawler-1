            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!This looks like urticaria or hives. The swellings or wheals produced after itching can be pale (of skin color) or red. Urticaria is usually triggered by allergens, such as drugs, foods, insect bites, inhaled substances, in response to sunlight, cold, heat, stress, exercise, or a viral infection. Other common allergens are pollen, mold, dust, pet dander, or cosmetics. Since you experienced an itch, just go over these possibilities in your mind. Something may strike you. In many cases, hives clear up themselves and don\u2019t require diagnosis or treatment. However if they persists you may need to see a specialist called an allergist to determine what is causing the reaction.Also get your blood sugar checked. Diabetes can delay healing.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
