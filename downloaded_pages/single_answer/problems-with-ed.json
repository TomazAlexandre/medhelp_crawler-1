    "question": "I'm at 38 year old male that was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes back in 2007, but has since gotten the issue under control. I have problems with ED only when it comes to sex with my wife. When I masturbate I'm able to maintain an erection just fine. We only maybe have sex twice a month. I've had occasional ED problems at other times my whole life, but this was usually due to being with a new partner I didn't wasn't comfortable with. I've been with my wife for over 10 years and up until the last few years I didn't have that much of a problem. Its gotten worse in the last 2 years.What I'm trying to figure out is if my problem is physical or mental, or both. I'm I addicted to the way my body responds to stimulation via masturbation? I'm really confused.",
