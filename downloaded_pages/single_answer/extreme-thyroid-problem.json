            "answer": "You must have been given a dose of RAI that continued to give you adequent thyroid function to not require medication.Things must be changing for you now.The most logical thing to do is to push your doctor to check your thyroid function with blood work. You should have been going at least once a year anyway.A TSH- Free T3 and Free T4 is a good place to start to see where you are at. I also think it would be wise to push for an ultra sound scan of the thyroid to see if you may be developing any other issues.If you TSH is anywhere above a 3.0 - (which most patients feel much better below 2.0) then you should be on thyroid replacement medication.",
