    "question": "In 3 yrs, my wife, 44 yrs old, insulin dependent diabetic with CAD, PAD, stable retinopathy, protein in urine, high choles, form smoker, form hi bld press w/ many meds -went from 3% plaque in arteries in \u201800 (angiogram) to 14 stents RCA & then CABGx4 w/\u00a0\u00a0graft to RCA closed 6 mos, & the LCX never bypassed had a major blockage 1 yr later.\u00a0\u00a0LcXstented w/ 1 BMS & closed w/ clot.\u00a0\u00a0Reopened w/ angioplasty & recoil closed it & pushed plaque to main LcX requiring another stent & closing off branch \"stent jail.\" W/in 1 month that closed & @ 2 mos another procedure b/c she had been feeling poorly & BP was low & now within normal range w/ no meds. Completely closed & when he tried to reopen it, it failed. 2 days after\u00a0\u00a0procedure she is worse. (Dr worked onartery for 1 hr straight trying to open it) she feels worse chest pressure, etc.\u00a0\u00a03 other grafts were good. He doesn't believe that she could be feeling that bad.\u00a0\u00a0She has PVCs and PACs (per monitor & several EKGs) constantly. She was on Lovenox prior to last procedure to help with angina & a cartiolipid antibody(?) found in blood. 1) Should she still be on that? 2) Plavix stopped because stents closed? 3) Aspirin stopped too? 4) Her Bp which was always hi the last 14 yrs with meds went from low to normal range now (90/70-140/70). How can that be & will it stay that low with the LcX closed? 5) With a record like this how long will it take for the grafts to close too? They were patent now -1.5 yrs after CABG but w/ a track record like this? 6) Since closing the LcX she has been feeling awful.\u00a0\u00a0Since\u00a0\u00a0procedure she is\u00a0\u00a0worse with chest pressure, jaw pain, dizziness, shoulder/arm pain, & nauseus.\u00a0\u00a0I know she's not fooling b/c she has been able to eat nothing & what she drinks she has vomited or feels like vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0Will this stablize?\u00a0\u00a07) How can a person live with a closed LcX? So far 2 arteries are closed.\u00a0\u00a08)Will her kidneys suffer more because her arteries keep closing? Thank you. I am getting no answers from our Dr.",
