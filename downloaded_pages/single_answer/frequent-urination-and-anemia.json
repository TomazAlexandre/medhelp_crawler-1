            "answer": "Hi,I\u2019ll suggest getting your blood sugar checked to rule out diabetes mellitus. You need to correct your anemia also by taking both iron as well B12 supplements. A urine specific gravity also needs to be checked. Dilute urine means the concentrating capacity of kidneys is markedly decreased which can happen in a disease called diabetes inspidus. Please do consult an endocrinologist to rule out these entities. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
