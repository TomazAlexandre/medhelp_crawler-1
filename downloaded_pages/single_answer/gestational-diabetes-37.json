I've done the test 4 times due to family history, and I've always passed! Like I said just increase your water intake and you should be just fine!",

    "question": "I went in for my 28 week doctors appointment yesterday and did the terrible glucose test. I havent been eating well lately since with baby push in on my stomach, there is hardly any room in there for food. I've resorted to candy and sweets and fruits, even thought I know i shouldn't be doing that. I ate a whole box of gushers the night before my test! My blood sugars were 180 for the test! And now i have the three hour test in two weeks. Anybody else have the three hour test and it come out looking good? Luckily i dont have long to go but I'd really hate having to keep track of what I am eating.",
