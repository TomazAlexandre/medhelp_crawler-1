            "answer": "After reading your post it appears it has two separate subject matters, diabetes and foot/leg issues. Several questions come to\u00a0\u00a0mind and are in need of clarification.Diabetes -1. Lab ranges and perception of what normal levels are are not well defined in your post. It would help if you posted the ranges exactly as they appear from your lab results.2. What does \"Long term glucose around 6.4 which is borderline for diabetes.\" mean? The term \"long term glucose\" may apply to long term diabetes care, or long term glucose care, the key word is \"care\". If it was meant as an A1c test result then 6.4% is not borderline diabetes but unfortunately diabetes; 6.4%=137 mg/dl eAG, where diabetes begins at 126mg/dl.3. Have you been tested for neuropathy, damage to a nerve or nerves which can affect your lower extremities [leg/feet]?Foot/leg -1. Another forum to post foot/leg issues is Ask A Doctor - Foot Care (Podiatry).",
