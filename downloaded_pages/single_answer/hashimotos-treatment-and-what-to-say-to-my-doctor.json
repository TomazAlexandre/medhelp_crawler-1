    "question": "Hi Dr. About 4 months ago, I asked my GP to test my thyroid. I'd been on WW and exercising regularly for about a year, and could not lose weight (yes I looked at my food choices, and no I wasn't loading on fruit). My TPO was 220, and my TSH was 3.5. She sent me to an endocrinologist, and I had a full set of blood tests to confirm these, and rule out celiac and diabetes (my sister is a type 1 diabetic). The next round was TPO 220 (might have been slightly higher actually, but I'm not looking at it) and my TSH was 4.5. He told me that this was consistent with Hashimoto's, but since my TSH was in the normal range they would just leave it alone and test me again in 4-6 months.Now, I understand that I can have both Hypo and hyper symptoms as my thyroid slowly destroys itself, so medicating me at this stage might be tricky, and in fact risky at a full dose. I'm going to be going back for another round of tests soon (to a new doctor, not out of malice, but wanting another opinion) and I want to suggest we try a very low dose of compounded t4-t3 immediate release. I've been googling all sorts of things, and came up with a set of videos by an N.D. which seemed to explain what was happening with my body pretty well, and he explained that with Hashi's the compound is better. I would however like to hear an M.D.'s opinion. I don't want to discount the N.D., but I also want to look at it from multiple perspectives.I went to the doctor in the first place, because I suspected a problem. In other words, I didn't feel \"right\". I'm starting to become depressed, and have to force myself to get out and do things as a result. I don't expect to be cured, of course, but I DO expect to be treated in some capacity. If it's dietary changes, then so be it, but I want to avoid the wait and see approach.I guess my question is, if this doctor is hesitant to try the low dose of hormones even if my TSH is normal, what should I say? Actually, would you recommend the low dose?",
