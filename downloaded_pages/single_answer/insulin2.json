            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.Lamb is a lean red meat and is a protein.\u00a0\u00a0Meat does not contain carbohydrates so therefore it does not raise your blood sugar level.\u00a0\u00a0If the meat is breaded though (say with breadcrumbs) then it does have some carbohydrates and then would raise your glucose level.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this answers your question.Bridget",
