Send some pus or scraping for culture sensitivity to know which antibiotic will act best. Other than this it can be an allergic skin reaction to jewelry or anything else in touch.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "For at least two months i have been getting these horrible blood filled bumps on my ear lobe right where my ear attaches to my head. When i went to the doctor they had no clue what it was and it has come back five times and when it gets to big it bursts. It doesnt have a lot of pus and its usually black and extremly painful my whole ear swells up. What could it be? Antibiotics did nothing for it.",
