            "answer": "Hi!If there is a localized swollen painful area then this could be due to seborrheic dermatitis. This can also result in hair fall. Another possibility is an infection of the hair follicle. Other causes could be sarcoidosis, fungal infection, or chemical burn due to something you applied. All these conditions can cause localized hair fall.If the hair fall is generalized then it is usually due to anemia, dandruff, allergy to skin products, diabetes, thyroid disorders or due to stress.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
