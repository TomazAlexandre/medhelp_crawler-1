            "answer": "Hi!Yes, foul smell from mouth can be due to stomach disorders. Bad odor from mouth can be due to poor oral hygiene, dental caries, gum disease, dry mouth, post nasal drip, smoking, chewing tobacco, diabetes, sinusitis or due to a bad gastric reflux. A bad gastric reflux can be due to lax esophageal sphincter or due to IBS, Crohn's disease or celiac disease. Do discuss this with your husband's doctor. He should undertake a thorough dental check-up. Take care!",
