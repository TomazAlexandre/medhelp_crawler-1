            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Apart from HIV testing, you must test for herpes, and other STDs including syphilis. If are having recurrent skin problems then it can also be dermatitis, fungal infection, psoriasis and eczema. All this can raise your lymphocyte count.Also, chronic stress can cause skin eruptions especially if you have diabetes or hypothyroidism.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
