            "answer": "Well have you had your blood work done to check your GFR, BUN, creatine, etc? A renal ultrasound will not always show renal dysfunction. Did your DR ask you about all meds youre taking, including over the counter? I would avoid all ibuprofen and anti-inflammatories as these are filtered through the kidneys and could be causing some issues.,, Tylenol is ok in moderation. Make sure any prescription meds youre taking are ok.. you really need your Dr to go over all of this with you. Drink lots of water and clear fluids. This condition could be temporary but you need to know what's causing this. If you have high blood pressure or diabetes, thats also bad on the kidneys. Good luck.",

    "question": "So I've been having high protein in my urine for the last few months, my doctor believes I'm having kidney issues. He sent me to have an ultrasound and it turned out just fine. I'm not sure what it is now. Could it still be my kidney's? Does anyone know of other things that cause high protein other than kidney disease. I'm a 34 yr old male.",
