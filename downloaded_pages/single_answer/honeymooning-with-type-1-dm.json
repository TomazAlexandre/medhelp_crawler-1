            "answer": "Hi,For the short term, just keep dropping your daughter's insulin doses to avoid those lows and try to figure out what may be going on. (also PLEASE contact her pediatrician as soon as possible to get this further and more specifically addressed). Puberty itself brings many hormonal changes that can alter the way her body responds to insulin. Plus, there may be changes in eating patterns, activity patterns etc.There is definitely a possible \"honeymoon phase\" in early Type 1 diabetes, and that may also be what is happening. You will need to sit down with your daughter andher doctor for a while to try and determine what is going on.Take care.",
