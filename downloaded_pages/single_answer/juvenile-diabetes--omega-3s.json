            "answer": "Juvenile Diabetes or Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease. The only real treatment for diabetes is insulin, good diet and exercise. This is not to say that omega 3 fatty acids are not good for you, but will not cure diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know much about Omega 3 fatty acids but when I googled it, it sounded as if it is a good supplement to keep your heart healthy.It sounds as if your neice needs to follow a better health plan, which is easier said than done.\u00a0\u00a0Does she an endocronologist?\u00a0\u00a0Does she have a dietician?\u00a0\u00a0Has she had any good diabetes education.\u00a0\u00a0Being 14 is hard enough without dealing with diabetes, but she must get her health in order to prevent further complications, which are a real threat to those not keeping their glucose readings at a good level.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe she needs to see a therapist in order to help her deal with the feelings she is having and why she is not taking care of herself.If you would like more information and answers to your questions I would suggest going to http://www.jdrf.org/, which is the JDRF, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation website.\u00a0\u00a0This site can help put you in touch with someone in your area to help your neice.",
