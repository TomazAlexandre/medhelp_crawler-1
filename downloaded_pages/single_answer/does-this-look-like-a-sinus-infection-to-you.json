    "question": "Well basically the past 3 months i haven't been up to par. Started as a worry about diabetes (sister has it, so i get worried, pretty bad hypochondriac) Then I started getting headaches every day. They are always on my left side right by my temple. I would get a tingling like sensation in the left side of my face and a few more minor symptoms.Anyway, I figured it could be my wisdom teeth coming in doing the damage (I'm a 16 year old male) I went in for a dental X-ray, turns out they are in and impacting, so this could be playing a role. However, there was a cloudy round spot that they noticed along my sinus. My dentist said it is most likely a sinus infection and prescribed me with 10 day amoxicillin. I am now done the 10 days. My headaches went away pretty much while i was taking the amox, but they have come back. Same spot on my left side by temple and ear. They are very short, sometimes last like 10 seconds to a few minutes. They are also sometimes in the top left side of my frontal part of my head and sometimes cheek pressure. When i bend down, sometimes there is immense pressure in between my eyes. Only sometimes though. Went to a doctor recently she said she is 100% sure it is not a brain tumour but i am still not satisfied. She also prescribed me with a longer prescription of amoxicillin, and i am going to start taking them again tomorrow.And also when i was on 10 days, my facial tingling sensations have completely gone away.Basically the point of this thread, I would appreciate if someone could look at the attached image and tell me their opinion. Do you think it looks like a sinus infection, or could it be a possible tumour in there? :s",
