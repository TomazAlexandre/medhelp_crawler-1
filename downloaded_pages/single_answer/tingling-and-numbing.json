            "answer": "Hi there. The onset of these multiple neurological symptoms of whole body tingling and numbness associated with headaches and dizziness need to be investigated keeping in mind the chronic demyelinating disorder of multiple sclerosis. This can be checked by ruling out diabetes, thyroid disorders and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis first as the culprit. a cerebrospinal fluid examination showing oligoclonal bands and an MRI brain for plaques as areas of demyelination in white matter of brain and electrophysiological testing would help in diagnosis. Take care.",

    "question": "3 weeks ago my symptoms came out of no where. I had numbing and tingling all over my body mostly in the head, the mouth and throat, the hands and the feet and shortly after bad headaches. One day I was sitting on my knees fixing something and out of nowhere I get really dizzy and my hearing decreases but only for a short period of time. After about a week some the symptoms stop. The headaches are still here off and on, not soo bad but last night was the worst, I could literally feel my purse beating on the left side of the head and my head was pounding. Still today I have a little of the headache, but I started a few days ago having sinus problems and a runny feeling in my throat and dry mouth. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night for no reason and I can't get a grip on my emotions. Does this sound like anything specific to anybody? I seen a doctor and got a catscan but it doesn't come back til tomorrow. But still I'm wondering what you would think of this?",
