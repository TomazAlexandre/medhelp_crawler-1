            "answer": "The increased thirst and urination could be symptoms of diabetes. Other symptoms might be weight loss or fatigue. These things could mean diabetes or they could not; it's impossible to say without tests. I suggest seeing your doctor and getting a blood sugar test. Don't panic yet! If you do have diabetes, it is a manageable condition though it does take some work and some changes. See your doctor and let us know what happens. Don't put it off because you are worried about the results.",
