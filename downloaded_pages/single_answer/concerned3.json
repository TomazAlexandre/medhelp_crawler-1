            "answer": "Hi there!Inappropriate ejaculation could develop in young adults due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders, peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. While blood in semen, medically known as haematospermia is most commonly caused by a prostatic venous bleed tough it could originate from the testicles, epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles or urethra as well. Other and related causes include infections (bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic)/ inflammations (50%), calculi, post inflammatory cysts, uncontrolled hypertension, diverticuli, strictures, trauma, growths, bleeding disorders malignancies (4-13%) etc. Multiple causes may be involved in a few cases. Though the condition is self limiting in most cases, a thorough investigation is often implicated to look for causes and more particularly to rule out the more serious causes. Hence it is advised to get this evaluated by a urologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",
