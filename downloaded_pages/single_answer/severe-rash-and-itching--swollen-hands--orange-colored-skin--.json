            "answer": "HiI am really sorry and concerned to hear about your mother. A whole body rash with skin sloughing off is a part of Stevens Johnson Syndrome or Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN). This is often drug induced. If a new medication was started then that is the culprit. I know she is off the medication for two weeks but at her age the body will be back to normal very slowly and it can take a month too. The very fact that your mother had acne like rash at first goes in favor of this diagnosis of related conditions.Alternatively you can think of exfoliative dermatitis, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (rare in adults) or erythema multiforme (EM).I think you should discuss these possibilities with her doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I need some help for my 80 yr old mom.She has developed a SEVERE and I do mean SEVERE rash over her entire body. It itches intensely and the skin is sloughing excessively. The skin is literally coming off in piles. Here hands are also so swollen she can barely move them. Here skin is not so tight she can barely move from that too. This keeps her up all no night so she is absolutely exhausted. I am also told her skin now has an orange tint so I suspect something to due with liver.At first they thought an allergic reaction to her Heart and Diabetes medicine but she has been off all of that and on prednisone for over two weeks with no help. Before all this happened she did have what looked like adult acne on her nose and forehead so not sure if related. This is obviously taking a huge toll on her and my dad since none of the Doctors are helping solve the issue. Can anyone give me some ideas? I need to get her back on her other medicine and really worried what this is doing to both of them.Severe skin rash over entire body, itching, skin sloughing off, swollen hands, orange colored skin, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, elderly",
