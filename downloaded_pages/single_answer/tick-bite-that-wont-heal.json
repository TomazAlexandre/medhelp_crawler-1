            "answer": "If your husband has MRSA, he has it for life which isn't a big deal\u00a0\u00a0because alot of people have it and don't even know. I work in a nursing home and we have residents who have problems with healing as well if they get sores on them. I can't be sure but I would say that the MRSA has a big role to play in his healing issues.",

    "question": "My 68 year-old husband was bitten by a tick over five months ago. When it wouldn't heal, he went to urgent care and they cut out some tissue in the area after my husband urged them.\u00a0\u00a0He thought there might be part of the tick still present.\u00a0\u00a0It nearly heals, then comes back.\u00a0\u00a0It gets puffy, reddish and is about 3 cm in diamater.\u00a0\u00a0He was put on antibiotics by his doctor and then by a dermatologist.\u00a0\u00a0Developed a rash from a sulfa drug.\u00a0\u00a0Now the rash starts to heal and then comes back.\u00a0\u00a0Tested negative for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He uses a corticosteroid creme from the dermatologist for the rash.\u00a0\u00a0Now develops hives and a rash on his legs--just a few spots.Blood work was also negative for lymphoma.\u00a0\u00a0He was then bitten on the shoulder by either a spider or mosquito on his shoulder and that wound won't heal up either (it's been about four months for that one).\u00a0\u00a0What could cause this?(He did have MRSA in the past).\u00a0\u00a0Could this be a hypersensitivity?",
