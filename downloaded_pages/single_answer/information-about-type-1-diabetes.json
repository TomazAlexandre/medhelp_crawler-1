            "answer": "If he takes proper care of himself, your boyfriend's life expectancy is the same as anyone else, as well as fertility. All diabetic complications (which are very severe things like amputation, blindness and kidney problems) are caused by sustained high blood sugar. (over a period of years, not just the occasional high). Common problems that type 1 diabetics encounter are struggling with highs and lows, taking longer to heal than other people and needing to watch our carb intake. Warning signs of highs and lows are very individual. In general, lows are more obvious than highs. When people are low they get lethargic, spacy, irritated and sometimes unusually hungry. Since symptoms vary by person why don't you ask him what his personal warning signs are? If you want a website with lots of diabetics and loved ones of diabetics, send me a private message. But in order to have a good relationship with a diabetic, it would be even more important to communicate and for him to explain to you how his diabetes affects him and how he would like you to support him.",

    "question": "My boyfriend has type 1 diabetes, but when i ask him about how it will effect his and my life in the future, he seems to have been misinformed or lied to by his parents/consultant. I was just wondering, what the average life expectancy for a person with type 1 who cares for their bloods is? Also, how diabetes will affect his fertility and what common problems normal diabetics encounter? Also, are there any 'warning' signs for when his blood sugar may be too high or low?Meg x",
