            "answer": "I've treated several hundred people with Suboxone or buprenorphine over a period of about 5 years, and I've never had a person 'get sick' from it-- other than nausea for the first few days in people with a low tolerance, or withdrawal during the first few days in people with a high opioid tolerance.\u00a0\u00a0I would wonder if it is truly the Suboxone making you ill, or whether you are having nausea from the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Buprenorphine has a very long half-life, so the level does not fluctuate much between doses-- meaning that if you are sick from buprenorphine, you would be sick constantly-- making it hard to distinguish from other causes.The general approach to pregnancy is to use Subutex or generic buprenorphine, not Suboxone-- I don't know if you 'mis-typed', or if you are in fact taking Suboxone-- but if you are taking Suboxone you might be having a reaction to the naloxone, and I would suggest trying generic buprenorphine instead.Finally, you mentioned withdrawal;\u00a0\u00a0if you are taking buprenorphine or Suboxone properly, genuine withdrawal should not be an issue.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you are taking an appropriate amount-- 8-16 mg per day-- and that you are taking it properly, i.e. not swallowing it, but getting it absorbed through the mucous membranes in your mouth or under your tongue.MERSA is a very serious condition, as you likely know;\u00a0\u00a0a person is much more likely to become ketoacidotic from infection than from withdrawal.\u00a0\u00a0From what you've written, I see MERSA and diabetes as much greater threats to your pregnancy that taking Suboxone-- but you obviously need to stay on top of all of those issues.\u00a0\u00a0 Work with your addiction doc to find a tolerable way to take buprenorphine--- and stay on it, especially if you have narcotics around (which should be locked up!!).",

    "question": "Hello, I have been addicted to oxycodone 30s for about 2 years, and about 6 months before I became pregnant I started taking suboxen. Since I became pregnant, the suboxen makes me very ill. My husband is on pain management, and so there is always some sort of narcotic around here. I am type 1 diabetic, so when I withdrawl, it sends me into ketoacidosis. I am 12 weeks pregnant, and I am really concerned about my baby. I also have mersa",
