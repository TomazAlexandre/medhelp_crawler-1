            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The probable causes for itchiness are scabies, diabetes mellitus, eczema, tineapedis (fungal infection) and psoriasis. Scabies infection is caused by a mite Sarcoptesscabiei, it burrows in the skin folds of hands and feet and causes intense itching mostly at night. You may need to consult a Dermatologist who will examine you and may ask for blood tests and in addition examine the scrapings from the skin to arrive at a diagnosis for appropriate therapy. In the meantime wash clothes in hot water.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
