            "answer": "I have read most of pounds and inches-the parts that effect me. I say this because I've been through menopause (early) and I don't have diabetes but I was borderline and I had high cholesterol. I say \"was\" because I'm sure I'm not anymore since I started the HCG diet. Anyhoo, I think the he hit the nail on the head. It makes sense and HCG is working for me. Although I'm in a stall right now I released 18 pounds of fat in 18 days. I wish I had done this sooner but I'm glad I'm doing it now.I also think that the reason mainstream medical providers aren't head over heals about it is because it costs them and the pharmacutical companies money. Sorry for them, I'm going with what I know...HCG.",
