    "question": "I'm 20 years old. Since very recently (2 days ago) I have not been able to become fully erect. It happened the first time during sex with my girlfriend (which is the first time I've really had sex with her...), and then now even alone I could not become fully hard.I drink and smoke a little but that's not a recent event. And I've not had that much sleep and have been eating sort of poorly for the past two weeks (one of which I was on a road trip with 3 male friends, so it was PB&J and fast food).This is making me pretty nervous. Is it my diet and lack of sleep? Or could it be something else? I do have a family history of diabetes, but I haven't been urinating more than usual and I feel ok other than this problem.Thanks very much.",
