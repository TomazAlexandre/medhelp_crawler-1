I don't feel pretty anymore every time I look in the mirror I see ugly I have melasma in my neck, underarms, I have freckles on my face my nose grew my feet grew. I'm at my weight limit I'm over weight I have gestational diabetes I'm checking my blood 4 times a day my babu is over weight and it's all my fault I feel horrible. We just gotta change things around these last 7-8 weeks. Our bundle of joy will be here soon. :)",

    "question": "Hi mums to be. I'm so over my pregnancy I just want my little girl out. I'm in so much discomfort, my back hurts and I have bh almost everyday. Today they have been non stop since I woke up and a bit painful (only 2/10). Not sure if I can handle another 8 weeks without having a mental breakdown. I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. Doesnt help I have a chest infection too. Any ideas on how to destress and enjoy the final weeks?",
