            "answer": "Hello,These burning sensations can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. It can be due to herpes also which presents as tingling sensations before appearance of herpetic blisters. In my opinion you should talk to a cosmetologist/dermatologist about this and get the mole evaluated. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have, in the past week, began to feel a burning sensation in my lower back and thighs. My scrotum also has been burning on and off. I also have a patch of pimples on each side of my hips (I have been wearing pants that are too big for me around my waist and tighten my belt a lot as I'm thin), I also have the forming of a small red rash on either side of the innter fold of my scrotum, where it meets the inner thigh (I have not been showering regularly and have been using the same towel for about a week, which makes me think that it may be fungal related). I am also nervous about the symptoms as about 3 weeks ago I had unprotected sex with a girl that I had not had sex with before. Any help would be appreciated, thanks",
