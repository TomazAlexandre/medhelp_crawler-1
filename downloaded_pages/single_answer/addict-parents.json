            "answer": "I have the same problem with my mom and I thought just ignoring her would be fine.\u00a0\u00a0But like you I was consumed by guilt, plus whether or not I liked it, she was still my mom and there is still a bond there.\u00a0\u00a0Now when I talk to her, and I make sure it is very limited because I already know all she is going to do is vent so I just let her and stop myself from trying to help her.\u00a0\u00a0In the past I would get so involved and want to help her and then get mad when she didn't do what I suggested.\u00a0\u00a0I realized I was being codependent, and that was my issue. As far as money, I am not sure if giving them it right now is helpful.\u00a0\u00a0You are right, it will go to drugs, plus if they have money for their basic needs and instead using it for drugs, then your money could just be enabling their lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0It is so hard, I know.\u00a0\u00a0You sound like you have a big heart and have already gone through so much.\u00a0\u00a0Please make sure you have safe, caring people in your life as well, to help balance out the insanity with your parents. Most of all just remind yourself that what they are doing is their choice.\u00a0\u00a0None of us are victims.",

    "question": "My father is a heroin addict.\u00a0\u00a0My mother was a reformed alcoholic, now addicted to pain killers and won\u2019t leave bed.\u00a0\u00a0She is unwell \u2013 cannot walk, has diabetes, is going blind and will not leave the house.\u00a0\u00a0There were elements of violence when I was younger but nothing really bad.\u00a0\u00a0My parents have no interest in me, and we no longer talk.I have grown up in a \u2018poor\u2019 background where it was common to have no food, water or electricity.\u00a0\u00a0I am now quite successful, but I don\u2019t like giving my parents money because they just waste it on drugs.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time I feel guilty because they need money for other things.I feel guilty for not talking to my mother but I cannot stand hearing her talk about what is wrong when I know she will not do anything about it and all my attempts have not worked well.I really need to know what to do, I can\u2019t keep ignoring it and I can\u2019t talk to my parents about it either they won\u2019t acknowledge anything.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone dealt with this kind of situation before?\u00a0\u00a0And what should be my best approach (i.e keep ignoring them?)",
