    "question": "For the past few years I have this intermittent smell of sweat that won't go away. Even after I take a shower or bath as soon as I dry off I can still smell this odor. I am not a sweaty person and I have good hygene.I asked my husband, my daughter, and my mother to smell me to see if maybe it was a Body odor problem I have and they all said that I smelled clean. It comes and it goes and lasts for days sometimes months at a time. I am so frustrated because I can't get rid of it and I constantly smell a sweaty odor. It makes me feel self-concious when it comes around and I don't know what to do. This is so embarrassing I hope by posting this that maybe someone out there can relate and get help too.",
