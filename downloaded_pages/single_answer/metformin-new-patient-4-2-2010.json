    "question": "Is there a difference between plain Metformin hcl and Metformin ER? I just started it yesterday. It makes me feel fantastic for about 3 minutes then it fades away. Doc started me on 2 a day to be safe. I have other issues. I've been 280 lbs for 20 years while on disability but last year had a few hard attacks of pre-diabetes, but they left so I thought I was OK. 127 on Fast 16 hours and 160/93 bp.Thanks much!",
