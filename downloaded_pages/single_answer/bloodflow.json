            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Many medications, arteriosclerosis, high blood pressure, pelvic trauma and diabetes can all restrict blood flow to the penis. Certain nervous system disorders too can cause failure of blood flow to penis. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss these possibilities with your urologist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
