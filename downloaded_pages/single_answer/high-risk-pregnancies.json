    "question": "I am 25, currently 7 weeks with my second child. I have a uterine anaomly called a Unicornuate Uterus and PCOS. I have to take Provera to have a period and then Clomid days 5-9 in order to get pregnant with my first. I\u00a0\u00a0went on bed rest with my first pregnancy before 4 months pregnant, my cervix shortened fast, was on complete pelvic rest, had to use progesterone vaginally, was a gestational diabetic, had ultrasounds once a week (transvaginal) and had my water brake at 33w4d and had to have a c-section due to my daughter being breach. I am just wondering if there are any mommies or mommies to be out there that have the same or similar issues as me? With this pregnancy it has been a merciless because I didn't have to take Provera or the Clomid, nor were we trying to convince. I'm just a little scared to have a toddler and to end up having to go on bed rest once again :-(",
