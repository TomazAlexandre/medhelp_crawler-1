            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Deep vein thrombosis is treatable, both medically and surgically. Stockings (tight compression) to press the lower extremity to aid circulation and medicines help many. If you take these medicines and wear the stockings, the pain will reduce considerably. Do not walk for prolonged time. Do not stand at one place for a long time. If you need to, then keep moving your legs. High blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, diabetes and hypothyroidism should be ruled out.Avoid weight gain and eat healthy. Do not worry too much and you should do well.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
