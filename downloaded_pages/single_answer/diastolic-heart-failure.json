            "answer": "Hi, Diastolic dysfunction and diastolic heart failure occur when the heart's ventricles become too stiff, leading to impaired filling of the ventricles. The commonest cause for diastolic dysfunction is hypertension. Correcting this will help with the heart failure. Others are due to coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis and diabetes. Supplements may not help improve this. Regards.",
