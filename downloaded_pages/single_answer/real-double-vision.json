    "question": "well i have been having double vision spells and now im on the third or fourth spell and i don't want to ignore it anymore. I've been to two optitricians and don't have insurance and took alot of eyes tests and my eyes are fine. Vision is great but double with both eyes and if i cover one or hold something at a certain point in front of one the double goes away. To some it up spent five hundred bucks on docs that told me they dont know what is wrong and cant afford to waste any more money and applied for some state insurance and waiting a reply. I'm 28 years old and female and have not one other health issue wrong with me. What are all my possibilties it can be?",
