            "answer": "Hi!I am not sure how you know whether you are bleeding in lungs or not. I assume you mean that you bleed from your mouth or cough up blood. This can happen if you have epigastric hernia or hiatal hernia or a bad gastric reflux. In these cases lifting heavy weights puts pressure on the gut and results in bleeding from the fragile gastric mucosa. Diabetes causes slowing of gut and worsens gastric reflux. I suggest you consult a GI doctor and discuss this. You may need endoscopy. You will need to take medications to bring the reflux under control. Take care!",

    "question": "I am now 62 y/o with type 2 diabetes. When I was 24 y/o I had PTB (active/minimal). While under treatment I bled profusely after I lifted a heavy object. I finished my PTB treatment and got healed of that. When I was 40 y/o my diabetis started and bleeding from my lungs recurred after carelessly lifting heavy things again. Now at 62, I am experiencing occasional bleeding whenever my blood sugar is near or over 200. I am taking Hemostan (Tranexamic Acid) everytime I bleed. I am also injecting insulin at least twice a day for my diabetes. My bleeding now seems to be caused by high blood sugar coupled with lifting heavier things (like carrying my granddaughter or a bag of groceries).Will the solution to this problem just be controlling my blood sugar and avoid lifting heavy objects? I had chest xray about 2 yrs ago and it was ok. Will appreciate your comments.",
