            "answer": "I think you'll find that most here will not recommend that you have I-131 without having an exact dx and a REALLY good reason.\u00a0\u00a0I personally would scream for my doc to dig deeper.\u00a0\u00a0Ablation is a HUGE step and should not be taken casually.\u00a0\u00a0I personally don't have any personal experience with hyperthyroidism and it's treatment, but I've had I-131 for cancer.\u00a0\u00a0It's no picnic.\u00a0\u00a0And living without a thyroid isn't any fun either.I know you're sick of being sick... but ablation is not just a \"step\" to finding a cure.\u00a0\u00a0It's killing a small gland that has a HUGE impact on your life.\u00a0\u00a0You need your thyroid to live your life normally.\u00a0\u00a0And you can't just \"undo it\" post RAI.\u00a0\u00a0It took me almost a year of experimenting with thyroid meds, to return to normalcy post RAI.\u00a0\u00a0Without a really good reason in the form of a diagnosis, I'd be highly skeptical of that docs advice.\u00a0\u00a0Get a second opinion, maybe even a third.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's about 16 years ago. A year prior to this diagnosis I lost about 40 pounds and was 109lbs at 5' 9\". During that time I became very depressed and then manic. This behavior stopped when I\u00a0\u00a0went on synthroid. I was fine for about 12 years. I lost my father 5 years ago and went on Paxil. After 3 years on Paxil I just started to feel very anxious. I was sent to a psychiatrist by my counselor. I was put on tons of meds and many people felt that they didn't recognize me anymore, I had become a zommbie. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but I don't feel that I fit this profile and most of the people that know me also don't feel this is the correct diagnosis.About 1.5 years ago my T3 level went sky-high. (14) At that time my THS and T3 were normal. I was sent to an endochronoligist who said that I \"should not worry about it and that I should worry about my blood sugar, which was now in the 120 -140 range.\" Great, so now I have been diagnosed with type II diabetes!I have had the run around and as most patients on this forum, I am so frustrated I could scream. I recently was sent to a new doctor and he had me do a fasting thyroid test and then stop taking synthroid. The first test showed my THS and T4 were close to normal and my T3 was about 14. The second time my T3 was even higher and my THS had gone down. I told him that it felt like my cortosol level seemed high. I wake up feeling very tense and can't get rid of that feeling, even with propranolol. I was right and my cortisol level was on the high side. I am now being tested for Cushings, but I don't have very many of the classic physical symptoms of Cushings. Do these symptoms seem interconnected? Is there any other diagnosis?I don't match hypothyroid symptoms and I don't have Graves. I seem to have symptoms of both of these conditions. I'm \"sick and tired of being sick and tired\".They are getting ready to do an I 131 on my thyroid. I have had a thyroid scan (only one percent intake, no nodules) and I have had a brain MRI-no pituitary tumor.I want to make the right choice about what to do. I've tried Armour T as well. Nothing is changing my elevated T3 and it makes me feel really, really anxious.I don't want any more psych. meds. These adreanal and thyroid problems seem to be the behind my mental health.I want to know if anyone recognizes these symptom cluster.",
