            "answer": "Hi,I have a few questions:When was the last time you had a full assessment by your physician?Do you smoke?Do you have a family history of heart disease, stroke or diabetes?Given that you had a full assessment done ( including coagulation factors,cardiac echocardiography, a stress test, carotid doppler scans) then a primary differential of a migraine headache may be considered. Do you do a lot of straining during the exercise?Muscular spasms over the neck and shoulders secondary to prolonged exercises(especially when straining is involved ) may cause headaches. In your case , we may be dealing with exercise induced migraines or exertional headaches.You may discuss with your physician if preventive therapy may be able to help ( some physicians prescribe indomethacin).At this point , I can not tell exactly if the headache is due to a nutrient or mineral deficiency brought about by the intense exercises. Some sports drinks contain ions and substances that may replenish those that have been excreted through sweating.Keeping a balanced diet rich in fruits , vegetables and fibers are beneficial and may be enough to sustain the\u00a0\u00a0necessary daily intake. Deficiency of certain vitamins, minerals or substances may present with other associated symptoms.",

    "question": "I'm a 56 year old male, in decent health and cardio-pulmonary shape. For a couple of years now, I notice that when I engage in long and intense work-outs (i.e., 17 mile rollerblading up and down hills, or hours of hiking and clearing trails with a non-motorized weed wacker), I feel great after the work-out. But the next day, invariably, I have an indescribably intense headache, clustered around the bridge of my nose, and radiating into the back of my eyes and the sinus area above my eyes. It starts early in the morning, waking me from my sleep, and lasts till deep into the day, often into the evening.At first I thought it was an allergic reaction to pollens and air borne fungi, since my activity is outdoors, but it hits me at every season of the calendar year; I thought it was too little water, but whether I drink a half or one gallon, it makes no difference. Whether I take some vitamins, MSM, chondroitin, calcium, it too makes no difference.(I tend to suffer from less severe headaches on a regular basis, anywhere from 2 to 5 times per week, and will drink some coffee with a few aspirins to knock them out. On very bad days I'll take some Excedrin. It usually eradicates the headache.)The perplexing thing about these post-strenuous-exercise headaches is that no matter how much aspirin or Excedrin I down, it doesn't even put a dent in the pain... IT'S AS IF MY BODY AND HEAD HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PRESCRIBED COURSE, as if I depleted something from my body's reserves, which the body tries to restore, post-exercise and over-night, and which takes my body 18 hours to register as depleted, and 36 hours to re-stock. Then, once my body has managed to re-supply the missing whatever-it-was, the headache goes away.The obvious answer might be, \"don't work out so intensely\". But I'm hoping that your suggested cure to this post-exercise headache may also prove to be the cure for the other, daily, far less severe headaches that I've been experiencing for most of my life.(I've had a CAT scan of the brain, which showed nothing abnormal. I know I need to avoid the usual suspects: MSG, alcohol, chocolate, onion family, mint, etc.)So, if this IS a depletion of some body nutrient, what should I try adding to my diet, or increasing my intake of, on those days that I work out more intensely than usual? Might this also be the missing ingredient that can prevent my daily, not so intense headaches?",
