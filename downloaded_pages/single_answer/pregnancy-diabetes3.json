            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.While those two factors alone should not preclude a pregnancy, they would make it a high risk pregnancy. I would recommend consulting with your OBGYN and the doctor who treats your diabetes. They will be able to consider your entire health history and help you to understand the risks involved specific to your health and a fourth pregnancy. Some things they would consider would be your general health beyond the diabetes (blood pressure, heart disease...), weight, how well your blood sugar is controlled, and your past pregnancies. They may be able to make some recommendations to help lower your risks.I hope this helps.Cathy",
