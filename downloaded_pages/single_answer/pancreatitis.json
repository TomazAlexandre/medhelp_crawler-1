            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. If you tire out easily then probably the pancreatitis has not subsided. You may need further evaluation by your doctor. Also, at times multi-vitamin supplements help over come tiredness, but you need to first rule out pancreatitis.Other causes could be low blood pressure, anemia, diabetes, poor diet and electrolyte imbalance.Please consult your doctor regarding this immediately. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I was hospitalized on Dec 10th 2013 with Pancreatitis and was in there until January 5th 2014. I am home and was released with a Picc line with TPN (nutrition supplement) because I needed complete gut rest. I am now off the TPN, but I still don't feel complete. I wear out real fast when I do things around the house and I just don't feel good sometimes. I am still experiencing some swelling of the pancreas area, but nothing painful. Is this normal???",
