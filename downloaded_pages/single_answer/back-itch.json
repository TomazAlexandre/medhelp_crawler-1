            "answer": "Silent Shingles? Nerve damage? I would see a neurologist to rule our nerve damage.If the itch is accompanied by numbness, pain, and a feeling like the tag on the back of your shirt is rubbing your skin ( but no tag is there ) it could be silent shingles. It took me years to get diagnosed.Finally one doctor asked me if I had ever been exposed to chicken pox...yup, I've had everything. So she said it was probably Silent shingles...it means shingles without the rash.Just thought I would throw those out there.Good luck.",
