            "answer": "Hello,If you have missed your periods for >3 months then it can be due to secondary amenorrhea. Secondary amenorrhea is when a woman who has had normal menstrual cycles stops getting her monthly period for 3 or more months.Causes of secondary amenorrhea include stress and anxiety, malnutrition, depression, overexercising, sudden weight loss or gain (obesity),thyroid disorders and hormonal imbalance due to polycystic ovarian syndrome(PCOS).Smoking is also associated with secondary amenorrhea. Sometimes tumors of the ovaries and brain may also cause absence of menstruation.Some of these causes are modifiable like if you are having stress then yoga and meditation and antianxiety medicines can help you out. Eat regular healthy, nutritious food and indulge in moderate exercises. If still the symptoms do not improve, then consultation from a doctor is required to rule out PCOS or thyroid disorder.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Ok so I have Polycystic ovary syndrome and am over weight. I haven't had an period for about a year and I understand that it's alot harder for me to conceive. But for about a month or two now I've been really moody from crying, to being very irritable that everything just bugs me. But I've also be experiencing some cramping and I just figured it was a cyst but lately I've had to to pee like crazy and I don't have diabetes because I was just at the doctors for test. I also keeps getting headaches, can smell everything, and am always hungry. I mean I never eat breakfast but I can leave the house without a bagel. I just wanted to know if anyone was going through something like this. By the way I did get a pregnancy test at the doctors but never got the results so I figured it was negative. Please help!",
