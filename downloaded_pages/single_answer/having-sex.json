            "answer": "Hello,Loss of libido can be due to psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety. Medicines used in the treatment of various disorders like depression, anxiety, hypertension etc. may also cause decreased libido. Other causes include anemia, drug abuse, diabetes, overactive pituitary and hormonal imbalance. I suggest you to get an evaluation done from a gynecologist.Talk to your partner openly about any fears or apprehensions, eat nutritious healthy food, exercise regularly and cut down on smoking or alcohol if you are taking it.If still a problem then please get yourself evaluated for the medical conditions mentioned above.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
