            "answer": "A ruptured appendix can cause peritonitis as a result of an infection being spread into the abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0It is serious and life threatening if untreated - but your friend should recover if he is in hospital undergoing the correct treatment (usually antibiotics, IV fluids\u00a0\u00a0- and surgery to repair the source of the infection if this has not already been carried out during the appendix operation).Gangrene is also life threatening if untreated and it is the infection of tissue in a particular area of the body usually located where there is no supply of oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0Again antibiotics are reruired and sometimes surgery to remove the affected tissue.Every case if different but these are serious medical conditions - however the diagnosis should be straight forward so that the correct treatment can be started quickly.I believe that diabetes sufferers are more likely to develop gangrene due to damage to smaller blood vessels.If you want more detailed information type in peritonitis and gangrene (separately) to google/yahoo etcGood luck to your friend.Morecambe",
