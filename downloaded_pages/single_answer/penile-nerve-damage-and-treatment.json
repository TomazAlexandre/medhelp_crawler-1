    "question": "Hello again,I am now fairly certain I have penile nerve damage. My original post is here:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/661231I recently had blood and urine tests confirming what I already thought - fine and healthy. No diabetes, infections, liver problems etc. Which leads me to believe it is penile nerve damage.It was the family doctor, and even though I should have, I didn't bring up the whole urological problems, for obvious reasons, just got the tests done. I am sure you are going to say I have to go back into the doctor about them, which I shall, but I am just wondering before hand... Assuming it is penile nerve damage, just for an overview, is there any treatment for it, and if so what is likely? Is there anything I can do in the meantime to help?Thanks",
