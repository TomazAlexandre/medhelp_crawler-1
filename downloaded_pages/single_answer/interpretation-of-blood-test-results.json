            "answer": "HelloYour labs should be interpreted in the context of other factors including your level of activity, your body habitus and your family's health history.Any history of first degree heart attack or strokes( ie mother, father, siblings) is significant and increases your risk. Additionally a sedentary lifestyle with low exercise tolerance is a risk. Medical risk factors include hypertension, diabetes and cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0high blood pressure is > 120/70. There has been a 70% increase in diabetes in your age group do to increase incidence of over weight.I dont know what your body habitus or body frame is, but your weight places you outside your ideal range and increases your risk of diabetes and cardiovascular risks.Your good cholesterol (HDL) is very low and this is unusual for your age. It may represent a familial trait. Ask your physician but dietary changes, exercise and niacin may be helpfulYour bad cholesterol LDL is high. Again diet is the first line therapy, but if it persists in elevation, you may need to be on a cholesterol agent like a statin,Your triglycerides are high as well.It seems like you are motivated to address this. See your physician and start on a program to decrease your weight and get on an exercise program. If your lifestyle does not change and your labs remain this way for years to come, your risk of heart attack or stroke will be increased. good luck",
