            "answer": "Hi there!Stomach transplants are not done for gastroparesis or for any condition where it does not specifically involve transplantation of other GI related organs. However, gastroplasty is a procedure that may be tried in severe cases. Gastroplasty is a high risk procedure and may be associated with complication; hence the decision should be chosen wisely. It would be best to discuss the management plan with her treating gastroenterologist.Hope this is helpful.Take care!MH: Please move to Gastroentreology",
