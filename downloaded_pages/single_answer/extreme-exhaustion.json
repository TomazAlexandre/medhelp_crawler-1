    "question": "I have been suffering with extreme exhaustion for over a month now. Since I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, I have gained around 60 lbs and not eating doesn't even work to take the weight off. I have hypothyroidism along with glucose intolerance and anemia. Over the past several months I have been getting my period every two weeks and read somewhere that the hypothyroid can cause this, anemia and glucose intolerance. In March my tsh was 6.9 and I was bumped up .25 mcg -- (I now take 100 mcg) but this turned out to be too little. I had lab work done two weeks ago and the only thing my docs office would tell me is that my thyroid is very high. I have an appointment on Thursday with the doc -- I am planning to ask for a referral to an endo -- last time I asked he said I did not need one because we could take care of it in the office.. What do you think? -tired of suffering :(Maria",
