    "question": "My sister just informed me because like me we both have type 2 diabetes. She was just diagnosed & her new (because she's never had to see one before) Endocrinologist, is insisting on her to have a Nuclear Thyroid Scan where they inject a low dose of iodine in her forearm, not IV. Anyhow, she asked why does she need that for diabetes, her Endo. said, because she's insulin resistance. She's worried about having it done, thinking it could destroy thyroid tissue & she too will end up with Hashi's as I. On the other hand, she's worried if she doesn't. My question is, is there risk at having the Nuclear Thyroid Scan? if so, what are they? Thanks for your assistance.",
