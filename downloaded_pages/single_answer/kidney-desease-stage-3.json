            "answer": "Most people with stage 3 live a long and healthy life!\u00a0\u00a0The kidneys are capable of doing far much more work than they do and stage 3 there are usally no compications nor symptoms of any. It really depends on the cause of the ckd (chronic kidney disease)\u00a0\u00a0If the cause can be remedied or controlled, then the loss of function can often completely halt or slow down dramatically. If the cause cannot be fixed (eg I have stage 4 ckd due to chronic kidney infections caused by having no bladder) then progression to stage 5 is inevitable. This can take years and years! or be rather rapid if infections or whatever cant be slowed.\u00a0\u00a0Dialysis is not needed until stage 5 , 0-14 egfr and while stage 3 to 5 might not sound like much of a gap it is!\u00a0\u00a0stage 3 is egfr of 30-59. Many with ckd may only lose a point or two a year, some may go years and it has plateaud and they dont lose nay more function till quite elderly. Some get to stage three and stay there with no fall at all.each case is so different and depends almost soley on the underlying cause. Are you asking for yourself or a family member in stage 3? how old are you and are there any underlying disorders eg diabetes, high blood pressure, structural defects (eg like mine)?",
