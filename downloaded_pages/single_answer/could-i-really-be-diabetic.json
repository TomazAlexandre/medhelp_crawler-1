    "question": "At the beginning of the year i was eating alot, always thirsty, constantly having to go to the bathroom and was always tired.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the doctors and they did a urinalisis to see if i had type 1 diabetes but it was negative.\u00a0\u00a0Oh also i had lost like five pounds and i already only weighed 95.\u00a0\u00a0I am fifteen and have always been really skinny.\u00a0\u00a0Before i was tested i fainted once in the shower and then all of the other symptoms started.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms never went away but they weren't as strong as they are now.\u00a0\u00a0I am always lightheaded and dizzy and i am constantly tired, am always leaving class to get a drink of water or go to the bathroom, which can get embarrassing.\u00a0\u00a0I also have trouble with my eyes and have trouble concentrating, and am constantly hungry.\u00a0\u00a0So i am just wondering if I could have developed diabetes since the beginning of the year?\u00a0\u00a0And should i ask my parents to take me to the doctor again?",
