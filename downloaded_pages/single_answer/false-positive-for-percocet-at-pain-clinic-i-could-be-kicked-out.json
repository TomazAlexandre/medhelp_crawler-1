            "answer": "Hi TsDaddy,First, I want to welcome you to the PM (Pain Management) Forum and let you know that we are glad you found this Forum. We are all CP (Chronic Pain) Patients that help each other with our own expertise and experiences that we have developed through our own CP Issues.I'm sorry that you are having to go through this.\u00a0\u00a0The lab test should be able to tell them exactly how much is in your system.\u00a0\u00a0 You need to get all of your information together that youhave about Diabetes and how it will affect lab results and what can and cannot stay in your body.\u00a0\u00a0Copy it and take it with you.\u00a0\u00a0If you have any Family members that can back you up then take them with you to clarify what is happening.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I'd go back to your other Doctor that prescribed the Percocets to you and take a statement from him that he gave you the Percocets and then take the bottle of Percocets with you to show that you haven't touched any of them since you have been seeing this Doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I'd even give them the prescription of Percocets to destroy for you (have them do it in front of you if possible).From now on, if I were you I'd take all of my meds with you to each appointment that you have and let them pill count until they are comfortable with you and how you are handling it.\u00a0\u00a0From what you have said it hopefully will work out for you but until you get those lab tests back there's nothing that you can do.\u00a0\u00a0With all of the different variables going on here there's no way that we could ever predict what the Doctor will do or what the lab results will be.I wish you the very best and hope that you will keep us posted on what happens at your next appointment.\u00a0\u00a0From now on be sure that you never take something that was not given to you by this Doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Don't even keep meds in your home that she hasn't given you that pertain to pain in any way shape or form!!\u00a0\u00a0By the way when is your next appointment?I'll be watching for your update.........Sherry\u00a0\u00a0:)",

    "question": "I have recently went back on methadone and was on percocet for pain management but have not taken the percocet I was taking for two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I recently went in for my refill at the pain clinic and tested positive for percocet and honestly have not taken it in over 2 weeks and it was prescribed before the pain clinic. I told my PM Dr this and she said it cold be a false positive so is sending it into the lab and if it comes back I had percocet in my system, I will be discharged, and It has me mad!! She does not believe me because of the prior thing with my regular Dr. but I am not Dr. shopping and once she explained that she is taking care of my pain now, and My Dr referred me to her for that, I have not touched his prescription, I don't even have any to take.\u00a0\u00a0The thing is, how could percocet show up almost two weeks later?\u00a0\u00a0 I looked it up\u00a0\u00a0online and I am a severe type 1 diabetic and that could affect it so I called them the same day and let them know that I looked it up because I was upset.\u00a0\u00a0Her assistant sounded like he believed me and tt the Dr and said we will wait for the lab to get back and go from there.\u00a0\u00a0I can't afford to get discharged over when I did not do anything wrong, I am not abusing my meds, she also gives me dilaudid for BT pain so why would I need percocet?\u00a0\u00a0 She was going to up my dose to what I used to be on with the methadone, but did not because of this.\u00a0\u00a0Her MA called be back and said to bring my meds in on my appt in two weeks (she gave me that much worth) and show them that I have some pills left cuz I didn't on the last appt (didn't know I had to) so he said we will wait for lab, bring in what I have left of the dilaudid and Methadone on Tuesday and we will go from there!\u00a0\u00a0What if my body did store some percocet and it was in my system still, willl they know if it's just a small amount and my diabetes played a part?\u00a0\u00a0I am finally getting my life back and no living in pain, what happens if i get kicked out? DO you think I am ok? Will I be able to see another Dr to prescribe me the meds that help me? I don't want to go through withdrawals or pain !! What do I do??\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to be tagged as a drug abuser, All I want is to manage my pain Please help me",
