            "answer": "It's probably Type II.\u00a0\u00a0My dr. also started me out on oral meds, but said depending on progression of it and how my body responds to the oral meds, I may have to move to insulin injections.The difference between the two is not how you control it, but what you body does.Type 1 diabetics don't produce insulin on their own.Type 2 diabetics either don't produce enough (which is probably your case) or produce a lot of it because the tissue in the body doesn't absorb it properly to break down the sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Oral meds help with the second one because they help your body know how to use it's insulin being produced OR it stops the liver from making glucose.\u00a0\u00a0Tries to let the insulin catch up...I am recently diagnosed and taking metformin and trying to educate myself the best I can to overcome this!",

    "question": "I am not sure if i am a type I or Type II diabetic. I am 53 yrs old and have had diabetes for 8 years. When I was first diagnosed they said it was type II and\u00a0\u00a0gave me oral meds. They did nothing. I finally went to the Joslin Clinic in Boston and they immediately put me on insulin which i have been on since. I always thought because of my age I was Type II but then I read somewhere if i was taking insulin I was\u00a0\u00a0a type I. I am so confused. Can anyone help?",
