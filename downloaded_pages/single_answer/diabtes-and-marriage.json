            "answer": "Your question was already answered in the post below but if you want more detailed information I suggest you do a search online and you will get all the information you want. One good souce is the International Diabetes Foundation.However, statistics don't tell the whole story because there is too much individual variation. If he keeps within his target blood sugars MOST of the time, he greatly reduces his chances of complications. No, complications are definitely NOT for sure, even with people with poor control, but they are a lot more likely. Good control is no guarantee of no complications but it makes it very likely he can live a long and healthy life. No one will give you guarantees, but only what is the best chance and that is good blood sugar management. If you meet with your boyfriend's doctor he will tell you this as well. Perhaps it would reassure you and your parents to do that.",
