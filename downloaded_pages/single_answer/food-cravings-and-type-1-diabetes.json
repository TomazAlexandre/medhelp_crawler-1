    "question": "Hi, I am a 15 year old girl who has had diabetes for about 4 years now. Recently, I have been experiencing strong cravings for food, mostly sugary food but occasionally just a general food group, too. Also, I haven't been able to stop eating. I keep snacking all throughout the day even when I am not really that hungry. I am not overweight, I have started running everyday but I fear that if this keeps up then I will begin to gain unwanted weight. I learned that when my pancreas stopped working that my body stopped receiving a certain hormone that tells me when I am full. However, I need to see if there is anyway to fix this or at least control it.",
