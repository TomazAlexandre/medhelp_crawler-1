    "question": "My daughter weaned off Prednisone over 6 months and finished her last dose on February 6th.\u00a0\u00a0She has Hashimoto's thyroiditis and an unclassified autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0She also had been taking DDAVP for diabetes insipidus.\u00a0\u00a0She was taken off DDAVP on February 29th after a water deprivation test.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is now she hasn't lost any of the water weight she put on with Prednisone and she has more muscle aches and pain as her physical therapist noticed her arms/hand are flaccid and floppy.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday we saw the endocrinologist and she ordered lab work and a urinalysis. The UA was the first of the AM and it was very concentrated and the specific gravity was l.3 something. During the day she has dilute urine.\u00a0\u00a0We are keeping her I&O and today again her urine was concentrated in the am. She drinks almost 4000 ml a day due to being thirsty and feeling a sense of dryness. She stops drinking before bedtime at 12:30 am.They believe she also may have Sjorgen's.\u00a0\u00a0She has had a constant, pulsating headache since all of this started in January 08. All the neuroologist we have seen can't answer the question as to why she continues to have the headache. She needs help and I can't get any answers to help her. The endocrinologist is great and she feels we should travel and get an opinion from a major institution. She thinks it could be a genetic disorder no one has found.So please give me your best answer to one of her problems.\u00a0\u00a0My question is why is she still retaining water and then why would she have such concentrated urine in the am and dilute during the day?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you sincerely for your help.",
