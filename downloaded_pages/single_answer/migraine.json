            "answer": "Hi!Well, usually the blood pressure is slightly lower in pregnancy. However, the lower recording of 55 is bit on the lower side, so ask your doctor regarding this. It could be contributing to the headaches. Make a conscious effort to drink water, fresh fruit juice, clear soups etc and see if it helps.Other than this, it could be pregnancy related headache. They are more common in first trimester and mimic a migraine or tension headache. Usually there is a trigger, like a particular food or light or maybe traveling in a bus etc. Keep a headache log and see what are the common points, what food triggers it and doing what helps reduce the pain. Consult your gynecologist and get your diabetes and thyroid status analyzed as any change in this too can cause headaches in pregnancy.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your gynecologist regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.
