            "answer": "Hi!I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s or lupus\u00a0\u00a0can also be the cause. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "Stressful events over the summer I started to get these symptoms July/Aug:Weird wet like or cold or numb feeling in right thigh, it will move to around the knee but mostly front thighWent to chiropractor, didn't help muchHad the needles in skin nerve test in thigh and it showed nothing, I had this done while I was seeing a chiropractor and after the nerve test I started to get a cold or burning type feeling in my right elbow and sometimes forearmAt this time as well my neck started to become soreI told the neuro about the neck and elbow and he did see a little something on the nerve test of the arm, I think around the tricep area and asked if my neck hurt I said yes and that got the insurance to give the OK for the neck and spine MRI.I stopped the chiropractor, got a clear brain MRI, insurance rejected the neck and spine MRI but I did get those about a month ago - they were unremarkableDoesn't happen constantly and I feel it more when I'm in the car or at work (computer operator)General Doc wants me to take anti depresents because I'm really stressingI want to find another doc and request blood tests before I see about the anxiety stuff.Anyone have anything similar? What did you do? I really don't know what else to look into.Of course I look up every little feeling on the net and yes I have been scared about MS.I did get a clear MRI for the neck and spine - Degenerative Disc Disease that's it.Almost a year later, black spot in left eye, acts like a floater but Optamologist doesn't see one, no sign of ON, Retina Specialist....same thing but I have enlarged blind spots in both eyes but they see nothing wrong.Only see the spot in a white background or outside looking in the sky.Scared to death.",
