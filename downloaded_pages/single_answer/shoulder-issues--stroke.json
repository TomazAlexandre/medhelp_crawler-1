            "answer": "Hi,It is important to know if your BP has been under control with lisinopril.These could be symptoms of stroke especially if the BP is still high but they can also be due to nerve compression due to disc herniation or neuropathy due to Vitamin deficiency or diabetes.I am afraid but this requires further evaluation before making a diagnosis. Please schedule an appointment with your GP or go the ER for clinical exam and tests.Take care!",

    "question": "I'm really not sure WHAT this is now.I'm a 37 year old male with high blood pressure, taking Lisinopril (10mg) currently, but just started.The reason I found out about the blood pressure issue is because of my shoulder, or more specifically, my left upper arm, across shoulder blade, up the back of my neck and about halfway up the back of my head.It doesn't really feel 'numb' per-se...\u00a0\u00a0more like there's a constant pressure against the areas.\u00a0\u00a0This, of course, freaked me out a bit, so I went to a clinic (I don't have insurance currently).The doctor there diagnosed me with high blood pressure and gave me the above prescription, but told me that, most likely, I had compressed a nerve in my shoulder.This would have been fine, except since then, I've encountered another pressure area on my left rump, and my cheek.All of these symptoms come and go.\u00a0\u00a0If I fall asleep and turn over so I'm sleeping on my back, the shoulder thing does get worse.\u00a0\u00a0Same with my rump and cheek: pressure against them only aggravates the issue.This has been going on for approximately 2 weeks now.So...\u00a0\u00a0my question is...\u00a0\u00a0COULD this be a minor stroke?\u00a0\u00a0If so, is there anything I can do about it besides going to an emergency room?",
