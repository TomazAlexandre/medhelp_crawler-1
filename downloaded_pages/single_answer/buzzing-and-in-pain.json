So if you are on any drug, ask your doctor and stop this drug and see if it helps. It can also be due to fibromyalgia, Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. A pinched nerve can also be the cause. Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps.
