            "answer": "Hi,I think most doctors would agree with your primary physician in saying that you meet criteria for diabetes based on your fasting blood sugars alone, although it may be mild. Many people do not feel well during that first week of Glucophage but for most it gets better afterwards(if it doesn't then they need to changed to another medication). If you have not tried some dietary and exercise modifications to your lifestyle, they will likely help, so give them a try.Take care.",

    "question": "I am 64 years old, and was told at age 28 to consider myself diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting blood sugar is always high (140-160 range), however my random blood sugar tests taken throughout the day are lower (still not as low as my doctor would like).\u00a0\u00a0When I saw an Endocrinologist after keeping a log of glucose levels for over a month, she decided to do a fructose test, which came back within normal range.\u00a0\u00a0She referred me back to my primary care doctor because \"I was just too healthy\".\u00a0\u00a0I agreed at one time to take Glucophage, and after one pill felt lousy the next day, so discontinued med.\u00a0\u00a0When asked if I'm diabetic, I can only say \"it depends on who you ask\".\u00a0\u00a0I say no, my doctor says yes, based SOLELY on my fasting blood sugar readings.\u00a0\u00a0I do not eat properly, skip meals, eat sweets, do not exercise, and have never considered myself diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0From ages 28 to 64, don't you think I'd know by now?",
