            "answer": "Hi,Blood in the urine or hematuria may be due to\u00a0\u00a0trauma, stones, infections, certain medications, and obstructions of the urinary tract. You can have urine tested again and if it persists, I would recommend that you have this evaluated further to rule out the differentials mentioned. Tiredness or fatigue may be due to stress or underlying medical condition. Take care and regards.",
