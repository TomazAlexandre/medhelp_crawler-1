            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. MRI brain shows hyperintensities in the periventricular white matter, sagittal FLAIR images are the most sensitive for MS. Sagittal FLAIR images distinguish between non-specific white matter changes like seen in hypertension, diabetes, age above 50, migraine, smoking and high cholesterol levels.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor should do a complete blood count, metabolic panel including TSH and B12 levels to rule out other possible diagnosis. CSF evaluation and detection of oligoclonal bands and prolongation of conduction in visual evoked potentials suggest MS diagnosis. For MS diagnosis if you have had at least two relapses or symptomatic episodes, with a month in between and more than one lesion on brain or spinal cord, this is, suggestive of MS.\u00a0\u00a0If your neurologist is able to make an alternative definite diagnosis accounting your symptoms, MS is excluded. MS is a possible diagnosis when your symptoms look like MS but tests are normal. It is usually a definite diagnosis only when you have had at least two attacks, separated in time and minimum two areas of demyelination on MRI. I hope this information only helps you know what to expect and not to cause anxiety. Wish you all the best.",
