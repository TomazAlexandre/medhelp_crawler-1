            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.It sounds like you have been having fatigue, tremors, muscle twitches, and some difficulty walking associated with leg heaviness. It is difficult to tie all these symptoms together at once. Desipte the presence of white matter plaques in the brain, your symptoms do not sound like MS, though again it would not be possible for me to say without examining you, obtaining a history, and viewing the MRI. MS is diagnosed based on specific clinical findings, discreet neurologic episodes, and MRI findings. There are multiple causes for so-called \"white matter lesions\" in the brain. Most often, white matter lesions are due to what is called \"chronic small vessel disease\", literally meaning diseased small vessels that supply blood flow to the brain. This is not an uncommon process in the brain and increases with age. This is not a disease in and of itself but rather is a reflection of unhealthy blood vessels, damaged by years of plaque build-up. This is most often due to a combination of several factors including the following: high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol. If these factors are well controlled, the damage to the brain can be stabilized and further damage prevented. However, unless you smoke or have other vascular risk factors such as diabetes, this would be less likely at your age. Other causes of plaques on MRI can usually be distinguished based on history and symptoms, such as symptoms of neurologic deficit (for example arm weakness or difficulty walking etc). These can also be distinguished based on the MRI appearance. These include, but are not limited to, multiple sclerosis, other demyelinating disease, and inflammatory processes such as vasculitis. Other causes of plaques in the brain can be migraine. People with migraine often have plaques on their MRI that are of unclear cause or significance.As you can see, there are many potential causes of white matter plaques, some more serious than others. The different causes can be determined to some extent by interpretation of various sequences of the MRI, in addition to history and physical examination. Sometimes, the MRI is simply repeated (with IV contrast) in 6-12 months to see if new lesions appear, which would suggested a cause that needs to be further investigates. A lumbar puncture is sometimes indicated in the evaluation of white matter lesions, particularly when there are unexplained clinical symptoms occurring.One potential cause to your arm and leg symptoms is neuropathy. There are 2 types of nerves in our body, large and small. The small nerve endings supply the skin and sweat glands. There are two types of sensory neuropathy: small fiber and large fiber (depending on the size of the nerves affected). With small fiber neuropathies, symptoms including burning or buzzing or other vague symptoms starting in the feet and hands then in some cases spreading to other parts of the body. The EMG/nerve conduction studies (NCS) (tests done to check for neuropathy) will not show an abnormality, as it sounds like yours was normal, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a skin biopsy so that the number of nerve endings can literally be counted. There are other tests of the function of small nerves that can be ordered, such as QSART testing which looks at how much sweat the skin makes, since sweating is in a sense of function of these small nerves. There are several causes of small fiber neuropathy, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune problems. A large fiber neuropathy is unlikely in your case given your symptoms, and your normal EMG/NCS.One potential cause of muscle twitching is benign fasciculation syndrome. It is a condition in which there are involuntary twitches of various muscle groups, most commonly the legs but also the face, arms, eyes, and tongue. These are most often related to stress and caffiene intake and excessive exercise, and are not associated with a serious neurologic disorder. Muscle twitching also occurs with large fiber neuropathy, muscle disease, or diseases like ALS but these would be excluded given your normal EMG/NCS.For your generalized fatigue, a neurologic cause may not be the culpritl; potential causes could be thyroid problems, sleep apnea (which is particularly common in overweight people who snore and can cause a lot of day time fatigue; diagnosed with a sleep test called a polysomnogram), anemia, and others. Another potential cause to your symptoms is depression; sometimes instead of a person feeling depressed they have multiple physical symptoms for which a cause is not found, and often fatigue is a symptom of depression. Fibromyalgia is also a condition that can cause achiness in the arms and legs associated with fatigue.Continued follow-up with your primary doctor is recommended, with re-evaluation by a neurologist as deemed necessary.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "I have been searching for answers for almost 3 years now, & don't seem to be able to find any. I'm guessing my lack of health insurance is the reason. I started out with extreme fatigue & weakness, I had an MRI (showed lesions on my brain , periventrical & subcortical), vitamin B levels are normal, test done were they shocked my legs(it was normal) & was told I had probable MS, then told that no, I didn't have MS. This was a year ago that these tests were done. Now I have started seeing a new family practioner, who performed some neurological exams in his office(I couldn't stand with my feet together & my eyes closed, I fall over), I couldn,t smile on one side of my face, He had me to stick my tongue out & I could move it to the left but not the right,I can't walk with one foot in front of the other.I came to this Doctor after seeing a neurologist (who was very rude & would not let me talk what so ever), She told me nothing was neurologically wrong with me & didn't do any of the tests the new family practioner had done. So I'm very frustrated & confused. Whatever this is has started to ruin my life , as I was a very active person before. Sometimes its like someone flips a switch & I feel better, sometimes for a month or more. Then here it is again & it always brings new symptoms with it. I can\"t walk at times & when I can then not very far( my legs get very weak & tremble), the fatigue is horrible, I have tremors & now my muscles randomly twitch, my right eye feels like someone sticks a knife in it & I'm very light sensitive(wear sunglasses in the house) , plus it hurts when I move my eyes, my legs & arms feel like someone tied concrete blocks to them, I have decreased sensations in my hands & feet (like I'm wearing gloves), & as if that weren't enough now I feel like waves of electricity run through me. I have had my husband come to watch my muscles twitch , just to prove to myself that I'm not competely crazy.",
