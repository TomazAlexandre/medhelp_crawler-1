            "answer": "Hi!You probably know by now that Pilonidal sinuses are known for their recurrence. It is necessary to keep the area free of hair and infection. Laser pilation of hair in adjoining area is also necessary along with the surgery to close the sinus. If you are a smoker, you need to stop smoking to facilitate healing. Also check if you have diabetes. This could be the cause for low grade infection resulting in recurrence. Please discuss with your treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
