            "answer": "Why did you go off your meds all together?\u00a0\u00a0When you have all these problems you cannot just quit taking them.\u00a0\u00a0You need to get back to a dr and get some meds again.Having these problems is not something you have done to yourself or can fix on your own.\u00a0\u00a0They are chemical problems just like diabetes, thyroid, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The chemicals that are missing have to be replaced.If you get back on meds I would think life would improve greatly for you.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously you were better before you stopped taking them.\u00a0\u00a0I DO understand that they make you feel different and that you miss some of the things about having them.\u00a0\u00a0I miss all the energy and creativity that came with the manic phases.\u00a0\u00a0But I do NOT miss the grouchiness and restlessness that went with them.\u00a0\u00a0My family doesn't either.Good luck to you.Dac",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed as Manic Depressive and I have been diagnosed with ADHD. I took medicine for two years. Tons of different medicines, too many to even start naming. Then I moved in with my husband a year ago. I stopped taking my meds. I have gained well over 100 lbs in a year. I feel totally restless, when I get restless I get very mad and I eat. I go to work and I get going and I get pissed at every one who slows me down or takes me off track of what I was doing. What's going on? I am getting so mad and restless and fat!",
