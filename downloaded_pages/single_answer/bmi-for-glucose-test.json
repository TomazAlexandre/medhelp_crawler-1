    "question": "So.. why on earth would they STILL be using Body Mass Index for the glucose test? We all know it it compleatly unrealiable and an outdated technique that only works for the very thin people. People like me, who have played hard core spores their whole lives (I play ice hockey & am an avid mountaineer) I climb 14ers for heaven's sake, I have twice the muscle then a lot of ladies & we all know it weighs twice the ammount of fat. So because of my muscle making my BMI over 30.. I have to take an early gluecose test...?? Ugh. Any other ladies dealing with this nonesence?",
