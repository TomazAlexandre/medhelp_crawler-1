            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your mother\u2019s medical problems. Underlying infection or inflammation (as in arthritis, IBS etc) in the body can result in the feeling of heat. In your mother\u2019s case IBS, liver infection and UTI should be looked into. Another possibility is hyperthyroidism or even diabetes. Antibiotic or other drug metabolism can also cause a feeling of heat in the body. She should drink plenty of fluids, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and take multivitamins. Get her thyroid function assessed. Sjogren\u2019s syndrome is another possibility. It can also be due to heart problems, especially if she feels suffocated at night. Menopause is also a known cause so get FSH, LH, estrogen and progesterone level assessed. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
