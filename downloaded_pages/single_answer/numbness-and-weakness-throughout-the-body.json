            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, you are having some neurological problem involving one half of your body. And yes, the wide extent of problems could either be due to a lesion in brain or due to nerve compression high up in the cervical spine. A MRI of the brain and upper cervical spine is needed for diagnosis.The symptoms can also be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, electrolyte disturbance, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or due to bad posturePlease consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "I had a fall about 4-5 years ago, ever since I've been experiencing extreme muscle stiffness and contraction all over the right side of my body right from tip to toe, and reduced muscle support and weakness throughout the left side of my body again form tip to toe. My ability to think, focus, co-ordinate and do physical activities has completely diminished. This has also been accompanied by constant fatigue, oversleeping and constant feeling of weakness. After the fall, my back felt severely hurt and I was bed-ridden for 3 days. An MRI on the lumbar spine revealed nothing and said everything was normal. However, there was no loss of consciousness, just a huge feeling of weakness an a little dizziness after the fall.I am a little confused as to the probable cause of all my problems. Could this have been a result of an injury to the head, considering the wide extent of my problems? What could probably have caused this and how can this be treated?",
