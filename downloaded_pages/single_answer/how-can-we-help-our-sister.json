            "answer": "You are right to be scared. Most transplant hospitals will not do a transplant on a patient who is still drinking. You don't say how old your sister is. Has she seemed depressed more than usual lately? Any major emotional disturbances? Your local social services office should be able to help you obtain councilling for her, and of course her physician needs to address these issues. You are right that she may have given up after being on the list for so long. It is so hard to watch someone we love make the wrong choices. Just love her and give her all of your support. Please post how she is doing. I will pray for her and you both.......",

    "question": "Our sister has suffered from diabetes for over twenty years.\u00a0\u00a0She has been through countless surgeries, including quadruple bypass surgery, and has been going for dialysis 3x a week for the last 2 1/2 years. She has been on the kidney transplant list during these last 2 1/2 years. She is also a recovering alcoholic.\u00a0\u00a0After over 30 years of not drinking, we discovered on Christmas she has been drinking again.\u00a0\u00a0She got drunk, fell and broke her jaw and passed out the day before Christmas eve, and was discovered the next morning by the woman who drives her to dialysis. The driver called paramedics who took her to the hospital and notified the family. Our family has pieced together two other times she was drinking.\u00a0\u00a0Can you provide resources for help?\u00a0\u00a0We are afraid her drinking alcohol will jeopardize her chance for receiving a kidney, and are terrified she has given up.",
