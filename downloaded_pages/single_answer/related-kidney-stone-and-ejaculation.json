            "answer": "Hello,The male orgasm begins with the stimulus leading to an erection and ends with ejaculation and return of the penis size to normal. In certain conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia, metabolic causes like diabetes, vascular obstructions or narrowing in the area, disturbance in the nerve supply and sensations, altered hormonal balance, infections, malignancies, etc can cause a delayed orgasm or may lead to failure of ejaculation.My advise would be to consult a urologist and get all these possibilities ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
