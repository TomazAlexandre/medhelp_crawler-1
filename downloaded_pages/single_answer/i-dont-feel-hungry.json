    "question": "three days have passed and I havn't been feeling hungry at all. I'm usually the one binging on chocolates and stuff. I love my foods but maintain my weight at 55kg. I find this really strange. Its like I'm full all the time. All I've been having for the past few days is green tea, water and a sandwich I was forced to eat by my parents. I don't think I've got any eating disorders. I'm comfortable with my weight and shape. Anybody have any idea what this is???",
