            "answer": "In case you know this please forgive me as others are surely in similar circumstances and may benefit from your situation.Cerebral atrophy means that your brain has shrunken in size and is usually having minimal function.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if mini strokes you mention are Ischemia (normal blood flow is interrupted for short periods of time causing losts of very small areas of damage) or small areas of brain death (strokes that affect small areas).\u00a0\u00a0Either way, you have brain damage.Dementia happens when the functions of the brain are changed due to changes in the brain structure.\u00a0\u00a0What you experience is nerve messages not getting where they need to go because the road is blocked or entirely gone.\u00a0\u00a0This can make it hard to do different things based upon the parts of the brain that have been damaged.\u00a0\u00a0Some people can't speak well - others can't remember well -- some can't coordinate movements well.\u00a0\u00a0Some have severe problems others have lots of less severe problems.Aricept is supposed to help if there are plaque blockages and some nerve signals can still get through.\u00a0\u00a0It has side effects.The smoking made your condition much worse.\u00a0\u00a0Episodes of high blood pressure alone could also cause this damage.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes definately makes your whole body worse.\u00a0\u00a0By not smoking and controlling diabetes and blood pressure, you will help yourself a great deal.Assuming that your allergy was causing you to die by stopping your breathing and dropping your blood pressure - they had to do something - but if the allergy was treated they probably should have stopped when you got the heart symptoms.There is nothing you can do about the past, sir, but you can try to make sure that medical professionals are being trained better these days by advocating for patient case reviews by independent boards.For yourself - I would guess that most of your fatigue and bad feelings probably came from the trying to cope with your condition and that the diabetes and increasing brain damage made it worse.Work to keep your diabetes controlled.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you have a great support network to help you with your memory and other problems and plan to do less mentally straining work -- like work that involves routines which your brain may still be able to handle.\u00a0\u00a0Use the pathways that still work as well as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Know your limitations - for example if you get lost, do not drive a car or do not travel without a companion.Make sure the aricept is helping and useful.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you keep your blood pressure\u00a0\u00a0under control - you have a reactive blood pressure but I am sure that stress is also making it high.\u00a0\u00a0If working is stressful, you may have to go on a disability program.If your country allows legal suits to be filed for medical care, you may be beyond the time that you could file a suit. In the US, for example, you get about 2 years to file a suit.\u00a0\u00a0It is a very painful process and most people regret the strain of the arguing when they could get on with their lives.\u00a0\u00a0The legal person usually gets all the money in the end or a countersuit may be filed that says you smoked, for example, so you should not get such a settlement, etc. Fight instead for advocacy and medical review.\u00a0\u00a0It will help the anger a bit.By getting a clear idea about what your limits and your abilities are and getting a plan for how to do things that you must do or that you would enjoy to do, and by having people around you who understand and care, you will have less stress and you will feel much better.\u00a0\u00a0Look forward, not back.Do not resist counseling or therapy if you are not able to redirect your emotions to a useful state (away from hopelessness, helplessness, anger and toward helping yourself, being hopeful that you can do things and having a purpose).\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes you just need a few close friends who can tell you to stop chewing on the tough past and start savoring what you have before you.\u00a0\u00a0Get nutrition counseling for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0We learn new things all the time about how to approach diabetes.I hope this did not offend you and I am sure it provides help for many who never ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for helping the silent many.",

    "question": "12 years ago I had an allergic reaction and was admitted to casualty.\u00a0\u00a0Adrenalin was injected into a vein\u00a0\u00a0in my wrist.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I got a pain in the back of my head and the heart monitor alarmed.\u00a0\u00a0I was given a heart scan which proved to be Ok.\u00a0\u00a0They then continued to inject the remaining adrenaline into my vein; again the heart monitor alarmed and the pain in the head returned .Before I left the casualty ( 3hrs later) I went to the toilet and found that there was blood in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0I told the doctor and he said that sometimes that happened with allergic reactions.After that I noticed that I was gaining fluid and my shirts were tight around my neck .\u00a0\u00a0I also had a dull pain in the back of my head were I had felt the pain the night I was in causality.I attended an immunologist approximately 3 months after the incident and complained to him about my headache.\u00a0\u00a0He asked for my records and found that my blood pressure was normal when I was admitted and that when I was given adrenaline\u00a0\u00a0my blood pressure went to 260 over 160 .\u00a0\u00a0He contacted the hospital and he received a letter from a senior consultant in the hospital to say that I had been given the wrong treatment.\u00a0\u00a0He gave me a copy of the letter and told me that I could do what I wanted with it.\u00a0\u00a0I did noting with the letter.I was sent to the hospital for liver tests, renal tests and had a scan done of my head.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that everything was ok.About 2 years after that time I was unable to continue with my work.\u00a0\u00a0I was an electronics engineer and found I had difficulty with my concentration and lacked motivation.\u00a0\u00a0I was treated for depression.\u00a0\u00a0I moved countries, returning home to my home country after being unable to work.I found work again as an engineer but lost my job after about 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have been treated for depression since I returned home but the medication did not seem to work.\u00a0\u00a0I had angina some 4 years ago and at that time my wife insisted I get a brain scan.\u00a0\u00a0The brain scan showed that I had Cerebral Atrophy.\u00a0\u00a0I have now been diagnosed with diabetes.I was given cogitative testing last year and was found that they were areas that I was good at but some areas I was poor.\u00a0\u00a0I gave up taking treatment for depression before Christmas and was put on Aricept.\u00a0\u00a0I am told that I have the early sighs of dementia.I seen a neurologist in the summer and was told that the X ray that I had taken some 12 years ago showed some cerebral atrophy.\u00a0\u00a0This surprised me as I was told that everything was normal.I then had a MRI and EEG test done.\u00a0\u00a0The EEG was OK however the MRI scan showed that I had mini strokes.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist said that the strokes were due to lack of blood supply.I would not be a heavy drinker and since my angina I have not smoked.I cant help think that my condition was caused by the incident 12 years ago.Does cerebral atrophy follow on from a stroke?I would appreciate your comments.",
