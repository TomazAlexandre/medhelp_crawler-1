            "answer": "I would say if you want to hold of on surgery use some sort of special food (Like KMR Milk replacer-2nd stage) to help keep his weight up.I know the dilemma your in. Do the surgery or wait, have the treatment fail and be faced with a yet sicker/weaker cat who has less likelihood of surviving surgery?I would say ask the vet for the minimum time frame for signs of improvement. Set a date. If you don't see a clear change by then (make it less than a week), then I, personally, would risk the surgery. BUT, that's me. My wife is here saying the exact opposite (as in, she doesn't believe in doing surgery until it's a last resort. I'm more behavioral and she's more medical...but I wouldn't let that sway you. This is one of those calls you have to make on your own).I hope this helps some.",

    "question": "I have a neutered 4 year old cat. He has been sick for the past two years. It all started when he stopped eating and went from 12 pounds to six pounds. I had to force feed him for awhile and then he was put on Prednisone and gained three pounds in a week. His weight and appetite was up and down for the next year or so but he got back up to around nine pounds. Currently he has been off of Prednisone for one month and has been eating out of control. He seems to always be hungry. The problem is he is still losing weight and is back down to six pounds. He is boney and sickley looking. I just had his thyroid tested (even though he is young) and it came back a 1.8. His blood work was within normal range except his liver enzymes were elevated, which are usually elevated after he losing weight.\u00a0\u00a0He was also slightly anemic.\u00a0\u00a0He was also tested for diabetes and it was negative.\u00a0\u00a0I currently have him on a multi vitamin and digestive enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0It's to early to tell if they are working.\u00a0\u00a0Two vets that I have seen are recommending surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not quite ready to do that but I feel that I need to act fast because he is so very thin.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions would be great.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your help.",
