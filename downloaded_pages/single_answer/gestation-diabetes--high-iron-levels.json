    "question": "Hey everyone...Congratulations to all of us on our pregnancies - 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or more! hahahaI'm wondering if anyone else has had their 3 hour glucose test yet, or if anyone else has been diagnosed with GD this early in a pregnancy. My OBGYN called and left a VOICEMAIL on my phone Friday night and told me A) I have GD, and B) my iron levels are too high so i can't take my prenatal vitamins anymore. I'm completely unimpressed that he did that and totally left me hanging as everything is closed for the weekend! I can't get any questions answered, any clarification, nothing. I don't know what to do, what not to do, how to eat, etc. I have a lovely friend on here who gave me some tips that i'm very grateful for that, but I'm hoping someone else can help me out too - the more information the better I would think!\u00a0\u00a0He said I should be expecting a phone call from the diabetes nurse but I don't know when and most things are closed between Christmas and New Years around here too so unless they squeeze me in this week I'll be waiting until January at the earliest to see anyone about this!\u00a0\u00a0This has me very upset which is definitely not good for baby!Also, the high iron levels, has anyone ever experienced that? I haven't been taking my prenatal vitamins since he phoned and have been taking 5mg of folic acid and some vitamin d that I had already been taking on top of my prenatal but I don't know what other vitamins I should be taking. The beginning of the pregnancy is so important I don't want anything to end badly because i didn't get the right vitamins or nutrients! Any help would be greatly appreciated!",
