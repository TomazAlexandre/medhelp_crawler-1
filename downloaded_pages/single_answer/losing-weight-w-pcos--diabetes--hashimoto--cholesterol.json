    "question": "I really need some guidance in losing weight.... I have a combination of things that are preventing me from losing weight and need to know if there is anything out there to help me. I have PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome), type II diabeties, high cholesterol and have now been diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease. I was able to loose a little bit of weight prior to the diagnosis but am now gradually gaining. My endrocronologist says my hashimoto disease is barely in its beginning stages so he has not prescribed any type medicine. He has advised me to loose weight before it starts getting worse which has brought me here. Any help, suggestions, recommendations would be greatly appreciated....",
