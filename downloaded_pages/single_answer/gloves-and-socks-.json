            "answer": "Hi!The jolting pains can be due Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency, fibromyalgia, and ankylosing spondylitis causing multiple pinched nerves. If you have glove and stocking neuropathy, then this is seen in Lyme\u2019s, metabolic disorders like diabetes, Kidney and liver dysfunction, gluten sensitivity as seen in Sprue and Celiac disease, Vit B12 and pyridoxine deficiency, generalized Vit B deficiency, alcoholic neuropathy, side effect of drugs and in some cases due to poisoning (arsenic, lead). Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper investigations and referral. You may need EMG and nerve conduction studies. The recovery time will depend on the diagnosis.At times the symptoms can be due to Gullian Barre Syndrome. The symptoms can disappear on their own after a week, or few weeks, or months or years later. The problem can become life threatening if breathing is affected. Most patients are managed well by supportive treatment and recover after any duration of time. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
