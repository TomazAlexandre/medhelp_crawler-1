            "answer": "Hi, how was your weight prior to surgery? Its been 5 yrs so its unlikely that cholecystectomy is causing weight loss. Unintentional weight loss can occur with hyperthyroidism, diabetes, certain medications, depression, eating disorders, and infections and due to loss of appetite. Sometimes, gaining weight may not be easy, if by hereditary, you are of the \u201cskinny body type\u201d and one with fast metabolism. I will offer a few suggestions. Count the number of calories you eat normally and increase by about 500 calories. Keep at it for a few days and increase further more and you will notice weight gain.Drink plenty of water.Sleeping well is the easiest way to gain weight. A few exercises are known to promote weight gain, about which a trainer in a health studio may help you. Further, exercises will improve your appetite.Stick to a good, balanced diet with high proteins and plenty of fruits and vegetables, which in addition to helping you put on weight, will keep you healthy.
