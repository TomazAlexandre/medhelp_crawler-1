            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Two conditions in particular come to my mind when I read the description of your symptoms.The first is a condition called meralgia parasthetica. The symptoms of this condition inculde tingling, numbness and burning pain in the outer part of thethigh. The cause of is compression of the nerve that supplies sensation to the lateral part (outer part) of the thigh. This condition has many causes including being overweight, certain surgeries and the positioning that occurred during surgery, prolonged sitting in one position such as in a dental chair that was not comfortable, pregnancy, very tight clothes, diabetes, trauma. Also, in patients who are bed-ridden for prolonged periods of time in a particular position, this condition may occur.A diagnosis can be made with a test called a nerve conduction study in which conduction along the nerve is measured. Treatment is available to help relieve the symptoms, but this condition may improve on its own. The most important thing is to avoid further aggravating factors like tight clothes or belts etc.The other possibility that comes to mind is what is called a radiculopathy, when there is compression of a nerve as it comes out of the spine. The compression could be due to arthritis of the spine or due to a herniated disc. A radiculopathy (what is sometimes referred to as a pinched nerve) often causes shooting pains. The treatment depends on the cause. The evaluation may include an MRI of the lower spine.A less likely possibility is a neuropathy.I recommend that if your symptoms do not improve that you be evaluated by your regular doctor (family physician) and after he/she examines you if he/she feels it is indicated, further testing can be ordered and/or you can be referred to a neurologist.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
