            "answer": "Hi,I'm sorry to hear what you've been through for the past years. Decreased skin turgor may be caused by dehydration, diabetes, extreme weight loss or connective tissue disorders such as scleroderma and Ehler's-Danlos syndrome. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are a group of disorders which share common features including easy bruising, loose joints, skin that stretches easily, and weakness of tissues. This condition can be inherited and\u00a0\u00a0can be passed from parents to offspring. (http://www.medicinenet.com/ehlers-danlos_syndrome/article.htm)Have this evaluated by a specialist in connective tissue that is familiar and understand this condition well. A skin biopsy may be done to determine the chemical makeup of the connective tissue. It is only through this that the proper diagnosis be made. Take care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hi,I have a problem that began when I was 19 and has gotten worse over the course of 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0My skin has lost turgor all over my body, and the slightest pressure will cause an indentation/impression on the skin that takes a long time to go away.\u00a0\u00a0I also have moderate gastrointestinal problems--gastroparesis (the stomach doesn't empty as quickly as it should).\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone think of any diseases that would cause this?\u00a0\u00a0Could it be Ehlers-Danlos or some other skin disorder.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any suggestions, as I have seen countless doctors who snicker at my worries--while sticking out their hands for payment of course.Thanks.",
