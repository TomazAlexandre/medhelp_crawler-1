            "answer": "Red itchy areas that result in pus, I've had them for like 4 years. Everytime I use this ointment called \"DIPSALIC\" . It is a clobestasol propionate and salicylic acid ointment.\u00a0\u00a0My itchy areas were not very large, but a bit severe and recurring. If you don't think that you are allergic to its contents, it's worth a try. You will feel a difference after 2 minutes of applying it. Hope it helps.",

I have been told it may be coming from the bones, but I have had bone tests which came back clear.I have high iron levels in my blood (haemachromatosis) and I used to get blood taken off every few weeks but not any more.I have type 2 diabetes. I also have high blood pressure. I previously suffered from Guillain-Barre syndrome around 15 years ago.No medical expert has yet been able to diagnose or cure this condition and it is having a very debilitating effect on my life. Please help!",
