            "answer": "Without reviewing the films, I can not provide a diagnosis. The changes in the report sound like non-specific white matter changes which can be seen in patients with migraine, hypertension, diabetes, some inflammatory conditions such as lupus, anti-cardiolipin antibody syndrome, and possibly in MS. However the absence of lesions in the corpus callosum, brainstem and cerbellum make this less likely. Unfortunately, you will have to wait until the other neurologist has the chance to review the films, spinal fluid, and your exam. I wish I could be of more help. Good luck.",

    "question": "Hi thank you for giving me this opportunity. My Neuroligist is unsure about my 2 mri scans and has referred me to another one but I have to wait till august. this is my last report. what do you think. MRI Brain sagittal T1 axial T2 and coronal FLAIR images.Comparison has been made with the previous MRI scan. There are again multiple areas of high signal in the white matter on the T2 weighted images and coronal FLAIR images. The distribution is unchanged with most of the lesions being quite peripheral, although there is periventricular white matter change adjacent to the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles bilateraly. No posterior fossa or corpus callosal lesions demonstrated. Low signal in the region of the globus pallidus is again demonstrated in keeping with the known dense calcification here. Extensive white matter changes, the lack of change with time would be against demyelination and there are no soecific corpus callosal or posterior fossa lesions.Still awaiting my LP result. What are your thoughts on this result. Thankyou",
