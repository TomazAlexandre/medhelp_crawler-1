            "answer": "Hello loup,Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a relatively rare autoimmune disorder of peripheral nerves in which antibodies form against acetylcholine (ACh) nicotinic postsynaptic receptors at the myoneural junction. A reduction in the number of ACh receptors results in a characteristic pattern of progressively reduced muscle strength with repeated use of the muscle and recovery of muscle strength following a period of rest.The bulbar muscles are affected most commonly and most severely, but most patients also develop some degree of intermittent generalized weakness. The most important aspect of MG for emergency physicians is the detection and management of the myasthenic crisis.Refer: http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/TOPIC325.HTMStiff person syndrome is rather unique among neurologic diagnoses because of its lack of significant similarity to any other neurologic diseases. Although rare, once observed it is quite unforgettable. Possibly the closest related disease is tetanus because both conditions affect peripheral inhibition via central mechanisms and both conditions inhibit central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems. Clinically, stiff person syndrome is characterized by muscle rigidity that waxes and wanes with concurrent spasms. Usually, it begins in the axial muscles and extends to the proximal limb muscles, but the severity of the limb muscle involvement may overwhelm the axial muscle involvement (stiff limb syndrome).Some confusion has also ensued as a result of cases that include other neurologic findings, such as encephalomyelitis or cerebellar deficits, in addition to the classic clinical syndrome. To further confuse matters, the most common pathologic correlate, anti\u2013glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies, have been associated with a wide range of human disease, including diabetes mellitus and seizures.Refer. http://www.emedicine.com/neuro/TOPIC353.HTMBest",
