            "answer": "Hello,There can be many possibilities for your symptoms.It can be due to dry skin(xerosis). Dry skin usually results from environmental factors that you can wholly or partially control. These include hot or cold weather with low humidity levels, long-term use of air conditioning or central heating, and washing or bathing too much.Other causes may be allergic reactions to socks fabric,shoes texture,soaps ,wool etc,sweat dermatitis,eczema,parasites like hookworm,ancyclostoma duodenale and internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,thyroid disorders,diabetes,iron deficiency anemia and abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12.Diabetes is an important possibility because it often causes peripheral neuropathy and hence itching and pin ***** sensations without any rash.Eat healthy, nutritious food and take adequate amount of water.Also take some multivitamin and multimineral supplements and iron supplements for some days and see if the symptoms improve.Pls get your blood sugar and thyroid hormone levels evaluated and if the symptoms persist then pls consult a dermatologist and neurologist to rule out the other possibilities.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
