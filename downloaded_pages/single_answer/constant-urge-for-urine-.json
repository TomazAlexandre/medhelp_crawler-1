            "answer": "Hello,The very first thing that comes to my mind on the basis of your posting is diabetes mellitus. This disease occurs due to a deficiency of insulin (formed in the pancreas for control of blood sugar levels) and usually manifests with symptoms of excessive thirst & frequent water intake, frequent & night-time urination and excessive hunger & frequent meals. For this, you need to get your blood sugar levels checked twice (first in the morning after a 12-hour fasting and second 2-hours after taking 75g of glucose).Other conditions that may mimic your symptoms include infections (particularly urinary tract infections), drug-induced, an excessive loss of water & salt (due to excessive/drug-induced urination, profuse sweating, loose motions/vomiting), an insufficient functioning state of the heart, liver or kidney, or an anxiety state.If the symptoms persist then get it investigated from a physician.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
