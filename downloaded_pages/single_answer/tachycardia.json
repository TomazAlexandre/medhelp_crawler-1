    "question": "I am a 48 yr old male.\u00a0\u00a0No history of heart problems other than non-medicated prolapsed mytral valve detected in 1974.\u00a0\u00a0Physically active with juvenile onset diabetes in 1968.\u00a0\u00a0All else is well.In early Sept 99 I was involved in an accident that shattered my left ankle.\u00a0\u00a0Two steel plates and 16 screws were installed and the wrapped to be left unattended with no dressing changes or antibiotics for 11 days per the attending Dr.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say when it was unwrapped 2 weeks after the surgury all of the skin over the plate was necratic and infected.I was the sent to another hospital that immediately excised the dead flesh and started me on Timentin and Clindomycin back to back at 6 hr intervals.\u00a0\u00a0The wound was left open and covered with wet to dry changes for another week and then a graft or flap was applied from my left inner thigh.\u00a0\u00a0Antibiotics were continious during this time.\u00a0\u00a0I am now home and still on the Clindomycin at 12 hr doses IV.All appears well and the flap has a wonderful distal pulse but my blood pressure has dropped in the past week to 100 / 50 and my heart rate is a constant 120 bpm from its previous 75 - 85.I am starting to now get severe chest pain and pressure and last night\u00a0\u00a0my left arm went numb.\u00a0\u00a0I fear the the racing of the heart will over tax my system and give out.I am looking for a reason or cause for the sudden tachycardic symptoms where none had been before.\u00a0\u00a0Can it be the PIC line in my left arm, or the infusion of extended antibiotics or what?Thanks,BR",
