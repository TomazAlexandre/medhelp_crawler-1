    "question": "When I was 10 my mum had fell into a diabetic comba. I'm not quite sure how long she had the diabetes for but I'm pretty sure it was type 2. The night before she went into the comba she had told me and my siblings to not wake her up in the morning. Sure enough we let her sleep in but it was getting unusually late so we decided to wake her up. When I went in to do so her breathing did not sound right at all. There was vomit on the floor and on her pillow and she was only just breathing because of the vomit blocking her airways. I was 10 I didn't know what to do other then call the ambulance so I did. She was then taken to hospital in the emergency ward. She kept getting worse and worse to the point where she needed a machine to put air in her lungs. I kept praying and praying for her to wake up but a month had past and she just wouldn't. One night dad took us to hospital and the whole extended family was there. The doctors turned off the machine and I watched my mother die. Was truly the worst night of my life and I still to this day is unsure why this happened ? Why did she tell us not to wake her up ? Did she do this to her self on purpose ? And what made her slip into this coma ? Why was she vomiting ? I need to know can anyone help please ?",
