            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you have is probably postural hypotension. The blood pressure falls when you stand and causes all the symptoms that you are suffering. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain epilepsies too behave this way with temporary blackouts. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required for diagnosis.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.",

I have been a little anxious with impending doom type feelings. been to the hospital recently (not for this) and had normal head CT normal Spinal MRI. Post concussive syndrome/lumbar puncture. Any clue? Has anyone experienced that feeling before of cold rushing down etc? I'm really nervous about what it could be.",
