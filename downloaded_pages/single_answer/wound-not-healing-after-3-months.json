            "answer": "Hello,For such infected wounds you need injectable antibiotics as soon as possible to prevent any cellulitis from developing. Delayed wound healing can occur in vitamin C and vit K deficiency,diabetes,p-rotein deficiency,immunocompromised states and if the person is taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.Get your blood sugar also checked. I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hello all,I suffered a couple pretty deep abrasions on my ankle on 8/29.\u00a0\u00a0Here's the timeline and treatment thus far:8/29 - initial injury10/17 - The wound seemed to be getting worse and inflamed - skin \"rash\" spreading outward from affected area.10/21 - Saw Dr. (internal medicine) and he diagnosed as infected.\u00a0\u00a0Prescribed Doxycycline and clotrimazoleand betamethasone dipropionate cream.10/24 - Allergic reaction to doxycycline (skin rash), switched to Sulfameth and added 12-day decreasing strengthRx of Prednisone to treat allergic reaction.12/5 - Wound was healing, but now has gotten worse - inflamed and weeping.\u00a0\u00a0Continuing cleaning and use of bacitracin2x per day.12/7 - Went back to Dr.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr. requested a referral to a Dermatologist (which can take 7 to 10 days).\u00a0\u00a0No Rx atthis time, recommended continued cleaning and application of bacitracin.Today, 12/9 - I'm a bit concerned.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that the Dr. should have ordered a blood test, etc. to look for anunderlying reason why this thing hasn't healed.\u00a0\u00a0This has never happened to me before, I don't have diabetesor any other diagnosed issue that would point to the cause of this wound not healing.I'm tempted to call another physician network and see if I can get in today.\u00a0\u00a0I know how serious issues likethis can be.Am I being a worry-wart, or do I have valid concerns?Thanks!",
