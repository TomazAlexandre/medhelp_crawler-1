I have a friend who developed gout and she was tested since it can be a symptom, and it turns out she does have diabetes..\u00a0\u00a0On a different note, I have severe arthritis in my big toe.\u00a0\u00a0I have a lump at the base, just like you.\u00a0\u00a0Several years ago, I believe I broke it (but never went to dr).\u00a0\u00a0So now I have arthritis in it.\u00a0\u00a0It comes and goes, and the pain can be quite severe (to the point that walking is very difficult).\u00a0\u00a0From what I've read, if it's gout, it will be red and swollen, and affects the joint nearest the tip of the toe.\u00a0\u00a0If it's arthritis, it doesn't get red, warm or necessarily swollen, just painful and it affects the joint at the base of the toe.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you find out what's causing it.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "This last week I developed a sudden and severe pain in my big toe.\u00a0\u00a0The swelling extended to the top of my foot at the base of my big toe.\u00a0\u00a0It hurt so bad that just sitting it was throbbing.\u00a0\u00a0I thought maybe I had sprained it or something during a walk or jog.\u00a0\u00a0it was so bad I could not sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my podiatrist who did x-rays but said the bones were fine.\u00a0\u00a0She said it was gout.\u00a0\u00a0I have been reading on this and it all points to obesity as a cause.\u00a0\u00a0I have been working very hard since last July and have lost 56 pound and I am eating better than ever and also exercising regularly.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on a high protien low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0I still have weight to lose but not as much as I have already lost.\u00a0\u00a0It was kind of a blow to me to think I am now suffering from this due to obesity when I have been working so hard.\u00a0\u00a0Could there be another cause?\u00a0\u00a0I was given Indocin (sp) and it made me very sick.\u00a0\u00a0I also was given vicodin which helped the pain but dropped my heart rate very low.\u00a0\u00a0That was over the weekend as I saw the doctor on Friday.\u00a0\u00a0I have not had any meds since Sat. because it made me so sick.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to call today for different meds but couldn't get through yet.\u00a0\u00a0How important is it to get other medication?\u00a0\u00a0The toe is still swollen and sore but not like it was!!",
