            "answer": "Hello,They seem like boils or furuncle. Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. . Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle.Treatment includes antibiotics and pls do not touch or pick them up.Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders.So pls get your blood sugar evaluated.In case the symptoms persist then diabetes has to be ruled out.Pls consult a dermatologist in that case.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
