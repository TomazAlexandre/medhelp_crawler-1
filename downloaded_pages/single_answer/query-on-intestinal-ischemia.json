            "answer": "Intestinal ischemia isn't likely by my opinion. This happens when intestinal arteries are blocked from atherosclerosis (often in long term diabetes) or from embolus. Ischemic colitis would be seen during colonoscopy.First , she should have a breath urea test (BUT) for H. pylori, which is common cause of gastritis, bloating, early satiety. If positive, she will be treated with antibiotics. She can try with Oil of oergano until then, some people reported that it help cure them H. pylori.She can have low-fructose diet (no fruits, or anything containing fructose or sorbitol (mostly in \"low- calorie foods\", for few days). If she had fructose malabsorption, the diet would obviously reduce bloating.",

    "question": "For about 18 months my 21 y.o. daughter has been suffering with intermittent stomach pain and discomfort, bloating, feeling of fullness after eating little, occasional nausea, irregular bowel motions, diarrhea and constipation. The symptoms have increased over time. For the last 4-5 days she has experienced stabbing pains in the stomach area, bloating and nausea and has eaten very little as this elevates the symptoms. Last year she had an emergency apendectomy, but the abovementioned symptoms have persisted. She is seeing a gastroenterologist and is taking Endep, starting with 10mg, but now on 75mg, and with no benefit after 10 weeks on the increased dosage. She has had blood tests, endoscopy, stomach emptying study, and numerous other tests and they cannot find any sign of disease. She is 5'1\" and very slight build. She has lost a bit of weight, but can't afford to lose much more.Today I read about intestinal ischemia and wondered if there is a link to her previous history. She has been taking the oral contraceptive for about 3 years. As a newborn she was diagnosed with a neuro blastoma in the thorax. It was surgically removed at 14 months old and was benign. She didn't have chemotherapy or any other treatment. Some parts of the tumor were wrapped around the spine, and some nerves were cut during the operation, in particular the nerve that controls dilation of the pupil, drooping of the eyelid and sweating on one side.Do you think there could be a connection e.g. some other nerves or blood vessels damaged at that time that are only now causing problems?",
