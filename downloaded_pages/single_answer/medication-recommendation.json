            "answer": "Well Geodon made me able to function relatively normally but it didn't treat my things like paranoia or the inability to express myself at all as well as destroying my memory and blunting my personality... I am a quiet person already believe it or not, but I have nothing on what I was like on Geodon.\u00a0\u00a0Abilify seems to be working to treat that stuff but I am gaining weight from it and I still have psychosis more present than when I was on the highest daily dose of Geodon.\u00a0\u00a0Risperdal seemed like it was going to work even better than both of those but I couldn't handle the side effects.\u00a0\u00a0Yeah.. I thought Geodon was awesome until I tried Abilify and Risperdal and I found out things could be way better.",
