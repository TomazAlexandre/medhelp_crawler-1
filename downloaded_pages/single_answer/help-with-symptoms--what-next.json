My advise would be to seek out the best neuroophthalmologist that is within 4-5 hours driving and get your tests together and get over to him/her for a second opinion. you can find one near your at www.aao.org\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OR you may want to go to one affiliated with a University department of ophthalmology.JCH MD",

    "question": "I'm a 37 year old female who was diagnosed diabetic close to 20 years ago. Diabetes runs through my family history on maternal & paternal sides.\u00a0\u00a0I come from a family with 6 biological siblings and as it stands, 5 out of the 6 have also been diagnosed as diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I'm in great shape and have always taken care of myself.\u00a0\u00a0My BMI has always been around 19.\u00a0\u00a0(5'4\" and +/- 110lbs)\u00a0\u00a0Though my A1C has always stayed below 7, I have had eye troubles since my early twenties.\u00a0\u00a0A scotoma in\u00a0\u00a0my left eye is actually what led me to the eye doctor and eventually was diagnosed with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Before my diabetes diagnosis, my neurologist ordered a MRI and diagnosed my eye scotoma as a static migraine.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, 15 years later, I now have 6 scotomas in one eye and 8 in the other.\u00a0\u00a0I also experience flashes of light in the dark and during the day every time I blink.\u00a0\u00a0 When I cover one eye, 3/4 of my vision in the other eye seems to disappear and reappear almost rythmic behind a black \"sheet\". Lately, I have been extremely fatigued (more than usual) and experience blurry/double vision and pain behind both eyes upon moving them left/right up/down.\u00a0\u00a0On some days my scotomas are dark grey and become blind spots instead of transluscent.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms are stronger on some days more than others.\u00a0\u00a0After my MRI, I should mention that the radiologists report suggested that I had a MS plaque visible on my frontal lobe, but the neurologist declined to concur at the time. He believed that my symptoms were indicative of a ocular migraine.\u00a0\u00a0I have summed up over the years that I need to live with the \"static migraine\" dx.\u00a0\u00a0As of recently a huge scotoma twice as large as others appeared right in my line of vision and made driving almost impossible.\u00a0\u00a0It has since faded to appear as the others.\u00a0\u00a0Now, post MRI 15+ years, eye symptoms continue to darken and then lighten, but are alway present.\u00a0\u00a0Last week I saw my Opthalmologist and had a complete dilated eye exam...completely within normal limits as usual... No diabetic changes at all.\u00a0\u00a0I have a MRI scheduled next week to look for progression/changes of said \"MS plaque\", just in case.\u00a0\u00a0What do these symptoms bring to mind, if my MRI is within normal limits, or no change, what do you believe my next step should be?",
