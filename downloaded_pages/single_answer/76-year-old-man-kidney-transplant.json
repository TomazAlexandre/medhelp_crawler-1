    "question": "My father has had type 2 diabetes for about 30 years and has many health problems including irregular heart beat, and high blood pressure (both controlled with meds) ....he's had two strokes already.\u00a0\u00a0 His kidneys are functioning at about 20%.\u00a0\u00a0 He does not want to go on dialysis (I believe at 15% you need dialysis? Correct me if I'm wrong).\u00a0\u00a0He would rather just die than go on dialysis.\u00a0\u00a0I was just wondering, because his doctor has never mentioned it....Is too old and/or in too poor health to be considered for a kidney transplant?\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you.",
