The other factors that potentially lead to PE can be organic like diabetes, hypertension, hormonal imbalance, trauma etc. Based on your description, it seems likely to be more of a stress and anxiety issue and try to avoid masturbation for some days. A good psychological and physical health will help you most.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
