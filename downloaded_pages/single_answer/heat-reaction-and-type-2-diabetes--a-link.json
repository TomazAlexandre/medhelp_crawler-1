    "question": "I belong to an exercise program through Human offered by our YMCA called Silver Sneakers. It is a program designed to try to maintain some degree of physical fitness. I am 67 years old and have been becoming increasingly sensitive to temperature. If temperatures are above 65 and or the humidity is high, I sweat profusely to the point of feeling queasy. The instructor has positioned a fan in front of me and that allows me to complete the 50-minute session. The same problem exist during the summer. In fact of both humidity and temp are high, just sitting outside results in the same reaction. I have Type 2 diabetes with an A1c between 6.9-7.0. Is this problem related to the Type 2 diabetes?",
