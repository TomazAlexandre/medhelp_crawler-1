This September he had Infarctus myocardii parietis diaphragmalis NSTEMI (hart attach), and 2 CVI. Multiischaemio celebri.(strokes) and he suffer from Hypertensio arterialis. This is written in the relief document from the hospital.He takes medicine regularly and insulin twice a day 14 IJ (morning)- 12 IJ (evening) and test regularly the level of blood sugar, but two days ago he told me that his blood sugar was 17,4.??? On 11/13 he has appointment to do the Computer Tomography and after that he has appointment with Phulmologist - breast Doc and Cardiologist.My question will be: Do I have to take him to the hospital to visit Endocrinologist or Neurologist or first to finish with Cardiologist? and your opinion about do this results have anything to do with his hart or brain? I'm scared about his health and I would not like to see him with another stroke or hart attach never again.I hope you will understand my English and if you have any other question about his diagnoses please let me know.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much!
