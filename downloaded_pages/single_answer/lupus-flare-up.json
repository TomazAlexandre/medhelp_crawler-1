            "answer": "Hi Joni, I was on Premarin after a full hysterectomy in 1998. I was placed on Premarin immediately after the surgery. I suffer from Hashimotos autoimmune disease for many years and was diagnosed last year with Lupus after suffering many years with leukopenia which was caused by the Lupus or the Premarin. I took myself off of Premarin in July 2016 and I feel so much better. My hair is now growing back after losing about 3/4 of it during a Lupus flare-up that lasted over 7 months. My muscle aches are gone and my blood counts are now registering normal. I am going through hot flashes now, but that is bearable compared to what I had been through. I do believe both autoimmune diseases where caused by Premarin. I thank God that I feel well after being sick for so long.",

    "question": "Years ago I tested positive for lupus but my Dr said it was fibro. I have celiac, sjogrens,\u00a0\u00a0types2 diabetes and high blood pressure. I have been having trouble with my ears, ringing or humming, running and itching. Occasionally I have a butterfly rash that comes and goes. Very recently I had a sudden severe dizzy spell that did not last long but, scared me so that I was afraid to go to sleep. I have noticed some joint swelling and extreme aching. Is it possible that this is a Lupus flare up!",
