            "answer": "Hello,The pain that you are having can be due to straining of the muscles due to repeated overuse.Other possibilities may be tendonitis,ligament or miniscal tears and arthritis.Cold knees means that blood supply to the knees is being compromised.This can be due to diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid.So pls get yourself evaluated for that.Are you having cold legs also?Whenever you start with your running,pls do stretching exercises like jogging,skipping etc and keep yourself hydrated by sipping not drinking fluids in between.Also get your blood sugar levels estimated.You can also consult a physician and discuss these possibilities with him.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",
