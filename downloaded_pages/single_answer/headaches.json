            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for posting.There is a possibility that you are suffering from tension headaches. However it is also important to rule out cervical conditions like cervical spondylosis and disc prolapse. Other causes can be acute anxiety and like you have mentioned extreme stress.I would suggest you to do some relaxation exercises everyday like breathing exercises and meditation.It is also important to rule out stroke since you have one sided facial and toe numbness.Do you have any risk factors for stroke like high BP, diabetes, high cholesterol or obesity?I would suggest you to consult your PCP and it would make sense to get an MRI done to rule out neurological causes like stroke.Take care!",
