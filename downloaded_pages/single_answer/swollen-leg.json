From my toes to lower shin my leg has hot spots\u00a0\u00a0and swelling. I do experience pain when shoes and or socks are removed. Can you please tell me what I could do to resolve this until I can see a doctor. I do not have health insurance so I would need to save money to pay for the visit. Thank you in advance.",
