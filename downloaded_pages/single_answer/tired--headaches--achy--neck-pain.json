            "answer": "Hello,Pain in the back of the head is often referred to as a cervicogenic (meaning: from the neck) headache because it often originates from an irritation in the upper cervical (neck) spine. This is because the nerves that supply the back of the head originate in the upper cervical spine.Usually this kind of pain is worse with prolonged sitting in a stooped posture as when working on a keyboard for long hours.\u00a0\u00a0It is seen most commonly in patients with whiplash injury and in patients with marked arthritis of the upper cervical spine.Such kind of headache can\u00a0\u00a0also be caused by cervical spondylosis(a common degenerative condition of the cervical spine).Symptoms include neck and shoulder pain, suboccipital pain and headache.MRI neck is the diagnostic investigation of choice.Rare causes of such headaches include Brain aneurysms, brain tumors, Brain infection like meningitis or encephalitis, stroke or TIA.Pls get a CT back of head and neck or MRI neck to find out the confirmatory diagnosis.Take care and do keep us posted on how you are doing.",
