    "question": "32 weeks pregnant with twins and so far I'm gained 60lbs. Entirely too much but Im having twins so I thought wth. Any who my doc has got me checking my sugar for a week with the infamous meter and pricking of a finger and doing a 24hr urine specimen test. And yesterday after a semi active day of walking I come home to find that I have cankles and sausage links for toes. Any advice? Should I be worried any more than I already am. I feel the closer to the end of this pregnancy o get the more complications I endure.",
