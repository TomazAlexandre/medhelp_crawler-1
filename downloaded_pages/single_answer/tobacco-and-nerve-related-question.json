    "question": "Hi,I've been using smokeless tobacco (dip) lately, and I think I may have done something foolish that could have caused some nerve damage. I went for a 6 month dental cleaning last week. During the cleaning, the doctor did a lot of scraping along my gums, which resulted in a lot of bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say, I need to start flossing more.\u00a0\u00a0About an hour after the cleaning, I went home and rinsed my mouth out some more because my gums were still kind of sore and would bleed if touched.\u00a0\u00a0After rinsing, I put some smokeless tobacco in my mouth for a while.\u00a0\u00a0Later that night, I noticed that my gums would still bleed easily when touched.\u00a0\u00a0A few days later, I've started to get this weird tingling feeling in both of my legs and both feet.\u00a0\u00a0The tingling feeling is in my thighs, lower legs, and feet.My question is:\u00a0\u00a0Could some tobacco have gotten into an opening in my gums or bloodstream and caused nerve damage, which is making my legs and feet tingle?The tingling is almost like a vibrating/ticklish feeling in my feet and legs.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry if this is a ridiculous question, and I am trying to quit tobacco use. Thanks.",
