            "answer": "Hi there!Erectile dysfunction can develop in young adults due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in adolescents in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors. You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work; I would suggest seeing your primary care physician or a urologist for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "Hello, I'm 15 and uncircumcised. About a year ago I tore my penis. During this time I had recently learned how to retract my foreskin. I was about 14, and I was just getting to masturbate. One day I retracted my foreskin, and there was a big glob of smegma connecting my penis head to my shaft, so me not knowing what smegma was at the time I was scared and frantically tried to pull my penis head and shaft apart. It left a tear and I began bleeding. After this I tried to get an erection to see if my penis was okay, but I think I made things worse. The penis head doesn't fill up with blood and looks deflated, and my erections are flabby. The tear has healed, but it's harder for me to obtain and maintain erections now. I'm worried that this will also stunt the growth of my penis. I'm scared, and I don't know what to do please help. Also, my semen isn't warm after ejaculation it's cool. I also don't last as long as I used to please help?",
