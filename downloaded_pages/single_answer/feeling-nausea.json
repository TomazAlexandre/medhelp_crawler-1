            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It could be food or water poisoning. It could also be a bad case of vasovagal attack especially since you jumped up from bed. It could also be a bad case of acidity and gastric reflux or GERD.The other possibility is that you developed postural hypotension. The blood pressure falls when you stand and causes all the symptoms that you are suffering. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "4 days ago, I jumped up from sleeping to catch the phone. I made it to the bathroom and felt faint.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to make it back to bed (in a hotel) but passed out.\u00a0\u00a0My husband said I was only out for a few seconds. I was short of breath, and when I tried to sit up I began vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0I was weak and dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0I layed there for several hours. When I tried to get up again, more vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0The next day I was pale, weak, had nausea and dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0It is now 4 days later and I still have nausea.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas? The Blue Cross nurse thought it was food poisoning but no one else in the family got sick and we all had the same thing.",
