    "question": "I am just about to leave for the hospital to get a Glucose Tolerance Test (2hr)\u00a0\u00a0I have been to a neurologist to try to find out the cause for the numbness in my hands and feet.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor wants to rule out Diabetes, of course.\u00a0\u00a0I have been dealing with others symptoms as well, but NONE of my symptoms include the expected ones for Diabetes. No thirst, no frequent urination, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Simple blood tests in the recent past have been running a bit high putting me in the \"pre-Diabetes\" category. My question is, can I have the disease without those symptoms except for neuropathy?Thanks for your opinion,Mary Kay",
