            "answer": "Hi there.With your background, I believe that your skin is really prone to dryness and even developing microscopic or evident superfical cracks.\u00a0\u00a0These cracks can be the nidus or focus of superficial skin infections that can cause the itching.The most common infection that can present with your symptoms is that of superficial fungal infections.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that you ask your doctor about tests to confirm this theory such as a skin KOH smear (where they take a scraping of the skin and examine it under the microscope) to see if there are signs of fungal infection and receive treatment for such.You can also benefit from oral anti-histamines such as hydroxizine or cetirizine but you should discuss this first with your doctors.Regards and God bless.",
