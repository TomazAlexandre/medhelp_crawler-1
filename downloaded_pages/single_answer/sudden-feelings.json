    "question": "To whom it may Concern:My name is Curtis, and for like about a week and a half now, I have for some reason been feeling a little shaky and kind of a like heavy feeling like pressure in my head. Both symptoms come and go and it strange. The shaky symptoms have that after a really good workout feeling, when your out of breathe in a way but not that dramatic,slighty. Also from this I noticed that about like two days ago, my body gets this chilly feeling ocasionally. The worst time with this though I must say is at night time lately when I try to lay down to sleep and can't properly cause my shaky body feeling is stopping me from sleeping right away even though in the past couple of days, it has been getting better. What could this all of a sudden be from, can anyone tell me?",
