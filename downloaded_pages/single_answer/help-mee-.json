            "answer": "Hi!If you want to reduce about 8 kg in a short time then you need to consult a good nutrition expert and physical trainer. You need to eat more of green vegetables, fruits, proteins and cut on carbohydrate, fats and fries. You need to slowly step-up aerobic exercise, and cycling and swimming are good options. Also you need to find out whether you have thyroid disorders or diabetes or polycystic ovary (if you are a female), as these tend to increase your weight. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
