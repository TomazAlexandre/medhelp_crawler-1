The symptoms of tingling, numbness, dizziness etc are probably due to radiculopathy caused by pressure on spinal nerves in the cervical region. Usually, this respond to treatments like hot and cold compress, stretching exercises, back low impact exercises, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, specially designed corsets, spinal manipulation and traction and epidural injections.Hyperintensities could be due to dilatation of perivascular spaces, demyelination and reduced blood supply. Hence, it can be caused by multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
