            "answer": "We are not qualified to make hospital or physician recommendations. A teaching hospital does sound like good advice, though. Her symptoms are not at all typical symptoms of type 1 diabetes, so if I were in your shoes, I would opt for a hospital that has specialists who deal with more than just diabetes. Her endocrinologist should be able to contact the hospital and make arrangements for you to get her admitted.",

    "question": "The 29-year-old diabetic/celiac young woman with severe autonomic symptoms, whom I told you about earlier, has suddenly developed disturbing new symptoms: an involuntary forward \"thrust\" in her head and upper body, almost like a pidgeon; she can't get words out when she tries to speak; and she's having severe headaches.\u00a0\u00a0 The local hospital ER suggested she should be seen at a teaching hospital where they will be better equipped to evaluate her.My questions:1.\u00a0\u00a0Which hospital would be best for her complex case in the New York area, since the cause of her multiple symptoms (dizziness, extreme fatigue, dark circles around eyes, nausea, severe headaches, loss of muscle tone, chills and sweats, inability to speak, inability to hold a pen to write, involuntary head thrust) has not yet been identified.\u00a0\u00a0It has been suggested that there might be a psychological component,as well.2.\u00a0\u00a0How to get an immediate admission?\u00a0\u00a0 Must she go through the ER?3.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know any specific doctor in this area (Westchester County/New York City) who is a superior diagnostician?Possibilities are Columbia Presbyterian, Montefiore/Einstein, New York/Cornell/Payne Whitney, NYU.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any advice!\u00a0\u00a0 The family is in a turmoil. A decision must be made today.wlew",
