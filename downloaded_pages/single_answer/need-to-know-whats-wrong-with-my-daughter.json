            "answer": "Your doctor is extremely irresponsible. She is having chest pains and all these other symptoms and he does no tests??? Take her to another doctor right away. He should at least do an EKG of her heart. And test for diabetes with an A1C test. At least! Get a recommendation from a friend or relative of a good doctor.",

    "question": "I am 28 and a mother of 2. My daughter, which is 11, has been having alot of problems in her young life. I am not sure if she has diabetes, this is confusing to me. Last week she missed two days of school because her right hand shakes alot,chest pains, heart racing, blurred vision, headaches, nose bleeds, and stomach pains. When I took her to the doctor on 8/27/10 he said that he believed she may have low sugar and wants her to eat snacks and more meals. He did not do any test on her at all. We have increased her meal intake and she eats more snacks and fruits and the symptoms are still here. She complains about her chest hurting all the time. Does anyone know what this could be?",
