    "question": "Hello. I am hoping you can help with my 14 year old daughter who has been sick for several months. She has had various thyroid related symptoms for almost 2 years but has been very ill since this past February.\u00a0\u00a0She was diagnosed as having Hashimotos due to elevated antibodies and her ultrasound, She was put on 50mg of sythroidShe's not better and herneck/throat pain have increased and it hurts when she swallows-she also gets swollen in the neck area at times.\u00a0\u00a0She has\u00a0\u00a0developed a persistent cough. Other symptoms include extreme nausea (vomits easily if she eats more than small amounts), dizziness, off and on fevers, feeling like she's hot all the time (this has been for 2 years now), exhaustion, sweaty, and increasing pains all over form her neck down to her legs-the neck.\u00a0\u00a0Her thyroid labs levels in March were:Anti-TG 80 (<1 normal)Anti-TPO\u00a0\u00a0129 (0-20) normalTSH 6.3Her ultrasound said her thyroid demonstrated slightly heterogeneous echotexture with tiny nodular foci-no dominant mass seen.They put her on synthroid and her recent labs levels are:Anti-TG 120 (increased)Anti-TPO 128TSH 1.8Her recent ultrasound said the isthmus appeared plump and the thyroid was more heterogenous in echogenicity then previous ultrasound and has increased in size.This past week we had an MRI which also indicated the ultrasound findings and said the thyroid was abnormal in appearance with possible goiter.With her being so sick and many other things ruled out\u00a0\u00a0we are very concerned.\u00a0\u00a0After this last ultrasound our pediatrician agreed he is concerned we need to rule out cancer but the endocrinologist said a he did not think it was cancer due to her TSH levels going down. We feel like we need someone who can differentiatebetween hashimotos, cancer or other thyroid probelms.We have seen her get worse and will travel to where we need to for help. Please let me know if you can give us any direction -we are in GA.Thank you for your time,Laura",
