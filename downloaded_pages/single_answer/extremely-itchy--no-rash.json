Skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "For over a month my skin has been extremely itchy. The itchiness exists all over my body, but the worst areas are my buttocks. I also have very bad itching around my arm pits, neck, legs, feet, and arms. There is no rash, but I have noticed small skin colored bumps on my fingers and toes occasionally (I have seen about 5 bumps total). I have had my liver tested, but it is healthy. I have used various anti-itch creams including hydrocortisone based products and benadryl, but they have no effect. I have used an antifungal cream, which seems to temporarily relieve the itching, but it quickly returns after about 15 minutes. If the itching is extreme, the antifungal cream provides no relief. I have also tried changing my soap, my laundry detergent, and my diet all to no avail. My doctor has no idea what could be causing the itching.",
