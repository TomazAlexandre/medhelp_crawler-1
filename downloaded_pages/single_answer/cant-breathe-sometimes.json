            "answer": "Hi, the report states that there is evidence of small airway disease which could be causing your symptoms of breathlessness. Here under-ventilation results in reduced perfusion and consequent breathlessness. Bronchodilators may help relieve the symptoms. Besides this cardiac disorders and certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time. Regards.",

    "question": "I just want to be okay :(I had PFT's done and all my numbers are great. Results are below , but WHY WH YWHY WHY do I wsignificantly decreased functional lung capacity?!?!!? when all my other numbers are normal :( im so sick of worrying. I have postural orthostatic tachy. syndrome and lupusmy results say this \"spirometry showed a forced vital capacity of 3.5 L which is 95% of predicted and FEV1 2.8L which is 96% of predicted FEV1/FVC is 81% The mid flow rates are moderately decreased. Significant improvement seen in mid flow rates with bronchodilator.The lung volume shows normal vital capacity and total lung capacity . The functional residual capacity is severely impaired.The diffusion is mildly impaired but when corrected to alveolar volume it is normal.Conclusion.1. spirometry and flow volume loop show small airway disease; significant improvement seen in mid flow rates with administration of bronchodilators2.lung volumes show significantly decreased fuctional residual capacity , but otherwise normal3. The diffusion is mildly impaired, but when corrected to aleveolar volume it is normal",
