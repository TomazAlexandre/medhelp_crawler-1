            "answer": "Hello,Ramipril is for hypertension and not for diabetes. Rest of the medicines are for diabetes. Your husband should take these medicines only after his physician\u2019s guidance and test his blood sugar at regular intervals. If his blood sugar rises then it can cause damage to the kidneys, eyes and nerves.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
