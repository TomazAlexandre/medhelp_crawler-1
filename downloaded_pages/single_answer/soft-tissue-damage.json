    "question": "Hello and thank you in advance for your help!\u00a0\u00a0I have a long sorted history of back problems.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 4 back surgeries, 3 of which were open back discectomies including correction for stenosis.\u00a0\u00a0All of my surgeries are L4 and L5 region and I have also been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, permanent nerve damage, and was borderline type II until I got my diet and weight under control.\u00a0\u00a0(I no longer require meds for the diabetes)\u00a0\u00a0I was also diagnosed with fibromyalgia as well.So my question is this:\u00a0\u00a0I recently fell really hard.\u00a0\u00a0My buttocks has these hard almost leathery bumps on it that hurt as if it is bruised but there are no visable bruises.\u00a0\u00a0I have bruises in other places that feel the same as my buttocks however, I am concerned that I may have done damage to my soft tissue?\u00a0\u00a0I can not find much help on the net about this either.\u00a0\u00a0Could the no bruising have to do with the permanent nerve damage, the DDD, diabetes or fibromyalgia?\u00a0\u00a0Whatever this is, should I be concerned at any point?Thanks again!",
