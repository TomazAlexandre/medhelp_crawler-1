    "question": "I have been suffering from pelvic pain for the last 5 years. I had an uss done around 3 years ago which showed a cyst on my left ovary and then another scan done last year which showed multiple cysts. I was originally told i had polycystic ovaries and was referred to see a specialist. The specialist has said they do not think I have polycystic ovaries as i don't have any symptoms, such as overweight, excess hair, acne etc. They have checked my hormone levels which were apparantley normal.Now I am confused my GP has done swabs numerous times, pregnancy tests all negative. They have suggested medication for IBS which I have also tried numerous times in the past with no help! I am constantly in pain in my pelvic area, nausea, bloated. My periods are irregular can range between 28-65 days. Has anyone else suffered anything like this or can suggest anything?",
