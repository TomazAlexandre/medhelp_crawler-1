    "question": "Hi I'm 19 and I got my period since I was 12 and basically since then I started getting ovarian cyst and having several rupture. The first ob/gyn I went to when I was 12 put me on the first birth control to stop the cyst, that worked for awhile and then stopped. I went to a new ob/gyn and she changed it to another one and that worked for a while then stopped, then she changed it to that pill one where you get your period every 3 months, that worked for a while and then stopped. Now my new ob/gyn put me on the depo shots, started them like 9 months ago. Now Its almost like they have stopped working again. I've had my period on and off for like the past 3 3 1/2 weeks and had terrible cramps and ovary pain. Is there any other options, I think I have an appointment to see my dr in like 3 weeks. My dad once told me there are people who are like immune to birth control, is that possible?",
