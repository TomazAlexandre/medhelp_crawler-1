            "answer": "Bypass surgery and tramua do not cause polyneuropathy. These conditions are most commonly secondary to diabetes. If the current dose of Neurontin is not working, it can be increased up to about 3000mg per day. If it does not work by this dose, it is unlikely to work at higher levels. The next line agent to control the pain is typically amitriptyline. This was orginally designed as a anti-depressant, but at much lower doses was found to treat neuropathic pain. Lastly, you should work with your neurologist to attempt to find a cause, however in many patients we never find the exact cause. Good luck.",
