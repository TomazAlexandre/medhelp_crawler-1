    "question": "Hi everyoneAll of my symptoms started a few\u00a0\u00a0months after I had emergency surgery to remove an ovarian cyst. I was put on birth control for endometriosis. Right before my symptoms I experienced a panic attack (trouble breathing, heart racing, tingling). My brother and dad have anxiety issues so I guess it runs in the family.A few weeks after the panic attack I noticed slight tingling in both feet...I noticed it after working out at the gym. It lasted for a good 2 and half months and slowly got better. I still experience it but not as much. Luckly I had no pain with the tingling. Just very annoying. During the same time I also had body wide painless muscle twitches. These occured randomly on my body and lasted for two days really bad. I still get this but much less frequent.When the tingling started I noticed starburts around lights at night (while driving). Lights look fine during the day. I have no pain/blurriness with this visual disturbance. I also notice floaters. I was most concerned with this so I went to an opthamologist and he said there was nothing wrong with my eyes. I felt relieved after this.With these symptoms I also noticed a \"skipped\" heart beat. I get these occasionally and had an EKG done just in case. It came out normal. I have been feeling these skipped beats more often with these other symptoms.Numerous people have told me this is most likely anxiety...I have to admit I have been very anxious. Also of note, I started taking a multi-vitamin and a b12 vitamin when the tingling continued. After a few weeks of taking these the tingling seemed to be getting better...although this can be in my head. :)Before the tinlging started I had blood work and showed no diabetes or thyriod problems.All in all I feel pretty good..no balance issues, no fatigue, no vision (except for the halos/starburst) problems, no bladder problems, etc.Any thoughts on my symptoms would be appreciated.Thanks!",
