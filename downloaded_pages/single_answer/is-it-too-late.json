    "question": "I've been really sick my whole pregnancy, from pregnancy related things and non pregnancy related things. I've done terrible with diet and exercise and I'm 25 weeks....I'm so worried that I've already been a terrible mother. Is it too late to do those things that can benifit my baby? I'm also starting to worry I have gestational diabetes but I haven't gotten results back yet.",
