            "answer": "HI,I do agree you should have a further check into those concerns.Medications can cause some changes in blood counts etc but do not often cause an enlarged spleen.I am afraid I am not the best person for this situation--a Hematologist is\u00a0\u00a0really the best qualified person regarding those concerns and questions, so I encourage you to seek consultation with one as soon as you can.Take care.",
