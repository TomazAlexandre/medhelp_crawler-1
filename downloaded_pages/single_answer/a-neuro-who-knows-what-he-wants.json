    "question": "Hey Guys!I saw my new neuo yesterday, and he was great!\u00a0\u00a0Gave him my sx list, and he actually started reading it, and asking me ?'s about it.\u00a0\u00a0He took me very seriously, was concerned because he said I have alot of complaints, on top of my other problems(diabetes fibro, lupus etc).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, he of course wants to eliminate all of the mimics. Spoke to him about how my new rheumy thinks the Lupus might be a misdiagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Because of the IBS problems, wants to make sure I don't also have celiac disease, sending me for an eng, I guess because of the vertigo. another mri of the brain, neck, and thoracic area,(never had that one done before).\u00a0\u00a0Told him about the buzzing, vibrating head, was very concerned.\u00a0\u00a0 Sending me for some king of computer test for the memory,problem solving, and cog issues.\u00a0\u00a0And also a dextra bone scan because I'm diabetic, so incase I need steroids.and also had a complete hysterectomy.\u00a0\u00a0I think that's what he said.\u00a0\u00a0Also last but not least, a sleep study, cause I snore really bad, and I'm still sleeping on the recliner because of all the muscle pain.\u00a0\u00a0I don't get much sleep.\u00a0\u00a0Not tooo excited about the sleep study.\u00a0\u00a0I like to watch tv before I fall asleep, and I have to get up so many times a nite to use the bathroon. Said will probable do LP after all other testing doneSo today I see my new Rheumy for the results of lab work, about the Lupus and other things.\u00a0\u00a0I'll keep you posted.\u00a0\u00a0I'm starting to see the little nite light at the end of the tunnel. A DIAGNOSIS!\u00a0\u00a0 No matter what the dx is I need something so I can start to treat it.\u00a0\u00a0 I asked him, so what do you think doc about the ms do you have any ideas yet.\u00a0\u00a0He said, \"Well if it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, It's probably a duck, but we have to rule everything else out\".\u00a0\u00a0I said I couldn't agree more.\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway I'll let you know what happens as it happens.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for listening!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hugs!\u00a0\u00a0 Sandie",
