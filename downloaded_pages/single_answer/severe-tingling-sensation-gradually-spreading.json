            "answer": "Hi there. I can understand these symptoms must be very disturbing for you. You need to check with a neurologist soon for an MRI spine cervical and lumbar to rule out any spinal canal stenosis,\u00a0\u00a0intervertebral disc prolapsed or any bony spur irritating the nerves. Any other cause for cervical and lumbar nerve compression should be checked. Blood tests to investigate diabetes, thyroid disorders, Vitamin B 12 and B6 deficiencies, any known history of chronic alcohol abuse.
