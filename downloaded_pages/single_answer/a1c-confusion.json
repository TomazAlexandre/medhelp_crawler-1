    "question": "I am little confused about my test results. Diabetes runs rampant in my family so it has always been a concern to me. I had a total thyroidectomy in Aug 2008 and am now Hypothyroid. Keeping myself at a healthy weight since my surgery has been extremely tough and nearly impossible. I had gotten my A1c and glucose checked in 10/27/2012 and\u00a0\u00a0my lab results came back with my: Hemoglobin A1c 5.6\u00a0\u00a0Glucose 85 mg/dl. I have since lost close to 20 lbs through diet and exercise. On 6/22/2013, I got another set of tests taken. I have gone back to the Dr since then for my follow up, she had received my new results and didn't mention anything concerning other than my thyroid was off, yet again, and sent me on my way. Today, I received my test results frim the lab and my Hemoglobin A1c is 5.7 (H) and Glucose 89 mg/dl. I've read other posts that state those results aren't even possible. Can someone please explain this to me?",
