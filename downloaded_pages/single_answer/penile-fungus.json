            "answer": "Fungal infections and diabetes go hand in hand unfortunately :(At this point it's best for you to follow up on this with a dermatologist since otc creams and oral diflucan aren't working for you.\u00a0\u00a0They can best help you at this point.I also recommend returning to your doctor or seeing an urologist too because a run of the mill fungal infection, is not going to be so painful that you can't even move. You need to make sure that nothing else is going on too. It shouldn't be causing you pain in the genital area like this.grace",

    "question": "I have what my doctor calls a \"yeast infection\", but I gather there are different varieties.\u00a0\u00a0I am Type 2 diabetic, 59 y.o.\u00a0\u00a0I've had the infection for over a year.\u00a0\u00a0It has been _extremely_ painful - some times more than others, sometimes also very itchy.\u00a0\u00a0 Since I've gotten my BG under control it's lessened but never gone away.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor gave me an antifungal ointment last year which does nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I took a fluconozole tablet once last year and it worked well but the infection returned.\u00a0\u00a0Subsequent administration of fluconozole had no effect at all, so I gather the infection has developed a tolerance to it.I have to get rid of this...it is extremely painful to the point where I sometimes can't even move - I had had a quite active sex life,but can't do anything now even with a condom because of the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Please. what more can I suggest to my doctor?",
