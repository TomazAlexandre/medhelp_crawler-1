            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!You probably have irritable bowel syndrome or IBS. This can causes loose stools with vaso-vagal or fainting attacks. The sensations of pins and tingling are generally due to peripheral neuropathies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism and diabetes. Hypothyroidism too can cause gut problems.Sweating is the result of lowering of blood pressure during a fainting attack.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
