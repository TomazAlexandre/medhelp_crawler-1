            "answer": "A few questions..Did you tell the Dr. about the new medication for diabetes and the diarrhea?When was the last time you took a Lortab before the test was taken? The morning of, or the night before?Did you bring in the bottle of your Lortab so they could see if there was any leftover if there was supposed to be?There are two types of urine tests. One is a dip stick test that shows a yes or no pretty much for opiates and is not sensitive at all for the amount of opiate. And then there is one that is sent to lab that uses gas chromatography mass spectrometry. This is sophisticated enough to see the detailed amount of each opiate and medication in one's system.All I can suggest now is that you make sure they know about your other health issues and either ask to be re-tested.Hope it works out ok for you.",
