            "answer": "Hi there. The most serious neurological side effects of metoclopramide are symptoms mimicking parkinson\u2019s disease, involuntary muscle movements, dystonic reactions but these usually disappear when it is discontinued. This could be trauma, infection, autoimmune disorder and spine disc degenerative disease. Consult an orthopaedician for examination of the foot to rule out any trauma, fracture bone and comparison with the better foot, radio graphically. This could be peripheral neuropathy secondary to vitamin b complex deficiency, diabetes mellitus etc. autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, metabolic disorders like gout need to be checked with blood tests. MRI spine needs to be done for lumbar disc degeneration, prolapsed or spondylosis. Hope this helps. Take care.",
