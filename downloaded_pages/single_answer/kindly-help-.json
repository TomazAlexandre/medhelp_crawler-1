However, it is important that your newly diagnosed diabetes condition be managed to prevent complications such as\u00a0\u00a0peripheral neuropathies which presents with numbness, loss of sensation, and sometimes pain in the feet, legs, or hands. It is highly recommended\u00a0\u00a0that blood sugar levels are within normal levels. Talk to your doctor about this for proper management.\u00a0\u00a0Aside from diabetes neuropathies, osteoarthritis, musculoskeletal issues and vitamin B 12 deficiency may also be ruled out. Take care and do keep us posted.",
