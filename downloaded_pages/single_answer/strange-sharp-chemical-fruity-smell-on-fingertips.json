    "question": "It occurred to me for the first time two weeks ago. A very strange sharp fruity (chemical) smell from my finger tips. When I sniffed my other hand it didn't give this smell. When I sniffed other body parts or the mobile phone I had been using (or other objects) I couldn't trace this smell. When I smelled the same finger tips a bit later, the smell was gone. However since than the smell has re-occurred several times, always from my finger tips. Sometimes from my left hand and some times from the right hand. generally only from 1 hand at the time (not both hands producing this smell). Could this be a neurological condition (phantome) , or could this be a genuine odor produced by a condition? Thanks for advice.",
