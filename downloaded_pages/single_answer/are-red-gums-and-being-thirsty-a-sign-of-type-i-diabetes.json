    "question": "MY 2 1/2 year old son is always thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as he wakes up in the morning he says he is thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0Just recently, he started waking up at night saying he is thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0I checked his shirt last night and it was damp so he must have been sweaty.\u00a0\u00a0We also noticed that his gums were a little red this weekend and not today, they are inflammed red and he is fussy.\u00a0\u00a0I read on one site that red gums might be associated with type I diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am worried that his desire to drink a lot may be an early sign.\u00a0\u00a0My mother and brother are both diabetics, so should I be concerned? Is this genetic?\u00a0\u00a0He is also on the thin side but he does eat.",
