    "question": "I am a 25 year old type 1 diabetic. I have had diabetes for 17 years. I NEVER FEEL FULL! I can eat foods high in protien and always want more. Sometimes I act on it sometimes I dont. My diabetes is not controled due to the fact that I do not have any money to afford medicines. But I domy best. I dont sit around eating junk food all day but mostly healthy foods. I just came off of the atkins diet because the hunger was too horrible. It really was! I would get bad headaches and end up taking more medicine to get rid of thsoe headaches. I just dont know what is wrong with me. I never ever feel full! I drink tons of water, sugar free drinks, I eat 2 to 3 meals a day. I eat veggies and fruits. If someone knows what could be wrong or lead me in the right direction to finding out, I would really appreciate it.",
