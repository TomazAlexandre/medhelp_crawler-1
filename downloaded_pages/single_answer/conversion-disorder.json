    "question": "I have been suffering from right sided facial numbness for 14 months that has progressed to include my arm and leg both on the right side. I have had MRI of brain and cervical spine, all normal. I have had every blood test known to Man to check for diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, vitamin deficiency, and lead poisoning, all normal. I have been on xanax from the onset of these symptoms, have been to two different neurologists and one ENT, no abnormalities. Today I went for a physical with my PCP and she said I may have conversion disorder. This started after the break up of my marriage for two years and becoming a single Mother. I was sexually abused as a child but thought I had dealt with those issues....If it is conversion disorder, what is the best course of treatment. I have been doing alot of research and am interested in hypnotherapy...if this is truly what I have, all I know is it is ruining my life. The only time I don't feel the symptoms is when I first wake up before full consciousness, and when drinking heavily. Any insight would be appreciated...Thank you.",
