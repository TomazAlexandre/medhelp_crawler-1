            "answer": "Hi!You are probably talking about Hidradenitis suppurativa, which presents as recurrent boil-like pus-like discharge abscesses resulting in difficult-to-heal open wounds and sometimes scarring. It commonly occurs on sweat gland-bearing skin such as in the groin, the underarms and under the breasts. It is also known as \u2018acne inversa\u2019. The disease can spread to genitals.It can also be due to staphylococcal skin infections. MRSA infection is another possibility. Hence a culture of the skin scrapings from the cyst should be done to rule this out. Also, please get a complete STD panel to rule out herpes and genital warts (less likely but it\u2019s best to rule this out too).Wash skin with antiseptic lotions daily to decrease bacteria. Treatment is by topical antibiotics and steroids. Local antibiotics of erythromycin and Clindamycin group also help. Retenoid group of drugs also help. Wear loose fitting clothes. Get your diabetes status checked as high blood sugar can also cause recurrent boils. Consult a skin specialist.Hope you get well soon! Good Luck and take care!",
