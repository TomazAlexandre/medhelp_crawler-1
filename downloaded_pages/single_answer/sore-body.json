            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are three main things you should test for: thyroid problems, diabetes and anemia. Apart from this Vit B12 and Vit D deficiency should be looked at. Unexplained pains, sometimes the bones paining and sometimes the muscles can be due to a problem called \u2018fibromyalgia\u2019. This is associated with fatigue and a heightened and painful response to gentle touch (allodynia). Other symptoms include\u00a0\u00a0needle-like tingling of the skin, nerve pain, muscle aches and spasms, weakness in the limbs, functional bowel disturbances, and chronic sleep disturbances. Although fibromyalgia usually presents with chronic widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the shoulders, neck, low back, hips, or other areas.The cause of fibromyalgia is often hereditary or due to a physical or emotional trauma or due to lingering infection in the body such as due to mono. The treatment is a mix and match of analgesics, anti depressants, anti seizure medications, physical therapy and counseling.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello,Sometimes I feel like the glands in under my arms and groin area are sore. They are not swollen at all, and I have had them checked, but I am worried why they would occasionally be sore. I also sometimes feel like I still have growing pains in my arms and legs even though I'm 19 years old. I do get occasional chest pain as well. Does anyone know if these are signs of something serious?Thanks for your help.",
