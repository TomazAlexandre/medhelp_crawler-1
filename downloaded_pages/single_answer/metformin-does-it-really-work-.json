            "answer": "Metformin is used with proper diet and exercise to control high blood sugar in people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Like all medication it may not always work with every individual.Did you consult with your doctor;\u2022 That you were losing weight?\u2022 Had two episodes of low glucose?\u2022 Stopping Metformin?\u2022 Resuming Metformin?\u2022 Pros/cons of Metformin with you?\u2022 Severe Heartburn?Stopping and resuming medication on your own w/o consulting your doctor is not wise. Complications may arise.Are you checking your glucose levels with a home test meter on a regular basis? Your log - dates/time/reading - should be presented to your doctor for analysis. It would help your doctor too if you indicated your weight at time of test.Something better than Metformin? Yes, one is a healthy lifestyle by carefully monitoring your nutrition along with moderate exercise and keeping your weight at normal levels. Injectable insulin would be your final recourse. I think its time you spoke directly with your doctor.By the way, congrats on the weight loss.",
