            "answer": "Hi,For how long have you experienced the headaches?Have you always suffered from headaches before?I suggest you undergo a complete assessment. You have mentioned of a stiff neck in the mornings. At this point, we may be thinking that the headaches may be due to the medications, however with diabetes, neuropathies or nerve related disorders ,these may present with headaches and other manifestaions.A cervical spine CT scan may be able to help exclude any nerve impingement or arthritic causes of pain.A cardiac evaluation ( EKG and 2D Echo) , carotid duplex scan and an EMG of the extremities and duplex scans of peripheral blood vessels in the extremities may be able to help. Decreased blood flow and nerve related disorders which may be present in patients with diabetes may manifest as pain and numbness.In addition, I suggest that you also have your kidney function assessed. A 24 urine collection for urine protein levels and serum protein albumin levels will be able to help.Diabetes affects all organs of the body.It is important to continue maintenance medications and to keep a close follow up with your physicians. The eyes, the heart and kidneys should be periodically assessed.Discuss with your physician pain management strategies that may help alleviate the pain while further evaluation is being done.",
