            "answer": "Pam,Thanks for responding. The funny thing is, I know what you say is true already. But sometimes it is just nice to hear someone confirm things to ease your anxiety until you see the Dr. I don't know if they'll be retesting. My LDH was 700 in Sept, but clearly due to a bad blood draw. The retest was 160. Now it is 246. The normal range is 100-190. My melanoma Docs at MD Anderson feel it has nothing to do with the melanoma. My CA125 was 60 last month and now down to 50. My gyn keeps wanting to tie it to the melanoma. My melanoma docs say no. So my gyn is sending me to a gyn/onc this Monday. I'm trying not to worry for a few reasons 1) because neither level is grossly elevated and 2) I have many other reasons why each of these levels could be elevated such as fibroids, simple cysts, I wouldn't be surprised if I have endometriosis, I had my appendix removed in July, my appendix was wrapped up in my intestines pretty bad so an infection wouldn't surprise me either, and I know I have some damage to my liver. I also take medication for diabetes, thyroid, blood pressure, hormones (too much estrogen), cholesterol. So, all of those conditions as well as their medications can cause elevated LDH. I'm trying not to worry, but once you have cancer, any sign of it being there or spreading is worrisome. My derm also thought maybe my lymph node was swollen on the side of my body with the melanoma. At this point I just don't know if it is all related and non-cancerous, or if I really do have melanoma AND some kind of gynecological cancer. Anyway, thanks for the reassurance that this could be something else. I hope to get answers soon.",

    "question": "Anyone have elevated LDH levels with any kind of gyn cancer? I had my 3 month melanoma check-up and my ldh level is slightly elevated (which \"can\" mean the disease has spread to organs). I have other conditions that could cause it as well, however now that I have a slightly elevated LDH and slightly elevated CA125 (50), I'm a bit more concerned. Two elevated tumor markers at the same time is a little scary.Thanks",
