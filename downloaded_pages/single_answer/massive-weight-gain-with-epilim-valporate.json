            "answer": "Yes I've noticed I started to gain weight myself with Catapres (which can increase appetite) so I am going back to taking preventative steps myself. I did gain weight on Depakoate (another term for Epilim) and Seroquel when I took them in the past. Besides a daily exercise routine another is to cut back on snacks and deserts and substitute more healthy snacks for them and to drink flavored seltzer water instead of soda. Also though I would discuss the weight gain with your doctor and have them do some blood work as regards sugar level and other relevant tests as the weight gain caused by Seroquel and other atypical antipsychotics can cause diabetes if not kept in check so they need to monitor for that. Depending on the level of weight gain it might be worthwhile to ask them to refer you to a nutritionist as well who could give specific suggestions as regards diet that would be a healthy way to reduce the proper amount of weight.",
