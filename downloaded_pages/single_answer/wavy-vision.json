    "question": "I am having hazy vision in my left eye. Sometimes I feel as if a screen is there in front of my left eye because of which I am seeing hazy things. I do not have cataract, tests have revealed. I have done all types of blood tests and everything is perfect and normal. I don't have diabetes, but have medium blood pressure of 140/100. I went to a few doctors, and they gave me eye-drops, and I have recently started having wavy vision, as if I am looking through one of those glasses one gets to see at a fun house, such that I see distorted versions of people, with eyebrows askew, one eye small, one eye large, sometimes I even see people's head as a tiny ball which suddenly enlarges after shifting a certain angle. Nobody is understanding my situation. No doctor here is able to evaluate my disease. Some of them are suspecting stroke, but I am yet to do an ECG. Please help me.",
