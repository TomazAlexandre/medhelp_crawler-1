            "answer": "Have you seen a cardiologist or a neurologist. The accident may have had something to do with causing these symptoms (see neurologist). Or the accident may have been a coincidence & had nothing to do with them (a cardiologist). You need further investigation & I wouldn't be pushing my body until I found out what is causing these symptoms.You sound like a very active person that doesn't dwell on sickness.
