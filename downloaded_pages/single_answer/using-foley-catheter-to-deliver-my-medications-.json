            "answer": "Hi,How are you? The muscles and nerves of the urinary system work together to hold urine in the bladder and then release it at the appropriate time. In a neurogenic bladder, the nerves that are supposed to carry these messages do not work properly. The common causes due to which neurogenic bladder can occur is acute infections, diabetes, trauma to brain or spinal cord, genetic nerve problems, heavy metal poisoning etc.What was the cause in your case that has led to neurogenic bladder? I think you are being prescribed antibiotics as a prophylactic measure to prevent infections. They cannot be given through the foley's catheter, because drugs cannot enter into the circulation when they are in the bladder, there by do not help in combating the infection.The purpose of preventing the side effects due to neurogenic bladder would not serve if the medications are given through the catheter into the bladder. If your symptoms are severe change of antibiotics can be considered, but you must remember that all antibiotics have some common side effects like headache, gastro intestinal symptoms, rash etc.Discuss with your doctor about other options of treatment like placement of an artificial sphincter, botox injections at site of sphincter and also about the change of antibiotics.All the best.",
