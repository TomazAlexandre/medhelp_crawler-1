            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Since you have high blood pressure, you must be on blood pressure medications. A feeling of floating/slipping at times happens when the blood pressure suddenly falls. It can also happen when awakened from very deep sleep or when very sleepy. Hypoglycemia too is another cause. Another possibility is punctate hemorrhage in brain. This can be dangerous. Please consult a doctor as it is difficult to give a confirmed diagnosis on net.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
