            "answer": "Hi, with so many abdominal surgeries there is the probability of having adhesions inside the abdomen. This is due to the fibrous tissue that forms after surgeries. If there is a complete obstruction then adhesiolysis may be done. For now eat healthy and include plenty of organic yogurt in your diet. Try to take high fibre diet and see if it helps. Regards.",
