            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. Your whole body vibration symptoms could be related to diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, Vitamin B complex deficiency, neurological disorder or if you are any vibration jobs (like drilling etc). Nerve studies and nerve test may be helpful to further evaluate the condition. I would recommend evaluating the possibilities here with the help of a doctor. Further referral to a neurologist or endocrinologist may be required to assess the condition. Hope this information proves helpful to you. Take Care & Regards!!!",

    "question": "I've been experiencing internal vibrations for almost 2 years now. They all started when, after a month of 2/3 hours every day at the gym, I started to get fasiculations in my insoles. The fasiculations gradually spread into my calves, at which point I was given a diagnosis of benign fasiculation syndrome. Since then the vibrations have become widespread: legs, arms, neck, and abdomen are affected. I also get the occasional 'thumper'; a short, visible fasiculation.\u00a0\u00a0I've had advanced blood labs, an MRI, nerve conduction and EMG, all of which were normal (except a high calcium on one blood test). One neurologist believes I have RLS; another, channelopathy (the second sent me on my way suggesting I forget about it or get a psychaitric evaluation). I should add that my vibrations are worse at night and after exercise, though they don't usually interfere with sleep. I'm at my wit's end with this thing it's so debilitating. Are my symptoms suggestive of RLS or something else? What is my next course of action?",
