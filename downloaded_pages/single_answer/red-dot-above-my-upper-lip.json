    "question": "I have had a red dot above my upper lip for about 2 months. If I do nothing to it, it just crusts over like it is forming a scab but a few days later the dead skin/scab falls off, but the red spot is still there. If I apply neosporin or lip-balm to it constantly, it doesn't crust over and the red dot shrinks a little in size, but the red dot still remains. The spot does not cause pain and does not puss or anything. I am just curious if it is a rash, pimple, scare, or something else and what I can do to get rid of itThe spot is not itchy, it doesn't blister or puss. All it seems to do is start to crust over if nothing is applied to it, and after a few days the crust falls off but it is still red. It repeats doing this if I do not keep it moist with neosporin or lip balm.I have tried to let it heal for two weeks. I did not pick at it or anything, but it continued to crust/scab up and then the scab would fall off and there would still be a red dot. I do not have any other medical problem (diabetes mellitus or a family history of it). This is the first time I have had this condition.Should I see a doctor or a specialist (dermatologist)",
