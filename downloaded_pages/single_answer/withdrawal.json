            "answer": "Hi and welcome! I'm pretty sure that many will agree with you and wish they had never gotten on methadone. However, that's water under the bridge and what's most important is that you're ready to get off. I, personally, don't have any experience with methadone but there are tons on here that do and will be able to give you great advice! I have no clue about your methadone / diabetes question and I hope someone on here does.What are your plans for getting off the methadone? Are you taking vitamins / supplements? Keep us posted on your plans and how you're doing!",
