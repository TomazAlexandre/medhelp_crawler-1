            "answer": "I can see the diabetes and feet connection possibility... But I really Dont know. If you've asked ur doctor/midwife and they have no answers (surprised if they didn't suggest you follow a nutritionist/special diet),\u00a0\u00a0maybe you can consider seeing a podiatrist/orthopedist.! They could be of great help. If you don't get checked now, baby will only keep growing and the baby weight plus your own will only increase the pain. But for now, I say, lay off the heels and flats. Wear something with at least an inch of heel between the front of shoe and back (heel being at the back obviously). I am no doctor but I do have feet issues of my own...those specialists helped me a year ago. I'm 29 weeks and can dance and walk in these feet! All the best mama.",
