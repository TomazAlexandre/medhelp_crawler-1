            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Thanks also for clearly enumerating your problems and points.The various causes of leg pain are atherosclerosis, deep vein thrombosis - (A blood clot in a deep vein), Leriche syndrome (block in abdominal aorta and/or main leg artery), limb ischaemia (low oxygen to limbs), sciatica, spondylitis of lower vertebrae and peripheral vascular disease (arteries of limbs are involved).Yes, since you are a diabetic, smoker, on birth control pills and an athlete in the past, you must get yourself investigated for deep vein thrombosis. A color Doppler test will rule out the possibility of involvement of an artery or vein and its blockage by a clot.Also since you are an overweight diabetic, you should also rule out pinched nerves as in sciatica. Your lower spine, CT scan or MRI will show a pinched nerve if there is one.I have enumerated the possibilities that come to my mind right now. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage without examining you. A vascular specialist and an orthopedic specialist can help you best. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 24 year old female with sharp shooting leg pains in my left leg.\u00a0\u00a0The pains don't seem to be muscular because I spent many years in sports as a kid and have pulled muscles before.\u00a0\u00a0It happens a couple times a week, a couple times a day and starts from my hip and continues down to my calf. It hurts so bad, it immobilizes me and feels to-the-bone.\u00a0\u00a0I am a smoker of 9 years and have a history of on-set obesity diabetes and low blood pressure in my family.\u00a0\u00a0I am interested to know what it could be and what specialist I should go see for testing, as I think it may be something to do with my blood, i.e. blood clots, or sugar levels. I do not take medications except for a low-dose birth control called microgestin. Hopefully this is enough info for a response. Thanks!",
