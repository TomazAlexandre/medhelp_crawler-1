    "question": "I am a 19 y/o male, and in decent shape [thin but rarely exersize]*I am experiencing stomach discomfort on a daily basis. I am also unnecessarily tired most of the time.My diet does not include any soda, but I drink a lot of juice, cereal, and consume lots of other sugars in my diet.What things could be causing a almost non-stop feeling of discomfort and 'feeling full'...there not a lot of excess gas either.Is it possible that my diet, low in fruits and veggies and all the other things that make a good diet, is causing my stomach discomfort and sleepiness? I dont believe it would be an ulcer, i have a relatively stress free day.help!",
