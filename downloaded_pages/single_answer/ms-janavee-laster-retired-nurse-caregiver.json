            "answer": "Novalog is a fast-acting insulin and is both expensive, and requires constant supervision by a physician or nurse who knows exactly what they are doing. Blood sugar levels of 500 are in the lethal range and are unaceptable, however there are many missing pieces to this story. What is her hba1c for example? And what is her fasting blood sugar in the morning and what is her diet? With proper diet there is no reason to obtain a fast-acting insulin. Novalog has advantages, but is not recommended for those who live alone. Lantus, a long-acting slow-release insulin may be more appropriate. I am not a happy camper knowing she is buming unused insulin from others. It is obvious her diabetes is completely out of control. Her diabetes needs to be evaluated by a qualified nurse, nurse-practicioner, and preferably an endochronologist and dietician who will come up with a plan of action that will preserve her life. As soon as possible. She might have a problem with so-called insulin resistance. There are lots of missing pieces to this story, and I would suggest you not be involved in obtaining Novalog for her without a physician's approval and prescription. There are many alternatives to controlling diabetes without using expensive fast-acting insulin.",
