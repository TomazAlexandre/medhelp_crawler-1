            "answer": "Hi!Your symptoms sound fairly classic for candida.\u00a0\u00a0This often occurs in the groin area and under the tummy pooch.\u00a0\u00a0Often there is some discoloration associated such as darkening or redness of the skin in the areas.\u00a0\u00a0Under the breasts and underarms can be problem areas as well.\u00a0\u00a0If you were my patient, I would do a couple of things.\u00a0\u00a0I would test for diabetes--this problem is more common in diabetics, but can also occur in people with normal blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0I would probably do a skin biopsy to rule out something like lichen sclerosis or eczema, and I would probably treat for yeast.\u00a0\u00a0Some things that can help:\u00a0\u00a0Antifungal shampoo used as a body wash, antifungal powder to help reduce the moisture, going naked whenever possible.I would probably also prescribe diflucan for at least two treatments, and possibly a steroid cream to alleviate the inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0One more thing to try while you are waiting to see a gynecologist or dermatologist--Crisco applied to the skin in the itchy areas is very soothing.Hope this helps!Dr B",

    "question": "Ever since I got pregnant w/ my last son who was born in Jan '09, I've had this itch that started just in the crease of the leg/labia area where your underwear line is.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last year it's spread slightly.\u00a0\u00a0I only have itching on the outside and there are no sores or rash or discharge.\u00a0\u00a0I'm overweight and it stays hot down there so there's usually moisture.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure it that is actual sweat or if I am leaking urine (I've had 3 kids).\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it itches so bad, I scratch til it's raw and then when I urinate, it's unbelievably itchy.\u00a0\u00a0When I shower, it's not so bad, but as the day goes on and I'm active, the moisture starts and then so does the itch.\u00a0\u00a0I thought at first I had an allergy to maybe the underwear lining (like the rubber), but I've switched underwear w/o the elastic there.\u00a0\u00a0I googled the itching and was thinking maybe I had low estrogen or allergies and then I've also read about how it could be liver related. ( I recently over the last few weeks started itching everywhere, my arms, legs, feet, head, etc., but they don't itch til I scratch it raw, so I'm sure this is something unrelated.)\u00a0\u00a0I don't have any discharge or itching or pain inside the labia or vagina.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be yeast or some kind of fungal infection?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe my PH is messed up and my sweat/urine irritates me?\u00a0\u00a0Please help!",
