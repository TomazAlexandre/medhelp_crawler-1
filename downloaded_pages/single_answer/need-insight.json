            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Well, without looking at the MRI pictures it is difficult to say what the problem is. Since there have been metastasis before, this should be ruled out first. You can either discuss the MRI with the neurologist or the cancer specialist you see for regular follow-ups. The second thing is to rule out migraines.Thickening of pituitary stalk is usually seen in diabetes insipidus (a disorder of increased urination related to either pituitary or the adrenal). However in some cases it does signify metastasis or tubercular pathology. With a high CRP metastasis should be ruled out first and then other causes of inflammation looked at.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
