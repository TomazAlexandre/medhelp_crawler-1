    "question": "Dr. Lupo:Thanks for your answer to my earlier question.\u00a0\u00a0I have hypothyroidism and I have also been diagnosed with PCOS using labs and ultrasound on ovaries.\u00a0\u00a0I am still experiencing horrible fatigue and occasional tingling in my hands and feet.\u00a0\u00a0I had thought this was thyroid-related, but now I am wondering about insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned since I have PCOS as well as relatives with type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I asked my doctor about it and he said that my fasting-glucose levels have always been normal (in June it was 81), my non-fasting serum insulin was normal (level was 8), non-fasting c-peptide was normal (level was 2.9), so it isn\u2019t an issue.\u00a0\u00a0I requested the 2hr GTT w/insulin check.\u00a0\u00a0He felt it was a waste of my time to get this test, but gave me the order to get it done anyway.\u00a0\u00a0I did that yesterday.1)\t What would indicate insulin resistance with this test?\u00a0\u00a0I am considering switching doctors because I am not sure if the doc I am seeing is right for me.2)\tWould a reproductive endocrinologist treat both PCOS and hypothyroidism or do they only treat people with issues in trying to get pregnant?3)\tI have heard of many people with PCOS taking Glucophage.\u00a0\u00a0If this is a proper treatment for IR, is the extended release version better than the regular?Thanks for your help.Most recent labs:November (while on .88mcg Synthroid, 10mcg Cytomel, 200mg Prometrium 18days/mo)Free T4 1.2 (.8-1.8)Free T3 325 (230-420)TSH\u00a0\u00a0.22 (.4-4.50)TPO AB 411",
