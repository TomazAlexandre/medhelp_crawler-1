    "question": "I've been reading other questions posed. I was recently diagnosed w/ hypothyroidism and I have been having trouble catching my breath after just minimal walking, etc. Mine does not feel as though the thyroid is enlarged, mine is located in my lungs & my ability to take larger breaths. I do have some trouble swallowing but again my lung area feels as though it's not expanding fully. I feel like others who have given the same symptoms are being told they aren't correct or that they aren't feeling it in the correct at ease. I've lived with serious chronic diseases since birth (chronic familial pancreatitis, diabetes) I KNOW my body. Could doctors be missing a symptom that does not necessarily affect all with hypothyroidism?? My only relief comes if I STOP movement, sit down, raise arms above head and breath slowly until breathing is not so labored. I have gone too far and been to the point of nearly not being able to catch my breath. Help! I'm an active person! Will my T4 & T4/T3 meds reduce this worrisome problem? Also will the last 1/3 of my eyebrows and my thinning hair repair themselves?",
