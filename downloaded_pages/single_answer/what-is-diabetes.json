            "answer": "Diabetes occurs when either of two things happen to affect the body's abiity to process the carbohydrates that we eat properly to convert them to energy that our cells need in order to function. The result is that the unprocessed glucose remains in our bloodstreams and damages the tiny blood vessels that supply major organs. Untreated, this can result in nerve damage and organ failure, and even death.In the case of type 2 diabetes, the problem is usually insulin resistance. This means that the body's pancreas usually produces the hormone insulin, as it is supposed to, but the body does not use this insulin properly to convert the carbohydrates in the diet to energy OR the body's pancreas does not make enough insulin. Usually, the type 2 diabetic is overweight, for fat cells are insulin-resistant, and it only makes sense that if a person is carrying too many fat cells, that person is going to be more insulin-resistant than the person whose weight is normal. Most type 2 diabetics can control their diabetes by losing weight, exercising, and watching their diets. In addition, many type 2 diabetics take oral medications that help the body to use their own insulin more efficiently.In the case of type 1 diabetes, the cause is very different, but the result is identical. The person with type 1 diabetes has an autoimmune problem that causes his or her immune system to attack his own pancreas' insulin-producing cells and kill them off. So the type 1 diabetic produces little or no insulin at all, so he must take insulin by injection in order to survive.Some people who are truly type 2 diabetics end up taking insulin by injection because the oral medications do not help them enough to achieve normal glucose levels. Those people do not have the autoimmune system problem that is present in the type 1 diabetic, but still take insulin.",
