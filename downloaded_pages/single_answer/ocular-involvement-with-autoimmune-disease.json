It can even be a benign finding.Get on the phone and get advice from your team.JCH MD",

    "question": "20 yrs ago I had a visual disturbance went to PCP who sent me to ophthalmologist. Ophthalmologist did a lot of testing in his office, said that I had \"Cotton balls\" on my retina.\u00a0\u00a0I was started on antimalarials and steroid eye drops.I lost confidence in the doctor when he told me that he was 99% sure that I was HIV+ with no lab tests having been done.I am a nurse, which is what he classified as a high risk group. I thought the guy was a quack. I had received a week on the meds that he had prescribed and then went to another ophthalmologist and did not tell him about the other doc. After testing he said he saw nothing \"except a congenital pit on my retina\". My HIV tests for the next 20 years have been negative. I didn''t think I had any further problems until 13 years later when I was diagnosed with RA and Sjogren's (since, learned Cotton balls were the sign of autoimmune disease). Now 7 yrs into RA, I have had several bouts of vasculitis, mostly peripheral, but lots of visual problems. Now, 3 day history of pain with lateral and up and down eye movement, grating headache in my temples and across my brow.\u00a0\u00a0Vague h/a back of my head could be tension because I am tighter than a drum.\u00a0\u00a0I have increased my dose of prednisone to 80 mg in hopes of decreasing the inflammation. Went to ER as advised by rheumy, there for 5 hours; CT brain, blood drawn, never got results.Ambulances pouring in the back there was no hope I would be seen tonight.\u00a0\u00a0Came bacck home.\u00a0\u00a0They cautioned me that this is very dangerous but they didn't tell me any danger signs to watch for.\u00a0\u00a0I would see no ophthalmologist until Monday either way. Wondering if there is anything that I need to be\u00a0\u00a0on the look out for, or is it just as I figure, that I'm pretty much doomed to lose the vision?",
