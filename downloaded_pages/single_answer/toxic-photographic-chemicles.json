    "question": "I spent 20 yrs in the Air Force as a Still Photographic Labratory Technician. During my 20 yrs I spent 3 yrs overseas (England). I processed film, mixed black and white, and color chemicles (process E3, E4, E6 chemicles) I did all of this in a 10x8 room with no ventilation. Bio/Envir came in and stated there was no ventilation or breathing equipment, and the chemicls were toxic. I repeatedly complained of eye, nose, throat irritation, chest pains, and skin irritation. Could this be a leading cause if not a direct cause for my sleep apnea which was disovered years later. I have also later developed type II diabetes.",
