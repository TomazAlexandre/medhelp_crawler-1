            "answer": "Hi Joe.Answers to your questions:(i)\tyes(ii)\tyes(iii)\tmaybe(iv)\tmaybeNow to get serious: You ask about \u201cnormal.\u201d Remember that everyone is different, and there\u2019s no such thing as \"normal\" when it comes to sex, because it\u2019s an entirely subjective concept and varies from person to person. I think what you\u2019re asking me is whether there\u2019s something \u201cwrong\u201d with you--and, of course, the answer is no.Welcome to your 40\u2019s! When you're younger and just beginning to be sexual with others, erections pop up everywhere--including when you don't want them! Post-pubescent men are highly excitable. As you age, you\u2019ll find that you need more direct touch and stimulation. This is just part of life and doesn\u2019t indicate any underlying condition to worry about.Also as part of the aging process, you'll find that erections sometimes take longer, and even come and go. Again, this is not an indication if ill health, but just part of life. Sexual interest ebbs and flows as well, depending on other circumstances in your life. And you hit the nail right on the head: without a partner, you may be getting slightly bored with your usual fantasies. In addition, both hypertension and diabetes can affect blood flow to your penis, resulting in less firm or frequent erections. Also realize the more stress you\u2019re under, the less energy your body has to respond sexually, so stop worrying!Worrying about erections is a dead-end street. All it will do is make you anxious, which will make your penis very uncooperative. And remember you don't need an erection to be sexual, have fun, experience pleasure, etc. Relax, enjoy your own unique sexuality and stop judging yourself. And find partners who aren\u2019t hung up on outdated macho ideas of what constitutes \u201cgood\u201d sex. Many women are more interested in a caring, sensitive partner than one with a \u201cporn star\u201d penis. For more information about this and other men\u2019s issues, I recommend the book, \u201cThe New Male Sexuality,\u201d by Bernie Zilbergeld, Ph.D., widely available both used and in paperback. The information in this book has helped millions of men overcome discomfort and anxiety about sex. Good luck to you. Dr. J",

    "question": "I'm in my 40s. I haven't been sexually active for years but masturbate regularly. Of late, I notice that my erection is shorter than it used to be and more flaccid than it used to be. I have no problem getting an erection when I get a lap dance at a strip club but going there is quite rare. I am taking pills for diabetes and hypertension.Is my erection not as it used to be because:(i) I'm getting older(ii) My imagination is not as vivid as it used to be and I need an actual partner(iii) The drugs I'm taking(iv) My medical conditionsAlso, I have noticed that my libido waxes and wanes - is that normal?",
