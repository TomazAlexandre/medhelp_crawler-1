            "answer": "It is hard to know without more information the cause of your symptoms. Since your FSH and TSH levels are low, it does not seem you are in perimenopause or that your symptoms are due to a thyroid problem.You could ask your doctor to check and see if you have diabetes or low blood sugar which also causes mood swings, irritability, and poor sleep. Also, stress, other medications or increased androgen levels (testosterone, DHEA-S) and increased prolactin levels could lead to some of your problems.\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally, a tubal will affect cycles because in cutting the tube, the blood vessels also get cut and affect hormone production from the ovaries.It also makes sense to repeat the FSH. The most likely reason is perimenopause unless there is a significant stress in your life adding to the situation or possibly a substantial weight loss.Machelle M. Seibel, MD",
