            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Diabetes patients suffer from a common complication after a period of 10-15yrs like diabetic peripheral neuropathy, renal failure and insulin dependence etc.The kind of pain you mentioned burning type is usually caused by damage to the nerves. So it is important to check if there is any nerve compression or not. If there is no nerve compression then it could be due to uncontrolled diabetes over a period of time.Get an MRI of spine and visit a neurologist for further assistance.Take care.",

In July 07 I had a nasty fall that i am trying to recover from. Now I have shooting burning pain from my lower back through my legs to my feet and ankles, but only since the fall.
