            "answer": "My personal advice to patients with your combination of problems----do not have multifocal IOLs put in their eyes. Just read all the problems with multifocal IOLs here, for diabetics problems occur in Spades.Also know that cataract surgery even successful surgery increases the risk of your diabetic retinopathy progressing. So don't have surgery until its a BIG problem. After cataract surgery have your retina ophthalmologist check you for increase retinopathy at least every six months for several years.JCH III MD",
