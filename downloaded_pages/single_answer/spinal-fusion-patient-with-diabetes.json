    "question": "I had a left lumbar laminectomy, foraminotomy,diskectomy, and nerveroot decompression, at left l5-s1 in mar 1994. I have contined to havesevere low back pain and left leg pain.\u00a0\u00a0The MRI shows degenerativedisc disease at that location.\u00a0\u00a0Have had numerous injections, therapy,with no success. Now using a back brace. My neurosurgeon said if thebrace helps considerbly, then he propably would do a spinal fusion.The brace helped reduce the pain, but you can't wear it all the time.One of my problems is that I have a right leg fusion(doesn't bend) andthe limp puts tremendous stress on the back. Would you give me youropinion and explain about a spinal fusion.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I am a insulin dependentdiabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Would this be a big problem concerning infection and healingafter the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is unbearable, and medications are no longerworking.\u00a0\u00a0I'm leaning toward the fusion.Thank you for your comments and help..______________________________________Dear Chuck,A small percentage of patients will continue to have problems after a lumbar discectomy.\u00a0\u00a0Among these problems a patient may develop instability of the vertebrae at that level from removal of the disc.\u00a0\u00a0This may cause chronic pain and disability.\u00a0\u00a0Some of these patients with instability will benefit from a fusion.\u00a0\u00a0Some will not.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to identify those patients who will not improve after a fusion.A fusion in your case would carry an increased risk of complications due to your history of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The risk would be to infection and not developing a solid fusion after surgery.\u00a0\u00a0This risk is not astronomically higher than a patient without diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It is a little higher and not to the degree that should prevent a surgeon from recommending surgery.Speak to your surgeon about the risks and benefits of surgery and the odds of improvement in your situation to get a clear understanding of his goals with regard to your care.Good luck.",
