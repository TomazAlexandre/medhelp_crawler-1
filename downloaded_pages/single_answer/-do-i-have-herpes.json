    "question": "[Im 31 and a Type 2 Diabetic (2 yrs.). I take Insulin and Metformin daily. My diabetes are uncontrollable and this year Ive had recurring yeast infections everyday. I scratch a lot & it got to the point of me shaving constantly to relieve my itch. It became a horrible habit. I never had a menstrual cycle in my entire life either if that helps. ]Last night, I had sex with my on and off boyfriend. Last time we had intercourse was a few weeks ago. Early this morning I developed a pimple on the inner left lip of my vagina. If touched, I experience a sharp pain on it. Later on today, that pimple morphed into a cluster. On camera it looks yellowish on the cluster.\u00a0\u00a0Its itchy and it hurts to wipe my vagina after using the bathroom. I went to the doctor immediately! However, although they stated it doesnt look like herpes, I still got tested and waiting for results. Im just afraid thats all.",
