            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are in menopausal age group then get complete hormone profile. It can even be due to PCOD. Malabsorption syndromes, IBS, Vit B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism, diabetes etc could also be the cause. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!",
