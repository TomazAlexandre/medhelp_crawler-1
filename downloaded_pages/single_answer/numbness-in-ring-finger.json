            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (cardiac or due to compression of blood vessels-Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon), nerve pinched (esp. cervical) or neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol/smoking (if you do) or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",
