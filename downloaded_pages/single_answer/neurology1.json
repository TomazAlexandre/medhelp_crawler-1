            "answer": "Hi there. The common categories of skin rash are ones caused by infection and the ones causes without infection. Non infectious could be atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, pityriasis and psoriasis. The infectious causes are fungal rash, eczema, ringworm or bacterial infection like impetigo. Consult a dermatologist first to rule out these. You will need to be checked for diabetes since there is an associated burning sensation also. I hope that this helps. Take care.",
