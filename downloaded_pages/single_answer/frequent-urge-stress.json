            "answer": "Try meditation. Really helps clear your mind. It doesn't have to be too elaborate; breathe in deeply through your nose and hold it for a few seconds (I like to count my heartbeat until it slows down) and then release through your mouth. Do that a couple of times and I bet you'll feel less stressed =)I think if you are having urge issues, you should check up with your doctor to make sure there isn't any damage to your bladder from the infection. *STDs can cause all sorts of damage. Rule out that this isn't a physiological aftereffect. However, even if it is an aftereffect, meditation should still be a great help.",

    "question": "Last March I was diagnosed with Chlamydia and with the infection I was given the gift of frequent urge / urination. I was miserable as it was the 1st time in my life I have ever went through that phase. So 3 weeks after my treatment I took a urine test to make sure everything was gone and I was negative of Chlamydia,\u00a0\u00a0UTI & Diabetes. The week after I made a diary of my urine times and after the 3rd day I stopped and it went away. For the past 3 days im starting to feel the urge again and im wondering if its stress because whenever I have my mind on something else (School,\u00a0\u00a0Friends,\u00a0\u00a0Basketball ) I never sense the urge. Just yesterday when I played Monopoly with my friends I never felt a urge during the 4 hour game. If this is stress is there any tips for me to relax my mind?",
