    "question": "Hi,I have been experiencing some very severe symptoms the last 5 months and I think it might be thyroid related.\u00a0\u00a0There are several people my family with thyroid problems including immediate.\u00a0\u00a0The most debilitating symptoms I am experiencing are tingling, burning, numbness all my arms and legs.\u00a0\u00a0Also my metabolism seems to be very out of balance as I cannot go more than 2-3 hours without eating carbohydrates or the symptoms get worse.\u00a0\u00a0I had my TSH done and it was 2.73 but they did not check T3 and T4.\u00a0\u00a0I had diabetes tests done as well and they all came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0I did for quite a while crash diet and use stimulants to lose weight so I am not sure if something/s got knocked way out of balance.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any help or suggestions.",
