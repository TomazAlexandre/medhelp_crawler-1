            "answer": "Hi Bipin,While I cannot make a diagnosis or prescribe medications without knowing more about you and examining you, I can tell you a bit about dry tongues and why that may be occurring.Dry tongues are most commonly due to dehydration. It can also be caused by a medication side effect, smoking, stress or anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Less commonly it can be due to diabetes or an autoimmune disorder.When the tongue is dry, it can become white from the build up of bacteria. People can also get a fungal infection on their tongue, which can show up as red or white lesions. This would need to be treated with anti-fungal medication.From what you have said about your symptoms coming and going with stress and workload, I think your case is more likely related to a combination of dehydration, stress, and anxiety, and the resulting buildup of bacteria. I recommend staying hydrated, eating well, and brushing your tongue (with a tongue-brusher or simply the back of a spoon). If it gets worse or is painful, I recommend seeing a physician.",
