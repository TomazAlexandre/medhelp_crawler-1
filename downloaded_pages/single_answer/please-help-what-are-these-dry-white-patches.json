            "answer": "Hi,Are your thyroid function tests in the normal range? When did you last get them done?There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.Fungal infections are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "I have these white rough skin patches on my arms. They appeared out of no where, and now seem to be spreading. My dermatologist recommended I use an alpha hydroxy lotion, but it's been over 3 months and I haven't seen any improvement.They are circular-oval shaped, rough to the touch, but don't itch or hurt.Exfoliation hasn't helped.Here are some pictures...in person they are much more noticeable, and you can definitely see the difference in skin tone.",
