    "question": "I am a 39year old female in surgical menopause since Jan.2006 (hysterectomy/ovary removal due to recurring ovarian dermoids/endometriosis). I take Zocor- cholesterol control, Ambien -for insomnia since the surgery; Flonase-for sinusitis. My symptoms, which the doctors have not been able to figure out yet: decreased sensation in face, left leg & arm; neck tightening; neck pulsations; vibration/pounding in my head; buzzing in my groin/pelvic area; low blood pressure 86/60 (it usually runs 100/70). When the blood pressure gets too low, I feel the blood running through the veins in my legs, and abdomen, especially the neck/head. I've been tested for diabetes-only abnormality is very mild insulin resistance, for which I take Metformin (500 mg. w/ breakfast; 250mg. with lunch). Blood sugar tests have been in the low to mid 90's, with the exception of one that reached 101. I was tested for Lyme, Sjogren's, B12 deficiency, CBC's - all normal. Echocardiogram- normal. EKG- nonspecific T-wave abnormality. Stress test- normal. CRP and ANA are normal. Neck/leg dopplers are normal. I was taking Diltiazem for PVC's, but Dr. took me off due to the low blood pressure. I've lost 40 pounds over the past 14 months (mostly intentional). I get light headed. I'm usually able to walk 2-3 miles with no issue, but recently started getting light-headed/feeling & the pulsing in my neck.\u00a0\u00a0It's affecting the quality of my life, especially in dealing with my husband and 3 year old.\u00a0\u00a0The medical testing goes on with no solution yet.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any suggestions or ideas what could be happening to me?",
