            "answer": "my suggestion is that you have very poor circulation in your arms and hands. you may notice that it is worse when sleeping because the way your body is positioned can decrease the flow of blood to your extremities. also your heart rate lowers when you sleep which can contribute to the poor circulation. i would see a doctor to have blood work done and an ekc to make sure the blood is flowing properly to everywhere in your body",

    "question": "Durning the night I will wake up with my arms numb all the way up to my shoulders. It hurts very badly. I will try holding them over the bed for blood to reach them and that hardly ever works. It reminds me of how my legs felt after my epidural with my pregnancy, excect with acute pain throughout. The next day my fingers tingle all day long and sometimes I have trouble holding a glass or opening a door. It is even hard for me to type this. My paternal Father died from diabetes, and my mother's father had diabetes also. My father took three shots a day and my grandfather took one shot a day. Ive been tested with the five hour sugar test about ten years ago and was told I was hypoglocemic. Extremly low blood sugar and was told to eat six or seven small meals a day, but that was ten years ago. I know that it is very painful and my hands are so swollen the next day I wouldnt even try to but on a ring. I was a bank teller for about ten years and counted money all the time and worked on the computer, but that was about five years ago so I just dont think its carpel tunnel syndrome. Can you give me any suggestions on what this could be or what might be or what might cause this?",
