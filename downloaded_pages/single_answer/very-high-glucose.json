    "question": "Hi all. I had my one hour glucose test this morning. I failed horribly...the test said 203. They bypassed the 3 hour test and sent out a referral to see a diabetes specialist. Has anyone had this happen to them and then check out just fine when they get to the specialist? Until today my labs have been fine for glucose levels. I am going to monitor my diet this week and eat more small and frequent meals. I have a feeling the bowl of ice cream I had last night played a part in my sugar levels today. Anyway, any feedback on your experience would be great.",
