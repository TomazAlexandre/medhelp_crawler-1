    "question": "I was diagnosed with pre-type 1 diabetes in 2005.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 27 year old female and am a little nervous about the progression of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting bg is normal and my highs are usually under 200.\u00a0\u00a0But, each time I go to the doctor I have high levels of glucose in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0I have been experiencing a lot of highs (for me its about 170 after meals) and lows (50-60 range) recently and was wondering if I was in the \"honeymoon\" phase and would soon be going on injectable or oral insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Could my threshold for highs be lower than the \"normal\" range.\u00a0\u00a0I'm only 5 foot and around 100lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Does any of that even play into my highs/lows?\u00a0\u00a0Any insight and advice would be greatly appreciated!",
