            "answer": "Hi there,Clomid is the first line treatment usually prescribed for irregular periods and regularizing ovulation in PCOD. There is no statistical figure regarding how many women will conceive on Clomid. Clomid is commonly prescribed for induction of ovulation. For clomid to succeed it has to be taken for at least three to four months. Metformin is a diabetes medicine used for lowering insulin and blood sugar levels in women with PCOD. This helps regulate menstrual cycles, start ovulation, and lower the risk of miscarriage in women with PCOS. I will advise you to consult your doctor before decreasing the dose or discontinuing it. Do keep me posted.Best regards!",

    "question": "I wanted to know it anyone knew if you continued to ovulate after you have stoped taking metformin. I have been taking it, and clomid for seven months. Then I stopped taking it about two months ago. I just started back taking it today. If felt like it was my first time taking it. All the side effects started coming back. So instead of taking two pills I will start off with only one a day.",
