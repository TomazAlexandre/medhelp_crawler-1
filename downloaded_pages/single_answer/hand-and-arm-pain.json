            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.I think your boyfriend should speak with his doctor about his symptoms. Blood tests could show the cause of his discomfort. Additionally, he needs to keep his blood sugar stable to prevent those peaks and valleys. This will help prevent the side effects of diabetes such as kidney damage, eye damage, nerve damage...I hope this helpsCathy",

    "question": "Hi. My boyfriend is a 44 year old juvenile onset diabetes patient who has glucose highs and lows. He has been experiencing swelling in his hands as well pain in both his arms and hands quit often lately. He thinks that this is associated with his salt and/or dairy intake. I am wondering if it has something to do with his kidneys. What do you think.",
