            "answer": "When you went to the hospital I think they would have given you an IV in order to hydrate your body.\u00a0\u00a0I would visit my doctor if I were you and explain the symptoms you are having.\u00a0\u00a0I think once the DKA was properly taken care of then you would have to make sure that your blood sugar levels do not go that high anymore.Memory loss and weakness seem more like signs that you have had low blood sugars or hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Severe vertigo is not a symptom of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you have been diagnosed with Vertigo I would imagine that it would affect your diabetes, but I am not sure if it would cause low blood sugars or high blood sugars.I would find out what kind of pills they gave you, because nurses and doctors are very cautious when administering medication to a diabetic knowing that different medications can cause lows or highs.I do think visiting your endocrinologist and asking these questions would be the most help to you.",
