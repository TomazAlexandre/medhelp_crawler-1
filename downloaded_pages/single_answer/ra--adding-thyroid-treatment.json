    "question": "I have had RA since 1972 and it is fairly well controlled. Some hand and foot deformity and a new knee. Recently a Dr. said I needed to start on thyroxine. The very next day my right index finger went numb, followed by others over next week or so.\u00a0\u00a0Lately (after ca 3 mos) my lower arms ache at night and also seems like skin is numb and my fingers feel slightly swollen. About the same time I started the meds I noticed a red eye ball. The eye Dr. told me it meant active RA happening.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone else experienced these symptoms after starting thyroxine?\u00a0\u00a0Can it make RA worse, or even perhaps trigger diabetes which the DR. wants to test for soon?",
