            "answer": "Hi there,Women with PCOS may find it difficult to get pregnant. But it is still not impossible. Women with PCOs have higher chances of acquiring diabetes, hypertension, eclampsia and the incidence of preterm birth and low birth weight is common. Fertility problems experienced by women with PCOS are usually related to the elevated hormone, insulin, or glucose levels. These all interfere with implantation as well as development of the embryo. Ovulation inducing drugs like Clomid are used in such women. Treatment of other associated endocrine abnormalities is also very important. Exercise and weight reduction is also helpful. In case all these do not work assisted methods of reproduction like IVF may be tried. I sincerely hope it helps.Take care and kind regards!",
