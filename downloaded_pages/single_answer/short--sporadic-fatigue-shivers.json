            "answer": "Hi!This looks like an episode of transient ischemic attack wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. Again this can be due to low oxygen supply to brain where the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off generally due to a spasm of the arteries, or a clot or high blood pressure causing micro leaks in the brain.The symptoms include temporary loss of sensation in any part of the body, black outs, vision loss, tingling, loss of function of a limb etc. It is common in people with high blood pressure, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and high cholesterol. Hence all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc.Generally this can happen several times before an actual stroke happens. This is a warning sign for the body. If you have such episodes, then you must get them evaluated immediately.To diagnose this you need a prompt evaluation (within 60 minutes) to identify the cause and determine appropriate therapy. CAT Scans done later or when you are fine will not reveal anything.Otherwise it could be due to nerve compression very high up in the cervical vertebra. Please consult a neurologist. You may need to undergo MRI of the brain or cervical spine.Another possibility is Vitamin B12 deficiency. Underactive thyroid and diabetes too should be ruled out. Sometimes migraine too presents with these kind of unrelated symptoms. Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon and seizures too should be looked into. MS is another possibility. Abnormal levels of sodium, potassium or calcium too can behave this way.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "I was in architecture school, so I used to not sleep a lot, for long periods of time. Last year there came a point when I would feel these (this is the best I can describe it) short waves of sudden fatigue, that last for like a half second, like a tremor, and I would feel it while I was walking. They weren't severe enough to make my knees buckle and send me to the ground, but just on the verge of doing so. And, like I said, they were very short and happened every 20 seconds or so only when I was moving significantly (like walking or running). I assumed before that it was because I severely lacked sleep and just needed rest. They went away after I started sleeping better. Except now, I am working, at home, and I've started getting them again. I am getting regular sleep and exercise, eating normally, etc. I am totally confused as to why they started again, but it's starting to scare me. Does anyone know what this could be?P.S. I have an ongoing history with depression, specifically chronic depression (dysthymia) but am not on medicationThanks all",
