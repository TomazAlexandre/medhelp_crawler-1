            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Burning/tingling/numbness/pain in hands and legs can be due to compression of spinal nerves in the neck/lower back or due to peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s or lupus. Rheumatoid arthritis of the joint, carpal tunnel syndrome, anxiety stress, chemical dermatitis, vitamin B12 or D deficiency etc are the other causes. Treating the cause will help relieve the symptoms. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
