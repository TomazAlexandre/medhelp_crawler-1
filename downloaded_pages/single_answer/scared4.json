            "answer": "Hi! It all depends on the nature of problem. Most common cause of vision loss/poor vision is corneal abrasion and sclera injury, and occurs due to supine position of patient during surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes include cortical blindness; central retinal artery occlusion, and some non-specific causes. All these are treatable causes. Another major cause is Ischemic optic neuropathy, both anterior and posterior type. This usually happens due to poor circulation to nerve. Patients with diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, herpes zoster, anemia, sickle cell trait, syphilis, Behcet\u2019s, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and polyarteritis nodosa are more at risk. Usually happens due to fall in blood pressure during surgery. Some patients recover and have better vision after weeks/months, while others progress to further vision loss.Please discuss the best treatment option with your eye specialist. Also a diagnosis is important. Take care!",
