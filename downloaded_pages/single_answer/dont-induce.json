            "answer": "I agree! My sister was induced because her baby was measuring big and her body didn't take the meds good so she had a c-section. All that after 15 hours in labor and the baby not moving down. It was frustrating. I will say I was induced for medical reasons, I couldn't get my blood pressure under control and I delivered really fast and it was easy. I don't think I would want to be induced again though as it was very painful.",

    "question": "Induction For Gestational Diabetes Even where there is a medical condition involved, for example, gestational diabetes, it is worth studying and asking your obstetrician and / or midwife to see if induction is going to offer more risks than benefits. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has published a study, which you can read here (which you might wish to print and show your Obstetrician), which concludes: Based on data from observational studies, labour induction for suspected fetal macrosomia (large baby) results in an increased caesarean delivery rate without improving perinatal outcomes. They state: \u201cSummary statistics for the nine observational studies showed that, compared with those whose labor was induced, women who experienced spontaneous onset of labour had a lower incidence of cesarean delivery and higher rates of spontaneous vaginal delivery. No differences were noted in rates of operative vaginal deliveries, incidence of shoulder dystocia, or abnormal Apgar scores in the analyses of the observational or randomised studies.\u201d Apart from this, not many Gestational Diabetes babies or other babies believed to be \u2018huge\u2019 finish being born abnormally \u2018huge\u2019. I have heard more stories of these babies being born early through recommended inductions only to arrive tiny, of average size or to have breathing problems because of unexpected pre-maturity. One Midwife recalls a birth in early 2006: \u201cOveruse of inductions is a real concern to me. So many women coming in for induction and the reasons seem so vague sometimes. I was involved in a birth a few weeks ago where the woman was induced because of previous macrosomic (big for dates) baby. She had gestational diabetes with that pregnancy and previous shoulder dystocia (first baby, this was her 3rd). We attempted induction at 36 weeks and it failed. Induction was again attempted at 37 weeks, which was successful \u201d baby was only 2750 g \u201d hardly macrosomic! The ultrasound had estimated a baby weighing 3500 g so it wasn\u2019t even close. I think if she had that baby at the first induction attempt at 36 weeks it would have had to go into Special Care as it would have been less than 2500 g, which is our cut-off. Frightening.\u201d This is a brilliant article on Gestational Diabetes by Henci Goer, an academic who wrote The Thinking Woman\u2019s Guide to a Better Birth and Obstetric Myths vs Research Realities, both of which are excellent books. Induction For Large Baby or Small Pelvis If you are told your \u2018huge\u2019 baby won\u2019t fit through your \u2018small\u2019 pelvis, well, this is an old-wives tale that was circulating even before our mothers birthed, but controversy began when these women started birthing subsequent babies at home \u201d with no troubles whatsoever! Trying to find how big your pelvis is and if it is capable of birthing your baby is something that no scan or X-ray can detect during the pregnancy, because lying on a bed and being flat on your back is not the ideal position for being able to open your pelvis. By squatting, it opens your pelvis and gives you up to 30% more pelvic capacity (Janet Balaskas talks about this in her excellent book, New Active Birth), which is not the way these testing procedures are done. It\u2019s also impossible for them to see the effect of Relaxin in your body, as it works its magic in labour. Relaxin is a hormone, which helps soften your joints and makes you more flexible and open for the birth \u201d your pelvis does what it needs to get your baby born \u201d trust mother nature! For more information on this topic, you can also read our article Small Pelvis, Big Baby \u2013 The Truth About CPD. Induction For Being \u2018Past Your Due Date\u2019 You are most likely to be offered an induction if you are post-date, remembering that a full-term pregnancy is defined as 37 to 42 weeks. The estimated due date you are given is only a \u2018guess\u2019 in the middle of that. Contrary to belief, your baby (and the placenta) don\u2019t automatically expire like a use by date when they hit that magic \u2018guess date\u2019. Many women and men (understandably) become fearful of the risk of stillbirth if they go \u2018too far over\u2019 the baby\u2019s estimated due date. However, in the study \u2018prospective risk of unexplained stillbirth in singleton pregnancies at term\u2019, published by the British Medical Journal, they actually found that inducing babies earlier increased risk. Its helpful to bear in mind that the risks are generally low, but according to this study, your baby has less chance of stillbirth at 42 weeks of pregnancy than 38 weeks of pregnancy. 35 weeks is 1:500 36 weeks is 1:556 37 weeks is 1:645 38 weeks is 1:730 39 weeks is 1:840 40 weeks is 1:926 41 weeks is 1:826 42 weeks is 1:769 43 weeks is 1:633 They commented: \u201cInterestingly, at 38 weeks the risks of stillbirth near term exceed those at 42 weeks, when delivery is usually recommended. Delivering women routinely at 38 weeks would lead to a high incidence of caesarean section with its attendant risks, either primarily or from failed induction, in addition to a small risk of iatrogenic neonatal respiratory morbidity.\u201d -See more at: bellybelly ******* dot au /birth/induction-of-labour-to-induce-or-not-induce",
