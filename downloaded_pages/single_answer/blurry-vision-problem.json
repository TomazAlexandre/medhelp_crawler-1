            "answer": "The disparity between new contact lens rx and old glasses rx could be causing some of the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Also - it is common to have some visual complaints after switching from contacts to glasses, anyway.\u00a0\u00a0You could have eye strain from prolonged computer work, especially with contacts - but with a lower power contact, I would think near work would be more clear.\u00a0\u00a0If you are around age 40 or older, then age is playing a significant role as presbyopia starts to kick in.\u00a0\u00a0Dry eye syndrome could be an issue, as well as medicatiion side effects.\u00a0\u00a0Consider all these things - but the glasses/contact disparity would me my first thought.Michael Kutryb, MD",

    "question": "I went for my annual eye exam about 4 months ago -- everything was great, even to the point that both my eyes had improved quite a bit.\u00a0\u00a0I went from 4.75 in my right and 4.50 in my left to both being 4.25 now.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that I had no sign of any eye problems or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0However, I did have astigmatism in both eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I ordered my new pair of contacts and everything was fine.\u00a0\u00a0However, now (4 months later) I all of a sudden, I am experiencing blurry vision.\u00a0\u00a0I only notice this when I try to read (especially in front of the computer or when trying to take notes in class) - its to the point where I have to actually squint to see my computer screen clearly.\u00a0\u00a0I've been tested (3 months ago) for diabetes and bloodwork came back clear.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what this has to do with.\u00a0\u00a0I've come up with 2 things that it might have to do with...1) the astigmatism or 2) Since my eyes improved and I ordered new contacts, I still had my old glasses and did not order new glasses because I only wear glasses rarely.\u00a0\u00a0However, my glasses prescription was my old one (stronger prescription) and my contacts are my new prescription.\u00a0\u00a0I wear my new contacts during the day and in the evenings sometimes I put my glasses on - could this have messed my eyes up since the glasses and contacts had different prescriptions?So those are the only two things that I could come up with.\u00a0\u00a0Or can there be something seriously wrong?\u00a0\u00a0I have made an eye appointment, but I want to get some more insight incase this doctor is not looking at all possibilities.Thanks.",
