            "answer": "High iron content can cause this, as well as vitamin B. Urinary tract infection and kidney infections can also cause this.Yes, it's true.Vitamins can cause this problem. Your body safeguards itself by expelling unused portions of vitamins in your body.I am 7 months pregnant and use vitamin B to help ease the nausea.It works,but within an hour or so I have the smelliest urine and it is very dark.Another culprit is diabetes/hypoglycemia...ask your doctor to test you for this.",

    "question": "For the past week I've had vaginal discharge with a bad odor. Did all possible STD testing and came out negative. Now I noticed orange solid spots in my urine (my urine looks fine just the spots in it). I read somewhere the multivitamins could be the cause of this but can it really? What could it be? What other tests should I be doing?",
