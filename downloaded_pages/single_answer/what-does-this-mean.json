    "question": "NUCLEAR MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION IMAGING STUDY, 2 DAY STUDY:INDICATION:\u00a0\u00a0Chest discomfort. History of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia.The patient was injected with 0.4 mg of IV Regadenoson and did 4 minutes of handgrip exercise and injected at peak stress with 39.9 mCi Tc sestamibi with stress images done 50 minutes later. The patient then returned the next day and injected at rest with 21.3 mCi Tc sestamibi with rest images done 50 minutes later.FINDINGS:SPECT images post stress reveal there is a large area of moderately reduced count seen of the anterior wall and anterolateral wall. This extends from the base to the apex and this area is reversible on rest imaging. There is also a large area of moderately reduced count seen of the inferior wall extending from the base to apex and this is fixed and does not change on rest imaging. There is abnormal wall movement and thickening seen in the inferior wall. The LV is normal in size. Given the patient's body surface area, systolic is function with an EF of 59%.IMPRESSION:Abnormal nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging study with evidence of LAD distribution ischemia and RCA distribution infarction. Normal LV size. Normal systolic function. EF normal, 59%.",
