    "question": "Hi. I am a 38 year old male in relatively good health, or at least I thought. I am 5'6 and weigh 178 lbs. My question is, has anyone heard of metabolic syndrome? I recently visited with my doctor to follow up on blood test results which showed my HDL at 30 and my triglycerides at 223. My liver enzymes (ALT) were also high at 61, while my fasting glucose level was on the higher end of normal at 92. All that being said, I mentioned to my doctor that within the last few months I've noticed that I've lost fat from my arms, legs, and hip areas but not from belly. My pants fit looser\u00a0\u00a0around my thighs, and shirts fit looser around my biceps. I told him that while this has been going on, I have not been really dieting and exercising, so I was kind of stumped. He then said it seems that I may have metabolic syndrome, which he then said is basically a precursor to developing diabetes. He also said that I may also be developing insulin resistance based on the body composition changes I've been experiencing. He told me that I need to get my weight down to around 160 lbs., so he suggested to start dieting and exercising. My question is, based on my my above mentioned numbers, does the likelihood of metabolic syndrome seem plausible? If so what else is there to know about metabolic syndrome? Can it be reversed, or will it inevitably lead to diabetes? Also am I\u00a0\u00a0at risk for any other complications? I do have a family history of heart disease (father), so this has me concerned to say the least. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.Andy",
