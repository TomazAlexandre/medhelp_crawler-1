            "answer": "Without reviewing the scans I cannot tell you what the white spots mean. Small white spots can be seen in disorders such as migraine, diabetes, hypertension, and MS or other demyelinating diseases. The sensory spells you were describing could have been related to migraines or seizures. If the spinal fluid suggests MS, I would recommend having a second opinion. If your MRI reveals changes consistent with MS, your spinal fluid supports this, and your history is suggestive you could take two approaches. You could elect to start treatment at this time, or wait 6 months and repeat the MRI and clinical examination to look for signs of disease activity. A consultation at the Mellen Center for MS at the Cleveland Clinic FOundation would be a good start. Good luck",

    "question": "Starting about 4 years ago, I started to get Migrane headaches, along with auras.\u00a0\u00a0These lasted up until one year ago, I had a black out while I was driving and was put on tegratol for seizures and have had no problems since, up until about a month ago I began having a sensation (not really dizziness, just a strange feeling) which was pretty much constant.\u00a0\u00a0This lasted up until about 4 days ago, it is now gone.\u00a0\u00a0I had an MRI done after the black out and it was normal also and EEG that had some abnormal activity.\u00a0\u00a0Had a second MRI done after the \"sensation\" spells and it show 6 white lesions on my brain.\u00a0\u00a0I had a spinal tap to check for MS and am waiting for the results.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to know the difference of the white spots from them being MS or being caused by migranes or even stress or the seizure activity.\u00a0\u00a0I am having no other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Is MS a real threat or is my doctor taking precautions?\u00a0\u00a0He also says if I do have MS that he would not treat me because of the lack of symptoms, but everything I've read states you should start treatment immediately. Can you tell me if this is true.\u00a0\u00a0I am definately headed to the Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Also I have a sister that is treated there for Epilepsy.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time.",
