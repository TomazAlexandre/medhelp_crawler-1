            "answer": "Hi loowho,Although I am in Australia and don't fully understand the US insurance issues. I am sure you could find the money to pay for a gynaecology/ onocolgy consultation as a one off at least. This will reassure you. The Dr will at least be able to advise you of a plan to monitor the situation. There are lots of reasons fluid could be in the abdomen. It could be from endometriosis, of fluid post ovulation. If you have a consultation, come straight to the point and ask for a tumour marker to be done - CA125. If you are reassured but your symptoms continue I am sure you can again, so you are in charge of monitoring yourself and not at the mercy of a health system .You also can get abdominal pain from the process of DKA as the body attempts to get its energy form the muscles. Hope this helps.",
