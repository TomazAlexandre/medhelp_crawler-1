    "question": "Hi, I'm a healthy 14 year old girl, healthy weight and height.I have experienced about 5 'almost' fainting spells recently - occasionally suffer from 'hot flushes' dizzy and lightheaded spells.Symptoms are as followed;.Feeling VERY warm.Tingling in legs and sometimes arms (if standing).Heart pounds REALLY fast.Blurred/ white vision.Shaky.Weak legs.Dizzy.Lightheaded.Feeling 'brain fogged'.Cold hands after spell.HOT head after spell.Feeling giddy/ dazed before&afterTimes of occurrence:1) Warm day, sitting in class2) Hot bath3)Standing for around 20 minutes (approx.) in tech class4)Standing in choir, wearing full uniform. for 30 minutes (approx)5)Sitting in\u00a0\u00a0English class, VERY warm.After first spell, visited the doctors surgery, and the doctor said that\u00a0\u00a0what I'd gone through was a 'pre syncope' episode.Visited after 3rd time, nothing done.4th time visit- Blood test & ECG scan- all results came back normal.I'm really concerned about myself, and don't want this happening to me again. It really frustrates me how the doctor can't seem to find anything wrong, as in my opinion, this happening can't be normal. I eat well, exercise regularly, am not dehydrated, and spells had not happened whilst being on period (Don't have heavy ones)So sorry for the brief and blunt description, but I really can't keep on going on like this. I don't understand why this seems to keep happening.Any suggestions for what you may think this is?Done alittle research and many say that this could actually be happening because of low blood pressure?I'm not currently stressed out on anything, but have also found out that I could be experiencing some form of panic attack?I'd honestly love to hear any sort of answer, as i'm now losing confidence, and am not wanting to go to public places because of this. What do you think is wrong with me?Thanks X",
