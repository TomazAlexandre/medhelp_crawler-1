    "question": "I am scheduled for and angiogram Friday. I am terrified. Went to an electrophysialogist for supra ventricular tachycardia. Had a stress test about 6months ago and either artifact or a problem. I am a 64 year old female with diabetes and hypertension. The electrophysialogist called my cardiologist and told him he thought I had a heart blockage rather then an electrical. He thought the blockage might be causing the electrical problems. I am terrified because I am allergic to IVP dye!!",
