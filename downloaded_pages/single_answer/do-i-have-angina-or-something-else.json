            "answer": "I'm not a doctor and can't give you a diagnosis, but this sounds like pain from your GI tract (acid reflux, etc.) You may ask your doctor if you suffer from hiatus hernia.Cardiac pain is rarely burning and almost never located below the left breast. You've done a lot of testing and no results indicate angina. I can't recommend or not recommend seeing a cardiologist, you need to think through what will reassure you that you don't suffer from a heart disease. Do you have any risk factors for heart disease (smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol/blood pressure, family history, etc.)?There are two non-invasive tests that can rule out angina with high certainty, the first (and probably the best) is an ultrasound of the carotid arteries (neck arteries). It's cheap, done in 5 minutes and can rule out plaque in your coronary arteries with the certainty of about 95% if the result is normal. Another test is a CT of the heart, a so-called calcium score. Also a cheap and fairly sensitive test, but it will expose you to a certain amount of radiation (the ultrasound will not).But you've already done a lot of tests, so maybe this will increase your cardiophobia, I don't know.Good luck :)",

    "question": "Hi Folks,For a few years now I have been having an odd squeezing / burning feeling below my left breast.\u00a0\u00a0Does not seem to radiate anywhere else.\u00a0\u00a0Seems to occur after I have eaten a meal that is extremely bad for me such as a greasy pizza or when I engage in a sudden spring or have to lift heavy objects rapidly, like a UPS worker or something.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I have run to the ER several times--Approximately twice a year and each time I am given the same battery of tests.\u00a0\u00a0Chest X-Ray, Blood Work, EKG.\u00a0\u00a0Each time I am discharged with a form that states \"The pain you are experiencing does not appear to be coming from your heart\u201d In 2010 I even had a Thallium Stress Test which also came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0Everything I read tells me that symptoms I experience are indicative if Angina.\u00a0\u00a0Should I go and see a Cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0Or does it sound like a case of Cardio phobia?\u00a0\u00a0I am a 40-year old Caucasian male.",
