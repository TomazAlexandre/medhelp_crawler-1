            "answer": "Your case is too complicated to offer a generality. My suggestion would be to get a second opinion from another ophthalmologist about what may be done to help the injured eye.REMEMBER: Your most important eye is the uninjured eye and you must do everything possible to protect it from another injury or eye disease or from systemic diseases like diabetes than can damage the eye. Live a healthy lifestyle, don't smoke or grow obese, eat a good diet, avoid activities that carry risks of eye injuries and consider wearing glasses to protect both eyes for your daily activities.\u00a0\u00a0Read the article I wrote about things you can do as you grow older to reduce the risk of age related macular degeneration.JCH MD",
