            "answer": "Hi!There could be many causes of gas in pregnancy. If you have gestational diabetes, it can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence get your blood sugar tested. It can also be due to excess consumption of food rich in sulfites like juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough. Constipation can also cause bloating. Very sedentary lifestyle is another cause. Also if you have IBS or acidity, it can get aggravated in pregnancy.Walking around will help clear some gas. Check and see if you are eating something that is causing gas. Talk to your gynecologist. Take care!",
