            "answer": "Hello first of all I would like to tell you how sorry I am for your nephew. I am not a doctor but I am educated. If this were my child I would see these three doctors: Pediatric Neurologist, Pediatric Medabolic Specialist, and a Pediatric Geneticist. The most important being number two. Medabolic conditions can cause a very extensive list of symptoms, alot of the disorders are treatable with the right care. There is one anomoly I have heard of before that may fit his symptoms and that is Lebers congenital amaurosis, you can google this and see the list of symptoms. Here is another list I wanted you to see as well. Ocular oscillations that mimic nystagmus include the following:Ocular flutterOpsoclonusOcular bobbingOcular dysmetriaSuperior oblique myokymiaSquare wave jerksVoluntary nystagmusConvergence-retraction nystagmus associated with the dorsal midbrain syndromePlease always keep looking for an answer. Bless you and your family.",

    "question": "Hi there,My 9 month old nephew was born with cataracts. Since he's been 1 month old his eyes also have severe nystagmus, jumping, rolling all over the place. He's been checked for brain tumors, eye tumors, diabetes (his father is diabetic) and currently had his adrenal hormones tested by both blood and urine. His blood normetanephrines were very elevated but the urine came back so low it wasn't even in the given range. They're doing an ultrasound to look for an adrenal tumor (pheochromocytoma) since he's also VERY active.My sister is beyond frustrated and now his eye dr. wants him to wear glasses. The eye dr. is really unhappy about how badly his eyes move and the lack of focus. She's sending him to UCLA to see a specialist. Is there anything they should be checking that hasn't been done already? It's very disturbing to see how his eyes roll all around and jump and bounce.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like a neurological issue and if so, what other tests should he have?\u00a0\u00a0Any advice would be so greatly appreciated, as I said he's only 9 months old.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance for you time. Take care.momto3girls",
