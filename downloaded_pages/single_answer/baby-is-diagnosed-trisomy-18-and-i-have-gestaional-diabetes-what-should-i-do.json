Given the complexity of the pregnancy, we recommend that you meet with a perinatologist, a physician that specializes in the care of mom and baby in high risk pregnancies.We also recommend that you meet with a genetic counselor who can answer questions about the management of Trisomy 18 and can help coordinate the specialists who will be involved in your child's care. You can find a genetic counselor at the National Society of Genetic Counselors website or through companies like mine, AccessDNA.",
