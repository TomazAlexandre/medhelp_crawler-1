            "answer": "You should be under the care of a neuroophthalmologist. yes sometimes optic nerves slowly die and a cause is not found. At other times diseases present themselves slowly over a period of years and the cause is not determined until much later.Also consider a trip to a world class tertiary eye care center such as Bascom Palmer, John Hopkins, Emory, Washington University, etc. Use the search feature to find the top rated ophthalmology programs in the USAJCH MD",

    "question": "What could be causing me to lose peripheral vision in both eyes?I have been dealing with this problem for several years now. I have confirmed loss of vision in my right eye, and after several MRIs and other tests, no cause has been found.As of a couple of weeks ago, I noticed that my left eye has a weird blind spot toward the left of my vision. I am at a loss. Am I going blind? What on earth could be causing me to lose vision in my left eye now?I have a pale optic nerve in my right eye, but when I had a routine eye exam a few months ago my left eye was normal. Now, I have a dark spot in my left eye that has never been there before. If my MRIs appear normal, and I've had every blood test in the world to rule out other diseases like diabetes and I do not have glaucoma,so what is causing my vision loss?I have migraines from time to time, and I have noticed that while they used to feel more extreme in the right side of my head they now seem to have moved to the left side, but the vision doesn't come back when my migraine goes away.Aside from my vision loss, I am perfectly healthy.Have any doctors or other people ever heard of unexplained loss of vision? Is there any way to know how if or how quickly my vision will continue to vanish?",
