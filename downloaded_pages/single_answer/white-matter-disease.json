            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for posting.According to the report there are multiple foci of white matter changes in the brain.The distribution of these changes is such that the possibility of MS should be excluded. Other causes of white matter changes like migraine, chronic headache, vasculitis or inflammation of blood vessels, diabetes, and hypertension should be excluded.It is important to correlate these changes with your current symptoms in order to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.Hope this makes the report clear to you.",
