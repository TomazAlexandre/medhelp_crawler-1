    "question": "Seven years ago, I had triple bypass surgery although I had no prior symptoms. It was the result of a stress EKG ordered because I have type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that I had no prior symptoms because of collateral circulation.\u00a0\u00a0After bypass, does this collateral circulation created naturally because of occluded arteries, disappear because CABG created other routes?\u00a0\u00a0If not, does the collateral circulation extend the viability of the grafts?And, if not, was CABG necessary? Is collateral circulation enough to sustain heart function?",
