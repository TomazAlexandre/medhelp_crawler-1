    "question": "My 91 year old mother has just been diagnosed with DCIS, grade low. We are reluctant for her to undergo either a mastectomy or breast conserving surgery due to her age and a recent CT scan showing multiple small strokes. The diagnosis was made through mammogram and biopsy. Does DCIS typically spread rapidly to become invasive cancer or is it generally slow moving?",
