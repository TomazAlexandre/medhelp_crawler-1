Science has not figured how they are created, a cure or a\u00a0\u00a0treatment. Its the immune system that creates the antibodies that attacks certain areas of the body that needs the cure. Science is just touching the tip of this area and diabetes is the first close break through.Once the trigger is identify and act upon, whether by stress reduction or medication or both, might lesson the impact of the antibodies symptoms.I am sure science will find the answer, but not in my life time or perhaps yours.",
