    "question": "A couple of months ago, I went in for a physical after several years, and my doctor said I had a hormonal imbalance.\u00a0\u00a0She checked my thyroid and my sugar levels and those came out normal. I requested a thyroid test because my family has a history of thyroid problems on one side and Type 2 diabetes on the other.\u00a0\u00a0 The only thing that was apparently not good was that my \"bad\" cholesterol was 10 points too high and my \"good\" cholesterol was 10 points to low.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor suggested that I needed to make more time for exercise and relaxation, because I have a tendency to work long hours.Up until the time I was 21, I was a little overweight (maybe 15lbs), but usually on the high end of normal.\u00a0\u00a0At that time, my periods were every 32 to 33 days.\u00a0\u00a0My body seemed to act pretty much like everyone else's.\u00a0\u00a0If I gained a little, I'd just cut out junk, and my weight would drop back down.\u00a0\u00a0About a year after this, I went through a two year period in which I had almost constant small infections, sinus, ear, UTI.\u00a0\u00a0 I did put on a little weight during this time, but with a healthy diet, I dropped back down to the high end of normal for the next few years.That said in the past 11 years, what started out as a mild annoyance has become increasingly frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0At first, my periods would be irregular during times of stress, but it started happening more often.\u00a0\u00a0As of about 4 years ago, I began to routinely go through three months of being regular and then 6 months of being 2 or 3 weeks late.\u00a0\u00a0I've also gone from a D cup to a G cup in the matter of three months.\u00a0\u00a0 I have dark hair, but it has become more pronounced on the lower half of my face and abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of retaining water a few days before my period, it is almost constant, especially in my hands and feet.\u00a0\u00a0Also, my weight has seemed to go up in spurts usually during the times in which my periods are late, and I'm now probably 75lbs. overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried exercising and eating healthy, and even on programs that are designed to have me losed between 1 to 2 lbs. at week, I'm at most able to lose half a pound.I'm not sure if I need to just take my doctor's advice to just try to exercise and relax more, or if I need to seek another opinion.",
