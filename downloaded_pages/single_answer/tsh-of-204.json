            "answer": "You should make sure that whichever doctor he sees tests free T3 and free T4 along with TSH.\u00a0\u00a0T3 and T4 are the actual thyroid hormones and give a much more complete picture of thyroid status than TSH alone.You don't mention your husband's age.\u00a0\u00a0If he is over 50 or has been hypo for more than a few months or has a history of heart arrhythmia, he should start out at a lower dose and gradually work up.\u00a0\u00a0Starting at too high a dose can cause problems that then just take more time to rectify. Starting out low gives the body time to accustom to the higher hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0Getting to the proper dose can take time, but there's no way around it.Hypothyroidism is a life-long condition.\u00a0\u00a0So, it's definitely worthwhile to find a doctor who both does adequate testing (FT3 and FT4) and works well with you.\u00a0\u00a0Some people see endos (I do), some have PCPs that actually know a lot about thyroid, some go with alternative medicine.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, finding an endo who does well with thyroid can also be difficult...many specialize in diabetes, and have little interest in thyroid.Best of luck in your search.",

    "question": "My question is my husband has been extremely fatigued and just feeling bad, he went to the doctor and his TSH was 204.\u00a0\u00a0Which is extremely high so I was wondering what would be the best thing to do.\u00a0\u00a0His family doctor only put him on 75 mcg which is of course not enough.\u00a0\u00a0I believe we need to see an endocrinologist, just wondering if anyone has any insight and has experienced the same thing and what direction we should go in?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
