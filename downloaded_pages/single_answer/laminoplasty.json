            "answer": "Hello Dear,With more than 3 disk levels, the nonfusion rate and morbidity rate are significantly higher Surgery for spinal decompressive laminectomy is a relatively safe procedure. The more common complications include wound infection, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and iatrogenic injury to neural structures. Long-term complications can include spinal instability.As expected, the anterior approach to the cervical spine carries a greater risk of complications.The rate of nonunion is significantly higher in long-term smokers and with multilevels of fusion. The risk of complications increases with greater levels of decompression and in patients with other medical conditions, such as diabetes, and long-term steroid use.I would recommend you to undergo conservative treatment .You should go in for Physical therapy such as hydrotherapy, massage, and hot/cold therapy.Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) is a treatment in which a painless electrical current is sent to specific nerves through electrode patches that are placed on the skin. The mild electrical current generates heat that serves to relieve stiffness, improve mobility, and relieve painTreatment methods should be focused on pain relief and maintaining quality of life.Although slow, usually these conservative treatments relieve pain.Surgery should be the last option as the results are not consistent and is not always successful.Refer http://www.spineuniverse.com/displayarticle.php/article180.htmlRefer http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic2889.htm#section~TreatmentBest",
