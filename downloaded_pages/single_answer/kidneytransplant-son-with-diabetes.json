    "question": "my 41 yr old son is in a nursing home after\u00a0\u00a0a two month stay in a wound care facility for mrsa infection and surgery on his spine and cocyx. He is unable to eat and is severly losing muscle mass. He is weak, cannot sleep during the night but can't wake up during the day. He is very angry at this situation and won't listen to anyone. I am wondering if I should move him to a larger city as I am worried my small town cannot cope with his diabetic situation combined with his kidney transplant and emunine deficiency problems. He also gets potassium level spikes. Will he die from this situation?",
