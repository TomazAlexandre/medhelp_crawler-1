            "answer": "Hi,UTIs can be due of inadequate fluid intake, inflammation or infection of the prostate gland, underlying disease in the kidney, infections in sexual partner, untreated STDs, underlying metabolic disorders such as diabetes, etc. The infective organisms may be located only within the prostate and/or kidney and come into the urethra during ejaculation. If they are not flushed away by urine, they would continue to be present in the urethra and try to grow there causing irritation and pain.You may need to have another urinalysis done, preferably from a sample collected just after ejaculation. A prostate fluid analysis can also be done. This is to identify the organism causing the infection and may be followed by a culture sensitivity test to determine which antibiotic the organism is sensitive to. A prostate ultrasound (done rectally) will give an idea of the state of the gland and whether it is enlarged.Antibiotic therapy is prescribed for long durations in prostate infections in view of the poor permeability of the prostate gland to antibiotics. The course will be for about 15-21 days and may even be for a few weeks.Ensure that you keep your fluid intake over 2000 ml per day and avoid irritants, such as caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. Also avoid sitting for long periods of time or on surfaces that are not well padded.If you do indulge in intercourse during the period of treatment, ensure that you practise safe sex (condoms) so as to not infect or be infected by your partner.Follow the general measures detailed above and you can avoid having any further UTIs until your urologist consultation. If you consume a lot of meat products balance that with vegetables and fruit to get adequate vitamin C which prevents cancer.Do keep us posted on your doubts and progress.",
