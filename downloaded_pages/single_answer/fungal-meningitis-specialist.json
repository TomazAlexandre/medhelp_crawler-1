            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your mother. Various reasons for recurrent or persisting fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing diabetes and low immunity. A combination of antifungals will have to be tried and her immunity boosted with diet and therapy. Along with that diabetes, HIV, liver and kidney status needs to be checked. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
