    "question": "My 4 year old son has been sick for a few days. One night or early in the morning he woke up vomiting witch he has done before, so i didn't think much about it. the next day he started getting a cold and running a fever with a bark like cough so i thought it might be the croup. So i took him to the doctor the barkey cough went away but it is still really bad. He had also told me that his lower back hurt so we informed the doctor when she examined him he told her the same thing and that it hurt when she pushed there. so they wanted to do a urine test thinking he had a kidney infection there was no bacteria in his urine at all but there was bilirubin and ketones presant. he has had urine test before twice before checking for juvinile diabetes there was protien and ketones in his urine the first time tested the second just protien. we went to a kidney specialist and she said everything is fine but also before all the urine test the first time he always complained about his tummie hurting. i'm not sure what to think, because everything that i read says that there should not be any traces of bilirubin in the urine . can u please give me any advice.",
