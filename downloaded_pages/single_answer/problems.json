            "answer": "Hi!If you were taking desmopressin then you should undergo a fluid challenge test to find out whether apart from a defect in ADH production by the pituitary, you also have a defect in kidney\u2019s response to ADH. Also, since you have been on pill/injection/spray for 34 years, missing a day\u2019s dose may at times not show obvious changes.Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
