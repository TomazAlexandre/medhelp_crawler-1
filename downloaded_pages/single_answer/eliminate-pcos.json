            "answer": "Hi there,Surgery is performed in PCOS only if other modalities like weight loss and diabetes drugs have not been successful. Your doctor has to assess each individual PCOS case on its own merits and whether surgery will be useful or not. Approximately 50% of PCOS patients who have the surgery will become pregnant. Do not hesitate to discuss your concerns with your doctor. Do write to me again on how you are doing.Take care and best luck!",
