    "question": "As you all know, testing during pregnancy can be so nerve racking.I had some early scares in this pregnancy and my doc was pretty concerned that I may have had GD, since I all of a sudden gained a lot of weight.Well, with my exercise program, I guess it helped because my test results were all normal and my weight gain has slowed a bit.\u00a0\u00a0No more tests to worry about----now just the labor--ugh!\u00a0\u00a0I begin my third trimester today and feel a difference already with being very tired.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone else feel very tired and aching hips and back at 27 weeks??",
