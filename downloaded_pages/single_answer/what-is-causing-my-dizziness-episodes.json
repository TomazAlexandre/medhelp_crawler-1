            "answer": "Hi,How are you? It is good that the initial diagnostic test results were fine. Light-headedness or dizziness occurs when the brain does not get enough blood. This may occur if there is sudden drop in blood pressure, dehydration, medication side effect, or underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, bleeding inside the body and even shock. If the symptoms persist, further evaluation may need to be done. Additional diagnostic tests may be indicated to rule out the conditions mentioned. A referral to specialists will also help. Take care and do keep us posted. Best regards.",

    "question": "for the last 8-10 years, every 3 or 4 months i get dizzy episodes, these episodes will go on for about a 3 day period (sometimes longer). on the first day i can probably only get 2 or 3 episodes, but on the second i get one every hour.I will wake up with a bad, metallic taste in the back of my mouth, and its the same one so i know 100% i'm going to be getting these episodes over the next 3 days. the taste will also remain over the 3day period.The episodes will last for about 1-2 minutes. i don't loose my balance but during the episode i cant make out what anyone is saying, i cant talk, if i try to talk i just blabber (make absolutely no sense). i can sometimes be asleep and i will get a episode and it will wake me up.over the 3 days i will barley eat, i will not have the appetite too, my face will be pale. sometimes when it gets bad all my teeth will feel weak.WHEN I FEEL BETTER is when during my sleep i sweat a whole lot, times where my shirt is very wet. and the moment i wake up the taste that has been in the back of my mouth is gone, and i feel completely fine. then my life is normal until 4 months down the track when i wake up again with that bad taste in my mouth and i know its the same old cycle.I've seen a neurologist, got tested for epilepsy, got a MRI scan, EEG scan, nothing turned up. i saw a ENT specialist, everything was fine BUT WHEN I SAW THE ENT SPECIALIST I WAS PERFECTLY FINE.any ideas? Thank you",
