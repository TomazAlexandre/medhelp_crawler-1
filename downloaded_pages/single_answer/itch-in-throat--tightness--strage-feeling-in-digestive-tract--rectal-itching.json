            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Bad taste in mouth is a common side effect of many medications. It could be due to infection of gums or cavities in teeth. It could also be an abnormal perception of bad taste called dysgeusia. GERD and heart burn, salivary glands infection, pharyngitis or strep infection, medications like antibiotics, vitamins and antidepressants, poor oral hygiene, copper or lead toxicity and Sjogren\u2019s syndrome too cause bad taste in mouth. Post nasal drip as in sinusitis too is a common cause. Certain dentures and artificial tooth or filling of dental cavities too give a metallic taste. You can try oral mouth wash, good oral hygiene and Vitamin C for this. GERD can also explain the unease you feel in your digestive tract and the itch in the throat. Uncontrolled Diabetes too should be looked into. Low electrolytes in body too cause general bodyaches.Itch and burn in rectum can be due to worms or fissures. Get your stool examined for this.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. You should see a dentist regarding this. Also your family physician can help you in this. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
