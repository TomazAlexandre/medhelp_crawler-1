            "answer": "Hi,The symptoms which you are having could be due to high blood sugar as uncontrolled diabetes is known to damage the nerves resulting in the symptoms of dizziness and burning sensation. Hence, I\u2019ll suggest you to consult an endocrinologist and ensure that your blood sugar remains in control. There are medications to take care of the pain/burning sensation but these should be taken only after consulting a physician. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
