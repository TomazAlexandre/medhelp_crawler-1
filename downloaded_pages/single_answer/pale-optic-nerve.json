            "answer": "Hi! A pale optic nerve is basically usually a pale optic disc. Normally an optic disc is orange in color. A pale disc can vary from pink to white in color. Most commonly it is seen in glaucoma and in brain tumor compressing the nerve. Optic atrophy can also cause a pale optic nerve. It can be due to poor circulation as seen in smoking (may not be in his case), diabetes, and collagen vascular diseases. Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuritis is another cause.The MRI will give a clear picture. Along with that other causes I mentioned need to be looked into.Take care!",
