            "answer": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0Welcome to MedHelp.\u00a0\u00a0Well, as far as MS goes, there are other causes for white matter lesions, that are less serious. Interesting that you also have changes in lymph nodes in both parotid glands. I remember reading online a few years ago that some brain lesions are lymphocytic infiltrations, and they are not permanent. I believe this was on a chronic fatigue info website.If your doctor thinks there's any chance of MS, you should have further testing for this asap, as the sooner you are treated, the better the outcome.Vitamin D is a prehormone, and low levels can cause a lot of symptoms. Have you had a hormone panel done anytime recently? Have you had any rheumatology testing done for autoimmune conditions?It's a good thing your PCP is staying on top of this. I would be interested to know what results you get from the vitamin D supplement.",

    "question": "I am a 40 yr old female with PMH of fibromyalgia. I have had a lot of strange neuro symptoms the last few months: numbness, tingling, memory loss, migraines, blurred vision, severe depression, personality changes, etc... Was referred to a neurologist. Neuro exam quoted as \"normal\". Labs and MRI brain and c-spine orderd. Phone call from nurse two weeks later: Vit D was very low at 8.2. Was started on 50,000u 3x week for that. Was told that can cause a lot of \"weird neuro stuff\". Was told MRI was \"fine\". No follow-up appt ordered. Follow up with primary physician. Saw PCP the next week. He ordered MRI images and reports from the hospital. He is very concerned about MRI results. Wants me to see another neurologist. Here is what the brain MRI showed: \"Small punctate foci of abnormal signal in the deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres- most likely minimal old small vessel ischemic changes. Were not present on previous study in 2001. Two small 5mm diameter rounded structures are noted in the right and left parotid glands and most likely represent small lymph nodes. These are unchanged from previous study.\" I am only 40, have no history of hypertension, diabetes, CAD, etc. What does all this mean and should I be concerned for anything like MS or something like that?? I am very worried and confused. HELP!!!",
