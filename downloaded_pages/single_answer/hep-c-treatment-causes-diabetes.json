    "question": "In August of 1999, I began Intro A/Rebetol treatment for my hepatitis C. Within weeks, I began experiencing symptoms of diabetes. However, I didn't recognize them as such and thought they were merely side-effects of the interferon/ribavarin. It wasn't until March 2000 that I discovered I had diabetes. Though doctors won't confirm the connection, I'm convinced that the chemo therapy caused my diabetes. If you are undergoing treatment, please be sure your doctor monitors your glucose!If you're interested, my story is detailed at my webpage, The Adventures of DiabetesMan, accessible via this link: http://e.webring.com/hub?ring=myhepatitiscTake care,ACE",
