            "answer": "Hi, understand your anxiety. Was the aneurysm not detected in\u00a0\u00a0earlier ECHOs?\u00a0\u00a0The aneurysm is referred to as a pseudoaneurysm. As there is triple vessel disease he may need CABG as advised by his doctors. Whether the aneurysm can be excised or not will depend on the status observed during surgery. If there situation is not viable, like if there is necrotic tissue surrounding the pseudoaneurysm and if cannot be excised, its best left alone and managed conservatively. So, please discuss in detail with your doctors, clarify all your doubts and then consent for the surgery. Good luck with the procedure. Take care.",

    "question": "My father had a Myocardial Infaction in 1986. Recently he developed Angina Pain and after consultation with the doctor he was advised CABG as he has blockages in 3 arteries. He is scheduled for surgery tomorrow. Yesterday after some test they discovered Aneurysm in the apex ( tip) of the heart. They now want to operate the heart also ie cut out the dead muscles. My father has a history of diabetes and hypertension (though both are under control with medication and life style ). Please suggest whether he should undergo CABG with heart surgery or not ASAP.",
