    "question": "Hi,I am 39 years old and have been experiencing some weird symptoms..\u00a0\u00a0I have had a numbness and tight muscle type of feeling in my left foot for a couple of years now but in the last few months the symptoms have gotten worse.\u00a0\u00a0I now have the same tingling, muscle tightness in my left foot and calf but I also have the tingling in my face, my arm, my hand, and occassionally on my right side now (but mostly my left).\u00a0\u00a0 I also get a weird sensation that feels like something is crawling on my leg or arms.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to that my left thumb quivers from time to time and I feel like I lack coordination on the left side.\u00a0\u00a0I walk fine and still function normally.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't feel right.\u00a0\u00a0I also get a loud ringing in my ears from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have been to the doctors and mentioned the tingling and numbness but I think my doctor thinks it's anxiety and shrugs it off.Having said all of that here is a little more about me.\u00a0\u00a0 I have Type 1 diabetes which I was daignosed with approximately 2 years ago (late diagnoses)..\u00a0\u00a0My daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at almost the exact same time.\u00a0\u00a0My Mom passed away early this year very suddenly of a brain tumor and my Dad has MS.\u00a0\u00a0 I am turning here because I don't know what to think.\u00a0\u00a0I don't talk to anyone close to me about it because I don't want to sound like there's constantly something wrong which is how I feel that I've made people feel about me this year.\u00a0\u00a0For the most part I think I am doing well with everything but of course I have some stress still.\u00a0\u00a0I go the gym and try to eat healthy and keep myself healthy and upbeat.\u00a0\u00a0I take vitamins and supplements as well.\u00a0\u00a0Yet I still have these issues.\u00a0\u00a0Can someone give me some advice or have you experienced anything similar?Thanks for any answers and have a great day!",
