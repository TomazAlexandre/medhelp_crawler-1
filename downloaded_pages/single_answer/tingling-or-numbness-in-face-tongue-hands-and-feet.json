    "question": "i have no idea whats wrong with me. i get sudden flashes of mild dizziness coupled with tingling or numbness in my lips, tongue, face, hands and feet. these symptoms have been going on for about 3 months and are not associated with standing up to fast or movement of any kind. it just happens at random. i thought maybe i was in the beginning stages of diabetes so i would try something sugary to see if my symptoms increased or decreased but there was no difference. im starting to wonder if this could be something neurological or vascular. any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.HL",
