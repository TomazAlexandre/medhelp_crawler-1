            "answer": "I can't give you exact treatment for canine thyroid cancer but I have human thyroid cancer so maybe it will help.\u00a0\u00a0Needle biopsies are notorious for giving false results of thyroid cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Often the cancer is so small that the needle misses it completely.\u00a0\u00a0For humans, the best treatment is to remove the thyroid then go on thyroid replacement hormones.\u00a0\u00a0 My dachshund was on them before he passed (from diabetes) and they are no big deal to give your dog.With humans, if it is cancer then the treatment is radioactive iodine.\u00a0\u00a0The thyroid is the only tissue that absorbs iodine so the radioactive iodine therapy targets just the thyroid and thyroid cancer.\u00a0\u00a0No nasty chemo side effects.\u00a0\u00a0But that is for humans - I'm not sure if the same treatment is available for dogs.Your greyhound's heart problems are probably either caused by, or are contributed to by, the thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid conditions are notorious for causing high blood pressure, heart palpitations, etc.Has she had her thyroid levels checked?\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like she is hyperthyroid.Hope some of this helps.\u00a0\u00a0My best to you and your wonderful dog.",

    "question": "I have an eight year old greyhound *****, she has recently been diagnosed with an enlarged heart and is taking vetmedin twice a day.In the last six months she has lost a great deal of weight. After numerous trips to the vets and blood tests etc we are now told there is a lump on her thyroid.She has been biopsied twice via needle with inconclusive results.Now they want to operate to biopsy her.I have looked up info on excisional and incisional biopsies but how great are the risks to this current operation in the state that her heart is in and her major weight loss.And if she is diagnosed with cancer what is the next step to treatment?",
