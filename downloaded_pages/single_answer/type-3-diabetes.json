            "answer": "Hi!Finger test for blood glucose reveals the blood glucose level. Brain glucose levels are measured through magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Bothe Hypo and hyper glycemia affects brain\u2019s cognitive function but hypo glycemia has a more detrimental effect. Please consult your doctor regarding this.
