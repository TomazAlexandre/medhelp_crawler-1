            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin without any rash can be due to low iron levels causing anemia as well. Other causes are dry skin, dermatitis, lice, scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes and irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods .You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding. Also take some iron supplements for some days.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have itchy skin everywhere. It moves around. It's intense. I've had it for 4 weeks. It started when I was in Bali and continued since I returned a week ago. Been to doctors - blood tests only show low iron, but I've had low iron for 2 years. Lots of bacteria in Bali, diarreah now and then. Doctors gave me fungal cream which made it worse and Fluoxecillin which hasn't helped and another doctor told me to stop taking it anyway. Itch is worse when I get hot. I have some bruises which I can't have caused mysel fas they are large and I'd have remembered. Please help!",
