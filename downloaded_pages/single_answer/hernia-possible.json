            "answer": "Could be any number of things - yes, I think it's possible it could be a small hernia from straining for the bowel movement.\u00a0\u00a0But I also think it could be related to constipation - if you are \"backed up\" so to speak in there, it can cause pain andother symptoms.Check with your doctor about giving an over the counter laxative or at least a stool softener a try (I personally like the Phillips No Cramp Caplets - not a \"stimulant\" laxative that could give you more abdominal pain, but they do work - for me anyway)I hope you feel better soon!",

    "question": "About a week ago I had to push very hard for a bowel movement. Soft stools before and after. Ever since, I have had discomfort around my upper abdomen area: right, left and middle. NO PAIN, just discomfort. If I put pressure on it (lying down) I feel more discomfort, but again no pain. I'm 32, overweight, male. I take no meds. Last doctors checkup was clear, no diabetes or other problems. I plan on going back ASAP but would like some more info to take with me to the doctors if possible.",
