            "answer": "Any fasting blood sugar over 100 is considered pre-diabetes. It sounds like you are doing everything right in terms of diet, exercise and maintaining normal weight. At this point I think your doctor is doing the right thing in re-checking your blood sugar. If it continues in the pre-diabetes range or goes up then I would recommend getting a glucometer which allows you to test at home in between doctor's visits. That will give you good information about how different foods affect your blood sugar two hours after a meal and allow you to fine tune your eating to keep your blood sugar from going up. Sounds like you are doing everything right and if it gets you it's genetics! (And can be managed. You're ahead of the game by focusing now on diet and exercise)",

    "question": "When I had my physical about 10 months ago my fasting blood sugar was 105.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr wanted to recheck in about a year which will be May.\u00a0\u00a0Last night I pulled all my paperwork on my physicals for the past 18 or so years and most of the time my fasting blood sugar was in the low 90s except once about 12 years ago it was 103 and this past year 105 so I am hoping that it will be back in the low 90s again. But I do know with my Dad being a diabetic I am at risk.Healthy eating for me is 5 small meals a day instead of 3 larger ones. Kinda like this.Breakfast - 3 egg whites, 1 whole egg, steelcut unsweetened oatmeal with fresh strawberriesLunch - salad (or some kind of complex vegies) with low fat protein (tuna, salmon, chicken)Snack - SF protein shake with fruit or protein barDinner - low fat protein with cucumber and appleThen go to gym.Snack - FF SF yogurt with a little granola, pretzels or wheat bread with all natural jelly or skim milkExcept for breakfast, I try to eat my carbs around my workout because of the glycogen you lose with cardio and weight training.I will admit, I do cheat and eat sugar a few times a week sometimes. Maybe just cutting out the sugar completely will help.Any advice on how I can change my diet if I need to would be nice. I am normal weight and exercise most weeks 6 days a week.Thanks!Lynda",
