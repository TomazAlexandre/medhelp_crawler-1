There are about 80 types of Mycotoxins and many of them are very difficult to detect with standard tests.It is a very vicious cycle,the longer these pathogens remain in the body, the more infections, the more damage to nerves and muscles and any part of the body and weakening of the immune system.Most sufferers unfortunately never get out of it.The good news is that this is treatable!With a very specific protocol -strict and precise- one can make a complete recovery!Ann Borock N.D. is someone who specializes in this area of health.Just do a search.The other possibility is pathogenic Mycoplasma Infection.Most Doctors just cannot find this as it is Undetectable in most tests!Again do a search for that as well. ( I have posted here and in the FibroCommunity pertinent info on mycoplasmas)My advice does not constitute professional consultation.Please post again if you have\u00a0\u00a0any comments or questions.Blessings,Nikodicreta",
