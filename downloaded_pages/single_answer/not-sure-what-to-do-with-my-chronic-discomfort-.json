            "answer": "Hello,Your symptom is called polyuria (excessive frequency of voiding). It can be due to many reasons which can be physiological or disease-related, and include excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones. I suggest you to take opinion of your doctor who would do a clinical examination and advice for needful tests (such as routine urinanalysis, blood glucose test, blood & urinary osmolalities, ultrasonography of renal system, etc).It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have had chronic discomfort and frequent urination since I think around 16 years old. I am 28 now and still have it, I have been treated multiple ways, but nothing has really helped. I don't have health insurance often, and kind of lost hope in it since when I saved up to see doctors nothing ever helped.I had my bladder expanded when I was younger, I have been treated for interstitial cystitis also, I have been told I have an over active PC Muscle, but that I had to get surgery for, which I cannot afford. I told an expert I met once of my condition and he said maybe INTERSTIM would work, but like I said I never got around to getting insurance to continue to try things.I guess what I'm saying is for over 10 years I have learned to live with it, in fact I'm not sure I even remember what it's like to not have it. I feel like I have to pee almost all the time, sometimes I pee a lot, sometimes I pee a little, but I only feel no urge to pee only for a short while after peeing, which is very relieving, so I pee maybe 15-25 times a day. Just something I live with. If I go out I can manage peeing less, but if I go to a movie or something I usually pee once in the middle, I can get through it without it, but it becomes very uncomfortable. I almost plan around how much I have to pee, at concerts, or when going anywhere.Along with that I have a chronic discomfort, rarely is it painful. If I smoke pot it kind of heightens the sensation. I just feel like a dull clamping on my balls or penis. I cannot find a specific area to give it, and when I feel to try and pinpoint the cause of pain, I cannot really find where it originates, its very confusing, frustrating. I am just kind of tired of it, and starting to become fearful it will get worse or never go away, and starting to wonder how nice life would be if I could pee 50% less and feel comfortable lol.I am not sure what I have, symptoms such Epididymitis and Orchialgia are coming up now that I am reading a bunch.I guess my question is does anyone have any ideas, and what is the best steps for someone without insurance and low income. Any direction helps thank you.",
