            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, even if you had been exposed to feron, it should not leave any lasting effect. Generalized feeling of a burning sensation can be due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. This would need a comprehensive investigation.If all these are ruled out, then maybe you will need to consult a toxicology expert.Take care!",

    "question": "Random burning sensations in limbs and neck and eyes? I am having these symptoms almost all the time, plus dizzy. Doc gave me antibiotic and that was a week ago, still no change. I went to my follow up and the doc didn't care that my symptoms are still here. I was told to keep taking the antibiotic.I was exposed to a leak of freon from my car AC, before this started. I fear that this isn't going to go away. I also get a stabbing pain all of a sudden in my left eye alot. What is this? Was it the freon? what can I do without health insurance?Please help asachs",
