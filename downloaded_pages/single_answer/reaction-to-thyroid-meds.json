    "question": "Have to warn you...I'm a newbie to thyroid issues! I was diagnosed late last yr. and was given Synthroid to shrink nodules, 3 shrank-1 enlarged so the dose was increased (I think .5 to .25). I had a reaction with migraines, throwing up and muscle soreness so was switched to Levoxyl and started over on the lowest dose. Now I hurt all over...and more severe. Feels like I have been hit by an 18 wheeler and my feet/legs are swollen! I can hardly walk and I'm also having muscle spasms...severe in back and legs. Ever since I started both of these, my diabetes has gone crazy as well!I would like to look at the possibility of taking Amour Thyroid, do you feel I can tolerate this one? I am getting desperate to feel better! I also have hypopituitarism and take HGH/Humatrope. Up until the last 4 yrs, I rarely took even a tylenol since I did not tolerate meds well and prefer the natural approach.I sound like I am falling apart!",
