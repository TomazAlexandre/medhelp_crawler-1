            "answer": "Hello,your blood sugars are still very high, and this may be detrimental to your baby (in early pregnancy high sugars can affect heart and spinal cord development).\u00a0\u00a0Target fasting blood sugar is typically < 95.\u00a0\u00a0Target post eating is maximum 140, and ideally < 120.You need to work very closely with your doctor to adjust your insulin doses to bring your sugars down.Are you using basal / bolus (both long and short acting insulin?)\u00a0\u00a0YOu will need to work out your basal rate, and you will also need to count carbs and work out how much fast acting insulin to dose.\u00a0\u00a0It is a bit complicated, and more so in pregnancy when things can change so fast.I would suggest the following books:-Think Like a PancreasDiabetes Solutions.\u00a0\u00a0You can also go online and look up Bernstein Diabetes University.\u00a0\u00a0He has quite a few sessions on U-tube and you can learn a lot.I also recommend, that you eat very low carb (for now at least) until you can get your insulin doses sorted out.\u00a0\u00a0Moderate protein and enough fats to meet your calorie and energy needs.You can do this.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes to you and your baby.",
