            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!This could be due to a peripheral neuropathy like seen in diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in Lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated.Deep vein thrombosis/clot is another possibility. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies.Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I was hoping someone might an an idea what's gong on...For two years now I have had pain in both hands, the longest I have been without any is about a month, then it came back. My hands have red blotches and strange tiny blue veins that pop up. I am starting to feel like I have an alien lifeform growing inside me or something, since nobody seems to have any answers. it is mainly my fingertips and the sides of my fingers that hurt, especially in response to pressure or accidentally bumping them on something.\u00a0\u00a0Heat or cold makes no difference. X-rays have been normal.I had ITP and had my spleen taken out, could this have something to do with it? There is a lot of autoimmune disease in my family, mostly rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.Any answers would be so appreciated!",
