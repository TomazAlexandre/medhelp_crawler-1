            "answer": "Hi!You are actually doing great. After initial weight loss, there comes a time when the weight loss almost stops. At this stage, you need to increase your exercise level, not cardio, but may be add a walk. Also, you need to find out whether you have anemia, diabetes, polycystic ovary and hypothyroidism or not. Having these problems can hamper weight loss. Other than that, if you have reached the ideal weight for your height/age and waist according to your ethnic background and geographical location, then it is best to maintain your current regimen and not push further. Normally you can lose another 5-6 pounds. Just eat healthy. Look for hidden calories and avoid them. Add walking to your routine. Also, please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
