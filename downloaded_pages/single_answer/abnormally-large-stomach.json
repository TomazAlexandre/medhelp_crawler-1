            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Weight gain and fat deposition can vary from one woman to another. Some accumulate fat on hips while others on abdomen. Also water retention in body makes the stomach heavy. It can also be due to gas in the gut because of constipation.Well if you have not been over eating or consuming high calories and exercising less or if there is no change in your routine or if there is no new medication that you have started, or you do not have diabetes, hypothyroidism or adrenal gland problems, then you do have unexplained weight gain. After testing for diabetes, hypothyroidism or adrenal gland problems you must look for other causes. One is water retention due to low serum protein. This along with anemia can cause unexplained weight gain. Adrenal gland problems are the other cause. Cushing\u2019s syndrome should be looked for. The kidney function too should be assessed. Also the diet should contain more of green leafy vegetables, fruits and protein and less of spaghetti, potato etc. Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain. Late night snacking and poor sleep too can cause weight gain. Polycystic ovary too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out by an ultrasound of abdomen.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
