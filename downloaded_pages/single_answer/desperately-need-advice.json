            "answer": "I am sorry you are dealing with this. Have you tried birth control pills to see if that minimizes the cyst formation? If you are overweight, losing some weight can also keep cysts from forming as well as improve the insulin resistance associated with PCOS that can lead to diabetes. If over-the-counter pain medication (such as ibuprofen) doesn't help, maybe you should talk to your doctor about this. I hope you find something to help!",

    "question": "I'm new to this site. I am 22 and have recently been diagnosed with PCOS, and I have 10 cysts on my left ovary (5mm in size) and 13 on my right ovary (7mm in size). I constantly get pain in my stomach, some days it hard to get up because of the pain. I sometimes double over in pain. I would like to know if there is anything I can do to help ease my pain?",
