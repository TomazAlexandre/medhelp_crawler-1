    "question": "I have high blood pressure and diabetes and believe this affects blood flow to penis for normal erection.\u00a0\u00a0I have heard of TV advertisements about Levitra for those with high blood pressure and diabetes. Would that be effective or is some other medicine or herb more effective? I have had no effect with Viagra or Cialis, but perhaps the dosage was too low.\u00a0\u00a0By masterbating I will get an ejaculation eventually but I never get \"hard\". Also, prostate trouble runs among males in my family. What can I do to prevent it?\u00a0\u00a0My PSA is 1, but I get up at night up to 15 times to pee.",
