            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The normal range for ejection fraction\u00a0\u00a0is 63-77% for males and 55-75% for females. It reflects the pumping capacity of the heart. Values below 35% indicate heart failure. If medical therapy fails, cardiac transplantation is recommended for all eligible patients with an LVEF below 20%\u00a0\u00a0regardless of clinical symptoms. It is difficult to predict the exact prognosis, as this depends on other co morbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension and the cause for the low ejection fraction values. Patients with heart failure have a 5-year mortality rate approaching 50 percent in some studies.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
