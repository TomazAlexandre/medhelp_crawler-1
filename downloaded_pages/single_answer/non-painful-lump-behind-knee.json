    "question": "Hello, I am a 34 yo man with type 2 diabetes. 3 weeks ago I began having some pain in my right knee. I did not think anything of it because I have 3 children and they keep me pretty active and waking up with a painful joint or muscle is not out of the norm. I have been treating this pain with 600mg of ibuprofen 3 times a day. It is effective. Unfortunately the pain is not going away on it's own. I have decided to really give myself a good weeks rest and implement the old rest, ice, compression, and elevation treatment. However, today i have noticed that on the back of the knee, where it bends, I have a small (dime size) lump or mass. It is not painful. I can touch it and move it around without pain. I am not sure how long this lump has been there. I am not in so much pain that I feel i need to be seen by my Doctor, in fact I feel comfortable in treating my situation the way i have been. Or should I go and be seen. Is there potential reason to panic? After all I don't even recall the incident where I might have injured it.... Thank you!!",
