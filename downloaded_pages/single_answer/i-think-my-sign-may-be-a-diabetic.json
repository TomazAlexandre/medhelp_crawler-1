            "answer": "If I were you, I would ask his doctor to do a hemoglobin a1c blood test on him -- this will show if his pancreas is working properly or not much better than a urine test does. His irritable times sound more like hypoglycemia than diabetes since you say he does better after he eats. But the thirst can be a symptom of diabetes OR of hypoglycemia (my mouth gets very dry when my glucose levels drop too low). You might want to check out the website www.hypoglycemia.org for more information in case this is his problem.",

    "question": "My son is eight years old and I had him tested for sugar well over a year ago. He was tested by giving a urine sample and the doctor told me that it was fine. I have still noticed his excessive thirst, he gets VERY irritable and once he eats, within 10 to 15 minutes he is a different kid. He also does not sleep well, up and down all night long wanting a drink and having to use the bathroom. I am really frustrated about the situation right now.. I just don't know where to turn.. can someone help??Holly",
