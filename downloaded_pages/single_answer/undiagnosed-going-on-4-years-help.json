            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to hear you are going through so much. Fibromyalgia should be seriously considered. Also it could be multiple sclerosis, hence MRI of brain should be done. Pinched cervical spinal nerves too should be ruled out by a MRI. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause. Hence it is important to get sleep studies done.Hope this helps. Do discuss these possibilities with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
