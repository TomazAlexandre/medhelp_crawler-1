            "answer": "Hi, IBS, Irritable Bowel Syndrome can produce a feeling of incomplete defecation. Then again please check for Diabetes as this can affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves leading to bowel symptoms. This can be detected by a simple blood test. Also local pathologies in the rectum like growths or inflammatory diseases can also leave a feeling to defecation. For this a proctoscopy or a sigmoidoscopy will help detect the lesion. So, would advise you to discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time. Regards.",

    "question": "A few days ago, i had moderate fever with abdominal pain (moving all over my abdomen lower and upper, right and left) ,constipation(difficult to pass stools, but NO PAIN. I mean, i never feel like i'm finished) and tonsilities. And then after 5 or 6 days, it was gone. So, i forgot about that. Now after a week or so i'm feeling discomfort and mild pain in the upper abdomen moving all over the place. Not specific.Other unusual symptoms:frequent urinationnever feel like i'm finished while i'm urinating or passing stools.black stools a loong time ago before the fever (2 times)now, narrow stools.. Quantity is normal.I drank appe (apple juice drink, cool) and the discomfort got worse.the whole abdominal thing started after i ate chicken pizza for the first time (in my life), like after 4 hoursFYI and i sit in my bed ALL DAY (for almost 5 moths now), i never get out..The more i check the internet for solution, the more i get worried. I find it maybe appendicitis, or ever cancer.So, I'm frightened as hell. Should i be really worried?",
