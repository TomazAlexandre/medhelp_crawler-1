            "answer": "Hello,It looks like delayed healing of the cut. Delayed wound healing can occur in vitamin C and vit K deficiency, diabetes, p-rotein deficiency, immunocompromised states and if the person is taking corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.Get your blood sugar levels checked and take some vitamin C for some days. If the symptoms persist of there is pain along with redness then possibility of an infection needs to be ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "i have a large cut on my lower leg- it has clean edges and is approximately 5cm long and nearly a cm deep.\u00a0\u00a0at the time the injury happened, it bled extensively- more than i've ever seen a wound bleed (except in the movies).\u00a0\u00a0i kept it bandaged for a couple of days, and then just left it alone (aside from cleaning it in the shower daily).the injury occured approximately a week and a half ago, and it does not seem to be healing.\u00a0\u00a0periodically, it starts to scab, but all the liquid in the wound seems to make the scab fall apart.\u00a0\u00a0the cut still gapes open constantly and weeps sometimes- slightly yellow transparent liquid.\u00a0\u00a0it is only slightly pink and there is no pus, so i don't think it is infected at all.is this normal healing for a cut of this size?\u00a0\u00a0i want it to scab up and heal.\u00a0\u00a0how should it be healing?\u00a0\u00a0what can i do to help it heal appropriately?\u00a0\u00a0should i clean it out inside or would this simply damage it more?\u00a0\u00a0should i put ointment on it and keep it bandaged?\u00a0\u00a0i'm a bit confused as to how to deal with this situation.",
