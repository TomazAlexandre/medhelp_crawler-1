            "answer": "Hello Jerry.I\u2019m not sure I understand your condition. You state that you have low blood pressure and broken valves, and yet you say you have no heart issues. I believe low blood pressure and broken valves are definitely cardiovascular issues. I\u2019m not sure why you don\u2019t produce testosterone. If, in fact, you don\u2019t, then perhaps a visit to an endocrinologist could determine what\u2019s going on and whether you would benefit from hormone replacement.It pains me when men use the term \u201cimpotent\u201d because it means \u201cpowerless.\u201d You\u2019re not powerless, you just have some health concerns which you can, in fact, do something about. In addition, that term means many things to many people\u2014from not being able to get an erection in a problematic relationship to NEVER having an erection for any reason. And everything in between.It sounds like you\u2019re depressed because you feel hopeless about this. And I\u2019m here to tell you that it need not be hopeless. You need to see an endocrinologist about your hormonal output and also begin to explore sexuality from a different perspective.Our society does a terrible disservice to men by raising them to think that their penis has to be 10 inches long, hard as a rock and last all night. It\u2019s no wonder that many men feel insecure about their sexuality. Great sex involves your whole body; in fact, having great, mutually satisfying sex is usually quite the opposite of what you see in those performance-oriented sex videos.I recommend the book \u201cThe New Male Sexuality,\u201d by Bernie Zilbergeld, Ph.D., widely available used and in paperback. Dr. Zilbergeld, a renowned sexologist, has many suggestions for men who are dealing with physiological conditions, and has much wisdom to impart. Best of luck to you. Dr. J",
