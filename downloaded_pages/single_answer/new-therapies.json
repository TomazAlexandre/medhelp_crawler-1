            "answer": "Hi, not sure what you mean by where does DPP4 is place for diabetes type 2 treatment.\u00a0\u00a0For treatment of type 2 diabetes, doctors usually initiate Metformin if the client's HB A1C >9mmol/L.\u00a0\u00a0When the target is not reached, then that's when you would consider other medications which includes DPP4.\u00a0\u00a0DPP4 works by increasing the incretin released by the intestines which increased the insulin level and decrease the amount of sugar produced by the body.\u00a0\u00a0DPP4 lowers HBA1C <1-2% and it is rare to have hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0One of the important factors that doctors consider is does the client has medical coverage or not.\u00a0\u00a0because the medication is very expensive, not everyone can afford the medication.\u00a0\u00a0hope this is the answer you were looking for!",
