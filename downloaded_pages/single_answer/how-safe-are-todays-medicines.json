            "answer": "All medications have side effects and many carry risk of complications that are worse than the disease they are treating.There are two management strategies for atrial fibrillation. One is rhythm control (trying to get the patient into normal sinus rhythm) and one is rate control (allowing the patient to stay in afib but making sure the rate stays normal). There is no data that one is better than the other, though some people just feel better when they are in normal rhythm.The medications that treat rhythm do have more significant risk of side effects and adverse events. If you are concerned about these risks, you could talk with your doctor about a rate control strategy.Regardless of which strategy you use, you should probably be on anticoagulation (a blood thinner) if you have any other risk factors (age over 75, hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, or history of stroke). If you don't have any of those risk factors, you should at least be taking aspirin.",

    "question": "These last ten years or so I had started getting palpitations but did not do anything about it. Two years ago I was sent to hospital and was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation and put on Amiodarone. Due to some side effects I was eventually put on\u00a0\u00a0flecanide acetate pills. My worry is that nowadays we are not sure anymore about the safety of prescribed drugs. To be honest my condition has not really improved that much: in fact I still get tachycardia rather frequently, and I get days when I am am continually out of breath even from small exertions. My cardiologist is adamant that I continue my medication regime to the letter but I have this suspicion that drug companies are not telling doctors the whole story.The internet is full of sites that black list many familiar drugs including mine. I am not sure anymore if I should continue and the temptation is to just quit.",
