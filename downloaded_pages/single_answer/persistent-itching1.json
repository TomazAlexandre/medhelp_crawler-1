            "answer": "Hello,Such a generalized itchy skin rash is usually due to an allergic reaction or viral rashes. Check the allergens which you may have come in contact with and take some antihistaminic like Benadryl or Claritin. Also consult a dermatologist as you may need topical as well as oral steroids.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "HiFor the past few weeks I've been suffering with whole body itching. There is not an inch of my body that isn't itching.I have visited my GP and he just told me to take an anti-histamine, I am doing this but it does not seem to be providing any relief. I have also tried some home remedies and creams (such as E45) and lotions.I have had blood tests done recently for diabetes, my thyroid and I have since been cured of my iron deficiency anemia.It isn't the kind of itch that I can ignore, I can't help but scratch it. However, it isn't causing a rash - I'm just getting some really nasty looking scratch marks and red marks - for example, on my abdomen, I have a ton of little red spots from all of the scratching. I've scratched until I've bled and it's just really getting out of hand now.Even though it is my whole body, I find it to be worst: on my shins, my whole forearm, my abdomen, my back, my inner thighs and behind my knees). My body truly looks horrible with all of these marks and I would appreciate any responses regarding what it could possibly be!",
