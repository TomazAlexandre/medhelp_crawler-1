            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. Ketones are formed from fat. They are formed when the body doesn\u2019t get\u00a0\u00a0enough energy from carbohydrates. In diabetics due to inability to use glucose as an energy resource or non- availability of glucose can lead to formation of ketone bodies.Is there a history of starvation prior to getting tested? Or due you suffer from uncontrolled diabetes?I feel the first one would be the cause, because your present sugars are normal and the test also shows trace of ketones.Ketosis is condition in which the patient has change in conscious level, dehydration etc.Visit an endocrinologist for detailed evaluation and treatment.Take care.",
