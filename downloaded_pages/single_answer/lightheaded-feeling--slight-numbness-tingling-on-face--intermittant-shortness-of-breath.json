    "question": "Hi,I'm a 24 year old male. For about 4 days I've been feeling lightheaded, with a sort of 'spaced' feeling, the severity alters throughout the day, but it is always noticeable, it sometimes feels like I may faint, but never do, this also accompanied by slight shortness of breath.Additionally on some occasions I've had a slight numbness and/or tingling on my face (mostly left side), sometimes extending down to my neck. My hands also seem a bit unresponsive, it's hard to explain, they just don't feel right i.e. typing/using my mouse seems harder than usual. Also I've noticed over the last month or so that I've been having a small degree of muscle twitching, mostly on my limbs.I've tested myself for Hypo/Hyperglycemia, it all seems within normal range, I've also tested my blood pressure, which is also fine (although it does drop very slightly when standing up, which I believe could be minor Othostatic Hypotension, but not anything major). I have no pain of significance anywhere, my sleeping pattern is fine, I have a good history of health, I'm normal weight and I do not smoke or drink. I have a few people in my family who have type 2 diabetes, plus my mother has multiple sclerosis.I'd really appreciate any ideas anyone may have.Thanks,Joseph.",
