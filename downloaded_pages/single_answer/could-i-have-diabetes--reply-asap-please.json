    "question": "Okay. Well I'm hungry a lot but I have bad diarrhea. My vision has been a little weird. I pee a lot and drink a good bit. But my foot sometimes goes super numb to the point where I can't feel it and if I try to stand I fall if I put pressure on it because I can't feel it at all. Someone reply asap",
