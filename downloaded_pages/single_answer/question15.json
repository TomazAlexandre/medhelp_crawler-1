            "answer": "Hi!Well, ibuprofen can cause seizures and convulsions but should not be responsible for uncontrolled shaking and twitching in your legs.The symptoms could be due to a pinched nerve in the lower back of due to a peripheral neuropathy (due to diabetes, Lyme\u2019s, lupus, hypothyroidism), deep vein thrombosis or due to electrolyte imbalance.I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders could also cause this.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
