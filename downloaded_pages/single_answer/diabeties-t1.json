            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.Just because your partner is diabetic does not mean your child will be as well.\u00a0\u00a0Your child inherits genes from both you and your husband and the genetic link for type 1 diabetes is still not fully understood.\u00a0\u00a0For example, there are cases with identical twins where one twin develops type 1 diabetes but the other does not.\u00a0\u00a0So don't be too concerned at this point.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and congratulations!Bridget",
