    "question": "I have a rough dark patch between my breasts and darkness on my inner thighs, groin, bikini area....vaginal/anal areas, underarms,under eyes,knuckles (hands/feet),knees, back of neck.....hmmmm you name it basicly. Also have a very strong sweetish smell coming from between and beneath my breasts. Also have a strong smell which comes from my vaginal/anal area.....the skin I think as I just can't figure out any cause.I have gone to my gyno and gotten checked up for pcos and other things and came out neg for the pcos and bacterial infections. I have also gone to a hormone (endochrinologist) doctor and came out normal to that too. I shower daily and use antibacterial soup, sometimes organic too and also keep the areas dry and use sufficient amount of summers eve sensitive skin powder on the areas, which helps alot but just not enough.I know I have acanthosis nigricans and it could be due to being overweight.\u00a0\u00a0But I just don't understand the strange smell....its sweet, and if it were mild might even be kind of nice(honey like), but its so strong that it is certain to raise questions when I let my fiance indulge (if you know what I mean). I understand the wetness too, my breasts are big so perspiration is the norm....but it doesnt smell like sweat EVER!The strong smell and constant moisture in my vaginal/anal area is very disturbing. I've gotten it all checked up by my gyno but all she did was stick some cotton swab like things in me, do some ultrasound things, feel around A LOT!!! and tell me I'm all good.I need some answers badly......I just dont know what to do or where to go anymore. Everyone thinks it's not so big a deal as I'm making it.........but just think about it, this kind of stuff is near impossible to live with and don't even get me started on the intimacy factor. I just KNOW something is wrong.....but who (which doctor) can help me figure out what it is. Should I see a dermatologist, as I also have excessive hair loss, oily scalp, acne on scalp and dandruff...plus bacne and acne scars and rough facial skin( I know...I'm a train wreck).",
