            "answer": "Hello,These tingling sensations can be due to parasthesia skin. They are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I recently used an at home organic facial cleanser and the very next day I experienced a tingling sensation on my nose. it feels like it's on the surface rather than inside the nose and it's driving me crazy. It doesn't itch or burn or feel numb. no rashes or hives or bumps of any kind. no discoloration. it just feels tingly. it feels like there's a bug crawling on my nose or someone's dragging a feather across it. this has been going on since mid July. I saw my physician and she said it's an allergic reaction to the facial cleanser I used. probably the citrus ingredient they used and she prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide Cream. I've been using it and it doesn't seem to be working. no improvement what so ever. And i've tried everything else. Calamine lotion, allergy medicine, nasal spray, even oragel hoping that maybe it would numb my nose, but to no avail. This is driving me crazy. it's so distracting and keeping me from really focusing at my job and school. any suggestions?",
