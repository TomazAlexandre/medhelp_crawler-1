            "answer": "Hi!Signs of diabetes: more than normal hunger, thirst or urination. Unexplained weight gain or weight loss, fatigue.Eating too much sugar or coffee or juices or drinks does not cause diabetes. Only those individuals who do not produce enough insulin or have insulin resistance are unable to maintain their blood glucose levels and get diabetes.It is always wise to eat healthy, exercise and get your blood sugar checked yearly. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
