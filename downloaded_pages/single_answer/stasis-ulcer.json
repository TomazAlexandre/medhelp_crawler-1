            "answer": "Hi!Stasis or venous ulcer on a varicose vein or any other ulcer does not heal well due to either poor blood supply or underlying diabetes. Hence the origin of the ulcer has to be determined. Duplex ultrasound of the calf is done to rule out varicose veins and atherosclerosis and blood sugar tested. It is treated by applying warm wet dressings, bandaging, exercise, and elevation of the affected leg. Complete healing\u00a0\u00a0may take several weeks or months. Sometimes plastic surgery is required to cover the ulcers. To help prevent recurrences, wear elastic stocking support available for varicose veins. Avoid prolonged standing and sedentary lifestyle. Please consult a vascular specialist.Take care!",
