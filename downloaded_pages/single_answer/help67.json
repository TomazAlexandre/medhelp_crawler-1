            "answer": "This what i did to get my gd in controlled in my first pregnancy. I went in a low carb hi fruit and veggies diet. No soda is thw first thing i did. Then in the morning i had a bowl of frut loops or ur favorite cereal, or a fruit cereal that i made.( cantaloupe, apple, penuts raisins grape with milk) sandwich (ham and cheese wirh tomates and letuce) and to drink fresh squeeze orange or apple juice. Snack a fruit or nuts. Lunch this is the time were you boddy is running like cary so here eat your carbs (spaghetti, rice, potatos cake) all in moderation. At dinner\u00a0\u00a0y would eat a lean meat with a big bowl of salad. Or veggies how ever you like it. If u drink a lot of watter and if you drink fresh squeeze juice from home this will help get your blood sugar under control. The sugar in the fruits are much easy to digest than processes sugar. My boy was big because my family is all big but did not have problems when he was born. I believed that this diet help cause he even came out clean full of blood but not that white thing that babys usally come out with.",
