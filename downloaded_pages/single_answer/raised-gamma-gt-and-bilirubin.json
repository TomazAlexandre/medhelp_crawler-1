            "answer": "Hi,Gamma-glytamyl transpeptidase, an enzyme which is found in hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells, may be high in liver disease and may be a feature of biliary outflow obstruction rather than hepatocellular damage. Raised GGT levels\u00a0\u00a0may also be associated with pancreatic disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, diabetes, obesity, alcoholism, heart attack as well as medication side effect. It is best that you discuss the results with your attending physician for proper diagnosis. Additional diagnostic tests such as other imaging studies may also be indicated especially if ultrasound was normal. Hops his helps. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hi there,I am a 29 year-old woman. Several months ago some joints on my fingers were swollen and red but not painful. This lasted for a few weeks and then went away. I did not pay attention as I thought it was over. However, about a month later the same joints started swelling again and this time they became painful and stiff, especially in the morning and throughout the day.I visited my GP and had some blood tests for several conditions. Rheumatoid arthritis, gout and other similar conditions were ruled out as the factors were not present, and no sign of infection. My GP prescribed some further tests - liver function tests, which showed an elevated bilirubin level and also elevated Gamma GT. After a couple of months the same tests showed slightly higher levels of bilirubin and Gamma GT than the previous test.Other tests showed slightly raised anti-nuclear antibodies, however the doctor advised me that this does not necessarily mean I have an auto-immune disease. Since my fingers were fine at the time of the tests, there was no clinical examination.I had an abdomen ultrasound which was normal, did not reveal any problems whatsoever with my liver, splene or other organs. I have also noticed my right leg (calf) is often stiff and painful and feels swollen during the day.This is a bit confusing and not sure what to make of it. Do you have any clue as to what this might be?I should also add that I don't drink alcohol, I have a generally healthy diet and i am not overweight or have any other health conditions that I know of.Thanks",
