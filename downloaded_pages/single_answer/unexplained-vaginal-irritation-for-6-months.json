    "question": "Okay, if anyone can please help me i would greatly appreciate it. Back in december i started with a yeast infection...then a bacterial infection...then back to yeast...and tried several different meds and nothing worked...then my gyno said the yeast and everything went away but i was still feeling burning and irritation. I was tested multiple times for all std's including diabetes and everythin was negative. My partner at the time was very large and because of this, i noticed about a month and a half ago that i had a small cut on each side of the vaginal opening. i showed a new gyno and she swabed and took blood for herpes...negative. So im still having burning and redness with no std's and no explination!! my gyno mentioned VULVADYNIA but i cant find a local specialist. i have also been experiencing vagainal spasms that are driving me crazy...i just want it to go back to normal!!! My question is, would anyone know what is causing this for this long? and im worried about the cuts down there that wont heal after a month, i tried neosporin but no success. is it possible i have hsv2 even thogh the swab and blood test came back negative durning the cut?thank you very much for reading ...",
