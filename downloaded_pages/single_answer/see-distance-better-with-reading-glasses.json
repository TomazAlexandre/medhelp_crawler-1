    "question": "I wear contacts for distance and 2.50 reading glasses to read. I first noticed this problem last summer on a road trip: Suddenly I couldn't see the exit signs and I was wearing my contacts. However when I put my reading glasses on to read the rather small GPS I happened to glance up andI found I could see the exit signs clearly! This was the only time it happened. Now tonight I was eight feet away from the TV and it was blurry...until I put my reading glasses on and I could see it very well. Yet I need the reading glasses to read also. Last summer when I went to the eye doc he suggested it may be related to diabetes. I saw my general practitioner. We did bloodwork and I do not have diabetes, though it runs in my family. Before I return to eye doc I was wondering if anyone can speak to what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for replies.Ken",
