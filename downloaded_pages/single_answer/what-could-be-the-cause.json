            "answer": "Hello,The pain in the thigh muscles after climbing can be due to spasm of the muscle due to strain of the muscles of the thigh.This muscle strain can be due to overuse of the muscle or repeated trauma to muscle fibers.Are you overweight or do you have prolonged standing?Apply warm compresses on the area and take some over the counter anti-inflammatory pain killer like ibuprofen or diclofenac.Application of topical muscle relaxants will also help.If the symptoms still persist then other causes like peripheral artery disease, dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low calcium, sodium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism,peripheral vascular disease,nerve compression and excessive alcohol intake have to be ruled out.Pls consult a physician then as thorough investigations are needed to rule them out.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.",
