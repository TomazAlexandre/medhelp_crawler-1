    "question": "I'm a 36 year old female with diabetes and high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0My glucose numbers are perfect, and rarely go above 120 post meals and my last A1C was 5.0. I've been experiencing a tingling patch on my left shoulder blade now for about a year.\u00a0\u00a0It comes and goes, sometimes its itches, and sometimes it feels normal.\u00a0\u00a0Also on the upper left side of my arm on the outer part only it has just started to go numb at times, and sometimes it will itch.\u00a0\u00a0Also I have problems with my ear on the right side of my head feeling numb, and then my right nostril feeling numb and becoming congested.\u00a0\u00a0Then, the teeth on the top right front side will get numb.\u00a0\u00a0I also experience loss of sensation in my right forearm sometimes and just recently it moved to the left side.\u00a0\u00a0Now its moved back to the right side.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the whole right side of my face will feel tingly and loss of sensation.\u00a0\u00a0I do have dizzy spells off and on, but sometimes I don't have the dizzy spells with the strange sensations and numbness.\u00a0\u00a0My hands and fingers and arms can go completely dead when I am sleeping, figured this was just because I was sleeping on them wrong.\u00a0\u00a0It does happen sometimes when I am awake (just to fingers) and have been sitting in a certain position.\u00a0\u00a0When I swallow sometimes it feels like there is a lump on the right side of my throat, and one time I woke up in the middle of the night choking and coughing and I had lost my voice.\u00a0\u00a0I thought my throat was closing up, so we went to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0They looked in my throat and said it was fine and sent me home.\u00a0\u00a0I had no pain in my throat, I had no cold symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I was hoarse for a day and then it went back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0The ER also said that my ear looked like it had pressure in it like I had been flying on an airplane.\u00a0\u00a0She asked if I had been traveling recently.\u00a0\u00a0I told her no.\u00a0\u00a0She told me to try and pop my ears.\u00a0\u00a0Here recently in the past few weeks I wake up in the middle of the night with trouble swallowing like my throat is stuck.\u00a0\u00a0Once I am awake it goes back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0I do get headaches off and on of all different varieties.\u00a0\u00a0I've even had burning sensations in different parts of my head that come and go, and sometimes I have that pain in my sinuses.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I have headaches that are in different spots on my head, or on one side and recently I started getting pain in the temple right next to the upper part of my ear.\u00a0\u00a0Like almost behind the upper part, but still on the outside.\u00a0\u00a0Its hard to explain.\u00a0\u00a0It can cause jaw pain sometimes too and radiate down to my neck.\u00a0\u00a0This comes and goes and is actually less painful than it was when it first started.\u00a0\u00a0The head ear pain head ache started when I started taking amaldoprine (sp ck blood pressure medicine), so I am not sure if that has anything to do with it.\u00a0\u00a0Most of these symptoms I've been having before I started taking any kind of medication for high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if this is of any interest, but I have frequent urination sometimes 5x in one hour and I can sit on the toilet and continue to push urine out even after I'm done urinating.\u00a0\u00a0I sat on the toilet once for 15 minutes doing this and it never felt like I had all the urine out of my system.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors say its from high blood sugar, but I have days where all I eat is meat and veggies and maybe one piece of fruit and I will still urinate that way.\u00a0\u00a0I've had several EKG's run that all came back normal, blood work that has come back all normal, (although some months ago they said my red blood cell count was low, its been back to normal since), they did a stress test on my heart last week and they said it was normal too.\u00a0\u00a0They like to attribute all my symptoms to my diabetes and blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I've also been told this is anxiety related, but why all the \"new\" anxiety related symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0I've lived off and on with anxiety for 18 years and everything I am talking about now is new as in the past 2 years new.\u00a0\u00a0So, I am really clueless and I'm tired of going to the doctors all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I'm scared one day they are just going to stop seeing me, and then that will be the time something is really wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0Oh one more thing I do have a lump in my neck that the doctor thinks is either a lymph node or a saliva gland with a stone in it.\u00a0\u00a0I've had it for awhile now.\u00a0\u00a0This is also on the right side of my body.\u00a0\u00a0I've noticed it go away sometimes, but only to come right back.\u00a0\u00a0He told me to not worry about it too much and to eat lemons to see if it goes away, and if it doesn't then if I start running a fever to call him and he will put me on antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0I'm really at a loss.\u00a0\u00a0Help please.",
