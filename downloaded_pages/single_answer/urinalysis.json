            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. Urine analysis is a very common test that can be performed in many healthcare settings. Urinalysis can reveal diseases that have gone unnoticed because they do not produce striking signs or symptoms. Examples include diabetes mellitus, various forms of glomerulonephritis, and chronic urinary tract infections. Therefore, a urinalysis is commonly a part of routine health screening.Interpretation of urinalysis is generally based on reviewing all the components of the test as well as the clinical symptoms and signs of the patient. It usually helps in identifying infections of the urinary tract including prostatitis, diabetes, hypertension, kidney stones etc.The urine sample is subjected to two types of analysis macroscopic and microscopic. Macroscopic urinalysis is the direct visual observation of the urine, noting its quantity, color, clarity or cloudiness, etc. In microscopic analysis\u00a0\u00a0cells and cellular debris, bacteria, and crystals in the urine can detected to provide further clinical clues. The presence of infection can be detected and confirmed by urine analysis, but whether it is prostatitis or not can be determined with urine analysis in combination with physical examination and symptoms present.Consult your urologist for further information.All the best.",
