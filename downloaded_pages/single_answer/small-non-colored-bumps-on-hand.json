    "question": "Hello, my Mother has had these two very small, flesh-colored bumps on her hand. She also has neuropathy and diabetes (type 2). Soon after these strange bumps popped up, they have been causing her severe pain. She describes is as a major burning feeling, and it makes doing the easiest things unbearable to do. Here are some picture links to them, I tried to get the clearest pictures I could.http://i33.tinypic.com/nxi8.jpgAs you can see its red around the area, its almost invisible to the naked eye, and it seems like its under the flesh. Its hard, and very painful. Any help would be nice.",
