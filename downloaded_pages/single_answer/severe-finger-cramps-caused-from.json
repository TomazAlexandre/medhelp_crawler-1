            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for writing in this forum.Some of the important causes of finger cramps are overextension of the muscles,dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium,calcium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism,peripheral vascular disease(narrowing of the arteries which causes poor circulation),sarcoidosis,excess alcohol,nerve compression, and sometimes liver disease.Some of these causes like dehydration and alcohol intake are modifiable by efforts of the patient. Stretching and massaging the affected muscle can usually relieve an attack of cramp. A painkiller such as paracetamol may help to ease muscle discomfort and tenderness that sometimes persists for up to 24 hours after a cramp has gone.My advice is to consult a physician and rule out the above medical conditions by thorough investigations as without physical examination and investigations, pinpointing a diagnosis is tough.Hope it helps.Tkae care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.Kind regards.",
