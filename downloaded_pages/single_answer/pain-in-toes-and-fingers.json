    "question": "For the past 5 months I have been experiencing pain in my hands and toes except the thumbs and big toes.\u00a0\u00a0If I can describe how it feels it is as if when i close my eyes my toes and fingers feel very very swollen but when I look at them they are normal.\u00a0\u00a0When I bend my fingers they feel tight. Pain is day and night. It started with my last two fingers then moved over to the middle finger and index and has stopped there.\u00a0\u00a0 My rheumatologist does not feel it is from my polymialgia rheumatica condition.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently taking prednisone and methotrexate which started about 10 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestion as to what could be possible causes would be appreciated. I have been wondering lately if it could be from my spine constricting on some nerves.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabetes. Thank you for your attention to this matter.Amespi",
