            "answer": "Men are more likely to get a UTI once past the age of 50. People with kidney stones, urinary tract abnormalities, weakened immune systems, spinal cord injuries, and diabetes are more likely to get UTIs, as are patients who have been catheterized to drain urine directly from the bladder. Therefore your disease state may be making you more susceptible. Again I am not a doctor and cannot diagnose, so I would have to refer you to your primary doctor or your urologist to have you probably diagnosed. If in fact you have one,urinary tract infections are usually easy to treat, but it\u2019s important to begin treatment right away.Best of luck to you.Jennifer R RPh www.drugstore.com",
