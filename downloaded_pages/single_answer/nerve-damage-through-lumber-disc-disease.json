            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Prolonged use of steroids can affect your brain function. Hence, try and ease off them. Also, chronic pain can often hamper your cognitive function. You can try and ease the low back pain through non-steroidal anti-inflammatory such as Tylenol, Aleve or Mobic, low back strength training exercises, physiotherapy, hydrotherapy like swimming, acupressure etc.Also since hypothyroidism and diabetes too can cause similar problems, so please get this investigated. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have been experiencing back pain for over a year and I finally got myself to the doctor and got examined.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, I was diagnosed with the Lumber Degenerative Disc Disease, on the 5th disc.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is actually tolerable, but one irritating symptom accompanied by this back pain (at least in my own theory) is that it is affecting my public speaking and my brain!\u00a0\u00a0Let me give you some examples: 1) I am often off in pronunciation on words; 2)I often cannot finish speaking a whole sentence in one setting, like it would get cut off for no reason; 3)I often now question why this sentence is said this way and must follow this grammar; 4) Given all facts above, now I tend to pre-organize the sentence in my head before I speak, I guess I have lost confidence in speaking;\u00a0\u00a05) sometime I feel like my right brain is being pulled, given that my back pain is mainly on the right side.\u00a0\u00a0Anyways, I feel like I am going crazy with this.How do I think this is related to my back pain?\u00a0\u00a0Because when the pain is not there, I don't have this problem!\u00a0\u00a0Every time the doctor give me a shot of the steroid anti-inflammatory shot to ease the pain, I would become normal again while it lasted.Please suggest what kind of doctor I should see or what kind of treatment I should look into.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I was under a huge amount of stress as well, but now the stress level is slowly diminishing.",
