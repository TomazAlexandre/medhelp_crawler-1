            "answer": "Hi VWguy,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved appears to be originating from upper cervical region.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.I think you need a complete physical examination from a neurologist to rule out any pathological state.Muscles twitching are also called as fasciculation\u2019s. Muscle twitching is the result of minor local muscle contractions or the uncontrollable twitching of a single muscle group served by a single motor nerve fiber or filament. Some minor muscle twitching is common and goes unnoticed, but some may be sign of underlying neurological disorder.Benign twitches are normal and quite common, often triggered by stress or anxiety. Any irregularity in your daily diet can also cause similar symptoms. Any drug overdose especially caffeine. Exercise can also induce twitching.Symptoms suggestive of a neurological cause of fasciculation\u2019s include:Wasting of muscle, weakness, other findings of nerve dysfunction like pain, tingling and numbness. Neurological illnesses where fasciculation\u2019s are seen include:Chronic denervation of muscle due to disk compression of nerve exiting the spinal cord, ALS, spinal muscular atrophy, Muscular dystrophy among others.Since these symptoms are prolonged and annoying, you can take help of neurologist at earliest.Hope this helps.Bye.",

    "question": "I should start from the beginning\u2026About a month ago I was sitting at my computer and I felt like I was going to pass-out but I didn\u2019t.\u00a0\u00a0Then it goes like this\u2026.Week 1: Throughout this week my pinky started going numb randomly.\u00a0\u00a0I also felt like there was an air pocket in my head every once in a while.\u00a0\u00a0So I went to my college physician and he told me to do some hand stretches to do when I feel my pinky going numb.Week 2:\u00a0\u00a0The stretches help a-lot but the feeling of pressure in my head was still there.\u00a0\u00a0At this point I\u2019m eating maybe 1 \u00bd meals a day with a gallons of water, juices etc.Week 3:\u00a0\u00a0The pressure feeling in my head is gone but now different muscles are twitching and my neck feels stiff. My right upper eye lid does it the most.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday my lower left eye lid started twitching.\u00a0\u00a0And random isolated muscle parts of my arm and leg twitch about 2 or 3 times throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0My eyes also look blood shot once every 5 days.\u00a0\u00a0My mouth feels dry with a weird taste.Lastly I should say I\u2019m 19, between 180-185 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I run 5 miles every other morning and weight train.\u00a0\u00a0And I eat healthy foods.Is what I described symptoms of anything?\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m hoping that this is some type of phase my body\u2019s going through.\u00a0\u00a0I just don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m 100% anymore.",
