I had to reread your post several times because of the NUMEROUS spelling and grammatical errors, and I still don't know if I read it correctly.So here is what I do when traveling ; start three days before your trip. Since Europe is 6 hours ahead...1. Day 1 take the first shot at 8pm2. Day 2 take the shot at 6pm3. Day 3 take the shot at 4pm.The next day get on your flight.Once in Europe your 10pm shot will be at 10pm. Reverse the order before you return. Unfortunately this means midnight, 2am and 4am.This will put you back on your regular schedule.",
