            "answer": "Hi,It would be unusual for you to have nerve problems related to diabates and not any other symptoms, although not impossible.\u00a0\u00a0You are more likely to have a nerve entrapment/back problem that can be the cause. I think you do need to be examined by your doctor soon to see if you are subjectively feeling numbness only, or if you also are numb on testing. He/she can also check o your blood flow and arrange for any blood tests/radiology studies that need to be done to figure out the cause. Testing for diabetes is a good idea, and I would also suggest thyroid function studies.After this is mystery is solved, try to start getting some exercise even in small ways(walking up some stairs etc) and watching your diet so that you can reduce your risks in the future as well.take care.",

    "question": "I'm 28 years old, overweight, and have a desk job that doesn't allow me to get too much movement during the day.\u00a0\u00a0A few days ago I woke up and noticed that my feet felt like they were asleep (right foot moreso than the left).\u00a0\u00a0This feeling wasn't as if the foot was completely asleep, but part-way.\u00a0\u00a0I had the tingling sensation that you get (not strong, just annoying).\u00a0\u00a0The following day I noticed my feet felt cold (especially my toes) and I continued to have this tingling sensation.\u00a0\u00a0It has been mild but continues on throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0I particularly feel this in the bottom of my feet and closer to the toes.\u00a0\u00a0It's a tough feeling to describe but it's a mix of tingling, cold, and a bit itchy.Now my biggest concern would be diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have not lived a healthy life in years.\u00a0\u00a0I don't seem to have any of the other symptoms of excessive thirst or hunger.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm wondering if this sounds like something someone who has come down with diabetes might feel.\u00a0\u00a0Would this warrant a trip to the doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Or is this something that doesn't seem at all like diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if it does sound like it, is it worse that I'm dealing with vascular issues or is this normal for even the mildest of cases?\u00a0\u00a0I always thought the feet problems were common in older people who have had it for many years.Any help is appreciated, I've been real worried.",
