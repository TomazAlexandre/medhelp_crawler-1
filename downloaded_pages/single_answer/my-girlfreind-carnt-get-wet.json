            "answer": "Failure to produce lubrication is a common problem when aging, however, if your girlfriend is not of an \"aging\" age then that most likely isn't the problem.I am not a doctor but I'm pretty sure the thrush is not the cause of your difficulties.Usually, foreplay, physical and/or oral stimulation helps to stimulate and encourage the production of lubrication during intimacy. However, if your girlfriend is unable to produce lubrication at all, and is truely interested in you as a romantic partner, she may be experiencing an emotional (stress, anxiety, etc.) or physical (diabetes, chemical allergy, etc.) problem that requires medical examination.I would recommend that you talk to her about the situation and determine together if there is something the two of you can do about it or if she feels that a doctors visit is in order. Good luck!",
