            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your condition. You seem to have generalized muscle atrophy. Liver diseases, hyperthyroidism and weight loss, diabetes, ALS (but this has upper motor neuron signs), Charcot Marie Tooth syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myotonia congenita, muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",

    "question": "To doc M or anyone who can offer input: I've had muscle atrophy in both arms worse on my right,muscle twitching, right foot drop and some atrophy on my right upper quadricep, left leg seems normal except for a lil twitching, I have limited flexability,and i get muscle craps almost any where {hamstring, abdominal,gluteus, lats ect..] depends. I've had a nerve conductivity test, and doc said I had lower neuron symptoms not so much in the upper neurons. I've had symptoms for more than 18 months. Doctor was kind of generous in my life expectancy, If the symptoms are not present in both upper and lower neurons, is life expectancy longer cause another 2 to 4 years of life\u00a0\u00a0is a real effin bummer, I'm 52. Thank you",
