            "answer": "This must be quite a shock, but let me encourage you that much of this condition can be controlled. An association with this condition can be abnormal blood sugar or even diabetes. You should have this looked into at some point (if not already done).I suggest that you seek/or continue care with a retina specialist. You should have regular exams and photos and possibly other tests like OCT and/or IVFA's (flurosceins).Do lots of web research and post back here regularly.Best Wishes,Timothy D.
