            "answer": "Hi,How are you? There are a number of causes for chest pain and pain in the left arm like myocardial infarction, myocarditis, hypertension, esophagitis, pneumonia, pneumothorax, herpes zoster, thoracic outlet syndrome etc.Have you got work up done for all the conditions mentioned? Also, if you are having medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia then you have risk of developing TIA\u2019s and stroke. The symptoms that you mentioned could be a manifestation of TIA. A cervical disc herniation, fracture or prolapse can cause radiculopathy, but the symptoms are constant.I would suggest that you visit your physician for proper evaluation of the condition and further advise on treatment.Best.",

    "question": "I'm 31. I recently I woke up with pain in my chest and my left arm. The same day I passed out at work, i went to the hospital they check my heart it was ok, they said I had a panic attack. That was a month ago. I have been to the GP since and been checked over again the only thing he could find wrong was a low white blood cell count which he said may indicate a virus, although I hadn't felt sick in anyway. The pain appears to be a musculoskeletol one, there is a constant pain in my left upper chest. My arm keeps getting shooting pains my wrist and fingers especially either numb or ache. Sometimes my left leg/foot feels shooting pains but not very often, at the moment throughout the day i get these shooting pains followed by a hot flush, followed by feeling faint and nauseous. When I try to massage the pain away it gives me all these symptoms plus a headache in my left temple and aches up the left side of my neck into my jaw. I have tried taking anti-inflammatories but the seemed to have little effect. Do you have any advice for me, I do suffer from stress and I am on herbal meds to sort this out but they are not having any effect on the pains/nausea.ThanksRichard",
