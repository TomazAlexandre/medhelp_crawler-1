            "answer": "Hi!You have described your symptoms pretty well. From you symptoms alone it sounds like chronic fatigue syndrome. This usually presents with widespread myalgia (muscle ache) and arthralgia (bone and joint ache), headaches, chronic mental and physical exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, concentration difficulty and memory problems. Cognitive behavior therapy, memory games, multivitamin therapy, nutritional care, graded increase in exercise all help to treat it. There is no cause for this.Then you also need to investigate other causes of similar symptom like liver dysfunction (get liver enzymes done\u2014liver function test), kidney dysfunction (get kidney function test done), and anemia. Poor sleep pattern and sleep problems like sleep apnea too can cause similar symptoms. Sleep studies by sleep specialists can help diagnose this. Low Vit D or Vit B12 too could be the cause.Hypothyroidism, diabetes and hormonal imbalance in women due to any cause like PCOD should be investigated. Some of these problems can have autoimmune origin and can run in families. Do discuss these possibilities with your doctor. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
