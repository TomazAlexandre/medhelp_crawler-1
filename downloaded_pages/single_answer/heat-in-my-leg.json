            "answer": "Hello,How are you?Feeling of heat sensation in the leg can be due to a problem with one of the nerves going down to your leg like nerve compression,peripheral neuropathy or entrapment of the nerve.It can also be due to a problem of the blood vessels to your legs like in periphaeral vascular disease or due to lack of blood supply to the legs as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels.However it is also important to rule out other possibilities like diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause such sensations in the knee and legs.I feel that you should consult a physician/neurologist and get yourself evaluated for these different possibilities.You also need investigations like MRI spine,nerve conduction tests,blood sugar levels,thyroid profile,MRA leg,serum levels of different minerals and vitamin B 12 and if need be a CT/MRI head.I hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing and if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
