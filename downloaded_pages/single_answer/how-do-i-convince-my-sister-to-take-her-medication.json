            "answer": "Hello confused,I'm a volunteer and not a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0What a wonderful sibling you are to reach out to try to help your troubled sister.Glugophage is a medication used to treat folks with Type 2 diabetes to help folks produce more insulin when they need it (typically with meals).\u00a0\u00a0There are some formulations that can now be taken just once a day, tho' not every formulation works for every individual.\u00a0\u00a0Clearly your sister's medication must be determined by her physician.\u00a0\u00a0Here's a website with some good information on the medication: http://www.diabetesmonitor.com/metf-qa.htmI'm a long-time diabetic (type 1 not type 2) and was diagnosed as a teen.\u00a0\u00a0I would encourage you to consider that the *real* problem you've described is not diabetes per se (tho' that is a serious health issue).\u00a0\u00a0I interpret your description like this:\u00a0\u00a0your sister is frightened, depressed, and may be in denial about her health, her value as a human being/family member/ friend.\u00a0\u00a0In her battle of the wills with your parents, she also knows that she can scare/hurt/control them (and you) by refusing to take her meds.\u00a0\u00a0You mention taht she has other issues, and because of that, it's more likely that the emotional aspects are strong right now.She might imagine that if she doesn't take her meds, then perhaps she doesn't really have a disease.\u00a0\u00a0She is asserting some control over her own life -- normal among teens (who are \"supposed\" to rebel at about this age).\u00a0\u00a0Teens with health issues often act out on the basis of their health issue.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest to your parents that they participate in family counseling with her.\u00a0\u00a0As your msg illustrates, diabetes affects the whole family ... parents, siblings, children, step- (if there are any).When a new disease strikes and then must be managed for EVER, interactions among family members often shift focus to the person with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Folks in a phase like your sister are attempting to get attention -- not necessarily \"for\" their diabetes, but rather for their emotional pain/fear about it and changed self-perceptions.\u00a0\u00a0The source(s) of the hurt must be dealt with.\u00a0\u00a0Medical folks rarely have the time/training to help teens (or adults) recognize and deal with the emotional pain of diabetes or pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Licensed psychologists and family therapists have the needed training.Folks with diabetes or pre-diabetes are just like everyone else with normal emotional reactions to stress and fear.\u00a0\u00a0As your sister is able to heal on those levels, she will naturally be motivated to manage her life/condition responsibly.Finally, alcohol/illegal drug use is increasingly common among teens even as young as your sister.\u00a0\u00a0If your sister's general patterns of behavior and coping have changed suddenly, it would be wise for your parents to determine if your sister is involved in such things.\u00a0\u00a0If she is, *that's* the first thing to deal with, since nothing else will \"stick\" 'til a person is clean & sober & ready to take life on its own terms.Good luck and pls let us know how things work out ... Check back again, others will likely post, too!",

    "question": "ok so my sister is 13 almost 14 years old. She does not yet have diabetes but is at extremely high risk for it. She has a lot of problems with it that affect her health and make it evident that she needs to do something about it. I'm away at school so I can't exactly monitor whether or not she takes it. i've pleaded with her to take it and told her the risks of it. The medicine she's on is called glucophage(spelling?). I don't know if anyone's heard of it but she's supposed to take it 3 times a day w/ each meal and she never does. I only know this because my parents told me about this and asked for my help. How do I convince her to take her medicine and do the other required things to prevent her from getting diabetes?",
