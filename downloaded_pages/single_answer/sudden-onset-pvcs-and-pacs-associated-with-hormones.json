    "question": "i just started getting very strong palpitations out of the blue - i am 30 and diabetes type 2 and have lost 50 lbs recently, these seems to be worse, right after i eat, and if i get up suddenly. it almost feels like a hormone is out of wack and causing this..i have had lots of weird symptoms for months, weakness feeling ;like i gonna pass out etc... none of it is related to my blood sugar either because it happens when its mnormal as well as high...the heart doctor said they are strong pacs and pvcs but cant find a cause, also my heartbeat has some tachycardia and some bradycardia down to 47 beats a minute , when this thing started my blood pressure suddenly dropped from my normal rate of around 127/75 to now it is always like 90/50. i was just sitting one night and had dinner and all of a sudden i had some very strong pvcs and then my heart rate shot to 180 and i called and ambulance cause i thought the worst, i had never had anything like that before, also i get a weird adrenaline rush feeling with it and sometimes the pvcs and the feeling last for hours, throid is normal, any idea what other hormone could cause this??",
