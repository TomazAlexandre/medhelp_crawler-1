            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You could be suffering from an inflammatory bowel condition such as Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Crohn\u2019s disease. Since you do not have bowel disorders, this is less likely. Other than that it could be due to H pylori infection. It can also be food intolerance. Diabetes can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence get your blood sugar tested. It can also be due to excess consumption of food rich in sulfites like juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough. Constipation can also cause bloating. Very sedentary lifestyle is another cause, but since you do zumba, this is ruled out.Cancers of the gut and in female ovarian cancer too could be a cause. Hence these two need to be evaluated too. Do consult your doctor. Abdominal girth can also increase in adrenal gland problems, and hence cortisol test should be done. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
