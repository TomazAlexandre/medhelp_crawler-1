            "answer": "Hello,The urine analysis is diagnostic of a urinary tract infection. UTI is urinary tract infection and no gender is spared. The cause of most UTIs is bacteria that initially settle (colonise) around the urethra (urine tube), and then ascend into the rest of the urinary tract. Factors that can cause this to happen include incomplete urinary emptying, hygiene of the urethra, urethra narrowing, bladder reflux disease (usually due to leaky valves between the bladder and ureter tubes that connect to the kidneys and diabetes etc. It is better to get a urine culture done as you need oral antibiotics.Till then drink plenty of water and cranberry juice.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
