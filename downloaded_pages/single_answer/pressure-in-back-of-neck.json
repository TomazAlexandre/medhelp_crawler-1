            "answer": "Hi, there\u2019re a few possible causes which I can think of in your case.1. Streptococcal sore throat \u2013 This is also common amongst diabetics. You can try some warm saline gargles but I\u2019ll strongly advise you to visit a physician as you may need a course of antibiotics.2. Oral Candidiasis \u2013 also commonly known as the oral thrush occurs when the immune system of the body is weakened\u00a0\u00a0by diseases like diabetes mellitus.3. Early stage of Carbuncle - A carbuncle is an abscess larger than a boil, usually with one or more openings draining pus onto the skin. It is usually caused by bacterial infection.Most carbuncles are caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. The infection is contagious and may spread to other areas of the body or other people.A carbuncle is made up of several skin boils. The infected mass is filled with fluid, pus, and dead tissue. Fluid may drain out of the carbuncle, but sometimes the mass is so deep that it cannot drain on its own. Carbuncles may develop anywhere, but they are most common on the back and the nape of the neck. Men get carbuncles more often than women. Because the condition is contagious, family members may develop carbuncles at the same time. Often, the direct cause of a carbuncle cannot be determined. Things that make carbuncle infections more likely include friction from clothing or shaving, generally poor hygiene and weakening of immunity. For example, persons with diabetes and immune system diseases are more likely to develop staphylococcal infections.http://en.wikipedia.orgIt\u2019ll be good if you visit a physician and seek his/her opinion too as because of associated diabetes, you can\u2019t afford to take a chance as the infections spread quite fast amongst the diabetics.I hope it has helped. Pl do keep me posted.Kind Rgds.",
