            "answer": "Well you didn't supply much information in your post. What did your doctor tell you? Surely you must have thought to ask this question.I'll take a stab at it ha ha <--sorry bad joke!Your liver is no longer fully functionable so therefore other areas of the liver are working on compensating for the area the can no longer function. How well the rest of your liver is able to perform is found by doing a standard metabolic blood test. Either way its going to be very important for you to take extra special care of your liver by maintaining a good diet such as staying completely away from fatty foods and abosoloutly no alcohol! Exercise will be very important to keep you from taking on any body fat. So cardiovacular exercise is what you need to be doing.Since you probably have already sustained alot of damage already getting if you were to get a fatty liver, diabetes or cirrhosis it would advance very quickly.You really should write down a list of questions for your doctor and dicuss the best treatment and what to watch out for based on the amount of damage inflicted.I wish you the best.Randy",
