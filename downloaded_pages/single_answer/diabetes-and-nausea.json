            "answer": "Hello,It sounds like your Dad has some excellent specialists trying to figure out the cause of his nausea.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid that nausea , like headaches, can be very tough to figure out because one or several things may be he cause(s), and sometimes it is not found and all you can do is take care of the symptoms. In someone with your Dad's history, medications and gastroparesis are the most likely causes, but the entire differential list is quite long. Somewhere in the course of tests the docs should consider doing a scan of the head also to ensure all is good there, sometimes they forget this can be a cause of nausea.I am sorry I could not be of more specific help. I hope all goes well with your Dad. Continue being a strong advocate for his care.Take care.",

    "question": "Continuing with previous question regarding vomiting in Diabetes 2 patient --- My dad is showing the same symptoms! Further complicated by being a kidney transplant survivor. He has a gastrologist, plus the kidney dr, plus an endocrinist assigned to his case. He recently was dx'd as gastroparetic and put on Reglan. THat worked for about 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0He then started vomiting again .... After admission for the recurrence of the vomiting, and some tests, he developed a mild UTI. They found an inguinal hernia but won't/can't repair it until the UTI is cleared up and he gets vomiting under control. They seem to be at a total loss as to what is causing the vomiting. They are doing some tests now related to the Ciclosporine he takes for kidney transplant, but since he has been on that for 15 years, I am having a hard time accepting that.\u00a0\u00a0Really do sense head-scratching .... Any further suggestions I can send their way? They finally did an endoscopy today, no esophogeal blockage.",
