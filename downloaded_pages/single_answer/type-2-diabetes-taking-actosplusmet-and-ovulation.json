    "question": "Hello. I am a 32 year old woman that has PCOS. I was diagnosed around 11 years ago. I was just recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months ago. My Dr. put me on Actos plus Met and I started having a regular period immediatly. I was amazed to find out that after 3 months I brought my A1C test results down from 13.8 to 7.8. My Dr. was amazed at this. I have never ovulated as far as I know and my Dr. seems to think since I started having a regular period I should start ovulating any time now. Me and my husband are trying to conceive. I have been taking at home ovulation predictor tests but so far I have had no positive results. Has anyone started ovulating after taking Metformin with your PCOS? And how long did it take? Maybe I'm worrying for nothing and just haven't given it long enough. Thanks for any help.",
