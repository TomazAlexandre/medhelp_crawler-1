            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Is there a chance that there is mold in your house or work place?\u00a0\u00a0Humid climate has plenty of this and this could be the reason you did not suffer from any symptoms in desert climate. Indoor exposure to black mold can cause upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sore throat and cough along with wheeze in otherwise healthy people. It can precipitate asthma attacks in people with asthma. Black mold can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis in individuals susceptible to immune-mediated condition. Depending on the length of exposure, amount of spore in touch, inhaled or ingested, symptoms can be headaches, irritation to the eyes, mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and throat, sneezing, coughing rashes, fever, breathlessness and chronic fatigue.Other than that breathlessness can be due to a cause in the lung, hear or elsewhere. The commonest cause is anemia. It can also be due to asthma like conditions, bronchitis (this should be evaluated further), high blood pressure, diabetes, hypothyroidism or obesity. Certain heart conditions too can cause breathlessness like mitral valve prolapse, high pulmonary artery pressure etc. Stress and anxiety too can be a cause and so also gastric reflux. What is important is to find out whether you are breathless all the time or is it due to exertion. At times certain triggers can cause breathlessness like a visit to a dusty area, using the blower of a vacuum cleaner, visit to a garden with flowers, perfumes, sprays etc. This is a type of allergic asthma and avoiding allergens will help take care.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
