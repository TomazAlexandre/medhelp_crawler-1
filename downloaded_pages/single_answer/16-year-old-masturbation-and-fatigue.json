    "question": "Hi,I've masturbated for about 5-7 years. In that time the longest break I've had was 2 weeks. These days I am fatigued and mentally tired. Also over a month or so I suddenly gained like 20 lbs (153 ----> 173), I'm 5'7\". The weight is even harder to shake off; whatever I eat almost feels sensitive to my weight. I feel like I am losing my youngness (I know its not a word). When I exercise it also doesn't feel the same. I can't do things as good as I used to n need to push myself harder. After I workout I usually take like a day to feel somewhat rejuvenated. The supplements I take is Super B-Complex, D3 1000, and Zyrtec for allergies. Now I have taken precautions in not masturbating n I have been 2 days clean.What can I do to reverse these effects and enjoy the rest of my teen years while I still have them?",
