    "question": "Hello, I'm curious if someone can have slightly decreased blood sugar levels that can cause them to feel fatigued 24/7 (Similar to CFS). I noticed when i take a D-Ribose supplement my fatigue is diminished, cognition is back, and I'm \"normal\" ... but the effect only lasts for an hour or so after taking the D-Ribose. Does this mean I'm deficient in glucagon or have slightly high levels of insulin?Thank you!",
