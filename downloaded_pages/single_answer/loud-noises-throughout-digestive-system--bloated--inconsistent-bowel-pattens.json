            "answer": "Hi!You could be suffering from IBS or spastic colon Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, diabetes, food intolerance, malabsorption syndromes, constipation, gallbladder and liver problems, pancreatic dysfunction, or taking a diet rich in sulfites juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, red wine, mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough). It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor as soon as possible. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "For the past little while, I've been having mild cramps throughout my digestive system (stomach, bowels), and for the past month or two I have been having inconsistent bowel movements.At this very moment, I feel no cramping, nor do I need to have a bowel movement. I do, however, feel very bloated, and my intestines and stomach are making very loud noises. I feel more bloated in the lower right section of my abdomen, and my right leg is experiencing some mild numbness.I do not feel nauseous.I am a non-smoker, 18 years old, and have not had my appendix removed.",
