            "answer": "I am sorry to know about you. Your husband seems to be having many health problems at the same time. Healing after spinal fusion process takes time. It may take several months before the bone is solid, he should be taking proper care about how to move, sit, stand, and walk. His diabetes also needs to be controlled. May be he has become depressed after his illnesses and that is making him behave in this way. I think you should seek help from some outside source since he has become abusive and violent. Seek the opinion of a psychiatrist. He needs urgent psychiatric help. Medicines and counseling sessions will be helpful. Do keep us posted.Take care and good luck!",
