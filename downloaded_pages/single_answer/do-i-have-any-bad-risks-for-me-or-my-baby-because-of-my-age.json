            "answer": "Hi!Well, teen pregnancy, or pregnancy under the age of 20 years does pose some risk. There is an increased risk of low birth weight baby or of premature birth. A teen is at higher risk of pregnancy complications like high blood pressure, diabetes, and nutritional deficiencies.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it is very difficult to balance motherhood, home, education and job. A baby is a huge responsibility.However, if you take good care of yourself, eat healthy and on time, go for regular antenatal checkups at a mother and child clinic, and mentally prepare yourself for motherhood at such a young age, then you and your baby will be fine. However, you will need a lot of social, financial, family and emotional support in the coming few years to take care of your baby. Think this through and plan your future with your baby. Meanwhile take good care of yourself! All the best! Take care!",
