    "question": "Last sunday within seconds my eye lost vision in the upper half. It was like a shade or curtain came half way down.\u00a0\u00a0So i went to the emergency room at a hospital and saw a optamologist and he told me i have branched retinal artery occlusion. The only test he did was dilate my eyes with drops and looked in my left eye with a light.\u00a0\u00a0He told me to take a aspirin a day and he prescribed eye drops\u00a0\u00a0He did no further tests. Has anyone else out there had this happen to them\u00a0\u00a0I am 50 yrs old and everything I read about this says it is more common in 70 to 80 yr olds. He said within 90 days i will know if my vision will come back or not.\u00a0\u00a0I need to talk to someone who has had the same thing happen to them. If you can please help.",
