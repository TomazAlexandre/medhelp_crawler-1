            "answer": "Dear MonkeyWash,I would recommend that you seek the care of an eyeMD and undergo a complete eye examination including cycloplegic refraction [this is a refraction when drops are placed so you cannot strain your eyes], and Amsler grid testing.\u00a0\u00a0They should be able to advise you on the best course of action after this.Dr. FeldmanSandy T.

    "question": "Hello,Last year I had a routine eye exam for my myopia.\u00a0\u00a0My prescription in my left eye had changed 1 whole diopter.\u00a0\u00a0Last month when I went for a routine exam my left eye changed two diopters (-5.50 from -3.50) and is no longer correctable to 20/20 it is 20/40 at best.\u00a0\u00a0I was seen by a retinal specialist who found no retinal abnormalities or defects as a cause of my eyesight loss.\u00a0\u00a0His suggestion was for a diabetes test, of which I have had two in the last year.\u00a0\u00a0The tests were both normal and I have no family history of diabetes.Last week I noticed a fuzzy spot in my right eye's field of vision.\u00a0\u00a0I saw a different optometrist and now both eyes are 20/40 with best correction.\u00a0\u00a0He also did three visual field tests of which all came back 'not normal, and show a generalized decrease in sensitivity of the retina.'\u00a0\u00a0I had an MRI of my brain done and it came back with 'no acute abnormalities.'I am getting frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0It seems as though the spot in my right eye is growing worse.\u00a0\u00a0No one seems to be able to figure what exactly is wrong just that something's not right.\u00a0\u00a0I have an appointment with neurologist at the VA on Friday.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any other steps I should take, or tests to ask for?",
