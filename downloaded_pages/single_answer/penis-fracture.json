            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!If at all this was penile fracture, then surgery is the only treatment. The earlier the surgery is performed, the faster erectile function is restored.You could look at this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_fractureHowever this could be contusion to the penis. You are consulting an Urologist (?) I think, so a proper examination along with medical history can help.Meanwhile you can also go through: http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/impotence/Viagra is more helpful if cause is not structural like as in diabetes or effect of certain medications causing erection problems. I would strongly advice you not to try this without your doctor\u2019s permission.It is difficult to comment in this case but surgery appears to be the treatment of choice. However this is an opinion based only on the available facts. Penile implants also help in restoring erection. Also in some cases vascular surgeries are performed on the penis to restore the erectile function.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care! All the best!",

    "question": "I am certain that while having intercourse with my boyfriend that we fractured his penis.\u00a0\u00a0The entire shaft of his penis bruised shortly after and since then he has had a difficult time getting erections (which was never a problem before).\u00a0\u00a0I did not know at the time that this was possible.\u00a0\u00a0The other day he showed me that he has a hard nodule on the shaft of his penis near the site of injury.\u00a0\u00a0I am assuming this to be scar tissue which is affecting his ability to get erections. He has made an appointment to see a MD, but I am anxious to know what other treatment options are available to correct his erectile dysfunction since he did not go the the ER and surgery was not performed.\u00a0\u00a0Will a medication like Viagra work since the problem seems to be structural (because of the scar tissue)?\u00a0\u00a0Or will he have to get surgery?\u00a0\u00a0If he does have to have surgery what are the chances that it will correct the impotence?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
