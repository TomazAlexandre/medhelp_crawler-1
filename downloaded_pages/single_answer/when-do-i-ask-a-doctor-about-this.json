    "question": "Hello,I am a 54-year-old male diabetic. By way of background, I have a family history of Parkinson's. I also was diagnosed many years ago with chronic communicating hydrocephalus.I am in generally decent health, but have noticed over the past few months that I am having some coordination problems, especially when walking. I tend to trip a lot now...over sidewalk cracks and even over carpet seams. This is troublesome to me, since not long ago I was a marathon runner. I cannot run at all anymore due to the tripping.I am unsure how to approach this with my physician. I am not sure if this is a normal function of aging, or related to diabetes, or something more sinister like Parkinson's or ALS.",
