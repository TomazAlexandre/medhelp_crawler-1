            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.There are multiple causes for so called plaques or white matter changes in the brain. Most often, these are due to what is called \"chronic small vessel disease\", literally meaning diseased small vessels that supply blood flow to the brain. This is not an uncommon process in the brain and increases with age. This is not a disease in and of itself but rather is a reflection of unhealthy blood vessels, damaged by years of plaque build-up. This is most often due to a combination of several factors including the following: high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol. If these factors are well controlled, the damage to the brain can be stabilized and further damage prevented.Other causes of plaques in the brain can be migraine. People with migraine often have plaques on their MRI that are of unclear cause or significance. This may be the source of your MRI findings.I suggest you discuss your MRI findings with the ordering physician. Many times, different diagnoses can be rule out or in based on the MRI sequences.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "Findings: single small focus of signal abnormality noted in the left centrum semi oval. This is considered a chronic finding and may represent an old white matter lacunar infarction or very early changes of small vessel disease. A single demyelinating plaque cannot be completely excluded. The brain and ventricular system are otherwise normal and no cortical infarctions seen. There is no hemorrhage or mass identified. Minimal mucosal thickening is present in the anterior ethmoid air cell and frontal sinus.I have had horrible headaches for years and no one seems to be able to help me. If anyone can explain what my MRI means and sees a connection with my headaches, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks, melanie",
