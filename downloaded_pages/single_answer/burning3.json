            "answer": "Hi,How are you doing? Burning sensation in the palms could be due to damage to the nerves supplying that part. It is also called as peripheral neuropathy. What is your age? Diabetes is the most common cause for this to ccur.It can also be caused by inflammation of the arch of the foot, usually seen in athletes. Plantar fasciitis is the name that describes inflammation of the fibrous band of tissue that connects the heel to the toes. It can be treated with rest, applying ice packs, night splints, shoe inserts, cortisone injections etc. If conservative measures do not help surgery may be considered,which involves plantar fascia release.Meralgia paresthetica is a condition that can cause burning pain over the outside of the thigh. There is a nerve that passes just over the bony prominence of the pelvis and down the outside of the thigh. This nerve, called the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. If the cause is due to tight fitting clothing, belts, or work belts, then modifying these should alleviate your symptoms. If simple measures do not relieve your symptoms of meralgia paresthetica, then a cortisone injection around the nerve may be helpful.Consult your doctor regarding surgical treatment.All the best.",
