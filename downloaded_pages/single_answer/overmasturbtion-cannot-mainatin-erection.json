            "answer": "Hello,You are having erectile dysfunction. It can be due to negative feelings about non performance,smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal or neurological causes. But since you are having it during masturbation also, so it does not look psychological in nature. It looks due to any of the medical causes mentioned above.I suggest you to consult a urologist and get these causes explored.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "heres the deal. 22 years old, have never been able to hold an erection long enough to take me from foreplay to sex before losing it. I can get an erection most of the time. While technically I have had sex, it doesnt really count,as in I never came from sex. When ever i/partner stops stimulating my penis, it goes flacid within 5 seconds. I find this pretty messed up and its cost me many sexual expereinces. Failed every time I have tried, maybe 25-30? I guess I've been jerking it since 11 very consistently and watching alot of porn as well.recently went off porn and no longer masturbate. Have a gf who I try to have sex with, always fail so we just pretty much just pleasure each other in other ways. Im trying to keep the number of times I ejaculate per week to 2-3.kegels every other day about 75 flex reps, and 3 sets of a 30 sec hold. been doing kegels for a month maybe. Started doing other penis exercises like Jelq's. are these bad?tried all ED drugs (viagra, cialis) and they help nothing with the holding erection part I still lose erection when not stimulated. This is also messed up to me that these dont work.I'd like to think this isnt mental because the same thing happens when Im alone or with a girl, dont feel nervous at all when getting ready to have sex, I know this because I used to. Id get that feeling in my stomach/throat, heart would beat 200 times a sec ect, doesnt happen anymore tho.Whats wrong with me doc?",
