            "answer": "HiThis suggests a skin infection. It may be a bacterial skin infection or a fungal skin infection.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that you maintain good genital hygiene. When washing the genitals it is important to wash the area beneath the foreskin. I suggest that you have this assessed by your surgeon. You may need topical medications for this. In the presence of diabetes or intake of corticosteroids, then a fungal infection may be likely. However, you have not mentioned any associated disease conditions.Refrain from unnecessarily touching the area. Microscopic evaluation of the white discharge and culture of the discharge may be able to help ascertain the diagnosis.",
