            "answer": "Hello,This itching can be due to jock itch or due to neurodermatitis. What you need to do is consult a dermatologist and get a KOH examination of the skin scrapings of the scrotum and a biopsy of small skin sample done. KOH examination of the area will clarify whether it is fungal infection or not.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
