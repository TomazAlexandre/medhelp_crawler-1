            "answer": "From what I have read, it's most likely you have an inflammation in\u00a0\u00a0your body since your CRP is 11.8. CRP was the \"hot\" new marker for heart disease back in 2002-3.\u00a0\u00a0From what I have read, it seems to have fallen into disfavor as it really doesn't tell a doctor too much.\u00a0\u00a0If you CRP is high (>3 and <10) you have an increase risk for heart disease but you most likely will have other risk factors. The net effect is that it doesn't tell doctors too much.The PCOS, though,\u00a0\u00a0does appear to put you at higher risk of heart disease diabetes as you get older. The heart or diabetes problem won't develop tomorrow or the next day but more so as you hit your 40s and 50s.\u00a0\u00a0However, you can decrease your risk by controlling the PCOS sypmtons as well as watching your diet, stop smoking, exercising more, and loosing weight if you are overweight.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the advice about diet, stop smoking, exercising, and weight loss is the standard advice for everyone to reduce their chances for heart disease.Google PCOS and you will get alot of hits.

    "question": "Hello, I am a 22 year old female. I was just diagnosed with PCOS today. I met with my GP about my bloodwork. He said that my CRP levels are 4x what they should be. My levels were 11.8 and the normal range was 1-3. Does this mean I have random inflammation in my body, or specifically inflammation of my blood vessels? I also have very flucuating BP, one day it may be 112/76 and the next day it may be 156/105. The 11.8 CRP was taken on a day where my BP was 156/105, could my CRPs have been up just that day? With the high BP my vessels could have swelled? I am just wondering what I need to do and if I should be concerned? My GP didn't seem concerned with it, but I know it puts me at a high risk of heart problems!",
