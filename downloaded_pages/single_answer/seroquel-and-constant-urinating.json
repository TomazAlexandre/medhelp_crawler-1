            "answer": "Hi amber, I am taking seroquel for bipolar. I have noticed that I need to urinate in the night which I never did before but apart from that I have found that the drug has saved my life. We all react differently to drugs though so what suits me might not suit you..Have you noticed that your urine is an unusual colour? Is there any stinging or burning? Just to rule out a urine infection.Some people do unfortunately get diabetes from this drug but the risk is quite low. Weight gain is a side effect with this drug as it is with most drugs of this kind but again it varies from person to person, I haven't gained much weight at all and I take 400mg but with similar drugs I have been the size of a house. The thing is if the drug is helping you, can you put up with the side effects? The excessive urination might get better in time. I have found that seroquel has really calmed me down, but if its not right for you there are options. I am on a modified release form of seroquel and I don't get any side effects but I sleep brilliantly.I suggest that you see your doctor for advice, you really don't want to be worrying, so go and seek reassurance hun.hugs x",

    "question": "I started Seroquel this week for my anxiety/depression. Ever since, I've been needing to pee like every 10/20 mins, especially during the night.I read the symptoms and this is supposed to be an uncommon one. It also said it could lead to diabetes.Is this true? I really want it to help me so I don't want to stop taking it, but I'm afraid it's going to make me gain weight or something worse.",
