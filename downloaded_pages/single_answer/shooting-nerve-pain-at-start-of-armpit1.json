    "question": "shooting nerve pain at start of armpitTags: nerve pain, Stinging nerve painI've been getting a shooting nerve pain at start of my armpit which happens when I move or lean on my left arm. The pain goes from the armpit, down my arm to my fingers and a little into my chest. It's a stinging pain (nerve?) which really hurts, I have to put my arm into a different position to stop the sensation. My doctor thinks it might be arthritis in my shoulder. He gave me a muscle relaxer and percocit (?). I had them do an EKG, which turned out perfect. I am 41, diabetic, and overweight (5'9\" @ 250 lbs.) The pain really hurts. What else could it be? He mentioned something about Conn's disease in passing but I don't think so. I also get the stinging pain when I do semi-circles with my arms in exercise and I have to stop from the pain. What else could it be?",
