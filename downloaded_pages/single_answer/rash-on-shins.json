            "answer": "It's highly likely to be a fungal infection.\u00a0\u00a0And that being so, the creams that you have been using will have no effect.Make an appointment to see your doctor to get a skin swab taken of the area so that it can get sent off to the laboratory for analysis.For fungal infections, you require an antifungal cream that is used on the genitals.\u00a0\u00a0It may also be of benefit to take antifungal medications by mouth as well as the cream.\u00a0\u00a0In between an antifungal cream, you would also benefit from using a moisturising emollient.\u00a0\u00a0You can purchase all these from the pharmacy without a prescription, but I would advise you to see your doctor and get a swab done to find out first if this is a fungal injection.When you take a bath you can put in a handful or two of porridge oats and soak in that and no, it won't clog up your sink hole.\u00a0\u00a0Or, you can have a bath with a large cupful or 2 of Epsom Salts and soak in that.\u00a0\u00a0You will need to put in a few drops of baby oil because Epsom Salts is very drying.\u00a0\u00a0Epsom Salts neutralises the pH on your skin, that the bacteria and fungus does not like.\u00a0\u00a0You can purchase Epsom Salts for use in the bath on line.To get immediate relief from the itching, you can apply natural set yogurt to your washed (don't use normal soap) and gently dried skin.\u00a0\u00a0The yogurt will cool down the itching and reduce the inflammation on the skin.\u00a0\u00a0This home remedy can be used for as long as required.Do you have pre diabetes or diabetes?Taking antibiotics can encourage yeast overgrowth because the antibiotics kill of the good bacteria as well as the bad bacterial.\u00a0\u00a0If you are prone to getting fungal infections when taking antibiotics, ask your doctor to also prescribe an antifungal cream or capsules as well.Being overweight causes sweating and that can encourage yeast growth.\u00a0\u00a0Don't wear manmade fabrics because this can cause more sweating.\u00a0\u00a0Use cotton underpants, avoid wearing nylons.\u00a0\u00a0Wear loose clothing.Don't use normal soaps.\u00a0\u00a0Use non perfumed soaps, the ones that have the same pH level as our skin, baby washes should be fine too.\u00a0\u00a0You can purchase an emollient from the pharmacy that you can use instead of soap.\u00a0\u00a0This will not kill off any bacterial or fungus - you need the appropriate medications for that.\u00a0\u00a0Having broken skin when the spots are raw and bleed, is an entry for bacteria.Have a healthy and well balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables and cut our or cut down on your sugary, processed and junk foods.\u00a0\u00a0Cut out or cut down on your alcohol and fizzy drinks too.\u00a0\u00a0Drink more water.\u00a0\u00a02 litres a day is usually recommended, more if you sweat a lot.Make an appointment to see your doctor to get the correct diagnosis.Let me know how you get on.Best wishes.",

    "question": "I'm 45 years old, had a rash on both shins for about 3 mos.\u00a0\u00a0Never had something like this last so long...usually hydrocortisone cream (1%) works pretty quickly if I get a small patch of itchy tiny bumps.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried hyrdocortisone (twice per day) for over a month, and no help.\u00a0\u00a0If anything, it's spreading.\u00a0\u00a0Now trying my son's Elidel (for eczema), but still no change.Bumps are small, skin color or light pink, EXTREMELY itchy at times (but not all the time), they often then bleed (with or without itching them), and then the final (lovely) step is that they turn into purple-y scar-type things that are alarmingly dark when I'm cold.\u00a0\u00a0those don't itch, but do seem to take a long time to go away.Help!\u00a0\u00a0??",
