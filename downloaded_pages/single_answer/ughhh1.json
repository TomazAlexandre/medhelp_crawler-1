    "question": "Hi beautiful mommies! Im 31w1 day and I feel like I've hit a wall. I have gestational diabetes and ive been following the diet exactly and still my sugar is too high. for ex. I ate one slice of whole wheat bread and two turkey slices and that made my blood go up to 166. Its so frustrating .. my baby is almost 4pounds already and I dont want to harm her or myself. I have zero energy and cant sleep well so I feel im putting myself in a higher risk situation.\u00a0\u00a0I want my baby to be full term and I just dont know if I can hold on til oct 4th! Thanks for letting me vent !",
