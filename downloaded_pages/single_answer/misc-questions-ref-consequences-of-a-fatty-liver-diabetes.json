    "question": "I am a 59 year old, caucasion, woman who has enjoyed reasonably good health over the years.\u00a0\u00a0I am 5'1\" and weigh 135lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I have never drank alcohol nor smoked any tobacco products.\u00a0\u00a0I exercise by walking 2 1/2 - 3 miles 4 times a week and eat a fairly well varied diet which includes vegetables and fruit.However, two years ago I was diagnosed with a hypo-thyroid -- this is being controlled with Levoxyl, 0.125mg once a day.\u00a0\u00a0A short time later, I learned that I have Type II diabetes and am currently taking 2 Glipizide, 5mg, tablets twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0I also learned, at the same time, that I had high cholesterol which is controlled with Lipitor, 20mg once a day.\u00a0\u00a0Other medications that I take daily are Vioxx, 25mg once a day; and Prem/Pro 0.625/2.5mg once a day.Right about the same time that I learned about the diabetes, I learned that my liver enzymes were high.\u00a0\u00a0After several blood tests and a sonogram, I was told that I have a fatty liver, or otherwise referred to as Steato Hepatitus.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor that gave me that diagnosis has left my area.\u00a0\u00a0A new doctor who had not read my records, and hasn't reviewed my test results for this condition, told me that I have NASH.\u00a0\u00a0Are these two diagnosis the same?\u00a0\u00a0If not what is the difference.I have been having difficulty bringing my blood sugar down, it's in the 135-145 range after sleeping and fasting for 8 to 10 hours.\u00a0\u00a0My General Medicine Physician has suggested that I take Glucophage in addition to the Glipizide for better control.\u00a0\u00a0I have read in several sources that Glucophage can have a negative affect on the liver.\u00a0\u00a0Is this true?\u00a0\u00a0I have opted not to take Glucophage at this time.Does a fatty liver decrease life expectancy?\u00a0\u00a0Is this condition reversable?\u00a0\u00a0If so, what do I need to do to reverse it?\u00a0\u00a0Are any of the medications that I am currently taking detrimental to the fatty liver condition?\u00a0\u00a0I am told that a fatty liver can turn into cirrhosis of the liver... how long does it take to go from one end of the spectrum to the other?As you can probably tell, I have a lot of anxiety about my health due to the fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0I am especially fearful about introducing new medications.I realize that much of my fear is due to a lack of education on this topic, but I cannot seam to get the answeres from my own physicians.\u00a0\u00a0Any help that you can afford me is truly appreciated.",
