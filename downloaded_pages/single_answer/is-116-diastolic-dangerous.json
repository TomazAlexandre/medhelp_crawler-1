            "answer": "A diastolic reading of 116 is considered to be stage 1 hypertension and should be treated. If you have not seen you doctor, you should. Having said that, using a wrist monitor can be tricky. I use one myself so I know how sensitive they are. In order to get a proper reading with a wrist monitor, it must be positioned directly above your heart. If it is low or high you will get a false reading. If you are using it correctly then you should take it with you when you visit your doctor next time to make sure it is accurate.High diastolic BP can be due to being overweight, having a diet high in fats and cholesterol, smoking, alcohol use, stress, depression and diabetes. You should work with your doctor to find the undelying cause of your diastolic hypertension.I hope this helps,Jon",
