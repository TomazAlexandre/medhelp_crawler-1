            "answer": "I am not a doctor, but have come across something like this before.Below is useful information for you to get your skin better.I know that you are shy and have a problem with seeing a doctor, but sorry, you do need to see one - the sooner the better.\u00a0\u00a0You could also book in to see a dermatologist or ask your doctor to refer you to one.The doctor should take a swab of all the skin area that is bothering you and this would be sent to a laboratory for analysis.\u00a0\u00a0The lab analysis would be able to identify the bacteria, virus and fungus that is on your skin that is causing the skin problem.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor will then be able to treat your skin condition much better knowing what he was dealing with.At home, do NOT use normal soap.\u00a0\u00a0Only use soap that has no perfume, one that has the same pH level as our skin and baby washes should be fine. Don't use bath or shower gels.\u00a0\u00a0 You can also buy from the pharmacy without a prescription an emollient that can be used instead of soap.The normal soap and the bath and shower gels will dry your skin out even more.Don't us biological washing detergents to wash your clothes.\u00a0\u00a0Use non biological ones.It is highly likely that you have a very bad fungal infection and probably a bacterial one too.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor would be able to prescribe antifungal medications in capsule form that you swallow.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor can prescribe a stronger dose and a longer course of the antifungal than what you can purchase from the pharmacy without a prescription.\u00a0\u00a0The antifungal medication that is in capsule form and is sold as a single dose is 100mg of Fluconazole.\u00a0\u00a0You may be able to get a 200mg strength.\u00a0\u00a0But even that may not be enough with you having such a large area of problem skin and the fact that you have had it for some time.You can also purchase from the pharmacy without a prescription an antifungal cream that is used specifically on the skin and on the genitals.You would also need a lubricating oil that will give back the moisture that is lost in your skin.\u00a0\u00a0Emollin is a fine spray that is used for that purpose.\u00a0\u00a0As the cream may be painful for you to apply, ask your pharmacist if he has an antifungal that comes as a spray.\u00a0\u00a0In the UK Canesten is available in a little spray bottle.\u00a0\u00a0You may or may not be able to get the Emollin and the Canesten spray from the pharmacy without a prescription.The doctor can also prescribe a bath solution - Dermol 600 - this is an antimicrobial solution that you pour as directed into your bath water.\u00a0\u00a0It may be available with or without a prescription, you would need to ask the pharmacist.As a home remedy, after you have washed yourself with water and gently dried the skin, you can apply natural set yogurt.\u00a0\u00a0You can do this for as long as you need to.\u00a0\u00a0It is very cooling and draws out inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0It is also a natural antifungal.Don't wear tight clothing and don't wear manmade fabrics.\u00a0\u00a0Wear cotton underpants.\u00a0\u00a0Manmade fabrics make you sweat more and this encourages fungal growth.Make sure that you have a healthy and well balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, lean meat and fish, cheese, milk, natural yogurt.\u00a0\u00a0Drink plenty of fluids and especially water. 2 litres a day is usually recommended, more if you sweat a lot.Cut out or cut down on sugary, processed and junk foods.\u00a0\u00a0Fungus loves sugar.\u00a0\u00a0 Eating natural yogurt will also help against fungal problems.Buy a big box or tub of Epsom Salts - you can purchase this from the web. Take a bath with 2 or more large cups full of the Epsom Salts dissolved in the bath water.\u00a0\u00a0Put a few drops of baby oil or coconut oil - not too much otherwise you will be slipping and sliding in the bath.\u00a0\u00a0You do need the oil because Epsom Salts on their own are very drying to the skin.Epsom Salts neutralises the pH level of the skin and the bacteria and fungus does not like this.\u00a0\u00a0Have the baths every day until the condition starts to get better, and then decrease the baths that you take, but do shower with water every day.Epsom Salts also contains magnesium and this is absorbed through the skin.\u00a0\u00a0This is a good thing.Try also applying coconut oil into the skin.\u00a0\u00a0Use the virgin coconut oil.\u00a0\u00a0Coconut oil is an antibacterial as well as an antifungal.\u00a0\u00a0It can be used for many things and can also be used to cook with and to eat off the spoon.\u00a0\u00a0It is a trans fat, so you would still need to limit the amount that you eat.\u00a0\u00a0Coconut oil is the only oil that does not change its composition when heated.As you have lumps that are painful, this may be an infected cyst or boil and you would need an antibiotic for this.\u00a0\u00a0If you neglect this, the infection can spread into your body and make you very ill.Your doctor should also take a blood test to check your HbA1C levels.\u00a0\u00a0This is to check if you have pre diabetes or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A glucose test would be better to check if you have glucose intolerance, pre diabetes or diabetes.Having glucose intolerance, pre diabetes or diabetes can cause these types of skin problems.You do not have anything that the doctor has not seen, so don't think about it.\u00a0\u00a0Make an urgent appointment and get the appropriate medical attention and the appropriate medications.\u00a0\u00a0If you do nothing, it will continue and fester and it is not very pleasant as well as being painful as you already know.Let me know how you get on.Best wishes.",
