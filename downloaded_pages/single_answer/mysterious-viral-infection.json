            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Tests should be scheduled for diabetes, thyroid problems, Vit B12 level, iron levels, Vit D levels, serum electrolytes, etc as all can cause peripheral neuropathies and all the symptoms you are having. Testosterone level should also be tested. The symptoms, \u2018painful sore throat with fever blisters on the uvala, extreme fatigue, lack of hunger and thirst, strange taste in my mouth\u2019 could be due to gastric reflux even though the endoscopy is negative. Take a late night snack. Raise head end of bed. Take Omeprazole empty stomach in morning and an antacid gel at bedtime. Refrain from smoking, alcohol, fuzzy drinks, caffeine, and spicy food. Hope these tips help. Throat swab should be taken to rule out EBV or mono and streptococcal infection.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Suffering from a painful sore throat with fever blisters on the uvala,extreme fatigue,lack of hunger and thirst,strange taste in my mouth,cognitive issues, stomack pain, muscle twitching and weakness, painful joints, Periphial Nureprothy, and erectile dysfunction.... all symptoms seem to be getting worse. Going on for 6 months now. STD and Lyme disease tests were negative. How long do I have to put up with this nonsense? I'm seeing a shrink and trying my best to intergate my old life back into my schedual but lathargy and foot pain,and weakness stops me in my tracks. Got an mri,an endoscopy,and an emg. nothing alarmed anybody. What's my next step? Went to the ER on two occassions both times they said i had viral syndrome told me to tough it out and sent me home.I\u00a0\u00a0WISH THIS CAN BE IDENTIFIED BEFORE MY FACULTIES AND PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS TAKE THEIR TOLL. Any suggesstion would help.",
