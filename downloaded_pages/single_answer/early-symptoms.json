    "question": "My 70 y/o mother recently began experiencing very slight resting bilateral hand and foot tremors after extraction of an abscessed molar 2 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0I only found this out from my father only a few days ago and upon observation, noticed she has been keeping her hands together when at rest, but does not exhibit any shaking when active (lifting a glass, dialing phone, etc).\u00a0\u00a0I also noticed a very very slight tremor of her head, but am uncertain if I what I witnessed was normal movement that I misconceived as tremor b/c I was looking for it.Her recent blood work was absolutely excellent.\u00a0\u00a0Her and my father are retired, but very active hobby farmers constantly performing chores and doing things together.\u00a0\u00a0Stress level appears to be what I'd consider \"normal\".\u00a0\u00a0She's ~30+ lbs overweight though and is medicated for irregular heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0No family history of diabetes, Parkinson's, etcI'm worried about this recent change and am seeking information as to potential causes.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be attributed to toxins from tooth extraction or indicative of early onset Parkinson's, diabetes, hyperthyroidism???\u00a0\u00a0Both parents are extremely stubborn and will not go to the Dr. until symptoms are fully manifested or they are in too much pain to bear.\u00a0\u00a0I want to catch this early on if possible and head down the correct path.Appreciate any advice you may be willing to offer.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
