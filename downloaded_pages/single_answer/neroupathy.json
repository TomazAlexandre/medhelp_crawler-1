            "answer": "Hi Heter, sorry about the neuropathy. I do understand there are some things to treat it and so I would consult with your endo. But yes, it is caused by high blood sugar over a prolonged period of time (You don't say how long you've been Type 1). What I do want to say is that studies show that diabetic complications begin with blood sugars over 140 so you should look at that more as a limit to strive for rather than 200. Good luck with you on finding treatment for your neuropathy. I do know it makes it important to care for and regularly inspect your feet because you can have damage, sores, etc and not realize it due to numbness.Zoe",
