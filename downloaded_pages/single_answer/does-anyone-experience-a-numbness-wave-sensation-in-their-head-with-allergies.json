            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Sometimes migraines can cause these odd sensations without an actual headache. If you have blurring of vision, nausea and see some light flashes it could most probably be due to a migraine. The numbness could also be due to neuropathy. It is a disorder of the nerves which causes numbness, tingling, unusual sensations and sometimes pain. Diabetes Mellitus can cause neuropathy. Other causes like vitamin deficiencies, alcohol consumption and certain medications can cause neuropathy. Nerve Conduction studies will help to rule out neuropathy. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
