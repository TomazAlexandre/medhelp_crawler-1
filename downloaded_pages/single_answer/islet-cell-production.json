    "question": "From what I've learned, the cause of diabetes is autoimmune based, attacking your islet cells which produce insulin. Something along these lines at least.Now I am wondering am I, as a diabetic, still creating new islet cells that are being destroyed as they are made? Or have I just stopped creating them all together? And if the former is true, what sort of effect would anti-rejection pills have in this situation?",
