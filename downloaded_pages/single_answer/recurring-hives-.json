    "question": "Ok, this is long so I will TRY to make it short. About 7 yearss ago I started with eczema...I have had asthma/hayfever since I was like 7. I am now 30. I have major hives that are mostly on my stomach, axilla and underarms, back of knees, and face. The face ones just started . The ones on the backs of my knees itch/burn so bad and they make the back of the knee swell like there are grape clusters there for about ahalf hour then go down. Anyhow, doc put me on prednisone + Allegra and said to call if they come back as they shouldn't (so she said)...well here I am 3 days after the prednisone and starting to icth like heck again! Also, I am VERY tired all the time and have dark circles under my eyes. Aslo, the doc thought I had pre-diabetes years ago, but the blood sugars have been fairily good...mayb a handful of 160's+ and lows of 50s. Then, she thought I had thyroid disease and I am on Syntrhoid for that. UGH I am so tired of all this tiredness and itching! HELP please!\u00a0\u00a0Oh, I have also been getting canker sores in my mouth and nose the last few months. I go back to see her tomorrow so who knows what happens then. She said we would do further testing if they came back (which they weren't supposed to). HAHA",
