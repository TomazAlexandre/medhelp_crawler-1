            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The numbness in thumb area and forearm is probably due to cervical nerve compression especially C-6 and may not have anything to do with abdominal numbness which may be due to compression of thoracic spinal nerves. A multiple vertebral pathology, costochondritis and peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes and hypothyroidism should be looked into.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "One week ago I experienced dull abdominal pain midline at the base of my sternum.\u00a0\u00a0On the third day, the pain decreased, but I noticed numbness over my gall bladder area and on my back directly behind my gallbladder.\u00a0\u00a0No other GI symptoms. One week later, my right thumb went numb and numbness radiates about halfway up my forearm along\u00a0\u00a0the radial side.\u00a0\u00a0I saw my Dr. the next day and had a GB U/S last Thursday, which was normal. I do not have my bloodwork results back yet.\u00a0\u00a0I know a HIDA scan would be the next step, but the numbness issue has me and my Dr. both a bit stumped.\u00a0\u00a0I have not found any info on the net addressing the numbness issue.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas or input would be appreciated as we try to figure this out!",
