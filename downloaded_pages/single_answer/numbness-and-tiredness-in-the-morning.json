            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!If only your hands are numb after sleep, it could be due to poor posture during sleep. Try to change the position in which you sleep. Also get a proper sleep study done if you are tired after a night\u2019s sleep. Chances are that you are not sleeping properly. Rule out hypothyroidism and diabetes. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Every morning I wake up and my hands are numb and I feel real tired and have this overwhelming feeling that I am dieing. My doctor has me on Xanax 1mg twice a day. I have tried therapy and bio-feedback, but nothing has helped. I can't take antidepressants because I have terrible side effects from them. Is this numbness, tiredness, and overwhelming feeling of death due to anxiety ?",
