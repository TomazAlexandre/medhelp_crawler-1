            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Fatigue that has lasted for so long could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism (ruled out in your case) or due to liver problems.Since you are also over weight, check out for diabetes and hypothyroidism. Severe anemia too causes water retention and weight gain. Both serum iron and hemoglobin should be checked. See if both were done. In women polycystic disease of the ovary too should be ruled out as it causes insulin resistance and fatigue.Another possibility is sleep disturbances which is possible even after a seemingly good sleep. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello,I was hoping someone could give me some advice. I am a 25 year old female. I exercise regularly, do not smoke, get 9-10 hours of sleep every night, barely drink. I've had anxiety in the past but that is really my only health condition. For the past couple years or so, I've been so tired to the point that it interferes with daily activities. I sleep long and well every night but still feel so fatigued the next day. I run everyday hoping it will wake me up, and it does for about an hour and then i'm back to tired. My brain always feels foggy...when I'm talking to people it's hard to process and pay attention to what they're saying.Other symptoms I am having are: dull headaches, always thirsty, always cold, inability to tolerate alcohol. (I used to be able to, but now I get bad hangovers for one or two drinks). I've had bloodwork done and the doctor ruled out thyroid disease, anemia and mono... and was quick to dissmiss it as anxiety/depression. However, I know my body and I just feel like it's not in my head and something isn't right. If someone has any suggestions...or any natural remedies for extreme fatigue (i'd rather be on natural medications rather than prescription) I would really appreciate any help! Thank you!",
