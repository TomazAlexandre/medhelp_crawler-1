    "question": "My 17 yr old son has had a high systolic pressure. It has been about 143/66. He is extremely active...playing football, baseball, yoga etc. He works out everyday with his varsity teams and is generally in very good health!! He recently went to a San Diego Charger health clinic with his high school football team and they told him his pressure was high and that his blood sugar was high. (he just told me that today). Could high blood sugar cause this high systolic pressure and should I be worried. Is this something that should be checked right away? I would appreciate any input. Thank you, Hadley",
