            "answer": "Hi,It is always a great idea to see your doctor.Can you quantify your urine output? More than a gallon of fluid per day seems pretty adequate but it is surprising that some of your other symptoms appear to implicate dehydration.Any problems with your shoes feeling too tight? Are your feet getting swollen? Face getting swollen?Any particular problems with headaches, visual field problems (blindness in the periphery or the visual fields on your sides) ? A pituitary problem may account for excess fluid loss through urine.There are a number of things to consider here, but it would be best to undergo some tests. The kidney, while being a remarkable organ for recovery may be irreparably injured if these symptoms persist. If the problem is largely due to metabolic imbalance like diabetes \u2013 the condition could worsen to emergency status.Again, best see your doctor. You may consider altering your diet as well to improve on the constipation by taking more leafy vegetables, grains, cereals.Stay positive.",
