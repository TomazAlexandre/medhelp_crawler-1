    "question": "Last September I was ill with peumonia (treated with 3 weeks worth of erythromycin).\u00a0\u00a0 During the third week I saw my doctir because I was becoming very thirsty, had lower back pain and was very tired.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since then, the problems have remained (i.e. drinking up to 12 pints a day).\u00a0\u00a0 I have been tested for Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetes Insipidus (negative) but have been found to have Haemochromatosis.I have, however, been on Zoton since September 96 and I note from the documentation that it can cause certain side-effects all of which are covered by the problems I currently have.Is there a source of information about Zoton's possible side-effects and how would I go about finding out whether Zoton is causing the symptoms from which I suffer?Dear Bill Mac,I could not find the generic name for the medication Zoton. If this is a medicine being taken out of the United States it would be helpful if you could provide us with the generic name.HFHSM.D.-ym",
