            "answer": "HI,Depletion of hormones after menopause can cause a lot of symptoms, but this can be dealt with a positive attitude and some medical help. HRT hormone replacement therapy is suitable for women who do not have medical conditions like cardiac problems or hypertension and diabetes. HRT can be a combination of estrogens and progesterone or progesterone alone \u2013 if you are averse to taking estrogens. It can be in the form of patches, oral tablets or vaginal creams.Another option is Natural Hormone replacement therapy, also called bio-identical hormone therapy (BHT). Also you can consider a diet with phyto-oestrogenic foods such as tofu, legumes, and add more calcium, vitamin D, flaxseed and black cohosh.The answer is based on information provided. Exact advice is not possible without a proper examination and investigations. You are requested to consult your Doctor. Take care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am a 52 year old woman, who had a total hysterectomy 2 years ago. This may sound stupid but I did not know my ovaries were going to be removed. It was a total surprise to me and I was very distraught. When I woke up from the surgery and they ask me how I felt, the first thing I said was I feel odd, like something is not right.\u00a0\u00a0I did not find out my ovaries were removed until about 8 weeks later. I was having a nervous breakdown and ask the doctor to check my hormones. he said you don't have any. Now I am faced with trying to regulate my body chemistry. It has been horrible. For over a year I felt like I was going crazy. I have gained weight. I am taking Estrogen shots once every 3 weeks. But I bought some Black Cohosh and some progestin cream so I think Im going to try that. If I don't feel a whole lot better Im going back to the doctor and see if he can help me feel better. I don't like taking the shots because of the health risk.t I must also consider quality of life. I do feel better in the last 6 months. The brain fog disappeared, I don't feel crazy. I just don't feel as good as I did before the surgery and Im convinced it has to do with getting your hormones properly regulated. One more thing, my hair is much thinner than it was, so Im fighting that battle also. Does anyone have\u00a0\u00a0any suggestions that would help with my plight?",
