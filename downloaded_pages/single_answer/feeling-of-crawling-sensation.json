            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Skin crawling sensation can be seen in people who are very anxious and stressed out. Very dry skin and disorders of thyroid gland all can precipitate a crawling sensation. The other possibility is Morgellons disease often mimics scabies. The disease is believed to be caused by weak immune systems in people that have contracted the tick-borne Lyme Disease at some point in their life. It can also be a fungal infection like Tinea corporis.It can also be peripheral neuropathy. Also check and see if you have diabetes. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
