            "answer": "Hello,You need to take the treatment for PCOS. If you desire birth control, the birth control pill, especially those with low androgenic (male hormone-like) side effects can cause regular periods and prevent the risk of uterine cancer. Another option is intermittent therapy with the hormone progesterone. For acne or excess hair growth, a water pill (diuretic) called spironolactone (Aldactone) may be prescribed by the physician under monitoring of potassium levels and kidney function. Glucophage affects the action of insulin and is useful in reducing a number of the symptoms and complications of PCOS and also useful in the management of irregular periods, ovulation induction, weight loss, prevention of type 2 diabetes, and prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus in women with PCOS. Weight loss can help reduce or prevent many of the complications associated with PCOS.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
