    "question": "Being that I suffered from a kidney stone this past January, this article caught my eye.

This is what could result if we don't keep in check of the salty snacks, crackers/chips, and fast food we may give our children(besides the obvious obesity and diabetes).http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/health/28kidn.html?_r=1&em&oref=slogin",
