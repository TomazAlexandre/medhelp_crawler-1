            "answer": "Hello,Such stinging or burning pain can be due to parasthesia due to rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve. In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Can eczema cause my skin to sting for seconds or minutes then disappear. The front of my thighs will burn bad, like a sunburn feeling then the pain will just go away. This usually happens when I am sitting down relaxing. This has happened when standing but not often. When I apply a moisturizer it stings bad. But the skin does not look dry. There is no rash and it never itches.The same feeling happens on the top of my left foot.I went to a podiatrist and he didn't have any idea. I have heel spurs but he insists they can't cause pain on the top of the foot.",
