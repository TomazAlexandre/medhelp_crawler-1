    "question": "I was on Abilify and Cymbalta for awhile and gained 65 lbs taking them even though my eating habits did not change much.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor wants me to take Geodon because it has less weight gain side effects.\u00a0\u00a0I agreed to try it.\u00a0\u00a0But once I got it home and read about all the side effects I am afraid to take it.\u00a0\u00a0What scares me most is the warning about involuntary muscle movements in the face becoming permanent and possibly causing diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes runs in my family so the Geodon is probably NOT a good drug for me.\u00a0\u00a0So I have been lying to my doctor and telling him I am taking the Geodon, only I don't because I am afraid to take it.\u00a0\u00a0Basically, I have just been taking Trazodone that helps my depression.\u00a0\u00a0So as I am not on any medicine for anxiety, and psycho, I have been having a lot of anger and bad moods all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I find it hard to get along with people and I am constantly attacking people verbally starting fights and picking on people.\u00a0\u00a0I also wake up in a bad mood every day.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any medicine that would help this that doesn't cause weight gain or diabetes?",
