            "answer": "There are no doctors on this forum.\"the doctor refused to tell us further about the causes of the pimples growth but as he told, the pimples growth is actually related with his diabetes problem\" Run from this doctor as fast you can. Any doctor who refuses to explain health issues to a patient and then puts blame on non standing facts is a quack. Your brother needs to see a Dermatologist for his pimples. Try posting next door on the Ask a Doctor forum under Dermatology. Have you looked for bed bugs?",
