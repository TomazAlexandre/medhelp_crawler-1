            "answer": "Hi,Hope you are feeling better.It is important to find out the cause of neuropathy in your case. Diabetes and B12 deficiency are the common causes which should be ruled out first. There are motor and sensory nerves. Stimulation of motor nerve results in muscle contraction while sensory nerves carry sensory information like pain, touch, pin *****, heat and cold sensations to the brain.At this point it is difficult to tell if the sensory defect will be progressive or not as the cause has not been identified as yet.",
