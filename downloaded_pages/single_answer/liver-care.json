I started gettingdizzy spells within the first 2 days so I read the precautions and it said notto take it if I have liver problems. Something about Lactic Acidosis and how itcould\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0me.What can I take that is safe for my diabetes?Also what can I take for aches & pains that won't hurt my liver?Tylenol, Ibuprofen, OK?_________________________Dear Bob,It is difficult to advise you as to an oral medicine for diabetes that would be 100% safe for your liver.\u00a0\u00a0In general, liver toxicity due to drugs is rare and for the most part would have nothing to do with the fact you have hepatitis c.\u00a0\u00a0The risk of any medication to the liver is more dependent on the degree of liver damage that you have rather than the cause of your liver disease.I would suggest that treating your diabetes is important and you should find a medication, with the help of your physician, that controls your blood sugar and has tolerable side effects.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest he/she monitor your liver functions periodically while on the medication to watch for any possible side effects to the liver.As far as pain medication goes, anything you take in moderation is likely OK.\u00a0\u00a0If you have to take something several times a day for longer than a day, you need to talk to your physician because Tylenol or Motrin could begin to do damage if taken in large quantities.\u00a0\u00a0Ultram may be a good choice as it is relatively safe for the liver and kidneys.This information is presented for educational purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Always consult your physician for specific medical issues.HFHSM.D.-kb*keywords: hepatitis, diabetes mellitus0.2",
