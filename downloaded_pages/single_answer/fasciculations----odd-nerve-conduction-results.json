    "question": "I'm a bit worried about twitching symptoms.I'm male, 49, thin, eat well, exercise regularly (run around 25-30 km / week).Starting a 1.5 yrs ago, I noticed fasciculations in my lower legs and feet. They seem to be in all muscles below the knee. They are constant, several/second. Two additional symptoms over the last year and a half: general fatigue, and I feel increasingly \"sluggish\" when I run. It's a dramatic change, like I've suddenly aged 20 years. But I haven't lost any strength.Ruled out:- Thyroid problems.- Diabetes.- Lyme disease (well, mostly ruled out, I had low IgG levels, but my IgM were 36 (reference: <22). The doctors said it seems like a false positive, but they're redoing the test.I just had a nerve conduction test done. I'm in Sweden, for a variety of reasons I can't get the results interpreted for another month. I got the raw numbers though. So here's my question.All the \"N tibialis - med abd hall\" numbers looked fine, on both sides. (And they were very nearly symmetrical, although the \"fossa poplitea - med mall\" ampl was 6.5 mV on the right, 12.5 mV on the left.)But the numbers for the N peroneus were slightly above (and in one case near) the max values given.Here are the numbers:N peroneus - m ext dig br(latency | speed | ampl)R: prox om caput fib -- distal:\u00a0\u00a0NA | 47\t| 2.0L: prox om caput fib -- distal:\u00a0\u00a0NA | 53\t| 3.3Normal values: \t\tNA |\t40| NA (max lat | min speed | min ampl)R: dist om caput fib -- heel\tNA |\t45\t| 2.1L: dist om caput fib -- heel \tNA |\t51\t| 3.1Normal values:\t\"\"R: heel\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5.0 | \tNA |\t3.1L: heel\t 5.2 | \tNA | \t4.7Normal values:\t5.3 \tNA\t2R: F-response\t45.4 |\t ampl-quotient: |\u00a0\u00a065%L: F-response\t54.0*\u00a0\u00a0|\tampl-quotient: |\u00a0\u00a070%Normal values: 53\t| NA | NAR: F-M-latency\t40.4\t| F resp % |\t45L: F-M-latency\t48.8* | F resp % |\t80Normal values: 48 |\tF-percentage | NAThe starred values are what I'm wondering about. What might they mean? Should I be worried?Thanks!",
