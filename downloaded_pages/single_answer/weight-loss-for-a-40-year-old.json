            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Weight loss if obese is very important, because obesity can trigger a lot of serious medical conditions like diabetes, arthritis, hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart attacks, strokes, sleep apnea syndrome, hormonal imbalance, PCOD etc.It is important to see a nutrition specialist, because they would calculate the BMI, and according to that they will plan the number of kilos you need to reduce. Also the calorie intake should be taken into account depending upon the amount of physical work you routinely do in a day.It is not advised to randomly cut down on food, as this could lead to serious consequences. A diet should be planned with less carbohydrates and fat with more proteins. On an average 2-3 kilos should be reduced per month, not more than that. You should start off with moderate exercise, but this should be planned by your fitness expert.I would suggest that you take an opinion of a nutritionist and a fitness expert and follow their advise.Best.",
