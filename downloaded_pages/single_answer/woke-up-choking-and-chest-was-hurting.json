            "answer": "Your description suggests that you may be having regurgitation of food from your stomach into your esophagus.\u00a0\u00a0This truly is scary.This condition, Gastroesophageal reflux disease, (GERD)is a common condition in people of all ages.\u00a0\u00a0The reflux in a sub-set of these individuals may be associated with a condition called Gastric paresis (paralysis of the stomach with delayed emptying of the stomach into the small intestine).\u00a0\u00a0There are many causes of this condition, the disease most often associated with it being Diabetes Mellitus.Food regurgitated into the esophagus (swallowing tube) can then be aspirated into the lungs and this is more likely to happen when a person is asleep and/or supine than when awake and erect.\u00a0\u00a0Thus it can sometimes be avoided by not going to sleep, soon after meals.My advice is that you seek consultation with a specialist, a gastroenterologist, one capable of evaluating your swallowing and stomach function.\u00a0\u00a0This is a serious condition that could result in pneumonia or asphyxiation and should not be ignored.Good luck",
