            "answer": "As I understand the designation of \"optician\" in UK its the USA equivalent of \"optometrist\" and that an Ophthalmologist EYE MD in UK is called a \"specialist\".That being the case I think she needs to see an ophthalmologist.In general \"tortuous blood vessels\" makes you consider: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking and lastly by exclusion \"abnormal variant without underlying disease\"JCH MD",

    "question": "My 81 yr old Mom visited optician today and was diagnosed as \" early cataract ?rm?rh (writing not very clear), likely tortous blood vessels\" and was advised to attend ED today or tomorrow. This was just a routine eye test, no symptoms/complaints.Generally very healthy, on Tenoretic for mild hypertension.She had a bad hospital experience in the past and is not very anxious to attend again, actually refuses! I'm just wondering if I should try to persuade her to attend or what are the long term consequences? She has been perfectly healthy up to this and I'm wondering if she were to go ahead with ? treatment, will it actually benefit her. I would greatly appreciate any advice and any info on what treatment might be,Many Thanks,Mimi Dunworth",
