            "answer": "Todd,the fact that your not losing weight is a good sign. Black, maroon stools should be investigated. If you had a barium enema and it came out negative then this is good as it is a good procedure to detect colon cancer. Black, tarry stools could be attributed to ulcers or other upper GI bleeding. The endoscope will be a good idea to explore your upper GI to see if there is anything going on.",
