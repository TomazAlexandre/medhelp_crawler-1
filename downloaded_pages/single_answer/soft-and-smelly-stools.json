    "question": "I am a type 2 diabetic who takes insulin 4 times a day, Apidra and Lantus.\u00a0\u00a0For the last couple of weeks I have had very soft stools, some bloating and abdominal pain (which is not there all the time).\u00a0\u00a0The fact that the stools are so soft has resulted in some irritation and burning around the anal area and it is a strain to pass stools. My stomach seems to be very unsettled and makes \"noises\".\u00a0\u00a0I think I may have IBS.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking some probiotics which I started taking 2 days ago.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone suggest what the cause of this is and what I should do about it. Is this possibly as a result of the diabetes?",
