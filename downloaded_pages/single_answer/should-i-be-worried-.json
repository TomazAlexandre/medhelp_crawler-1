    "question": "I went in for my diabetes test yesterday.. (I'm 27 weeks) as I was getting all checked up my doctor said I'm measuring small like im 24 weeks. I've always been a petite girl, 97 pounds pre pregnancy and 5'3. But her heartbeat is great and I'm gaining weight just fine. Should I be worried, Or is it just because I'm small myself? Have any other moms on here measured to small as well?",
