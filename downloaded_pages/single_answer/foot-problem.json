    "question": "For the past year I have had burning, tingling sensations in both (always both) feet in the region of the toes, during the day and when resting,. I also get a sensation like tightening around my toes. These symptoms are so strong that they stop me from fallling asleep at night. They only occur at the front in the toe area and under the top part of the foot. No pain in the heels. I don't have diabetes. Could it be the Guillian Barre syndrom, or the tarsal tunnel syndrome. Any help will be welcome",
