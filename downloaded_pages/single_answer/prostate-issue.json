            "answer": "Thanks for your question.\u00a0\u00a0Your symptoms are fairly non-specific and it is not possible for me to offer an exact diagnosis without a full work-up. A few possibilities could be prostatitis, external or internal hemorrhoids. These symptoms may also be related to other conditions such as diabetes or cardio-vascular disease.\u00a0\u00a0A visit to a urologist may prove to be helpful.Prostatitis is the most common urologic diagnosis in men younger than 50 years.\u00a0\u00a0Prostatitis can range in its severity and level of bother to a patient.\u00a0\u00a0Although prostatitis may have more than one etiology, it is often considered bacterial until proven otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0There are three major categories of Prostatitis, but it is easier to think of them as two; acute and chronic.Acute Prostatitis is characterized by an acute onset of pain combined with frequent urination as well as difficulty in initiation of urination in a patient with fever/ chills and/ or achy joints. Patients typically complain of urinary frequency, urgency, and pain with urinating. Patients often also complain of pain in the groin, buttocks lower abdomen may have associated pain the genitalia. Symptoms can range in severity but they can be vague and non-specific.Chronic bacterial prostatitis is characterized by repeated episodes similar to acute prostatitis that come and go.\u00a0\u00a0Patients may be relatively asymptomatic between acute episodes pain, which was most commonly felt in the scrotum, buttocks and lower abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0Pain can also be felt in penis, groin or low back. Pain during or after ejaculation is one of the most prominent, important, and bothersome features.Treatment for prostatitis involves antibiotic use, frequently for many weeks and medications such as Advil or other NSAIDS to treat symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Frequently, it can be very difficult to treat and some men require multiple cycles of antibiotics.I would make an appointment with a urologist who can better evaluate you for prostatitis and consider other possible explanations.Best,AT",

    "question": "I'm a heterosexual male in my 40's.\u00a0\u00a0When I masturbate, right when I ejaculate, I get a phantom feeling like there's some fluid coming out of my rectum and it's very convincing, like maybe I had a slight \"accident\", but there's nothing there.\u00a0\u00a0This has been happening for over a month now, no other symptoms and no pain; the semen is normal in volume and color.\u00a0\u00a0I assume I'm having a prostate issue, but I just had a PSA done at my regular doc's office last week and it was fine; even he didn't know what to think of this symptom.\u00a0\u00a0He also checked my prostate and said it felt fine and I had no pain when he checked other than the usual minor discomfort of a digital rectal exam.\u00a0\u00a0I do have recurring anal itching from an unknown source/reason and have been for years now, but I control it well with hydrocortisone cream as needed.\u00a0\u00a0This doc and a GI specialist both say I don't have hemorrhoids.\u00a0\u00a0Is this phantom anal discharge symptom a common issue with men at my age and is it usually benign?",
