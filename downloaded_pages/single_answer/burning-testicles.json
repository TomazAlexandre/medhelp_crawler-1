            "answer": "Hi,In your case, I would like to rule out 2 possibilities. Firstly, a blood sugar should be done to rule out diabetes mellitus as you have frequent urination and diabetes is the commonest cause for the same. Secondly, please get an ultrasound of the urinary tract done as the presence of stones in the urinary tract can give rise to radiating pain in the testicles which can be burning in nature. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
