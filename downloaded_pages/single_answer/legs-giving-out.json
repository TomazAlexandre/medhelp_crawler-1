    "question": "I am not sure if this is a symptom of diabetes, but diabetes runs heavily in my family, and I am getting worried. I am obese, on depression and anxiety medications, have PCOS, and am largely in the running for diabetes. For some reason, my legs give out sometimes, when going up and down stairs or just walking regularly, and I have no idea why. It is really starting to worry me. Does anyone know why my legs are randomly giving out, with NO warnings, and if it might be a possible sign of diabetes?",
