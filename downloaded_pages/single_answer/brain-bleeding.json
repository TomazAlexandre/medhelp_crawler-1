    "question": "My dad woke up 15 days ago with numbness in the head and a feel of vomiting, after less than 10 minutes, he fell to the floor unconscious. after moving him to the hospital immediately, the doctors did a CT scan and told us it's a bleeding in the brain stem area which caused coma and breath stop.He's in the ICU ever since, can't breath without the ventilation, the doctors are trying to maintain the body functions and monitoring blood pressure and sugar frequently as he has diabetes.the doctors prognosis is not good, and they informed me that there's no way for a surgery especially in this particular area of the brain, all that we can do is to give the medicine and monitor the body and wait!!I'm not so sure about the solutions and still feel that there are things that can be done!the breath, it's not coming back so is it possible that it won't come back ever? or he will wake up again?Some complications started to occur after 15 days such as producing less urine, high sugar level and low blood pressure.Any hope?Thanks",
