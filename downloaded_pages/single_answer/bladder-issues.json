            "answer": "Hi, it sounds like your catheter got temporarily blocked, your bladder got overdistended and you suffered a hyperdistention injury.\u00a0\u00a0Pain from the overdistention and bleeding when the blockage is relieved is common. Both conditions are temporary, however and the bladder usually recovers.\u00a0\u00a0It's unclear whether your UTIs are related to the bladder distention or whether they would have occured anyhow because 50% of women get at least 1 UTI and 20% get frequent UTIs.\u00a0\u00a0If you are having culture positive UTI not effectively treated by antibiotics you need to see a Urologist.\u00a0\u00a0You may have a chronic deep tissue infection that will take time (months) to clear, or an infected focus somewhere like a kidney stone.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't have a positive culture you definitely need to see a urologist for an evaluation of other causes of pain frequency and urgency such as a bladder/ureteral stone, bladder tumor, or Interstitial Cystitis, an inflammation of the bladder wall with no infection.Good Luck",
