            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor with your parents to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.Fungal infections of the human body are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "What cream can I use to cure these light spots on my skin? It started a month ago, I noticed every time I left the shower my skin around my left side of my nose and nostril would get dry and flaky. It would clear up if i washed it or put\u00a0\u00a0 petroleum jelly on it. After that i would peel it off.\u00a0\u00a0After sometime, I wasn't happy with the results and decided to use a cream for all spots. Now the cream work but my skin color in that spot is drastically lighter than my face. I also noticed the spot is also on the back of my forearm. It is a circle as big as a watches face and is dry with\u00a0\u00a0white stuff blocking the pores? Has anyone has this or knows how to treat this?",
