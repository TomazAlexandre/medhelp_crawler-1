            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (cardiac or due to compression of blood vessels-Raynaud\u2019s Phenomenon) ,nerve pinched (esp. cervical) or neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol/smoking or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

    "question": "Hi, - I was a heavy smoker and drinker.\u00a0\u00a0I've cut down a lot on the drinking but still smoking but less than I used to and now do more excercise which is mainly walking or cycling.\u00a0\u00a0However, I still get numbness in my left hand (i'm right handed and use computers a lot but don't think that is an issue).\u00a0\u00a0 The numbness always starts in my left little finger and i get pins and needles in the ring finger and all down my hand to the wrist on the little finger side.I did break my left wrist when I was 15\u00a0\u00a0and it didn't heal quite properly but has been fine for the last 20 or so years.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a cause of an old injury or something else as I can wake up with a completely numb arm.\u00a0\u00a0Yes I do tend to sleep on that side as well.Also, when I get the pins and needles my left tricep is a bit tender on the outside.The odd thing is that I had no fags, no drink and ate well for 3 weeks and i still had the same problemGo and see my doctor?ThanksAndy Clay",
