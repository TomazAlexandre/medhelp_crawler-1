            "answer": "I am type 1 and can try to help.\u00a0\u00a0I might also suggest that you look under J for Juvenile Diabetes for type 1 help.\u00a0\u00a0I made the same mistake when I first looked on this site too.First,\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 diabetes is not only for the yound and the old.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone can get it and there is no known cause for it.\u00a0\u00a0Some say it is genetic and others say it is caused and neither is proven.\u00a0\u00a0Most believe that it is both to some degree.\u00a0\u00a0I did not get it until I was 40 yrs old and there is no history in my family of it.At the present time there is no known cure for Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0However, that being said people can live for years and decades with it with little to no sidde effects if they take care of themselves properly.\u00a0\u00a0IT IS VERY IMPORTANT that your husband starts to eat right and take care of himself or his life will be GREATLY shortened.\u00a0\u00a0If you husband is in fact a Type 1 diabetic his body does not produce ANY insulin so it is vitally important that he not go without insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is a MUST for anyone with Type 1 as is monitoring his levels SEVERAL times a day.\u00a0\u00a0At least 3-4 is recommended.To my knowledge there are no Pancreas transplants available.\u00a0\u00a0However they are working on transplanting what are called Islet cells into patients.\u00a0\u00a0If this proceedure is undertaken expensive anti-rejection drugs are needed for the rest of your life of the proceedure will fail and you will be back to square one.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that these proceedures are reserved for the worst cases and not recommended yet and more that likely would not be covered under insurance if you have any.Bottom line is that he NEEDS to start taking care of himself NOW if he wants to prevent MUCH worse problems in the future that are both DEADLY and PAINFUL.\u00a0\u00a0Including greater risk of Heart attach, loss of vision, neuropathy (loss of nerve funtion) which can be very painful.He can live a totally normal life if he starts to take care of himself now.\u00a0\u00a0Ignoring this problem will make it much worse very fast.\u00a0\u00a0If you have any specific questions I will do my best to answer them but I am not a medical professional.Kevin",

    "question": "I know this is a type 2 site, but I was wondering if anyone knows anything about type one.\u00a0\u00a0My husband got diagnosed two years ago, at age 19 with type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering why he got it at the age he did because I heard you either get it really young, or old, and is there ANYTHING that can make it go away.\u00a0\u00a0He doesnt eat healthy, and sometimes he doesnt have money for insulin so he has to go without.\u00a0\u00a0Could he possibley get a pancreas transplant so that he isnt diabetic anymore?\u00a0\u00a0Any answers would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0We are young, and we have two young children, both under the age of 2, and I want my husband to be here with us for a very long time.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so very much.",
