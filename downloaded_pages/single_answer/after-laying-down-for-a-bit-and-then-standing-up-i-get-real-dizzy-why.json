    "question": "So here's a problem I've faced for the past 3 years or so.Every time after laying down even for a little bit, then standing up I get real dizzy. It once\ufeff made me pass out for just a second, making me fall to the floor. When I stand up, I have to sit down or move my head down in order to get the dizziness to go away. This happens when I wake up and when I'm just watching TV and then standing up.Does anyone have an idea what's the cause of this and whether or not I should see a doctor?",
