    "question": "Has anyone had a son or daughter with type 1 diabetes travel abroad for a high school semester or year long exchange program?\u00a0\u00a0My 15 year old daughter, a sophomore in high school, is looking into becoming an exchange student abroad, and I am wondering if anyone has experience with this.\u00a0\u00a0 She has travelled before, but never for this length of time.\u00a0\u00a0I was thinking that maybe we could do a real exchange---if a teen with diabetes from another country wished to come stay with us, and his/her family could host my daughter, maybe that would work?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks for your thoughts!",
