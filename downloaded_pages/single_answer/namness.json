            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Are there other symptoms present? Numbness can be caused by a variety of conditions such as nerve injury, pressure on the nerves of the spine, such as from a herniated disk, pressure on peripheral nerves, lack of blood supply to an area, and medical conditions, including diabetes, migraines, electrolyte imbalance, and thyroid dysfunction. If it persists, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Additional diagnostic tests may be done to help determine the underlying cause. Take care and regards.",
