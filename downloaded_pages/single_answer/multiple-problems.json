I have been diagnosed with Primary Pulmonary Hypertension, strokes in the basal ganglia region, fibromyalgia, arthiritis in my entire spine, GERD, lumbar & cervical stenosis,diverticulosis, fibrosing alveolitis, chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction, blood\u00a0\u00a0clotting disorder, mitral valve disorder, block and narrowed cartotid artery, diabetes II, constricted and narrowed esophagus, esophagel disease, and more. Now the palms of my hands, bottom of feet, neck, chest and face are bright red. Sometimes the tips of my fingers turn purpleish-red. It makes the skin very sensitive, almost like a sunburn. It has started the skin to raise up, like a burn.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know what would cause a 39 year old to have these types of problems? Also, my doctor does not seem to know what is going on with the redness. What could case this? And is there one disease that can cause all of these issues and diseases?",
