            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Depression, dementia, psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, alcohol abuse, migraines, diabetes, abuse of certain drugs etc can cause auditory hallucinations. It is difficult to diagnose and treat this without professional help. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "My hearing voices experience has been subtly increasing over the years.\u00a0\u00a0In 2002 I was assaulted and kicked v. hard in the head but I did not lose consciousness or have a scan.\u00a0\u00a0I was concussed however.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, the voices have increased, to the point where now, 18 years later, I can be at the mercy of them, unable to hold a proper conversation with my friends whilst attending to the business of \"interacting\" with my voices.\u00a0\u00a0They can of course be delusional in the scenarios they set-up/act out and distressing.\u00a0\u00a0I was 32 years of age at the time of the assault.\u00a0\u00a0Yes I use cannabis, but nothing else, and in moderaration for years (let's see who jumps at that), but I do not believe that to be the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect the head trauma.\u00a0\u00a0I have been referred to a neuroscientist but am awaiting the appointment at present.\u00a0\u00a0 The thing is, I actually engage in conversation with these voices. and aripiprizole seems to help.\u00a0\u00a0How does it cut out one side of the conversation?\u00a0\u00a0How does an anti-psychotic relate to an ephemeral voice in my head and how does it stop one half of the conversation?",
