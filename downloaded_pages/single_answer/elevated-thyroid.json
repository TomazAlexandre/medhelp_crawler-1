    "question": "My daughter who is 18 was just (and finally) diagnosed with elevated thyroid her number was 11.57 I'm, wondering if that is high or medium high. She wants to sleep all the time and has several other health issues like diabetes (type 1), unable to walk due to pain, scoliosis, vision problems and a lot more. We have an endocrine appt on the 24th but I was wondering what they may do for her? I have researched the type of drug they might give her called synthroid but it says there are certain foods you cannot mix that medication with and those foods are everything she eats! She's a lactovegetarian and you are not supposed to have high fibrous foods with synthryoid is there anything else to give someone with elevated thyroid and what are the side effects? Could her thyroid be off due to her diabetes and does it ever go back to normal?",
