    "question": "I am in my early 30s and finding that I get every family-history disease possible. GI issues in family? I have crohn's.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes family history? I know have type 2 (and I'm only somewhat overweight).\u00a0\u00a0Makes me want to check my other issues, and this one is realling bothering me:I have what feels like middle/upper back pain between shoulder pains, almost a hollow feeling pain.\u00a0\u00a0 I mostly feel it whenever I hunch over and take a deep breath, but when that happens it seems to radiate deeply.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if this is just muscle tightness, posture, etc...\u00a0\u00a0But given my medical issues, and my past history as a smoker (I have quit), I really want to get this checked out.Also, I do experience a mild sensation of not having enough oxygen, like I'm breathing more to try to oxyginate. Adn the other day I had a real problem with exerting myself. I got all sweaty and felt like I was coming up to a wall, where I just couldn't exert myself any further without exploding.\u00a0\u00a0Like my head felt all kinds of pressure inside. I feel that pressure daily, though it has never been as bad as it was that day.I'm at risk for all kinds of things, and at this age I'm already experiencing painful neuropathies in my arms & legs from the blood sugars. Makes me wonder what else is going wrong. (and whether perhaps I get neuropathies happening along not jsut peripheral nerves but also my autonomic systems or whatever you call them).I guess my real question is, if chest X rays are negative, am I crazy for wanting more investigation? what should it be? stress test? chest imaging? I am getting an MRI soon of addomin/pelvis for crohn's issues.\u00a0\u00a0Wouldn't it make sense for them to just include the chest?Thanks for your help.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like the doctros may think I'm crazy but I'm the one suffering this and I want to get this all worked up so I can move on if it is truly nothing.I'm so interested to hear your thoughts.",
