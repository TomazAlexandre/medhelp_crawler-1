    "question": "Recently diagnosed with Macular Degeneration to go with my Glaucoma- Multiple retina tears and holes a detachment and\u00a0\u00a0Scaleral buckle- subsequent severe dry eye. I can still see 20-50\u00a0\u00a020-60\u00a0\u00a0poor reading vision and poor color vision with very bad night vision . They took many pictures after injecting dye and had good news- the blood seeping issue\u00a0\u00a0I had previously was gone ( diabetes now under control ) however a large wedge in my macula was missing- it went to the left and was very clear to even me in the pictures- they even took extra pics to verify. I am assuming this is very rare because the doc pretty much said that there is nothing that can be done .\u00a0\u00a0Previouslythere had been debate amoung my docs where one would note macular edema and then a few days later the specialist would say there was none- this occured on several occasions and I was so confused-\u00a0\u00a0The Doc had told me that this wedge created a flap and explained the destorted vision at times and changes in this distortion. Is it possible that this explains the mixed opinions on macular edema???\u00a0\u00a0was this flap confusing them??",
