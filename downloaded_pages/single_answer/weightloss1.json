            "answer": "Hello,How have your blood sugars been controlled? Many times weight loss occurs because blood sugars are too high and your kidney spill glucose into the urine(hence the weight loss). Once glucose control improves, weight tends to return. The other aspect of this is to determine if there is some medication side effect playing a part as some meds for Type 2 diabetes can cause weight loss. Speak to your doctor about this in the near future, and if this amount of weight loss should be concerning in your case.Take care",
