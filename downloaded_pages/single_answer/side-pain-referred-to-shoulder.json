    "question": "For the last 4 days I have had pain in my upper right side, sort of referring to the back and up through the right shoulder. Nagging, feels like the kind of pain you get from running after a meal. I thought at first it was just gas, but it's not. I have soreness in the intestinal area, and the pain is sharpened with a deep breath, although I think it's too low to be respiratory. No other symptoms. I had my galbladder removed 5 years ago, and know that ther are metal clips remaining there. Could these do anything to cause this type of pain? Bending over and tight clothes are uncomfortable.",
