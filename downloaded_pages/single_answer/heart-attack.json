            "answer": "I don't know that anyone can give you mathematical odds in a situation like this. So much depends on how well he has controlled his diabetes during the years before the heart attack, how well he is controlling the diabetes NOW, how his cholesterol levels have been, his diet, his exercise, etc. We are individual humans and no two people are alike. Instead of trying to figure out how many years he will live, I would suggest that you let him know how much you care about him and take an active role in encouraging him to do frequent glucose tests and to maintain ideal glucose levels. Hopefully he is taking aspirin therapy and eating a very healthy diet, too. So many factors combine to decide how well he will do. Many of those factors are in his control, but it is hard work, and he will appreciate the encouragement.",
