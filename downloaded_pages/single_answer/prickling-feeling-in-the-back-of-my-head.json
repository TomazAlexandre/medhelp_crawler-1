            "answer": "Hello,These ticks or picking sensations that you are having are parasthesias.Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol? Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes,vit B 12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also occur in nerve compression, transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus or in head injury patients.Firstly, I\u2019ll request you to get your blood sugar/HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) tested to rule out Diabetes mellitus. You may also need tests like Nerve Conduction Velocity etc.Try taking vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve.My opinion is to get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.Take care and do keep us posted on how you are doing.",
