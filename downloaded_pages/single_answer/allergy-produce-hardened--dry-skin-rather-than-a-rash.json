            "answer": "Hi,It is very unlikely that an allergic reaction produce dry skin instead of a rash. Are there other signs or symptoms present? Dry skin on any part of the body can can cause flaking or cracking of the skin, and unsightly patches of thick/hard skin. Dry skin on the feet may be due to weather: exposure to excessively cold outdoor temperatures, dry indoor heat, hot baths and showers, inactive sweat glands, certain medications, obesity, prolonged standing, chronic skin problems such as eczema and psoriasis and certain chronic diseases such as hyothyroidism and diabetes.The skin of the feet have no oil glands and must rely on the sweat glands to moisturize the skin. The lack of oil glands makes preventing dry skin difficult. It is important to exfoliate by removing the dry dead skin present, and to moisturize the underlying normal skin. If it persists, it would be best to have this evaluated further by your doctor to rule out other causes mentioned.Take care and regards.",
