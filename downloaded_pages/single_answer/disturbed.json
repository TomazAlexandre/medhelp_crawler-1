            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms could be due to anxiety. However they could also be due to severe acidity and gastric reflux. Take antacid gel and Omeprazole and see if it helps.Along with that the blood levels of the following should be checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
