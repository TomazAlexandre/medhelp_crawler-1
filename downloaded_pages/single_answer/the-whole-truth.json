            "answer": "I suspect the doctors are right, and that the cancer spread from the ovaries to the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0You would need the pathology report from the pancreas surgery to determine that, because the cancer cells found in the pancreas would still have similar characteristics to those of the ovary.Surgery does not necessarily remove all cancerous cells.\u00a0\u00a0Assuming the diagnosis is correct, and that the original ovarian cancer has metastacized to the pancreas, that means those poisonous cells could crop up anywhere in the body.\u00a0\u00a0For that reason, a systemic treatment like chemotherapy is chosen.\u00a0\u00a0Radiation can only be used to pinpoint areas of known tumors, while chemo hits the entire body and areas of cancer that are yet undetectable.I'm really sorry you and your mum have to deal with this.\u00a0\u00a0The only reason I know anything about cancer is because my father died of gallbladder cancer and I learned more than I ever wanted to about the subject.",

    "question": "Hi,I have a question about my mum, and feel that either she is not telling me the whole story, or that she doesn't know herself what is happening.After being diagnosed with ovarian cysts, my mum went through an operation earlier in the year to remove the cyst. The cyst weighed over 9lbs, and she was given a clean bill of health. (this is after having a hysterectomy around 19 years ago). A few months after the operation, another cyst was found and it was decided to remove her ovaries. I have been told that the ovarian cyst that was removed was not cancerous, but after having her ovaries removed, it is said that she had cancerous cells in them.A few months later, she has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, and her doctor has told her that it is likely that the cancer has spread from her ovaries. (ovaries to pancreas seems an unlikely organ for it to spread to, but I don't know much about cancer and it's behaviour)She has been suddenly diagnosed with diabetes, which makes sense due to the pancreatic cancer. She has had surgery to remove the cancer of the pancreas (which she has been told/has told me is stage 1 cancer), and is now undergoing radiotherapy AND chemotherapy.There are a few questions that I have.How likely is it that the cancer cells have spread from her ovaries?Secondly, the way that I understand it, is that stage 1 cancer is only cancerous cells, and if it is big enough to have been removed, then it must be further than stage one, especially if it has spread and affected other organs.Thirdly, is it likely that she wouldn't have received any cancer treatment for the cells found in her removed ovaries?Next is my issue with treatment. I don't understand why Radiotherapy AND chemotherapy is being used after treatment, unless there is a risk that there is cancer elsewhere in the body...Is there any other reason for this harsh treatment after surgery?Please can you let me know and educate me a bit more on this issue.Thanks,Sarah",
