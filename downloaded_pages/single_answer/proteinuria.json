    "question": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0Male age 40.\u00a0\u00a0Had a random urinalysis yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0Results were a high PH level and a positive for protein.\u00a0\u00a0Have no other symptoms for kidney problems such as blood in urine, high blood pressure (mine was 118/71), or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have low cholesterol, no pain or swelling, good appetite, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The night before, I had a two hour drive, six hour flight and landed in 105 degrees AZ.\u00a0\u00a0Had little to drink and the day of the test I was very dehydrated and the urine was very concentrated.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. did not seem worried, but wanted a follow urinalysis in a few days.\u00a0\u00a0I have no symptoms for any of the diseases that cause Chronic Kidney Disease, except for this urinalysis finding.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like it could be serious?\u00a0\u00a0I know the protein can be an indication of something serious with the kidneys, however, with lack of other symptoms, could it be a transient proteinuria caused by the dehydration and stress of the day or a false positive due to the high PH?\u00a0\u00a0Appreciate your help.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
