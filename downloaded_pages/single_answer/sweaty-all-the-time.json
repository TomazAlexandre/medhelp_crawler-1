    "question": "I am 29yrs old and have never had any problems with anything. I had my first and only child two yrs ago and now I seem to sweat around my neck,breast.under arms and crotch. This just started happening worse and worse. I have been checked by My Md and all test check out ok. What could it be. I drink about a gallon of water a day and I am not over weight. I can just be sitting at my desk and start sweating and being very thirsty. If I have already been tested for diabetes,thyroids,etc and it all checked out ok. Do I need to see an endocrinologist? How serious is this? Please help. Thanks",
