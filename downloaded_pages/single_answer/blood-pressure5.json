    "question": "I was surprised to learn that so many adults avoid taking their blood pressure simply because of the white coat effect.The medical field has failed to take this phenomenon seriously. In many situation physicians simply over prescribe medication when most likey very little medication may be necessary. I take 3 medications: Toprol XL 100mg, Benicar\u00a0\u00a0HCT 40/25, Dynacirc 5mg. Consequently the side effects are overbearing. In addition a report by the British medical authorities have recommended against prescribing diuretics and beta blockers for the great risk in setting of the onset of diabetes.How could one overcome this fear and determine the true blood pressure regardless of ones state of mind? Would a sedative prior to blood pressure being taken be a good advise or will that lower blood pressure artificially?",
