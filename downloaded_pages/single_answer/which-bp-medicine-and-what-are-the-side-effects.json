            "answer": "Well the first question is what are your bp numbers like? Is there other health complications? I ask as you are seeing an endo.Also Losartan is often prescribed for patients with high bp along with type 2 diabetes?So i was wondering are there complications.All bp meds have side effects. But taking one med daily will probably cause little bother.Often bp meds are for life, so be very careful before trying to cut them out. Also bp may rise over a period of time rather than quickly if you stop.So careful observation of bp numbers would be necessary.Your endo has prescribed the meds, they have your full history and are best placed to work out a strategy for your meds going forward.Just tread carefully",
