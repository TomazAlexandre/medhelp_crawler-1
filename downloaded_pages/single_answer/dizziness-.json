            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Dizziness can be caused by a variety of issues including eye and ear conditions such as visual fatigue, error of refraction, vertigo and ear diseases and infection. Low blood glucose, changes in the blood pressure and underlying medical conditions such as anemia and diabetes can also be a factor. I would also like to clarify your medical history regarding the head and face reconstruction and if melanoma is present apart from the pressure ulcer in the head that you mentioned. Additional diagnostic tests and direct clinical examination are important to rule out any organic causes. Have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",
