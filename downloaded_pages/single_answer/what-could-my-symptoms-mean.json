            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Since you are bruising, don\u2019t eat well, have hot flashes and are very exhausted, you could be suffering from vitamin B12 deficiency or deficiency of vitamin K or platelets or suffering from severe anemia or bone marrow disorders. All these can cause bleeds into the joints which can also cause pain.Other than this, the symptoms could also be due to diabetes, thyroid disorders, low or high blood pressure. If you take birth control pills then this could also be the cause.You need to consult a doctor and get some blood tests done, as early as possible. Please ask your parents to take you to your GP. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
