            "answer": "Dawn Phenomenon (DP) can be a real problem for type 2 diabetics. In terms of management some people say a small snack at night before bed helps and some say the opposite, that you shouldn't eat after dinner. You will just have to experiment to see what works for you. You don't say what your fasting blood sugars are but if they are consistently high, yes, you might want to consider medication. Diabetes is, unfortunately, a progressive illness. Congratulations on your weight loss and keep up the good work! Send me a private message if you want a couple websites with many more people living with diabetes where you can get more tips on DP. (sorry I'm a type 1 and don't experience it myself).",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with diabetes type 2 for almost three years.\u00a0\u00a0I have lost 50 pounds in the past year (much more to go), but have been diet-controlled on no meds for a year.\u00a0\u00a0My sugars have always been higher in the morning (fasting) than any other time of day, but lately these fasting BS are even higher.\u00a0\u00a0I have been reading about dawn syndrome on the \"net\" and think that might be what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0However, I have not come across much in the way of specific management plans.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone else have this problem?\u00a0\u00a0Can you give me some ideas for control?\u00a0\u00a0Do I need to give in and go back on metformin?\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas would be appreciated.",
