            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!In females above 40 years (as in your case) it can be a symptom of menopause and hormone replacement therapy will help. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes too should be looked into. Fibromyalgia is another possibility. It can be shingles without rash but less likely. Please consult a neurologist and a gynecologist regarding this. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "A day or so after receiving the H1N1 shot 1 week ago, I developed a sensitive burning sensation on the right side of my back, which spread all over the back, and around the waist mostly on the right side. I was concerned that it might be Shingles beginning, but there is not skin outbreak at all, or redness.\u00a0\u00a0What could this be, and what kind of Dr. should I see?",
