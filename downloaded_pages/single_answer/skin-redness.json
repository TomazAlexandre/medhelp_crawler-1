    "question": "I wasnt sure which topic to put this under, I have Diabetes (type 1) so I figured that would be the best bet. Anyway, I have been noticing for the last few years that my skin is getting really red. I dont mean like Im getting flushed after an embarrassment but I mean all over my entire body its increasingly getting redder and redder. Apparently its getting really bad because now practically everyone I meet comments on it. I have also noticed that I have Peticia (little red dots) was told that its like bleeding through the skin. I stay indoors a lot hardly ever in the sun...it hurts my eyes. Would anyone know what this could be and if so should I be running to my doc.",
