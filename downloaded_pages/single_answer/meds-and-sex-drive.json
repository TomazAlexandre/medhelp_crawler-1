            "answer": "Hello,It is true that some of the medicines can cause loss of libido. He should check out with his doctor if any of his medicines is causing any loss of libido. Apart from that medical causes of loss of libido need to be ruled out. These include diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal and neurologic causes.Investigations like blood sugar levels, thyroid test, testosterone levels and blood pressure levels are needed to confirm the diagnosis.So my sincere advice is to get the diagnosis confirmed from a urologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
