            "answer": "Hi Daisy! I have been type 1 for 49 years and it's been along haul when I was younger. Please don't obsess. With your b/f eating right, exercising and taking his insulin(s) he should be ok. It is when the blood sugars are constantly high that complications start to set in. The only thing that happened to me was something called, \"Neuropathy\" which affected my hands terrible. It's a numbing of the nerve endings and believe me that pain is horrible. We do and can live a normal life. We are better for ourselves and loved ones taking care of ourselves. Learn all you can. Read, read and read. Diabetes is a progressive disease but taking one day at a time helps. Don't think ahead and worry yourself sick. Things do happen but less chances when we have tight control of our sugars. It was said when I was diagnosed and it still holds that it does run in families and down the line; a family member can get it. It ran on my mom's side with my aunts and uncles. It skips so many generations. It could be that, say your kids have kids. One of their kids could get diabetes. If you need, you can email me: dnorvellatcomcastdot net.\u00a0\u00a0Ask anything you want and I will do my best for you and him.\u00a0\u00a0Just know that all diabetics are different. What is good for one may not be good for the other. Take care.Hugs,Debbie",
