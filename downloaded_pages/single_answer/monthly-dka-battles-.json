            "answer": "Hello,Being in DKA so often is quite alarming.Have your drs been able to determine why this happens? I presume they are working very closely with you on this.What I can recommend is to adopt a very low carb, moderate protein diet.\u00a0\u00a0This will at least reduce your insulin requirements (less insulin = less roller coastering).\u00a0\u00a0Frequent testing\u00a0\u00a0to catch both highs and lows rather than them getting out of control.To get excellent control and the best chance at avoiding DKA, I recommend the following book:\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes Solutions, By Dr. Richard Bernstein (he's an 80 yo type 1 since he was 12, Dr.)\u00a0\u00a0 If anything can help you, I really think his approach can.",

    "question": "I've been a Type 1\u00a0\u00a0Brittle Diabetic for almost 7 years now. When I was first diagnosed it wasn't abnormal for me to go into DKA,\u00a0\u00a0I'm talking like every month,\u00a0\u00a0up to a month in ICU at a time. The last 2 to 3 years I've been doing great, maybe 2 or 3 stays in that time span... the last year however has been a roller coaster again. I follow my diet fairly well, follow my insulin plan and my crisis plan but yet here I am again at the ER. Does anybody know or have any advice other than what we all know... insulin and fluids, to keep me out of here? It's hard in me and my family wich stresses me out worse and I know that's not good for me... Anything would be greatly appreciated!",
