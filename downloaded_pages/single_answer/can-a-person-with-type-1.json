            "answer": "Hi,Yes, a person with type 1 diabetes can use Novolog Mix.\u00a0\u00a0Novolog mix is a mixture of both short and long acting insulins. It is typically injected twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0 However, that person will need to be very careful to eat on schedule to avoid going low, and this type of insulin can not allow any flexibility on eating.However, if the person with type 1 diabetes is only using lantus (intermediate acting insulin), then you are only covering background insulin requirements and not covering meals.\u00a0\u00a0Meals require a fast acting insulin.Typically persons with type 1 diabetes will use a basal-bolus regime.\u00a0\u00a0Where the basal insulin is used to keep blood sugars stable where the patient is not eating at all. Basal insulin is injected once or twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0 Then bolus insulin (fast acting) is injected before meals to cover the protein and carbs in the meal, and also to make corrections if the blood sugars are too high.Hope this helps.",
