    "question": "at 20 weeks i had my anatomy ultrasound but baby was being difficult and they couldnt see everything they needed too. But they did say his kidneys were a little larger than normal (but he was also 1lb which is larger than normal) i am going to a specialist tuesday to have another ultrasound done. Has anyone else had them see something abnormal? They said they are just being cautious but i am so scared ):",
