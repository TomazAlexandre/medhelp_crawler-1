            "answer": "Welcome to the medhelp neurology forum. Thanks for writing in. since varied investigations have been done and many suspected diseases ruled out, I feel your symptoms are suggestive of temporal arteritis. In temporal arteritis, you have muscle aches, throbbing headache on one side of head or back ofhead, intermittent jaw pain, scalp sensitivity or tender to touch, vision difficulties like blurred vision, double vision, reduced vision( blindness in one or both eyes), weakness or excessive tiredness, weight loss, excessive sweating, joint pains and stiffness, hearing loss, etc.Temporal arteritis is inflammation and damage to blood vessels that supply the head area, especially the medium and large arteries branching from neck. It usually affects the temporal artery branching from the carotid artery in the neck but can affect the other vessels also. It can present along with polymyalgia\u00a0\u00a0rheumatica and is due to faulty immune response.Consult your neurologist again with this possibility, e would like to do hemoglobin and hemocrit which are decreased here. Liver function tests with alkaline phosphotase\u00a0\u00a0increased and raised C reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Biopsy of the vessel might be required.Treatment includes corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.I hope this really helps. You are welcome with any other query.",

    "question": "I am a 32 year old female that has been experiencing constant right side facial numbness and also numbness down my right neck and ear. It does not go away but varies in severity.Part of my right foot is also numb. This has been going on for 16 months. I have had 3 Brain MRI's (2 of which were mildly abnormal for nonspecific white matter hyperintensities), Evoked Potentials which was normal, Ecocardiogram and Carotid Artery Scans were normal, Spinal Tap showed no Oligocolonal Banding, Lyme Disease test was Negative, Diabetes test was negative, Sjogrens disease test was negative and yet here I am sitting undiagnosed. They were concerned with MS but have ruled that out with the spinal tap. My ful array of symptoms are the following, Right side facial nubness, right side foot numbness, tingling in all extremeties, blurred vision, blind spot in vision, muscle stiffness, constricting feeling in the trunk area, burning in my scalp, shooting pains through my head area, stomach problems, vertigo with nausea. Was told today that there was nothing to pinpoint what is wrong so it may be Migraines. Seems that is always the diagnosis when they can't figure out what is wrong, Was told we would watch things and do retesting in a year or if I got any worse. Any thoughts on what this could be?This discussion is related to/posts/show/297067.",
