            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I fully empathize with you! It is a difficult situation.However it is not a situation that cannot be corrected.\u00a0\u00a0If you are having actual incontinence of urine and stool then you need to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. A good physiotherapist should be able to help you with that. Until then it would be advisable to avoid strenuous exercises. Talk to your physiotherapist and exercise as advised. Fecal incontinence can be actual waste matter or just gas that is passed out without your knowledge. Some neurological disorders and stress too cause incontinence, both urinary and fecal. You should consult a doctor about this.If there is only odor and no incontinence, then you need to get yourself tested for uncontrolled diabetes causing ketones in sweat and urine.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult a doctor soon. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, I am a male high school athlete. About two years ago, I began smelling like urine during/after exercising in a sport. I checked my genital area, and it was somewhat wet. I do not think it's sweat and feel like it's urine matter. I began to try to hide it by spraying axe and other stuff to avoid public embarrassment. A couple weeks ago this problem got bigger. Upon exercising for at least 30-45 minutes I started to smell like feces matter(e.g. poop). This was a lot harder to hide with spraying deodorants as it did not work. What should I do? I'm scared people will find out and I'm very embarrassed about this.",
