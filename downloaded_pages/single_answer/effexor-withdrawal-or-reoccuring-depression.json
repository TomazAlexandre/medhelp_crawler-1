            "answer": "After 6 months it's probably not withdrawal effects you are going thru considering the other issues you mention.\u00a0\u00a0New Job = very stressful!\u00a0\u00a0Moving = very stressful.You are going thru life changes, even tho they may be good ones, are most stressful.The issue for you is ...would you prefer going thru what you are experiencing and living with the symptoms or taking the medication and living with that?For me personally this answer has always been easy.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't function without medication, like it or not.\u00a0\u00a0My family, job, health, all hang in the balance.I always equate it to having diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Many people with diabetes have to take insulin every day or they will die eventually without it.\u00a0\u00a0Sure they'd like to not have to stick themselves daily testing their levels and injecting medication...etc..\u00a0\u00a0and we'd think they were crazy if they DIDN'T do that and put their lives in danger.\u00a0\u00a0 For me this is how it is with depression/anxiety.If you can be happy, healthy and productive without medication then by all means stay off of them.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't mind the roller coaster rides anxiety can put you tru then it must not be that bad.\u00a0\u00a0Only you can make this decsion for yourself.It sounds like you are well capable of deciding what's best for you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "About ten year ago I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and associated depression.\u00a0\u00a0It may have resulted from using Larium as a malaria prophylactic but that\u2019s another story.Eventually my doctor put me on Effexor XR.\u00a0\u00a0I did not have the major side effects some have reported from Effexor.\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless I do want to get off the medication for both physical reasons, e.g., potential high blood pressure, and personal reasons, (I don\u2019t like to have to rely on chemicals).\u00a0\u00a0Several times I tried to discontinue the use of Effexor but each time several weeks after discontinuing the medication I\u2019d suffer anxiety and associated depression.\u00a0\u00a0My physician would then put me back on Effexor.\u00a0\u00a0He was actually rather discouraging about most things beyond feeding me meds.Two years ago I switched doctors.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019d been doing fine for several years and discussed discontinuing the medication with my new Psychiatrist.\u00a0\u00a0He encouraged me to give it a try telling me I knew Effexor worked so I could go back on if necessary.He decreased my medication and switched me to Prozac for a few weeks then I discontinued all meds.\u00a0\u00a0I was fine for a while and my wife says I seemed a lot healthier.\u00a0\u00a0However after a few weeks I started having anxiety issues.\u00a0\u00a0I should also mention it\u2019s been a stressful six months in other way; my father passed away and I\u2019m about to go through a job change and associated move to a new city.\u00a0\u00a0That of course also means I need to find a new psychiatrist.I\u2019ve been off all meds for approximately six months.\u00a0\u00a0I did go through a period of serious anxiety that my physician suggested was probably a manifestation of discontinuation syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless after six months I still have constant, although usually low-level, anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0 My anxiety may be stress related and I do occasionally take a Xanax if it seems truly overwhelming but as I mentioned, I don\u2019t want to rely on chemicals so I try to keep away from that as well.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise is very effective for me but as I told my psychiatrist I can exercise every day, but not all day every day.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m also trying meditation but frankly I\u2019ve not had much success with that.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll keep it up anyway \u2013 it can\u2019t hurt.So, realizing no one out there can see what\u2019s in my head or treat me, my question is after six months is this still a result of discontinuing Effexor or is it a manifestation of underlying anxiety/depression issues.\u00a0\u00a0If it is the former I\u2019ll stick it out, if the later I may be better going back on the meds.Any personal experiences that can be shared will be appreciated.",
