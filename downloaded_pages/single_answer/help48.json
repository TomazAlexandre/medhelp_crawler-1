            "answer": "You should have had a work up by the ophthalmology department to determine the cause which can be anything from tumors, diabetes, sinuc problems, strokes, etc. Some we do not find a cause ('idiopathic). 6th nerve paresis does not usually affect the near vision and usually only causes double vision at distance when looking towards the weak muscle. So by looking the opposite way most people do not have double vision and can drive that way or by patching the weak eye while driving.Most cases of 6th weakness get better over 3-6 months and do not require surgery.JC MD",
