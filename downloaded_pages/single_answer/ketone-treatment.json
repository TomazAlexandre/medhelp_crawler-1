            "answer": "This is called Ketoacidosis, (This means glucose is unable to be used by the body for energy.\u00a0\u00a0The body begins to search for alternate supplies of energy & begins to break down fat. When fat is broken down (metabolised) into fatty acids, waste products known as ketones (also known as ketone bodies) are produced & accumulate in the bloodstream. This causes the blood to become too acidic (acidosis).The body will try to get rid of the ketones by excreting them into the urine, which causes increased urine output & increased thirst.)Ketacidosis is a serious situation which needs veterinary attention. Possibly intravenous fluid administration.You need to either get your dog back to the vet, or find another vet who can give the right treatment. I am sorry but I don't know precisely what the treatment should be, but I don't think it is something you should be left to try to figure out.It sounds as if this is putting great strain on her kidneys.I would get her to a vet as soon as you can.",

    "question": "My dog had Cushing's Disease and very strong diabetes symptoms. She hasen't eaten for a week and is drinking and puking nonstop. The vet said that we needed to get rid of the Ketones so she can eat again; I am afraid that she's going to die of starvation, so my question is: How do you treat Ketones?",
