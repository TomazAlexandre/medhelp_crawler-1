            "answer": "Hello,Stress is an important cause of hair loss.It seems that you are not taking a nutritious diet even.Malnutrition and deficiency of important vitamins and minerals are a result of malnutrition thus leading to hair loss.Both these causes are modifiable with efforts.Take a healthy nutritious diet consisting of lots of green vegetables,dairy products and fruits and avoid taking any undue stress.Take mutivitamins and multiminerals for some days.Also get your Hb levels evaluated.If low,you can take iron supplements also.If still the condition prevails,then other causes like alopecia aereata,hormonal imbalance(overproduction of dihydrotestosterone and thyroid hormones irregularities) and fungal infections(tinea capitis) and diabetes have to be probed by a trichologist(hair specialist). You may need a blood work up to rule out hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes and other reversible medical diseases.Hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
