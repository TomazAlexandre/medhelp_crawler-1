It could also be due to nerve compression very high up in the cervical vertebra. Excess alcohol intake, partial seizures and low calcium levels all cause tongue tingling. Wisdom tooth is another cause.Hope this helps. The enumerated the possibilities can be investigated or ruled out one by one by your physician. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
