            "answer": "This is definitely a matter you should discuss with the doctor who has prescribed the drugs with hepatotoxic effects.\u00a0\u00a0The prime action to be taken is for you and your doctors to carefully monitor your liver function, with appropriate blood tests, during administration of the drug(s) in question.\u00a0\u00a0The monitoring schedule will vary with the specific drug taken, the relative likelihood of its causing liver damage, the potential severity of the damage and the reversibility of liver damage with the discontinuation of that drug.\u00a0\u00a0For many drugs, the risk of liver damage can be reduced, simply by the avoidance of alcohol.The preceding also applies to what is called the risk/benefit ratio.\u00a0\u00a0Does the need for the drug and the expected benefits from it outweigh the potential risk of liver damage?\u00a0\u00a0This is a matter to be discussed with your doctor.As to your question regarding avoidance of the side effect, I assume you are asking about substances that might be taken with the drug, or the need for a reduction in dose to reduce the chance of side effects occurring.\u00a0\u00a0 An good example of this would be administration of the drug, Isoniazide used in the treatment of tuberculosis.\u00a0\u00a0One potential side effect of this drug in inflammation of peripheral nerves.\u00a0\u00a0The chance of this occurring can be reduced significantly by the co-administration of\u00a0\u00a0Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), especially to persons at greater risk of neuropathy, for example those with HIV infection, nutritional deficiency, diabetes, pregnancy.You should discuss the risk/benefit of the drug in question with your doctor, and ask specifically if the risk for the precribed drug can be reduced by either the administration of vitamins or other substances or the avoidance of other drugs that, if taken at the same time would increase the risk of the primary drug\u2019s toxicity.Bottom line is that you or anyone needs to have a discussion with the doctor prescribing the drug regarding the risk and prevention issues.Good luck,Concerns related to adverse effects:\u2022 Hepatitis: [U.S. Boxed Warning]: Severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis may occur; usually occurs within the first 3 months of treatment, although may develop even after many months of treatment. The risk of developing hepatitis is age-related, although isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity has been reported in children; daily ethanol consumption may also increase the risk. Patients must report any prodromal symptoms of hepatitis, such as fatigue, weakness, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, jaundice, or vomiting. Patients should be instructed to immediately discontinue therapy if any of these symptoms occur, even if a clinical evaluation has yet to be conducted.\u2022 Peripheral neuropathies: Pyridoxine (10-50 mg/day) is recommended in individuals at risk for development of peripheral neuropathies (eg, HIV infection, nutritional deficiency, diabetes, pregnancy).Disease-related concerns:\u2022 Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Treatment with isoniazid for latent tuberculosis infection should be deferred in patients with acute hepatic diseases.\u2022 Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with severe renal impairment.",
