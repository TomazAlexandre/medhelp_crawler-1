            "answer": "Hi Annie,i haven't been diagnosed, but suspect this is what I have, as I also have other autoimmune conditions.I use insulin and have ever since, because I was diagnosed in my first weeks of my first pregnancy (in pregnancy treatment is insulin), after pregnancy when my blood sugars were still high I decided to stay on insulin.\u00a0\u00a0That is nearly 8 years ago now.The treatment for adult onset type 1 (also called type 1.5) is insulin rather than oral meds, even if a low dose. It is also important to get excellent control because high blood sugars are toxic to your pancreas and the beta cells that secrete insulin.\u00a0\u00a0If you can control your blood sugars well you may go for a long time without needing vey much insulin.Weight management, low carb diet, exercise, also are all invaluable in management.Hope this helps you.\u00a0\u00a0Please ask more questions if you need.",
