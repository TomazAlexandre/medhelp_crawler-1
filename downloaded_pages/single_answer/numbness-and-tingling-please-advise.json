            "answer": "Hey there,Understand your concern about father. I am his age.\u00a0\u00a0Don't have his health problems, but can relate.\u00a0\u00a0As we age, we are more susceptible to various disorders.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds as though he does an excellent job of handling the two main problems he has.As you posted in the agoraphobia community, I am wondering if your father is homebound due to his condition or anxiety.Cant really advise ....but know he needs to be seen to get a diagnosis on that tingling and numbness.\u00a0\u00a0Honestly.....there are so many things that can cause numbness alone that I wouldn't venture an opinion....I have both on the right side of leg after exercise...no idea what causes.\u00a0\u00a0 As long as I can walk and remain upright, feel I'm good to go.You may find more support in Diabetes and High blood pressure communites....think there is one for people who suffer hbp...know there is one for diabetes.You are very caring child.\u00a0\u00a0That is a great blessing for your father.",
