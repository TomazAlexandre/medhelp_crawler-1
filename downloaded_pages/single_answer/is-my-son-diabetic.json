            "answer": "Dear jmbeach,Thank you so much for reaching out to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. We are all volunteers here and can only give you our own experiences in dealing with type 1 diabetes.I would like to ask if it was an overnight fast, at least 8 hours. May I also ask if your son is showing the typical signs of thirst, weight loss, excessive urination, vision problems as your daughter may have experienced?As a parent, I would not hesitate to have your son checked for type 1 diabetes. As you probably know, it is a simple test and it is much better to find out sooner than later. I am hoping it will be negative, but if not, I would like you to feel free to contact us for further information and support. I do hope your daughter is doing well. We are coming along way with research.Please,let us know how you are doing and keep in contact. You will most likely see other comments from others on this thread.Best,dm",
