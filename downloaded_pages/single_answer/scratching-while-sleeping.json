            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms it looks like restless leg syndrome. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a disorder of the part of the nervous system that affects movements of the legs. Because it usually interferes with sleep, it also is considered a sleep disorder.People with RLS have strange sensations in their legs (and sometimes arms) and an irresistible urge to move their legs to relieve the sensations.Sometimes restless leg syndrome can be caused by diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, Cigarette smoking, magnesium or Vit B12 deficiency.Get your blood tests for any kind of anemia done. Also get yourself evaluated for diabetes by blood sugar levels. Polysomnography (sleep testing) may be necessary to diagnose the sleep disturbances and determine if you have periodic limb movements. Sometimes Needle electromyography and nerve conduction studies may be done for signs of neuropathy.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
