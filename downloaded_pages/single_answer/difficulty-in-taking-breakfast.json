            "answer": "The sedentary lifestyle will certainly slow your metabolism, since exercise builds muscle and muscle burns more calories.If you're eating only 2 meals/day, chances are, you're getting way to hungry before the next meal rolls around, which increases your chances of overeating at meal times.When you eat, isn't so important as WHAT you eat, though it's best to have your biggest meal(s) early in the day.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally, that would be breakfast and lunch, but if you prefer brunch, that would work, so long as you don't overdo, and have at least a light snack between brunch and dinner, to keep from overeating at dinner.Bottom line - it's all about WHAT you eat and how much, not necessarily when. Exercise is a necessity, because it not only burns fat and builds muscle, it's good for the heart and can help prevent a lot of illnesses, including heart attack, stroke,\u00a0\u00a0type II diabetes and others.",
