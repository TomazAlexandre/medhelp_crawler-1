            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There is a lot of missing information here. Why does your mother need to be fed through tube for a case of cellulitis or sore? Is it a bed sore? Does she have any other ailment?Non healing ulcers are due to poor blood supply, persisting infection, underlying diabetes etc. A bed sore happens in people who have been on bed rest and cannot move at all. The non healing ulcer is treated by frequent change of position, antiseptic dressing and placenta extracts etc. Please send in more details in order to help us understand the situation better.Take care!",
