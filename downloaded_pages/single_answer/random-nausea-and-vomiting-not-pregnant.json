    "question": "Yesterday I out of the blue with no warning just started throwing up for like two or three minutes. Last night I was still nauseous but VERY mildly. I ate dinner and even had a few drinks (alchohol).Which I'm sure didn't help anything, but I was completely sober before going to bed and I drank a lot of water although still nauseous. Today, all day, I've had nagging nausea and when I got home from work I threw up again. I don't think I ate or drank anything that would cause this so I'm pretty sure it's not food poisoning, but what is it?",
