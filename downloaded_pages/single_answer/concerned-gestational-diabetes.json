    "question": "Hi all. I wasn't sure what topic to put this under, so here it goes- I had a 1 hour blood glucose test done a couple weeks back. A few days later the results came in HIGH and my Dr. had me go back in for a 3 hour test which the results also came back HIGH. The nurse/receptionist from my Dr.s office called and just said 'watch your sugar intake'. I asked 'meaning what exactly?' She replied 'just remove sugar from your diet'. Um, ok, easy enough..... NOT! I've been trying to do that, but almost all food/drinks have some sort of sugar in it. Still, I'm trying to watch it. Anyway, I have one of those blood sugar test kits here at home and I decided to test my blood this afternoon just for the heck of it (I've had this whole glucose on my mind for the past 2 weeks). The results showed the number 268!!!! I don't know what that means exactly, but from what I've found online, it's not good. So I called my Dr. and asked exactly how bad my numbers were when I took the 1 and 3 hour tests and what all this means. She replied that my number was only 1 above the mark where they consider it to be high- 155 (154 being the cut off) and to just watch my sugar intake. So now I'm confused! If my numbers were barely high, then what's this 268 reading all about? This is my 5th baby and I've never had any issues with the others. My last was almost 10lbs., however, and I am way overweight with this one (I'm 33, 5'4\" and 225lbs.) Does anyone else have any experience with this issue? Is this even really considered Gestational Diabetes? The nurse never used that term, I'm just assuming. I suffer from major anxiety (panic disorder) and am going through a TON of stress (no work and being evicted from our home) and this just adds to everything. Please, help me to understand these numbers. I need some peace of mind. My Dr. knows of my anxiety and just thinks I overreact to things, but I am concerned for my baby and myself, to be honest. Thanks for reading. Blessings to all.PS- I've been having a lot of headaches, back pain (sciatic is BAD!), sore feet, etc. You know, typical pregnancy stuff, especially at 6 months. However, I've been really fatigued, hot and my eyes are blurry often. Are those considered a part of this blood sugar thing or just another pregnancy related symptom? Again, my Dr. just brushes everything off as anxiety, so talking with him isn't always the best option. You get what you pay for, right? :-/",
