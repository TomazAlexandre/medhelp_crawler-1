            "answer": "Hello,I am sorry you received such discouraging news about your father.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know how to guage those predictions for you. This may be more related to your father's congestive heart failure moreso than his diabetes, although I admit that his diabetes will make his heart failure a bit more complicated in its course and care.In terms of his diabetes the best you can do is ensure his regimen is optimized to bring his glucose numbers under control, and review his medications with his doctor to ensure none are potentially contributing to his water retention or cause of side effects.The heart failure management will be mainly in the hands of his cardiologist however, so I am afraid\u00a0\u00a0cannot offer much guidance there.Take care",
