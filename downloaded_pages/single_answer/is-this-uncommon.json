            "answer": "I went through the same thing for quite some time.One doctor told me it was a severe yeast infection ( you don't have to have discharge apparently ) one told me that I was allergic to pads, and one told me that I had some nasty disease and gave me a penicillin ( which I'm allergic to)...ugh.Too much yeast in your body ( not just yeast infection ) diabetes, and a few other diseases can cause this as well.If it's a yeast infection it could cause grief all month, but should clear up or lessen during your period.Ask to be tested for all of the above, and STDs as well.",

    "question": "I'm a 23 yr old female and i have experienced some really weird irritations in my private area. I have asked a nurse about this when o went to her my pap smear done but she said it may be the type of pads i wear. I get these irritations whenever my period is near. Like even when its 3 weeks away my vagina gets itchy aggrivated and irritated. I can't have sex with my husband 3 weeks before my period because its just impossible. It will swell and it will hurt for days. I don't know its really weird and this never occurred until after i had my baby in 2010. Its like IM allergic to my own bodily fluids somebody help me if you've experienced the same.",
