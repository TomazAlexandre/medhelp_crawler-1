            "answer": "Hello,From your symptoms the possibility of neuropathy is important to be ruled out. The other possibility is of friction rub or chafing skin which can cause soreness and redness of skin. Neuropathy is common in diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. It can also be due to vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
