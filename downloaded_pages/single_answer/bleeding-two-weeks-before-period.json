            "answer": "Well your ovary/cyst removal was over 2 years ago so I don't think that is associated with what you're experiencing. It sounds like there might be a hormonal imbalance. You should have your doctor do a blood test to check your thyroid and also to check all of your hormones related to your cycle (LH, HCG, progesterone, testosterone, etc.) to see if there are abnormalities.I have slightly high testosterone (and no, I don't have a beard!). It caused ovarian cysts and I stopped ovulating. Not to mention the mood swings! I would go a long time without a period one cycle and then the next I would get my period and bleed for two weeks. I was diagnosed with PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome).I'm not saying you have the same thing. But you definitely should get the blood work done. If it finds an abnormality, then you'll be able to possibly do a sonogram. Part of testing for PCOS is also taking a 3-hr glucose/insulin test because diabetes is associated with this syndrome (I personally do not have the glucose/insulin problem).",
