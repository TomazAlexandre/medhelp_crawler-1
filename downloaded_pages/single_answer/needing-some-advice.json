            "answer": "Zeldox is less likely to cause prolactin elevation. If that doesn't work out Abilify is another option. There are no differences in how effective the atypical antipsychotics are, except for Clozaril which is used less because of potential blood dyscreias. But as regards the other atypicals every person reacts differently to each one so I would say give it a try and if it doesn't work out Abilify would probably be the next one they would use. And there are medications in study such as the glutamate antagonists which are far more effective and don't cause tardive dyskinesia, diabetes or prolactin elevation.I'm on glycine an antipsychotic in Phase II FDA study and have made a full recovery as defined by my psychopharmocologist. I will post the link when the study is published. Here's the official study:http://www.schizophrenia.com/research/javitt.htmAnd\u00a0\u00a0link to all medications in study:http://www.psychmeds123.info/Which updates itself. In the meantime see how you react to what you are on and then make a decision from there. Each person is different. Best wishes with your recovery and keep us updated.",

    "question": "I was on resperdal but my prolactin was extremely high.\u00a0\u00a0I was told my doctor it can be very critical if I don't get off of it.\u00a0\u00a0The Resperdal worked well with me.\u00a0\u00a0I was able to sleep at night with no problem and didn't have any suspisions.\u00a0\u00a0I'm now on zeldox hoping I won't have the same problem with my prolactin.\u00a0\u00a0Will I have a chance to be with this drug without that problem?\u00a0\u00a0But first I hope it will not make me suspicious as well.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a good drug that will help me with both problems, and will I eventually be anxiety free and be able to fall asleep at night?\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know, I'm so worried what will happen because these are the only kind of drugs that could help me.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried seroquel but that kind of drug doesn't go well with me.Thank youItalia111",
