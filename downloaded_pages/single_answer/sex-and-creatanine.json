            "answer": "Hi there!A low sexual desire/libido can be caused by a number of reasons like fatigue anemia, a few medications/drugs, hormonal imbalance, depression, stress, anxiety, systemic pathology like diabetes, smoking etc. The most common cause is psychological. You could start by working together with your partner on the psychological factors like stress, inhibition or lack of interest. You might also benefit from behavioral therapy. In case it doesn\u2019t help, I would suggest consulting your family physician for an evaluation for secondary causes, as mentioned above.Hope this helps.Take care!",
