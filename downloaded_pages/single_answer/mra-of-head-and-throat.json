            "answer": "Hi everyone,I have had left sided headache for 3 years which turned to cronic daily headache for the last 6 months - almost unbearable.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a couple\u00a0\u00a0MRI's of the head. Unfortunately, had to change Insurance company in the middle of all this and start with Primary Physician and Nurologist from the beginning again. No prescribed drugs have helped -\u00a0\u00a0including Topamax.\u00a0\u00a0I am\u00a0\u00a0scheduled for nerve block and MRA of the cervical spine. I am very\u00a0\u00a0happy that my Neurologist is moving forward and trying to help me -- just wondering if anyone had same situation and received a medical diagnosis?\u00a0\u00a0Prior to all this happening,\u00a0\u00a0I never had a headache in my entire life.",

    "question": "How much does a MRA of the head and throat show?\u00a0\u00a0Does it just show the vessels, or are there bonuses, like seeing if my thyroid looks right, or my pituitary, or anything like that?The orders for the tests list the reason for tests as \"numbness\".\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure why, but will that affect what the radiologists focus on, or do they check everything out?\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms are dizziness, tremors, loss of balance, fatigue, parasthesia, plus more.I had 2 MRIs that showed multiple small lesions in the white matter, and though I'm 46 and have had great blood pressure, cholesterol, etc. for many years, and never a sign of diabetes.Any ideas?Kathy",
