            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I think your UTI is still persisting. If you have frequent UTI it will be worthwhile to get your blood sugar tested for diabetes. You also need to get urine culture and sensitivity analysis done for infection. This test can only tell you what kind of infection it is and which antibiotic will work.Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 29 year old female prone to UTI's. Most recently I had a UTI treated with a 3 day course of Bactrim. Following this course the most sever symptoms are gone but I still have frequency and an almost constant bladder tingling that makes me think I need to urinate again. The burning upon urination and bladder pain are gone. I am also still waking up most nights at least once to use the bathroom. My only other medical history includes hypothyroidism which is well controlled and being one year postpartum. Is there anything I can do about my remaining symptoms? They are kind of annoying.",
