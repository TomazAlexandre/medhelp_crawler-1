            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor with your parents to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.Fungal infections of the human body are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "Hi, i have had some white patches on my skin which look just like Tinea Versicolor. Just few small patches of discoloration on my belly and my back.The doctors all agreed it was most likely tinea and i used Daktarin and then Itraconozole tablets. However, i noticed the patches are still there. Please bear in mind it has only been 1 month since using the Itraconozole so might take time for color to re-appear.I recently went to a derm and used woods lamp test and she found very very slight evidence of some fungus on my back. However, the mycological sample came back negative for any fungus or yeast infenction so i am rather clueless right now.The patches have not spread anymore and are not vitiligo. I am just wondering what else this could be? Could it simply be some dry skin condition - i avoid using moisturiser because that is bad for Tinea. Also, these spots only started when i went on holiday to Country with humid climate and was on some hormones at the time - this makes me think it was definitely Tinea.Anyone know how long it might take for my color to come back or anything i can do to speed up the process?Any help will be greatly appreciated.",
