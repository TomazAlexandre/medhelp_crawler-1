            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are having repeated infection that is responding to a bacterial cream then get your blood sugar tested both fasting and two hours after food to check your diabetes status. Presence of high blood sugar often causes recurrent infection.The other possibility is that it is a self limiting dermatitis, psoriasis, fungal patch etc that heals on it own. Please consult a skin specialist and if you are already seeing one, then consult another for a second opinion.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Its been about a year since I had a staph infection over my upper body, I was put on bactrim and penicillin twice. My skin cleared up, but i still get these itchy bumps once or twice a month around the same areas where the infections were. Sometimes the bumps will go away but other time i will have to apply bactrim on it. The doctors said its just dry skin, but i know that is not true, can anyone give me some info?",
