            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include infections, inflammations, hormonal/ endocrine issues, trauma. Injuries, neuro-muscular causes etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary care physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed according or specialist acre may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
