    "question": "I found out today I failed my blood glucose test so I have to go back next week for a three hour test. Not to happy about that :( my doctor also mentioned I seemed to be gaining alot of weight fast and thinks my bodyvis retaining alot of fluid. I had preclampsia before does this mean ill end up having it again? Im switching products with high sodium to lower sodium, but due to insane food prices I cant afford to buy 100% nutrtional food like they want all the time. Any of you ladies had a gestional diabetes n preclampsia while.pregnant? What happened with your pregnancy?",
