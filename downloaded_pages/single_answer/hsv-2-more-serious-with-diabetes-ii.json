    "question": "I'm a healthy 52-yr old woman who has recently been diagnosed with HSV-2 (apparently from a former relationship 23 years ago!) and have been in a wonderful (and monogomous) relationship for the past 2 years with a 63-year old man who has diabetes II.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say this has put a halt to our sexual relations, which were previously very frequent.That said, I've been reading up on herpes and immune systems and was wondering if someone with diabetes II and HSV-2 would have more serious outbreaks because of his compromised immune system.\u00a0\u00a0My partner has not yet been tested to see if he has it, but if he does test positive for it, is it likely to be worse for him because of his diabetes?And if he doesn't have it, then obviously his immune system must be working well, since he hasn't been infected by me in 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0(I never had an outbreak until recently, so he would have had to get it from the viral shedding.)I would greatly appreciate any input on this at all. Thanks!",
