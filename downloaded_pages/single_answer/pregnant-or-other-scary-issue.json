    "question": "Hi, I'm a 22yr old student anda scared I might be pregnant, and if it's not the case, that something else is wrong. I haven't had any period or spotting since Jan 4, which was a much lighter and shorter period without pms symptoms. I'm on Micronor (mini-pill) but was taking antibiotics in dec and Jan so I'm concerned they weren't effective, and I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend. I'm always nauseous and extremely tired, and seem to catch every cold and virus out there. I'm also bloated, but no cramps, and have weird cravings. I also have a weird flushed face feeling for the past week, feeling like a sunburn or like I've done a workout.I did urine tests though and came back negative. How likely are false negatives?? I also saw a doctor who sent me for a blood test, which I get results for tomorrow. She said she suspects pregnancy, but also mono, thyroid disease, diabetes, etc. I also looked up leukemia and ovarian cancer who has similar symptoms... Has this ever happene to anyone?",
