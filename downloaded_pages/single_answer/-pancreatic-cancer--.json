    "question": "My sister-in law who is 40yo wf with diabetes has had a sudden weight loss of 30# in 6-8 weeks, increased fatigue, occasional diarrhea, vomiting during the first week of the acute weight loss. CA 19.9 is 54 and CEA is 9. She does not remember the CA125 result. Her color is sallow, but no jaundice of the sclera. She denies any abdominal discomfort or tenderness. No noticable ascites or \"bulging belly\". She is scheduled for a CT with oral contrast 4 days from now. I feel she should be in the hospital. What other things should we be concerned about?",
