            "answer": "Your concern about your husband is warranted.\u00a0\u00a0He is on good medicine for his lung condition.\u00a0\u00a0Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a slowly progressive chronic disease, more rapidly progressive in those who continue to smoke but never to the degree you describe with a fall in FEV1 from 53% predicted to 23% predicted in less than a year, assuming each of these breathing tests were done with his COPD in a stable state; that is he was not having a flare-up, also known as an acute exacerbation, when the 23% value was obtained.\u00a0\u00a0If that is true, one of these values is not valid.\u00a0\u00a0The 54% FEV1 is consistent with the criterion for moderate COPD, not severe COPD.\u00a0\u00a0If his predicted FEV1 truly is greater than 50% of predicted, it would be unusual for him to, as you indicate, \u201cneed to be made comfortable, (with) no energy, very fatigued, with a poor appetite\u201d, on the basis of COPD.\u00a0\u00a0COPD is often associated with depression and, at least some of his symptoms could be due to that.The more likely scenario, given fatigue, no energy and constant thirst is that his diabetes is out of control.\u00a0\u00a0And, if he is on the highest dose of Advair\u00ae HFA (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol) Inhalation Aerosol, that could be contributing to poor control.You should have his blood sugar checked, perhaps by you at home, immediately and arrange for him to be seen by his doctor without delay to:\u00a0\u00a01) assess the state of diabetic control; and 2) repeat the pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and a chest x-ray; and/or 3) request that his doctor arrange for consultation with a lung specialist, also known as a pulmonologist.\u00a0\u00a0Do not delay.",
