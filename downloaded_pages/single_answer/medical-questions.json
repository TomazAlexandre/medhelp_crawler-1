    "question": "Hi there, I need help in figuring out what is happening to me. I have recently had headaches, blurry vision and I can't really focus\u00a0\u00a0at my work place. Also, I get thirsty most of the time and this is not common for me as I don't really drink a lot of water. For the past few days, I have been drinking about 500ml every hour. When walking, I tend to loss my coordination sometimes and even though I am not wearing heels, I can still trip or fall on flat ground. I also have back and joint pain. I tend to get the pain on the left side of my body. I was diagnosed with rheumatic fever when I was 10 and continued taking penicillin until I was 14. I did a blood test when I was 18 and the doctor told me that I was free of it. I am 23 now and I am an avid diver. I don't have any problems underwater but it has been about a month since the last time I went diving. I eat regularly but my colleague says that I look very sick and thin. Please advise.",
