            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis) which can be due to hot or cold weather with low humidity levels, long-term use of air conditioning or central heating, and washing or bathing too much.Other conditions which cause itchy skin are psoriasis,dermatitis, scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",

    "question": "Hello,For about a week now I have been itchy everyday. It started on my hands but quickly turned into an all over itch. The first few days it was relentless, but it has seemed to calm down alittle. It was the worst when I slept, keeping me awake for hours on end, but for the past few nights I have been able to sleep. I live with my daughter and she so far has no shown to be itching. I do notice that there really is no redness or anything on my skin, expect for some pimple like marks that break when I scracth (sorry about the spelling) and bleed, but these are not everywhere I am itchy. What is this and what do I do? I have tried lotions and they do not seem to work. I have also been taking an allergy medicine before I go to bed, but it's hard to tell if it has been helping any. I am otherwise a healthy 23 year old. Thank you.",
