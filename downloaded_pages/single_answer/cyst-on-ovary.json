            "answer": "I've had 3 c-sections. My first was an emergency & I was 9 days past due date. My second was scheduled & performed 15 days early the same applies for my third. Out of the two that were done early it was my third that needed extra oxygen when born. She was fine all in all. I'm in the medical field & I could tell by her cry after delivery that something was different. After giving her oxygen for a few minutes she was finally able to be held by my husband & for me to get to see her closer up & then when I was done she got to ride back with me on the bed. I know my dr. didn't want to do my c-section before 38wks. I wouldn't deliver at 37wks & I'm sure your dr. wouldn't allow it due to that being a crucial time for development unless you or the baby absolutely needed it done then. Ask your dr. to do it at 38wks. Mine too with my third was scheduled at 39wks, but we ended up moving it up in my 37th wk due to her size & I was having such a hard time breathing. Good luck to you & your little one!! I'm sure everything will be just fine!!",
