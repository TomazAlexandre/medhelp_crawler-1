    "question": "Hi there. So with baby girl #1 I failed the 1-hour test but passed the 3-hour test. Had no additional ultrasounds after the anatomy scan at 20 weeks or so. She was born 7lb11oz.Now preg with boy and they wanted to check on a fibroid so I had a 36 week scan. He\u00a0\u00a0is already 7lb110z at 36 weeks and fluid measured 27 (ideal max is 25) so they suspect diabetes. But with him I passed the 1hr and never took a 3 hour. Now I have to take a 3hr at almost 37 weeks. Anyone else have this happen to them?DH said all the boys in his family weighed over 9 pounds but that would not explain the fluid would it? Feel like it's too late and damage is done :(",
