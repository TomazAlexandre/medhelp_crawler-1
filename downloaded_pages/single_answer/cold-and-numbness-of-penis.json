            "answer": "Hello,The tingling you feel at the tip of penis can be due to STD, an allergic reaction (say to body lotions, condoms, soaps etc) or it can be a skin condition like eczema, dermatitis etc or it can be a fungal infection. Frequent rubbing of clothes on a hypersensitive tip of penis can often keep it stimulated and cause increased semen volume. Get yourself tested for diabetes as presence of this can cause mild infection. I understand you have undergone a STD panel but see if it includes all of these: gonorrhea, chlamydia, mycoplasma, ureaplasma urealyticum, trichomonas, syphilis and herpes). If all these are ruled out then a peripheral artery disease (by dopplar ultrasound) and a peripheral nerve disease will have to be looked into.Hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "About 9 months ago I started having issues with numbness and physical coldness of my penis.\u00a0\u00a0My wife would tell me that it felt like a icecube.\u00a0\u00a0Over a few months it became a persistant issue and I went to a Urologist.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with a accute prostate infection and was on Cipro for 6 months althought no infection seemed to show\u00a0\u00a0of the urine tests at each doctor's visit.\u00a0\u00a0I was also placed on Flomax and meds to shrink the prostate for the last 5 months.\u00a0\u00a0I'm now off the meds and the doctor says the prostate is fine.My penis is still numb and cold.\u00a0\u00a0Erections are few and far between...and only with a lot of work from the wife and/or cialis.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor says don't worry about it...you have ED and wants me to go on daily cialis.I worry that there's a issue with bloodflow, nerve damage, something still wrong or damaged in the prostate or possibly some other problem that's causing the issues in the penis to persist.\u00a0\u00a0My Doc says...he doesn't want to take my money...live with it and take cialis.Do you see any alternatives I can reasonably explore with another Dr. for a second opinion?????",
