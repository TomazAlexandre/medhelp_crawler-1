            "answer": "It is normal for the blood sugar to go a little crazy during the adolescent yrs. In general diabetics in this age range need to up their insulin levels, because of the rise in hormone levels.His symptoms of throwing up and nausea etc. could be due to his extreme blood sugar, but are definitely worth noting and looking into.I think the first thing that should be done is to re-evaluate his insulin needs and make changes to his treatment plan, see if things improve with his other symptoms, if not then at least you've ruled out one things and can move forward in finding out what might be the culprit.",

    "question": "My younger brother is 14 years of age, he was diagnosed with type 1 when he was just 5, my parents since then have been very carefull and he has never had any complications. Over the past year however his readings are constantly up and down, they are ranging bewtween lo and 40! He is not doing anythign differently and has has to take off at least 2 days a week from school. He is an extremely intelligent boy and is starting to fall behind. We have been to the doctors and they did tests and have ruled out celeac (apologies for the mispelling). We have spoken to his nurses in the clinic who are going to take him in to do tests but is there anything I could advise my parents to do until we find out? His symtoms are, throwing up, not being able to get up in the moring, reflux and a range of other ones too. Could this just be him hitting puberty?Thanks!!",
