    "question": "I have a 19 year old Autistic son who has type one Diabetes and has been fighting Hodgkins Lymphoma for 5 years now. He recently came down with a bad cold that turned to a bad cough and a nasal infection. After two weeks of that, we had his chest x-rayed and were told he was fine. He was placed on Biaxin and sent home. We are not just finishing week three of this ordeal and he is experiencing extreem fatigue, loss of appetite, vomiting and severe sweating to the point that it looks like he just got out of a shower. The Diabetes is under control with normal numbers taken multiple times a day and the cancer Dr tells us his symptoms are not related to his treatments or cancer. My son cant express what he is feeling and I'm afraid something is very wrong. Any ideas on where to start would be appreciated.",
