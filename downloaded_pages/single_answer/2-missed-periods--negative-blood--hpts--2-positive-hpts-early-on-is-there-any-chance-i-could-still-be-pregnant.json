            "answer": "Hi!If you were my patient, I would advise you that I think you probably WERE pregnant, but have had a miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0A chemical pregnancy is the term that we use for a pregnancy that is only detectable by the very sensitive modern tests, and which produces no real symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Back in the days before these tests, we would never have known you were pregnant at all.The pregnancy hormone has probably delayed your cycle.\u00a0\u00a0Now that you no longer have hcg in your system, your cycle should return to normal within 4-6 weeks.I would expect that the ultrasound wouldn't show too much.\u00a0\u00a0I have often been wrong, however!Good luck!Dr B",

    "question": "I am currently 30 days late for my period. I love my Dr. She is amazing. I went to her at 6 days late, with two positive HPT's. She did a blood serum test, which came back negative. She told me that I was probably having a chemical pregnancy. She said come back in 2 weeks if you haven't started your period. I went back, and told her I didn't think I was pregnant because I still couldn't get a positive HPT. She agreed that at this far along I should be testing positive. She did blood tests to check and make sure all of my parts were producing enough of the right chemicals and hormones. She told me that everything came back normal. My Prolactin was at 10.4 which falls into a grey area of possibly pregnant, and possibly normal. She even checked me for Diabetes (because of family history), which came back negative. We ruled out stress because well I am just not stressed. I do morning and evening meditations, and life has been pretty good lately. I haven't gained or lost significant amounts of weight. I exercise regularly. I have no history of cysts, or cancer. I just had a pelvic exam done five months ago, and that came back fine. So, she is now sending me in for an ultrasound tomorrow at 9:30. I will be 31 days late. Approximately 8 weeks if I am.I just want to know is it possible for me to be pregnant and still be getting all of these negative HPT's? What else could it be? I am usually one or two days late if ever. I'm just not sure what to expect tomorrow.",
