            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Impaired depth perception is seen in strabismus. However since your husband is a pilot, he must be having regular eye checkups. However sometimes this is felt only in one eye or as a movement parallax, where things closer to you appear brighter and move faster than things away from you.However in your husband\u2019s case I feel there is a good chance that all symptoms are due to diabetes. Ofcourse I cannot comment for sure. The list of tests does not mention the result of blood glucose, GTT, urinary glucose and ketones etc.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
