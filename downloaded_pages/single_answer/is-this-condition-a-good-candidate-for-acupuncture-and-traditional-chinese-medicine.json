What other symptoms are present and what initial diagnostic tests were done?\u00a0\u00a0Numbness and burning sensation suggests neurological issues and may warrant neurology consult. Complementary and alternative medicine such as acupuncture may also help. In Eastern medicine, any imbalance of the chi may present symptoms and this may be corrected with modalities such as acupuncture. You can ask a referral to a certified acupuncturist and have this evaluated also. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Main Question:\u00a0\u00a0Is this condition a good candidate for Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine?I'm a male and getting close to 50. My health is good, in general, and I am in pretty good shape -- I can still climb mountains as a hobby -- despite the fact that I still feel the effects of a fractured tibial plateau, which required surgery and a year of recovery, back\u00a0\u00a0in 2009.A couple of years ago, I experienced frequent tearing and burning sensation along the top of my feet and heels, generally experienced when they were stretched during flexing or pointing toes movement.Last year, some of those areas suddenly became numb affecting both feet. The numbness was felt most acutely on the tops of my feet. This gave the sensation of wearing socks, and also resulted in an uncomfortable aching when ever my feet got the slightest bit cold.What disturbs me is that over a year later, I am still experiencing the numbness in my left foot. The right foot regained sensitivity almost overnight after 6 months or so. Having done nothing to cause this return of sensation, I am not sure why it occurred.I have seen my primary care physician, who ruled out things like diabetes, blood clots, and poor arch support from footwear.",
