            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.Fungal infections are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.Calamine lotion should also help to some extent with the burning sensation.You could take some oral antihistamine medications like cetrizine or loratadine Do not use any cosmetic products. Wear lose comfortable footwear and preferably cotton socks.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",
