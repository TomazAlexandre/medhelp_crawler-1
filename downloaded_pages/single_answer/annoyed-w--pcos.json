            "answer": "Have they tested you to check for Type II diabetes? I was diagnosed 12 years ago with PCOS. I am also 26 years old. In 2005 my doctor ran some test and discovered the my body was producing too much insulin. He then put me on metformin 500mg 3 times a day. Since then I have also been put on Actoplus which is a medicine to treat type II diabetes and was recently switched to Glipizide. PCOS can cause increased insulin production. If not controlled it can lead to full blown diabetes in a matter of years. In 2005 I was told that I would be a full blown diabetic by now, but luckily the medicines have been able to control my insulin production therefore prolonging the inevitable. I am not trying to scare you by telling you all this, but it is very serious. PCOS will normally get better with weight loss, but if there is a problem with your insulin production you normally wont lose the weight because your body is not dissolving the sugars that you take in.PCOS can also cause high cholesterol. It literally affects every aspect of your body even though the cysts are normally on the ovaries and uterus.",
