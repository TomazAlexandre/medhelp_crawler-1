            "answer": "I also have type1 . Im 33yrs old and struggle withmy weight as well. My sugars are good most of the time (hem A1C 5.7)\u00a0\u00a0but I haven't been able to xerecise as often as I'd like (2 kids). But even when I was working out 5 days\u00a0\u00a0a week I couldn't quite make it to my goal or ideal weight. We do have to realize though that as we get older our metabolism can slow so that may be a factor!I do know that I read that when you take insulin it can sometimes store extra fat.Just a thought but, have you had you thyroid tested? I'm sure your endocrinologist checks that but thought I'd mention it because I also have hypothroidism. That contributes to slow progress of weight loss as well.I can understand your aggervation of trying to loose but not getting the results you want .But keep up the good work. Having blood sugars in good control is key for your overall health and thats something to be happy about :) !!!",
