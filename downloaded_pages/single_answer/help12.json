            "answer": "Hi there,The common causes of increased urination are overactive bladder, urinary tract infection, urinary incontinence, diabetes, vaginitis and pregnancy .Drinking many liquids may also cause frequent urination. In UTI or any other urinary system problem a person will have fever, back or side pain, vomiting, or shaking chills. In diabetes a person will have increased thirst or appetite, fatigue, or sudden weight loss. You should consult a doctor and rule out above mentioned possibilities. Do keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",
