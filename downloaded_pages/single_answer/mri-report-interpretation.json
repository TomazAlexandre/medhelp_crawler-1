            "answer": "Hi,This report means there is acute infaction of internal capsule,corona radiata and centrum semiovale.Also there is bilateral thalamic infarction which is old one.Overall it says that patient is having stroke meaning some parts of brain are dead due to inadequate\u00a0\u00a0blood supply.Patient requiers antiplatlet drugs,antilipids drugs and if hypertension/diabetes then to manage that also.Stroke rehablitation therapy may be of great value.Hope to answer your worries.Reagards,",

    "question": "The following report was issued after a brain MRI. Unfortunately the neurologist did not provide sufficient explanation regarding the report's meaning. I would appreciate any help in interpreting this report in terms of its impact on the patient's health.\"On the DWI there is hyperintense signal in the corticospinal tracts and beginning from image 11 to 23; posterior limb of the internal capsule to corona radiata and centrum semiovale.\u00a0\u00a0There is also increase signal in the splenium of the corpus collosum.\u00a0\u00a0Since the other T2 weighted sequences appear to have normal signal in these regions these findings are suspicious for cytotoxic edema/ infarction.Image 12 of theT2 Ax shows bilateral discrete thalamic hyperintense lesions which are likely chronic lacunar infarctions.\u00a0\u00a0The absence of corresponding DWI signal in this area suggests that it is subacute to chronic.\"",
