    "question": "Ok, I have two friends that have lost a significant amount of weight on the hcg protocol. It is not from doing the 600 calorie diet. these are women who have dealt with obesity their whole lives. One lost 60 lbs in 80 days and the other lost 90 lbs in 60 days. I have lost 50lbs in 40 days. My first friends primary care doctor sent her to the hcg clinic because of her diabetes and heart. he needed her to lose weight fast. It worked. You feel better you look better and it gets rid of bad fat. She is now off of her diabetes med and cholesterol meds. If I would not have seen it and done It I would not have believed it.All you doubters have never been overweight or struggled with obesity. I have been to a nutritionist, had my thyroid checked become a runner and seriously nothing worked until i did this. So all you doubtersdo not doubt it any more. unless you have done it please be kind!!!",
