            "answer": "Hi!Normally a grade II maturity placenta is seen after 30 weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0So, in your case it has matured earlier than expected. This can slow down the blood supply to the baby. So, you need to go for regular check ups to monitor the placenta and growth of baby. Do deep breathing exercises. While sleeping or resting try to spend maximum time in left lateral position as this increases blood supply to the placenta. Also discuss this with your Obs and Gyn.Lateral ventricles are prominent at 11 weeks of gestation and thereafter decrease in prominence as compared to rest of the brain. So in your case the size is normal. If there is prominence of ventricles at 29 weeks (10mm or more) then this can be due to chromosomal abnormalities, increased CSF formation, poor brain development or taking some drugs not advised during pregnancy or due to maternal diabetes. At times the cause is not known. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
