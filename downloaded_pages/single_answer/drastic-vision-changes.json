I heard this was common.\u00a0\u00a0I also had gestational diabetes.Recently my vision suddenly changed and I couldn't see very well out of my contacts.\u00a0\u00a0I had an exam and found it jumped from -6 to -7... another whole point.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with diabetes a few weeks later.I have also been noticing tired eyes and more floaters.\u00a0\u00a0Are these things related to my diabetes or just coincidence?",
