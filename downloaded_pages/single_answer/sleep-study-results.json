            "answer": "I'm not too clear on how your number was reported. Does 61 mean 61 times per hour you stopped breathing or 61 times total that night? If it's 61 times per hour, then you have severe sleep apnea. Untreated sleep apnea can cause or aggravate depression, anxiety, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, heart attack or stroke. I recommend that you call back your sleep doctor to formally discuss the results. It's better that you understand fully what's going on and look at other options for CPAP treatment. Many people have terrible times with the mask in the sleep lab and do fine one they're home. Sometimes they have to go through a few machines or masks, and through trial and error, it's possible. There are also other ways of treating sleep apnea besides CPAP.",

    "question": "I had a sleep study then came back and slept with a CPAP.\u00a0\u00a0The sleep study showed I had 61 events each time I was in REM sleep, but nothing in the other sleep states.\u00a0\u00a0In order to keep the airway open the sleep tech had the air pressure so strong the air pillow was lifting off my face.\u00a0\u00a0He switched the mask to a fuller style.\u00a0\u00a0After several hours of not being able to sleep he gave me an Ambien. I could not wait for morning and have not returned their calls as I don't see how I could sleep with that CPAP. What other options do I have? Is my apnea severe enough to worry about anyway?",
