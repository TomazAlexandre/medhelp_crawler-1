            "answer": "Hi,How are you? The surgical repair of retinal detachments is usually successful and may take several months before vision returns to its final level. However, the final outcome for vision depends on several factors and close follow-up by an ophthalmologist\u00a0\u00a0is required. If it has been 11 months already, you may benefit from seeking another doctor's opinion for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",
