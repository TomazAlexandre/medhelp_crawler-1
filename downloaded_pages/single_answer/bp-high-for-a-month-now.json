    "question": "Hi everyone. Hope all is well with your growing babies. Just a little frustrated as I have had high blood pressure vitals the past 4 weeks. I really hope this doesnt cause my doctor to take my son early as I also have gestational diabetes :/. Just need some form of reassurance that everything will be ok. We are 35 weeks so just a few more right?? Sorry for ranting just no one understands except other concerned mothers.",
