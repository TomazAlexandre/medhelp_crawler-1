            "answer": "The diarrhea can be due to unregulated release of bile into the duodenum which unfortunately can happen after GB surgery. You may want to make sure you're following a low fat diet which can sometimes help. In addition, if the diet doesn't correct things, talk to your doc about using some form of bile-binding medication like questran which can help to control the diarrhea.",

    "question": "I had surgery last summer to get gall stones removed, I was sent home but returned the next day due to severe pain. He told me it was trapped wind but i was given morphine, I had blood poisoning due to a leak. I got a stint and drain put in, which remained for five weeks before everthing had left my system. He told me I had an extra duct in my gall bladder. Since then I've been suffering with back pains and diarrea. It's leaving me feeling down and I'm afraid to leave the house unless I have an empty stomach.\u00a0\u00a0I also have type two diabetes and I'm worried this is really damaging my body. Do I need to see a doctoror is there anything i can do at home?",
