    "question": "Hi i have been having unusual symptoms since encounter with a woman.\u00a0\u00a0All i did was put my fingers inside her for about 5 seconds max.\u00a0\u00a0Then her mouth 5 seconds max.\u00a0\u00a0I did not touch my mouth or penis with that hand afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0I did have an HPV wart on my finger and it splits some times.\u00a0\u00a0It was this time but it wasnt even bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0It was pink but it didnt even scab up.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure if it was deep enough to need to scab.\u00a0\u00a0I have naseau and headaches and high BP about 2 to 4 weeks afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0Then loose stools and fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Then 2 months afterwards my wife has headaches and inverse psoriasis.\u00a0\u00a0They did herpes test and nothing.\u00a0\u00a06 months later and still symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0She developed diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0At 6 months and a week negative for HIV and all the bacterial ones.\u00a0\u00a0They didnt test hepatitis b and c or herpes.\u00a0\u00a0I can and cant rule out those though.\u00a0\u00a0Sysmptoms started around 2 or 3 weeks so i wouldnt think hep b.\u00a0\u00a0Plus it clears in most adults and both of us dont even rarer i would think.\u00a0\u00a0Hep c makes the most sense symptoms wise out of the three but i wasnt bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0Plus 5 seconds exposure to it.\u00a0\u00a0Plus usually not transmitted sexually unless involving blood.\u00a0\u00a0Seems less likely.\u00a0\u00a0Herpes cause constant symptoms for 8 months now.\u00a0\u00a0They say complications is rare so both of us plus no blisters for either of us yet unless her inverse psoriasis was that but the gyno saw it and suspected inverse psoriasis.\u00a0\u00a0After she got the it was psoriasis, we had sex and oral.\u00a0\u00a0My mouth hadnt been the same since.\u00a0\u00a0Feels like my mouth is scrubbed out with a green scrubbie pad.\u00a0\u00a0Went to dentist the other day but they didnt say anything was wrong.\u00a0\u00a0So i am confused.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any ideas?",
