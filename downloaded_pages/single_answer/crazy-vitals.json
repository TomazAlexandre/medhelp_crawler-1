            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.A complete clinical examination and work up is important for confirming the exact cause of your illness. A fluctuating heart rate can be due to heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, hyperthyroidism, smoking, drug or alcohol abuse, stress or medications. There can be nonmedical causes of fluctuations in blood pressure like tension, stress etc.Higher level of fluctuating blood pressure can lead to complications like stroke, paralysis, heart disease, to renal failure and death. It is best to see a cardiologist and get evaluated. Treatment will be specific based on the cause. Keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",
