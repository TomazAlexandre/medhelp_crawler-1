    "question": "Hello I am new to this site and found it while searching up symptoms and thought \"Why Not?\"My question is:Lately, for the past week or so I have had really Sore eyes that appear to be Bloodshot and I wear prescribed glasses all day,everyday. I just had my eyes tested Last year in November and was told my eyes have not changed and there was no worries on anything. Now, I do not know my Full family history on eyes but i do know Glaucoma, Night blindness, double vision, Diabetes and MANY other problems is common. I am active, I don't even bother with Cable because of my activity level. Now recently, I put my glasses on and noticed that I could not read my MSN IM or even the keyboard. My eyes are bloodshot and sore. Should I worry and call my doctor or just wait it out? I know night blindness and double vision is a main concern because my mother had it from the time she was 18. I am 20 years old.",
