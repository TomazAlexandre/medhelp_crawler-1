    "question": "Well first of all a little backround, I have been a type 1 diabetic since I was 12. I have always been a normal a tad above normal weight. I have had four boys, After my last son in August 2005, of course the body was wacked out, didn't think much about it.....since I know it could take up to a year, well after having these horrible highs and major lows....I learned how to actually treat my diabetes....but something still didn't seem right with me.....all of a sudden I was insulin senstive, I had a goiter for a while remember my endo telling me back in 04, and my level was a tad low, but nothing to worry about, but the next time it was normal, so i shrugged that off back then....well I decided to pump then weight loss a lot I was 137 pounds at start in March, I am now 105, increased insulin sensitivty, sensitivity to cold, mood swings, lighter periods....I am tired, I have energy sometimes I fight it a lot...but then I just wear out, I have read the countless and countless books and been on forums and test my bg's all the time I cannot level off, I used to know how to, nothing works....OkI just had the doc test my thyroid hormones, I told him he should test for antibodies and he was a smarty pants in saying you will show something if it affecting your thyroid hormone but I read every where else that that is not always the case, my old endo ignored these classic symptoms and my symptoms of major anxiety and balled it all up with I was too emotinally unstable to handle a pump...and insulin pump....something is wrong with me, I am sickly getting too thin, I have upped my calories and carbs just to gain weight, it doesn't work, I get mad if I am cold, and my moods are extremely horrible, my sex drive is way down....I just don't know what to do....I don't have insurance, so i don't know what options I have is this doc, see's nothing wrong with my thyroid, am I being to quick to judge, because this is not me....I have never been the same after my last son, ever, the diabetes or my overall feelings about life, and everything else.....The anxiety is the worst and the insulin sensitivty that I all of a sudden have is not normal, you can't heal type 1 diabetes, and I read that you can use less insulin if your thyroid is off...Tell me I am not crazy.....I just want to feel better....",
