    "question": "I have daily dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0I have been worked up for ears, eyes, heart, blood work (diabetes) and even at Duke University for Meniere's disease but no one can find the cause of my dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0During workups, Dr's diagnosed me as being hypertensive and overweight but nothing more eventhough I tell them I have a 10% reduction in hearing for my right ear and tinnitus in both ears.\u00a0\u00a0I used to have a \"fishbowl\" feeling which is helped by the Klonopin I was prescribed. My MRI from the ENT shows no tumors and my inner ear is clear of fluid, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I can sit and feel as though I am falling. When my dizziness hits, it is hard to walk because my legs are not stable but I must walk to get into bed.\u00a0\u00a0I have never thrown up and I don't always feel nauseated; just dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0I am now going to embark on a sleep study hoping this may uncover something.\u00a0\u00a0I am talking to a psychiatrist because Duke University said my dizziness was due to depression and I've tried 4 different meds including paxil, zoloft, effexor and prozac.\u00a0\u00a0I also stopped medications thinking they were causing the dizziness but to no avail.\u00a0\u00a0The dizziness hits me every day around 10 to noon and I can only get rid of it if I lay down and sleep for 2 to 3 hours. I've tried Antivert and continued to stay up but to no avail.\u00a0\u00a0After sleeping, I am fine to ride in cars, move around, do yard work, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Never had a problem at night with dizziness and this baffles me.\u00a0\u00a0If I were truly depressed and that was what is causing my dizziness, wouldn't I be dizzy ALL day?\u00a0\u00a0My work suffers and I am aggravated that I can not find a solution. I have read testimonials for cervical injuries to which I can not remember trauma so I have ruled this out and I am also considering being checked for Lyme disease.\u00a0\u00a0I am running out of possibilities as to what is causing my dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0I am going on 2 years now.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any help as to other tests to try or possible causes of my dizziness.",
