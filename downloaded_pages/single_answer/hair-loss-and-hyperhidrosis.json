    "question": "My son has hair loss and thinning hair for about 1 year, so I thought he has male pattern baldness because he has receding hairline and thinning on top of his head. We went to hair specialist who studied trichology and my son had microscopic hair analysis. The specialist said he has scalp hyperhidrosis and the excessive lactic acid is causing hair thinning and hair loss. I have never heard of scalp hyperhidrosis and my son's thinning and hair loss look just like someone having MPB. I like to know that someone who has scalp hyperhidrosis loses and thins hair like the person who has male pattern baldness.",
