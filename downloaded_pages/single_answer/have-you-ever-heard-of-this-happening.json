    "question": "I am a 49 yr female with Type I Diabetes for the last 37 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have diabetic retinopathy and have vision in only one eye.\u00a0\u00a0I had extensive laser done in the good eye 18 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0It was done in the peripheral part of the retina all around.\u00a0\u00a0My vision in my good eye is 20/25.\u00a0\u00a0Nearly one month ago I started to experience shimmering with sparkles all around the peripheral and it is CONSTANT.\u00a0\u00a0All day every day.\u00a0\u00a0No headache.\u00a0\u00a0I've had the following tests:\u00a0\u00a0MRI, MRI of the Carotid artery as well, CT Scan, Visual Acuity Test, complete Retinal\u00a0\u00a0Exam, Angiogram of the Retina, Slit lamp exam, every exam possible!\u00a0\u00a0All came out normal, other than the laser scars on my retina which have been there for 18 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have not had laser since then and that was 1990.I've been to 3 Retina Specialists, a Neuro Opthamologist and now I am going to a Neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0The Retina doctors flatly told me there was nothing they could do for me, they have never seen or heard of this situation going on constantly and the Neuro Opto doctor said she has seen this only rarely and most of the time, it goes away on it's own.\u00a0\u00a0But not always.\u00a0\u00a0She diagnosed it as Atypical Ocular Migraine secondary to Retinal changes due to age.Because I only have vision in ONE eye, I feel as if I'm going insane.\u00a0\u00a0I've been taking Xanax for anxiety but don't want to get addicted.\u00a0\u00a0I just need to hear that there are other people who have this CONSTANT shimmering,\u00a0\u00a0 There is no headache.\u00a0\u00a0I did have a small ischemic stroke 3 years ago, but MRI said there was no indication of another one or TIA.PLEASE HELP and tell me there are meds to calm this shimmering down or make it go away!!!!!Thank you for your time.",
