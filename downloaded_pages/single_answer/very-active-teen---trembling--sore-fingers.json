            "answer": "Hi!Since there is trembling and pain, pinched nerves could be a cause.\u00a0\u00a0Before resuming any sport, this aspect should be investigated through nerve conduction studies and MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine. Tendon and muscle injury is another possibility. It can also be peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or thyroid disorder.

    "question": "Thank you in advance for reading my question.My daughter is 15 and in very good overall health.\u00a0\u00a0She is quite athletic, and plays high school basketball and softball, as well as competitive travel fastpitch softball for 6 months per year from May to November.\u00a0\u00a0She sees a personal trainer 2X per week and works out regularly on her own.She is a pitcher for her fastpitch softball team, and sees her pitching instructor regularly.\u00a0\u00a0She has been pitching for about 5-6 years now.\u00a0\u00a0A few weekends ago, at a tournament, she began experiencing symptoms she has never felt before.The fingertips on her pitching (right) hand began hurting.\u00a0\u00a0She always has a few rough spots on her fingers from the laces on the softball, but she described it as a deeper pain, as if her fingertips were bruised.\u00a0\u00a0There are no visual changes noted with her fingers.\u00a0\u00a0I assumed it was due to pitching, but later that day, she said that her left fingertips were feeling the same way.\u00a0\u00a0She says they are tender all the time now, as if she had cut all over her fingernails too short.\u00a0\u00a0When she presses on them, they feel bruised.\u00a0\u00a0Within the last 1-2 weeks, she has noticed that her fingers are trembling spontaneously for a few seconds, then they will quit.\u00a0\u00a0Her fingers are quite weak now, and she is having trouble gripping the bat, the ball, and even catching with her glove.\u00a0\u00a0She rarely complains about injuries, but this is really affecting her.\u00a0\u00a0When she is pitching, I notice her shaking her right hand.\u00a0\u00a0We have tried ibuprofen, ice, pain relief, etc, but we can't seem to remedy it.Any ideas?Thank you again!",
