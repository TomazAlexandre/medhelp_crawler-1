            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.It could be that the post operative swelling is taking longer to settle down. Hope diabetes has been ruled out, this can delay the healing. Sometimes fungal infections can delay the healing. Check with your doctor to rule out this condition. In the meantime continue with your medications and vocal therapy. Good Luck with your recovery.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "It's been two months since I had surgery to remove a cyst and nodules on my vocal cords. Because of persistant swelling and redness in my larynx, I was on vocal rest for 7 wks. and only now can speak a little, when it's quiet. My voice is a lot higher due to the swelling, and hoarse. When I speak even for a short while my throat is very sore. I was completely compliant during vocal rest, very careful. I take meds for reflux, and stay on a pretty good diet. I have taken antibiotics, no smoking, alcohol, allergies - actually they gave me Nasonex to use in case of. I have an excellent doctor and vocal therapist whom are among the best in the business. I've been scoped at least 8 times since surgery, and the surfaces of each vocal fold look good and move well. They are just swollen beyond that. It's a mystery as to why I am not healing. They are still working with me, but I am wondering if anyone else has had an experience similar to this or has any ideas. Thank you :)",
