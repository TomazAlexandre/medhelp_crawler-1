            "answer": "I'm unclear if you are a person currently diagnosed with diabetes. If so: Diabetes can cause a sweet or fruity smell to the breath if you are spilling ketones in your urine. This can be very dangerous and quickly become a medical emergency. Do you test your blood sugar regularly? Are you consistently over 300? Then you are in danger of DKA. If you start to experience flu-like symptoms you need to go to the ER. Otherwise see your doctor to help you get the numbers down.If you have not been diagnosed with diabetes, a sweet smell to the breath can be a sign that you have very high blood sugar and need to see a doctor right away. The same thing applies as above: go to the ER if you start to vomit and have flu-like symptoms. But you are describing it as more alcohol related than sweet or fruity. This might indicate something else, but whatever it is you should see your doctor.",
