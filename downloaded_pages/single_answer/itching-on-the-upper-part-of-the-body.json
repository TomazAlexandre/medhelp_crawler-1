            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin without any rash can be due to liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. Your father should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. If the symptoms persist then he should get it evaluated from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
