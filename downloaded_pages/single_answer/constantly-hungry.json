            "answer": "You referred to blood glucose numbers, but you don't say when you test. Random blood sugars don't mean a lot (unless they are very high). If those are fasting blood sugars they are a tad high. I would also test two hours after eating and see what you get (It should be under 140). Your increased hunger could be from your diabetes, but if your diabetes is controlled, than you need to look elsewhere. Have you had your thyroid levels checked? I would see your doctor, and check your thyroid. If your blood sugar numbers are going up you also might want to be sure you are in fact, type 2. 20% of type 2's were misdiagnosed and are in fact LADA, a slower onset version of type 1. At any rate, something is causing this hunger so I would talk with your doctor.",

    "question": "I am constantly hungry. About a year and a half ago, my doctor diagnosed me with Type 2 (my A1C was 7.2 or so). So I started working out, ate like\u00a0\u00a0a model dietary citizen and 6 months later it was 5.4. I\"ve lost about 45 lbs in a year.But in the 6 months since, I've had a couple of occurrences of this extreme hunger (and in the midst of one right now). Unlike my typical hunger, these hunger pangs come from the top of my stomach, whereas other hunger (or 'real' hunger as I call it) comes from lower, deeper. I've not changed my diet much, but in the last couple of months I have been cheating more. However, I've sort of tested myself by eating certain foods to gauge if that could be the culprit, but it doesn't matter what I eat.The first time this happened, I tested my blood glucose and I was in between 90-100 each time. The hunger pangs lasted for about 5 days. I honestly thought I had a worm or something. But it passed, and life got back to normal. But it's happened again-- i'm now on day 8 of this and frankly, it's pretty debilitating. I know I can't really be hungry, but it's very worrisome to me. My blood glucose is higher this time (I have slipped on my regimen, evidently). Now I'm 95-135 or so. So, what's going on? I'm freaking out. Thanks.",
