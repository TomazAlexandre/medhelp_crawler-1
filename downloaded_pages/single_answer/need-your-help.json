            "answer": "I get the same thing because while your asleep your blood sugar gets too low and you get hypoglycemia then it goes away when I drink something with a lot of sugar. My legs feel like spaghetti and have so little strength that its sometimes takes 3 trys to open a refridgerator and all my organs start feeling really weird and it feels like someone is sitting on my chest so I can't breath. I think I have diabetes but I don't know forsure since I don't want to go to a hospital. If you have the same symptoms as I do then go and get tested for type 1 diabetes.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemiahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus",

    "question": "I'm 18 years old and I'm tired every second of every day. Even if I sleep for 12 hours I'll still feel weak and really tired the next day. This has been going on for 2 years now. I've been to the doctors and had a blood test and I found out I'm very low on iron. I've been taking 3 iron tablets a day for the last 4 months and theres still no change. I've tried eating foods rich in iron such as red meat as well. I know it sounds stupid but I feel like theres something else wrong with me. Its ruining my life because I can no longer spend as much time with my friends and I'm usually in bed by 7! I need some help but I don't know what other tests the doctor can offer. Please help!",
