    "question": "Due to my job shifts being changed from morning to night, I've been having to adjust to a new sleeping schedule.. which isn't very easy for me to do. I've been getting 2-3 hours a sleep for the past month and often wake up to eye pain. I am worried it may lead to something more serious like AION. I heard it was near impossible to diagnose AION with the condition not having warning symptoms. I am trying to get more rest, but what can I do to avoid serious conditions to the eye without sleep?",
