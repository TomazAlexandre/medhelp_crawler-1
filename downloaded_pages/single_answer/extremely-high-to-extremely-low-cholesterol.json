    "question": "Before being diagnosed with diabetes in April my cholesterol levels were ridiculously high (these are real numbers):Cholesterol: 522HDL: >10Triglycerides: 1680The rest could not be calculated.My doctor prescribed Crestor 10 mg once a day and directed me to a endocrinologist for my diabetes treatment.Not long after he retested me agin with the following results:Cholesterol: 193HDL: 25Triglycerides: 346LDL: 99Chol/HDL Ratio: 7.7Things seemed to be improving. My endo also wanted a 3rd Lipid Panel for my visit in 2 weeks and these were the following results which have me slightly frightened:Cholesterol: 71HDL: 31Triglycerides: 143LDL: 11 (Is this possible?!)Chol/HDL Ratio: 2.3I assume the Crestor and diabetes control drove things down to this level but I'm wondering if there is some sort of liver damage from the Crestor? Is it possible to have a higher HDL than LDL? And is that low an LDL dangerous?I'm just wondering if I need to see my doctor sooner. Thank you in advance for your help.",
