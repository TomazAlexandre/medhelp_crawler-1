    "question": "My boyfriend has been complaining of an uncomfortable burning sensation on his scrotum for the past couple of days and his testicle area looks slightly larger than usual. I have been tested recently for gonorrhea and chlamydia but the tests were negative. He has also very recently been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and is now on insulin.\u00a0\u00a0For the past 6 months before he was diagnosed his sex drive was very low, but since being on insulin (about 3 weeks) his sex drive has improved a great deal. He is getting erections quite often and has been having sexual dreams. Could this possibly have anything to do with it?",
