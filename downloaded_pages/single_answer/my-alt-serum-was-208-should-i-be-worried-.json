    "question": "Hi There,I am 29, 5 ft 9, my weight is 225lbs. I don't have diabetes. I very rarely drink, I did have an unhealthy diet with lots of junk food and no exercise (started healthy eating 2 weeks ago).I had a blood test 2 years ago and my liver function was pretty normal, I was told (after an ultra sound) that I had some fatty liver deposits in my liver but nothing more was said. My cholesterol level was higher than normal as well.I just recently had a liver function test and I was told that my levels were elevated across the board. my highest being ALT serum which is 208. My doctor asked what has changed since then, to which i said \"I have been taking a reservatrol supplement in liquid form, aswell as niacin, biotin, magnesium, vitamin D and tryptophan\".\u00a0\u00a0She did seem to look at the reservatrol as a possible cause for my elevate enzyme levels, because it is broken down in the liver.She has told me to come off all of my supplements and in one week I will do another blood test, I am extremely concerned by the elevated readings especially the Alt Serum and if there is another Alt reading that was\u00a0\u00a0high too. I read everywhere that it is a sign of liver damage.I am worried that i might have a problem with my liver that cannot be reversed. Is it possible to have a high Alt reading and not have any liver problem?Is a reading at this particular level for Alt Serum very bad ?I have read taking milk thistle, vitamin E and cod liver oil can help repair the liver is this true ?I know my questions might seem all over the place and slightly erratic, but I am just so worried.Thanks in advance for taking the time to answer my question.",
