            "answer": "No, you are right, his blood sugar sould NEVER be 210 and even 140 is pretty high. 160 is way too high at bedtime, so I would go see another doctor, if possible and endocrinologist who has type 1 kids patients. Children do not run higher blood sugars, but I doubt that an A1c is going to change this doctor's diagnosis (why would they only do a urine test in the first place???). So I guess find a doctor who is going to listen to you and help your son. An early diagnosis can be such a good thing as it may help stretch out the honeymoon phase, so don't give up now. There's a parents' board where I have read similar stories, maybe you can get some information there as well:http://community.diabetes.org/n/pfx/forum.aspx?nav=messages&webtag=adaparentsNicki",

    "question": "I have a 3 year old son that had started wetting the bed and wanting to drink during the night, my father is diabetic so used his monitor to test his blood sugar level and it was 210. I called the doctor and all they did was a urine test and said there was no sugar in his urine and he is fine. I still did not feel comfortable with the answer. I have done several other tests, before eating he runs around 135-140, and sometimes up to 160 at bedtime. His morning fasting levels are fine (below 100) but during the day and night, they run higher. Could he be pre-diabetic and should I have an A1C test done, or do kids that age tend to run higher? I'm wanting to know if I'm over-protective or if he has something going on. Thank you.",
