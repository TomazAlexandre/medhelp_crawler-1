If you are concerned, suggest going to the Doctor to get blood work done to determine if she is diabetic or not. Thank you for your question.",

    "question": "We have just moved over 4 hours away from where we use to live. My daughter is getting headaches often, sometimes tummy aches as well. In general not herself and also thirsty often. I have read up on things, seems this could be diabetes, or possibly stress. Diabetes runs on both sides, but my husband and I do not have it as far as I know. We excersise often as a family. We love the outdoors. Our girl does seem to want sweets more often than I would like, and sometimes begs. We keep her busy and do not eat fast food or soda, or high sugar foods in general. As well, she only wants starch, pasta and such. She will not touch meat. We are trying to keep her diet balanced. I am mostly worried about the headaches at this point.",
