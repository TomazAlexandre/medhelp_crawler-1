    "question": "For the last three weeks, I am having severe dizziness and nausea after eating. Checked pregnancy, and its negative. My cesarean delivery was on 25-Mar-17. As routine followup, on 1-Jul-17, my HbA1c was 6.1 and TSH was 5.96. The doctor said to followup within a month. The blood that has been done recently again upon my complain of dizziness and nausea on 23-Aug-17, the HbA1C is 6.4 and TSH 7.79, both gone up. Taking medication now (Glucophage 500mg and Euthyrox 25 - once a day) but still the same. Currently I am breastfeeding. I was not a diabetic patient. During my pregnancy, on 21st week I developed gestational diabetes. Also, during my last month of pregnancy, the diabetes was high, and hence, has to take insulin 4 times a day. Is there any other reason for this dizziness? Does any lactating mom experiencing the same? This dizziness is killing me.",
