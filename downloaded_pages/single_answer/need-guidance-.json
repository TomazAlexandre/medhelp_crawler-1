            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The sensations of pins and tingling are generally due to peripheral neuropathies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism and diabetes. Do get a thyroid antibody test too.Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis and G B Syndrome are two other possibilities. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Please read more about it on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ParesthesiaHypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, liver diseases, adrenal insufficiency, liver failure and side effects of some drugs cause a person to feel abnormally cold.In your case ruling out diabetes and thyroid involvement should be the first step.Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
