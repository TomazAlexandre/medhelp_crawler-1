I understand your concern for your father\u2019s health.\u00a0\u00a0I think you mean chronic small vessel ischemic disease, where smaller branches of large blood vessels in brain, internal carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral artery are affected due to long-standing hypertension, diabetes or other inflammatory condition affecting the vessels. This blockage can cause cell death distal to it. There are some conditions where one can have sub cortical vascular dementia. There are symptoms of short-term memory loss, mood, attention deficits and psychomotor slowing. Check up with a neurologist for evaluation. There is no specific treatment, anti depressants may be prescribed, control of hypertension, diabetes and smoking is essential.\u00a0\u00a0Wishing him all the best.:",
