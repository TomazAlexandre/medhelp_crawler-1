    "question": "I'm a 57 year old woman, 200 lbs. Four or five times in the last year I have experienced a sharp sudden pain behind my left breast at night. It has happened prior to the last year but has been more frequent in the last year. It wakes me up. It happens when I am sleeping on my left side. It only lasts for seconds but it immobilizes me. I hold my breath and am afraid to move. It feels as though something is trying to move through something too small and once it clears, the pain quickly leaves as fast as it comes, but it leaves a tenderness behind, lasting for days sometimes. I don't experience shortness of breath, pressure, nausea, pains down my arm, or any other cardio symptoms. It has happened enough that I am afraid to roll over on my left side to sleep. Sometimes it is immediately followed by a rush of light-headedness, but I can't determine if that is a symptom or from my anxiety of the moment. After it happens I have a hard time getting back to sleep, fearing that I may die from a heart attack in my sleep. I've had a stress test about two years ago, but because I have no other symptoms, further tasting was not warranted. My cardiologist suggested an ultrasound, but because it was a mobile unit from the cleveland clinic, my insurance wouldn't cover the $3000 test. I'm on a low dose aspirin, I maintain my blood pressure with medication, and I have type 2 diabetes. I have no history of gall bladder problems, and I have been using nexium for maybe 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0I'm trying to determine if this is something I should be so concerned about.",
