    "question": "My boyfriend has been having problems for the past few months with his energy and feeling sick to his stomach. He can eat something, and feel perfectly fine...10 minutes later, he has lost all of his energy and his stomach bothers him. It will happen just out of no where, and we are at a loss. We don't have the money to take him to the doctor for all the high dollar test...so I am asking, what do you think? Both his parents are diabetics, and I think his grandparents may be too...so it runs in the family. The other day, he brought home doughnuts for breakfast, and he ate a few...feeling fine. He went to bed, because he works third shift, when he woke up around lunch time, he was very sick and had no energy to get move or get out of the bed, after laying in the bed until 6pm that night, he felt fine. We ate supper and after a few bites, he lost his energy and started feeling sick again. It is random, and we never know when it is going to hit him, but when it does, it hits him good. I am nervous for him, I am scared I am going to find him laying in the floor...I believe that it could be something to do with his sugar, either it is dropping to low, or getting to high...I am not sure. I am at a loss, and so is he. Another thing is, he has been battling heartburn a lot as well. It also runs heavy in his family, so he drinks a lot of milk to help with his heartburn, so another thought we had was...he could be having an allergic reaction to the milk, like he has became allergic to it from drinking it so much. It is just weird how his energy level drops so quick and he starts getting sick to his stomach, thankfully he has never vomited...but he wishes he could if it would help his stomach. Any suggestions?",
