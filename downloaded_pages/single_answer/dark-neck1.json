            "answer": "I have the same problem. I saw a specialist for my Hyperthyroidism disorder, and she said that the darkness on my neck is caused by my Hyperinsulinemia where insulin builds up and causes a dark almost velvet feeling of wrinkles all the way around my neck. before I found this out I used to scrub and scrub my neck, but all it did was rub off my skin and it didn't get any better, so I didn't know what to do until this.. The thing is I have an extremely rare case of Hyperinsulinemia caused by an abrupt stop of steroids when I was a child from asthma in which there is no cure, I cannot get diabetes type 2 and it wont go away. Does your mom have a weight problem? If none of this helps I'm sorry but this is what I know about mine.",

    "question": "hi doctor!well my mom is i think allergic to the sun.its almost 3 years that this happened. her neck slowly started to get darker. at first it started with a line and she thought it was dirt, but as time passed her neck got more and more dark and it traveled all through her neck going up below her chin and ending at her chest. when she goes out, if it is too hot, the sun burns her neck alot and the only type of material or fabric she can use for shirts or blouses that wont burn or irritate her skin is polyester. her skin is very sensative. she tries really strong sunblocks and has tried many ointments as well but nothing seems to work!she is scared that this will travel all out through her body. she has tried soo many things from organic to getting a biopsy..but they cant find anything...will this ever go away?is there a cure?heeeelp!-s",
