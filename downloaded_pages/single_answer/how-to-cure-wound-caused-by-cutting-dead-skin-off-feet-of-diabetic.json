            "answer": "Hi,Wounds that won't heal are unfortunately a very common complication of long term poorly controlled diabetes.Given he has these wounds, he needs to take special care to protect his feet all the time.\u00a0\u00a0 Walking barefoot and out in the rain without proper protection is not recommended.\u00a0\u00a0Any serious worsening of the wounds or infection could end up in amputation of his limbs.His feet should be inspected every day and he should seek medical attention immediately if he notes any changes.The best chance to improve the healing is to normalize his blood sugars (or as close to normal as possible).Normal blood sugars would mean keeping his blood sugars in the range of 80 - 140 all the time, and as stable as possible.\u00a0\u00a0 A1c ideally less than 6.0, definitely less than 7.How to do this?\u00a0\u00a0Low carb diet is a very important tool.\u00a0\u00a0Weight loss, if necessary, and insulin (dosed in basal-bolus regime) and closely monitored.\u00a0\u00a0 Exercise helps with blood sugar control.\u00a0\u00a0Will need to be done carefully given his condition.Hope this helps you and your dad.",

    "question": "Can anybody help me find the root cause for this:My dad got wounds on both the toes with holes made impinging into 1/4th of the skin present in each toe which is caused actually by cutting a little piece of extra dead skin on outer part of the toe 10 years ago. When the Diabetics has been detected by then.. since these cut wounds didn't start to heel upon perfectly fine toes back then. From then they extended to lower parts of the toe from extremely outer part ( we can say outer sideway of toe ). He had been diagnosed by many well known diabetic specialists doctors but just his wound got calmed down temporarily but not cured totally.
