            "answer": "I dont think you need the advice, I think your Mother does :) They never listen to their kids right?I can only validate your thoughts. Natural Choice is a better food then Mighty Dog and frankly we both know your dog is getting too many calories. Dogs so often eat canned food faster because the moisture in the food brings out the flavour. It is like gravy for us.Explain to your Mother that obesity is the number one health problem we see in dogs and like in people it leads to painful arthritis, heart disease, and diabetes. Simply put your dogs quality of life and lifespan will be negatively effected.Getting him back on his regular diet, having the food measured every day, and lots of exercise is what this doctor is prescribing.Good luck.Dr. Cliffwww.pettalk360.com",
