            "answer": "Hi!If you experience tremors only at night and especially during sleep, then three two things that should be ruled out immediately are sleep epilepsy, hypoglycemia and restless leg syndrome.Other causes of whole body tremors are peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes, lupus, low vitamin B12, and thyroid disorders.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I EXPERIENCE tremors covering most of my body and a pounding of my heart. I have recently had\u00a0\u00a0an extensive heart investigation with no explanation. The tremors etc are mostly at night and sometimes last quite a while. There appear to be no physical\u00a0\u00a0reasons so I assume they are caused by my nervous system.",
