    "question": "I am set to have my gallbladder out in the next week and consider myself a healthy 33 year old male. Not overweight, blood pressure, cholesterol are all good. I\u00a0\u00a0have been getting dizzy only after eating. This is a new symptom though in my months trying to figure out what is wrong with me. I have only been experiencing this over the last week or so. It kind of worries me and I have been wondering if this is related to my gallbladder. I have had 2 ultrasounds, 1 hida/cck, and plenty of bloodwork. My blood only showed an elevated billirubin, everything else was normal. My hida returned a 70% ejection but the CCK injection triggered the same pain I have been going through over the last 2 months. My ultrasound showed some gallbladder sludge. Is this dizziness really related to my gallbladder? I am hoping gallbladder removal will bring everything back to normal. Any info is greatly appreciated.",
