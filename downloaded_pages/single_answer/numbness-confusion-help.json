    "question": "I am a female 21 year old. I am 5'4 and weigh 140. For the last 4 months I have been experiencing numbness in my hands, nausea, and occasionally dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0This past week the numbness has gotten worse, my right arm, right leg, and upper lip go numb off and on through out the day.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a mri, cat scan, blood, and urine tests done with nothing coming up. The results were no ms, no diabetes, all vitamin levels were good. Everything was perfect.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist said that it probably has to do with my heavy migraines. He put me on a pill for a week and the numbness just got worse, along with the naseua and dizziness. with it not working he said he wants a EMG done now.Does anyone know what this could be. Please comment.Thank You",
