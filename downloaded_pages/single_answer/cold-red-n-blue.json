            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are a few possibilities like hypothyroidism, peripheral neuropathy like in diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, Reynaud\u2019s phenomenon and very cold external temperatures. You do say you live in very cold climate. So keep your legs warm. The other possibility is peripheral vascular disease. You would need angiogram or color dopplar for this.Basically consult a vascular specialist.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
