            "answer": "Hello,Skin conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing.You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how\u00a0\u00a0you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "I seem to have had this problem with my arms, sometimes neck and the side of my face itching.When I proceed to scratch it or when it becomes overly irritated little red spots from along my arm to even the top of my hand sometimes, my neck as well if it pops up there.I'm really not sure what causes this, I went to a doctor LAST summer when this thing first appeared, and it was bad. All over my body head to toe. Of course it went away when I went. And never really popped up again.I'm not sure if it's heat related, because anything I've looked up shows the rashes that go along with heat to be usually raised bumps, and mine aren't, they're just little red spots.I've tried anti-itch creams and it doesn't seem to do to much. It's flared up in the shower sometimes, which made me think it was heat related, and it's now summer weather and it's popping up again.D: But I'm not quite sure. Anyone else have this? Itching with red spots, NOT bumps.Also, even now it itches, but it's cool where I am and I'm wearing a tank top. D: So - - I don't really know what's up. If it really is a heat thing or not. At the very least I think heat irritates it.Thank you!",
