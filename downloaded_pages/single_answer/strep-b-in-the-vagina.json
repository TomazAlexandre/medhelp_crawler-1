            "answer": "Hello,Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a type of bacteria that is found in the lower intestine of 10-35% of all healthy adults and in the vagina and/or lower intestine of 10-35% of all healthy, adult women. Normally, the presence of GBS does not cause problems.But sometimes like in pregnancy(which is a stressful state in itself),immunocompromised states,low immunity,hormone changes,under stress and even idiopathic(cause not known), GBS bacteria can invade the body and cause infection.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
