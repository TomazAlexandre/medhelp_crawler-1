    "question": "Hello Everyone, I am an adult 21 year old female and have been dealing with frustrating symptoms causing insomnia as they happen mostly at night and on occasion during the day. I have been feeling constantly lightheaded, nauseous,trembling along with frequent tingling pains throughout my body and frequent urination. I have done tests before and normal and can\u2019t accept the answers because my symptoms won\u2019t go away. Too mention, back in may I have been near syncope and had one low blood sugar result (63) considered normal with the same symptoms. I am concerned. I also have hypothyroidism and a family history of Diabetes(Grandma).",
