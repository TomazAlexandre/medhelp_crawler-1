    "question": "Hi I had a blood test two weeks ago and i called the clinic today and they said everything was fine (CBC, Diabetes, Cholesterol, Liver tests) except one of my enzymes was at 47, which is just above the 45 max. Problem is last year it was the same, and the year before that also.I don't drink at all, my BMI is 24.5, and I don't really think I'm fat except for maybe a bit of flab around the belly.

I feel fine.ThanksRead more: http://www.************.com/boards/liver-pancreas-disorders/1007464-why-my-liver-enzymes-always-bit-high.html#ixzz3i1QuVjKF",
