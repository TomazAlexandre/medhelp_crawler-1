            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Dark groin skin can be due to a variety of issues such as repeated use of razors when shaving, friction from skin surfaces rubbing together, tight clothing, age and underlying medical conditions like obesity, diabetes, thyroid or pituitary disorders and medication side effects. Treatment usually depends on the underlying cause and topical lighteners as well as cosmetic procedures like dermabrasion or laser therapy may be done. Natural methods\u00a0\u00a0such as exfoliation, bio oil, licorice bath soap, and sour milk may also help. Take care and do keep us posted.",
