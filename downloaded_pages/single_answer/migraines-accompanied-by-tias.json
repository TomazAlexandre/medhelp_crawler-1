            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Have you had your migraines worked up in the past? Migraines can cause sensory findings such as what you describe. However, it is important for you to understand that if you have not experienced headaches in the past and you are now having new head pains, seeing a neurologist is a good idea, just to make sure there is nothing serious causing this pain. Imaging of the brain and sometimes then neck may be indicated depending on your exact symptoms, your physical examination, and other factors.\u00a0\u00a0It is also important to evaluate your stroke risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol, family history of strokes, prior strokes, cardiac problems, diabetes, smoking, etc. TIAs do place people at higher risk for stroke.I highly recommend you discuss your symptoms with your primary physician. You should have a complete stroke workup to rule in or out TIAs. If stroke workup is negative, the sensory symptoms you describe may be related to your migraine.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
