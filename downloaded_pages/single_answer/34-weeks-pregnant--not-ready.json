    "question": "So I'm due July 14th but I'm getting induced early due to being high risk because of gestational diabetes. So probably between July 7th through the 14th. We do not have anything! I've had one baby shower and about to have another one. My first shower was nice but all we got was clothes and homemade blankets. It's frustrating because there's things we need not want. I don't want to sound selfish but why can't people just get what I put on my registry?! I obviously need those things! Now my husband and I have to scramble in the last month to make sure we have everything we need. I'm just so stressed and worried were forgetting something!! Anyone else having this problem?",
