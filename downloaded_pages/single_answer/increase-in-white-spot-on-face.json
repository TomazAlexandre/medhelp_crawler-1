            "answer": "Hello,A clinical examination is necessary for correct diagnosis and management of your condition. There could be several causes of these white spots. The common causes are fungal infections,vitiligo etc.Fungal infections are very common and one\u00a0\u00a0such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection which\u00a0\u00a0produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease. Other possibility is that it is Pityriasis alba which is a mild form of dermatitis that clears up after a few weeks to few months. The cause is unknown and no treatment is necessary.If the symptoms are severe and persistent you should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes. Take care and do keep us posted.Regards.",
