    "question": "My doctor took my off my contraceptive, saying i'm too old for it(51). Since then I struggle with my health.\u00a0\u00a0In July I started itching after taking part in a winter walk(8km).\u00a0\u00a0My face felt extremely hot, my eyes swelled up, and my face itched terribly.\u00a0\u00a0A few days later I went for a routine mammogram and asked the dr to check my face with his sonar.\u00a0\u00a0All my glands were swollen, and an echo structure on my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0He said it was nothing, told me to take antihistamines.\u00a0\u00a0Few days later I was so sick I went to a homeopath.\u00a0\u00a0He said it was glandular fever and mumps.\u00a0\u00a0It has now been 2 months and my glands all went down except for one on one side under my ear, although it is still uncomfortable when I turn my head from side to side.\u00a0\u00a0The itch has gotten so bad to the point that I want to scrape my skin off with a knife!\u00a0\u00a0In the first month it was only on my face, then spread to my arms, and a few days ago spread to my legs. If I bend over, feels like all the blood is going to my head.\u00a0\u00a0Blood pressure is normal.\u00a0\u00a0Today it feels like my eyes are swelling again and they are a bit red around the edges.\u00a0\u00a0Lymphoma has come to mind, but is it possible that I only have an allergy to something?\u00a0\u00a0Other than that I feel fine, still have all my energy. Can it be hormonal?\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to use hormone replacement, read too many negative things about it, and I don't have menopausal symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Please help.",
