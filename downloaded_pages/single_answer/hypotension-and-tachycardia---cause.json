            "answer": "first, drink lots of water for 2 or 3 days and see what happens. If you are dehydrated, you have less blood volume... so less blood = less pressure and also your heart must beat more often to keep up the required flow.There is something called the pressure x rate constant.if that doesn't help, then try the Dysautonomia community here. To be at 120 BPM merely from standing is not something to disregard, I'd think - especially if it gets worse as minutes go by.",

    "question": "Sorry if this is not quite the right area.I am a 22yr old female, have diabetes but it is well-controlled.I've been intrigued for a while about my blood pressure/heart rate however. My heart rate is typically 90-100bpm, even when sitting at rest, and quite often up to 120bpm if I've been standing for a while, even if not walking. My blood sugars can be any level when this is occurring, so I do not think it is related. I quite often \"feel\" it racing in my chest, though it doesn't appear connected to exercise/food/caffeine etc.However my blood pressure is often on the low side - 90-100 systolic, 50-60 diastolic, and sometimes as low as 85/45. Could this be related to my high heart rate? And if so is it a problem, or just something to forget about do you think.Thank you!",
