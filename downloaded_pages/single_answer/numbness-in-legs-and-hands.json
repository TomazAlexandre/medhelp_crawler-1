    "question": "I am a 38 year old male.\u00a0\u00a0I recently, approximately two and a half months ago, strained my middle and lower back.\u00a0\u00a0i saw my doctor, who prescribed methyl prednisolone.\u00a0\u00a0I took it and had no relief.\u00a0\u00a0i returned to the doctor and was prescribed naproxen 500mg twice a day and skelaxin 3 times a day I was also given tramadol for the pain.\u00a0\u00a0I had to stop taking the tramadol due to nausea.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor gave me a shot of toradol in the office to help with the spasms I was having in my middle back.\u00a0\u00a0I again returned to the doctor because about two weeks after the initial injury, began to have numbness in my left foot and left hand.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor sent me to have MRI's of my cervical, thorasic, and lumbosacral spine.\u00a0\u00a0I made an appointment with a neurosurgeon due to the numbness progressing and worsening.\u00a0\u00a0I have numbness in the left foot radiating up the leg and left hand radiating up the arm.\u00a0\u00a0About a month ago my right foot started getting numb and my right hand also, but not to the extreme of the left side.\u00a0\u00a0The neurosurgeon said I have a herniated disc in my neck and middle back, a bulging disc in my lower back.\u00a0\u00a0He does not feel surgery is in order and wants me to get a brain MRI, an ENG test and a blood test to rule out diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He also can not explain my numbness pattern. My MRI's of the neck and back are not causing the numbness in his opinion.\u00a0\u00a0I am in a lot of pain, the only time I have a little comfort is when I am laying down.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said he has seen a case of diabetes and possible Multiple Sclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0 Any help would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0I was an active adult who worked out regularly and I have an 8 year old boy who I want to resume full activities with.\u00a0\u00a0The only other things that I can tell are:\u00a0\u00a0I had JRA when I was around ten, had left arthroscopic knee surgery at 15 and right carpal tunnel surgery at 16. I had a motorcycle accident at around 25 and broke my left clavicle, separated my shoulder and possibly tore the head of my shoulder.",
