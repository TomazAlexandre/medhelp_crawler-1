            "answer": "Just my opinion; A lot of supplements claim antioxidant properties, but do they work? Some claim psuedo-scientific results such as increased pancreatic insulin. However, a claim is a claim. Unless they can prove their product does as advertised, with proven test results from major university medical test lab[s], or an FDA certified lab, its buyer beware. Sure there has been random studies but where are the results published so we, the public, can read for ourselves? Think about this for a second; if there was a supplement that was proven to increase pancreas insulin wouldn't the world hospitals and doctors be all over it with high recommendations? If so, why haven't we heard of it? Because none exists that works for everyone. You best antioxidant agents comes from consuming healthy foods, not a pill/capsule.",
