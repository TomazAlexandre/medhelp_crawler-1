            "answer": "Hi there. Your mother being a diabetic is at an increased risk of various bone and joint disorders. Factors predisposing this could be nerve damage, arterial disease, obesity if she is overweight etc. this could be frozen shoulder where one has shoulder pain and limited range of motion. Diabetes is an important risk factor. There is pain on movement, stiffness of the joint and decreased range of motion. You need to be investigated for degenerative disc disease also since disc herniation or damage can also lead to compressed nerves and hence the symptoms. An MRI cervical spine can help in the diagnosis. CT scan of the affected shoulder joint is required. Consult an orthopaedician for the management in coordination with your diabetologist taking care of the blood sugar profile. Hope this helps. Take care.",
