            "answer": "Hi, usually with the TIA, there may not be significant changes in the brain,\u00a0\u00a0so testing may also not help. But it would be worthwhile to rule out any vision defects.\u00a0\u00a0And therapy for TIAs is focused on controlling risk factors and in improving blood supply to the brain. As you have been initiated on therapy you can follow up with your doctor, he may screen you for high risk factors like diabetes or hypertension. Regards.",
