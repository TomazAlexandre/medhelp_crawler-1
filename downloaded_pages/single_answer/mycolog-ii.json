            "answer": "Hi,long -term steroid use is associated with thinning of the skin.But as such it will not affect the size of the penis.You could take some preventive measures to reduce the chances of getting yeast infection.Fungi thrive in warm, moist places, so make sure the groin area is clean and dry.Also wear loose and comfortable clothes.Keep your sugars under control and you will not have to deal with this often.",
