            "answer": "Hi!In all probability the medications are not suiting him and causing postural hypotension. The blood pressure falls when your father stands and causes all the symptoms that he is suffering. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain epilepsies too behave this way with temporary blackouts. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required for diagnosis. To begin with make a conscious effort to drink fluids (not plain water but juice, lemonade, soups, herbal tea, etc), and eat at regular intervals. Normally this helps. If it does not, then you need to consult a doctor and get all the above causes ruled out. Take care!",
