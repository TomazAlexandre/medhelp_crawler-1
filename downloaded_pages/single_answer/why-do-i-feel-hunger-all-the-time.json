It can often be hard to distinguish between physical and emotional hunger.Carbs are addictive, so you might try eating lower carbs and see how you feel. (less cereal, bread, pasta, sweets, more fresh vegetables, fruit, meat, cheese, etc.)",

    "question": "I'm always hungry, I eat normaly and feel normal. I just had three sandwiches for lunch and I want more. At breakfast I had to force myself away abd the only way I stopped eating was cuz we ran out of cheerios. Today I already ate half a loaf of bread and if I'm trying to loose weight I'm hungry all the time abd it's hard to not eat. It's not a starving feeling, that's so different. It's the hubger feeling before dinners done and you can smell what you moms cooking. Or somthing like that. Please, help! I'm dieing for another sandwitch but I've already eaten my calories for lunch! I'm not restricting myself to much, It horable how I need to eat all the time to be full. What could be making me feel so hunger? Do you think it's all in my head? Is there something wrong with my body? What is it?Although I am 14 I started growing sooner and there for lost my teen appetite a few years ago but now this is something else. Its not the same hinger feeling as I had when I was growing. What could be it and what can I do?",
