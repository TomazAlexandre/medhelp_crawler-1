They appear when there is rapid stretching of the skin. Striae are most commonly located on the breasts, hips, thighs, buttocks, abdomen, and flank.They are often seen after pregnancy, obese children, during puberty growth spurts in boys and girls. They may also be associated with topical corticosteroid overuse, diabetes, Cushing disease, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.You may try a mild steroid, such as 1% hydrocortisone, and a moisturizing lotion. They should go away by spontaneously over a period of several weeks.\u00a0\u00a0If not, you should consult your doctor for evaluation.Take care",
