    "question": "I'm freaking out! I am 33w 5d today and I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes a few weeks ago. So now I get weekly ultrasounds and today I had one and they said I had too much fluid around the baby. My doctor is making me do another fasted glucose test and then checking the fluid level again on Wednesday. He said if it is still hight they will have to induce me next week. I am so nervous!\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to have her too early and this feels so early. Have any other moms out there experienced anything like this?",
