    "question": "My 5 year old son drinks a lot of water.\u00a0\u00a0He's been checked for Diabetes (sugar in the urine) and the results were negative.\u00a0\u00a0He's recently been suffering from headaches and mentions that his neck hurts.\u00a0\u00a0His weight is fine but he's recently been napping which is new.\u00a0\u00a0He's never been lethargic (that I've noticed) and his eating habits seem normal.\u00a0\u00a0Should I have him tested again for Diabetes or should I just pass this off as a growth spurt?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I should also mention that he has an inverted chest (pectus excavatum) and is in the process of being tested for Marfan Syndrome which he will be tested for again when he is 6yrs.\u00a0\u00a0I would greatly appreciate any comments.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
