            "answer": "Do you take your Humalog on an Insulin Carb ratio? This is the best way to take fast-acting insulin, because it is based on what you are actually eating. That way you aren't taking food to match the insulin, which puts you on a vicious cycle of too much of both. If you are on the older type of set dose or sliding scale talk to your endo or else get the book Using Insulin by John Walsh to figure out I:C ratios. Your diet sounds a bit high carb to me. Most Type 1's can't eat cereal and a sandwich and apple is a lot of carbs. What are your blood sugars like? My suggestion to lose weight (and get better blood sugars) is to lower your carb intake and match your insulin to the lowered carbs. Eggs are better for breakfast and for lunch I would suggest skipping the apple if you are having a sandwich. Also check into low carb breads and tortillas. Send me a private message if you want a site with more traffic of Type 1's so you can get more suggestions and ideas about managing your diabetes and weight loss.",

    "question": "I have been type 1 diabetic for 11 years now and I currently take Lantus at night and in the morning along with Humalog during the day to control my readings. I have always been a pudgy kid and I weighed 235lbs junior year in High School. However, I began to diet and exercise and dropped down to around 210lbs by my senior year. When I entered college, I actually dropped all the way down to 170lbs from diet and exercise. I would run 7 miles MWF and do the elliptical for 50 minutes on TTH. I still try to maintain this workout but have found it harder to do as time has worn on throughout college. I am in my senior year of college and I weigh 206lbs. However, I still workout 5 times a week running for 6 miles MWF and doing the elliptical for 50 minutes on TTH. For my meals I eat cereal in the morning, a sandwhich and apple at lunch, and usually some type of chicken and veggies for dinner. The past 6 months I have gained around 20 pounds with this regimen. I have no idea how to lose this weight and I am very frustrated. Oh yeah I also lift weights routinely. Any suggestions?",
