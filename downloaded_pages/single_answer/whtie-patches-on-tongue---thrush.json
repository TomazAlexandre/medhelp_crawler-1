    "question": "I am terrified. Please help!My doctor just confirmed my diagnosis as Thrush.I have been tested as HIV negative (well beyond the testing window) and Diabetes negative. I have not had any sexual intercourse since being tested.I asked my doctor what was causing the sores on my tongue over a month ago. He told me it was due to my geographic tongue. I tried to explain that I had never had geographic symptoms on the SIDES of my tongue - he didn't listen.I recent went through a course of anti-biotics which made the \"sores\" worse.Now my doctor finally diagnosed me with Thrush. He wants me to wait until I'm done with my current course of medication before starting the thrush medications.Once again, this has been going on for at least 2 months, but my doctor didn't take note of it until the antibiotics made it flare up more.My question is this. I have conclusive HIV negative and Diabetes negative test results... WHAT ELSE COULD CAUSE THIS!?!?!?!?!I am terrified, please help!!!!",
