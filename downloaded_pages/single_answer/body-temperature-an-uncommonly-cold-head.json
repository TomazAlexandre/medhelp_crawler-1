            "answer": "Hello,Cold sensation of the head can be caused by several things, including environmental factors, neurological disease, diabetes, alcohol-related neuropathy, hypothermia, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid.If it is due to environmental factors,then wearing protective clothing like caps,mufflers etc can help.Otherwise,you need to get the other possibilities ruled out by extensive investigations. I sincerely advise you to consult a physician and discuss these possibilities with him.This symptom may only be annoying but can be due to some serious cause like impending stroke also.So clinical examination id definitely required.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",
