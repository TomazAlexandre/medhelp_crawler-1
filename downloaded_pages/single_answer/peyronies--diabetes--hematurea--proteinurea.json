            "answer": "Hi,Long-standing diabetes can cause diabetic nephropathy, especially if blood sugar control was not stringently achieved.Diabetic nephropathy causes impaired kidney function and is characterized by protein and blood in urine. However, there are other conditions that occur and cause comorbidity with diabetes. These include hypertension, which could also be the cause of protein in urine.Blood in urine can also be a sign of infection or renal stone or carcinoma.The type of hematuria will provide an idea about the site of its origin.Peyronie's disease occurs and is mediated by an autoimmune component. Any condition which alters the immune structure of the body can also have a bearing on the mediation of such disorders.Do keep us posted on your doubts and progress.Regards",
