He plays hard outside and I was contributing the thirst this and him just growing. He hasn't lost any weight and his eating habits are the same.\u00a0\u00a0He has maintained a weight of 28 pounds. I don't know if I am sounding like a paranoid mom, but am worried after seeing some of these symptoms. Just worried because I am pregnant with #2 and am starting to panic!!",
