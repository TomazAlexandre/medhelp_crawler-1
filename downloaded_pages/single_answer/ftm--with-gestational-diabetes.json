            "answer": "I understand where you are coming from, and it sounds like your Dr. isn't very reassuring... It's especially hard when you're so close and getting uncomfortable. I don't know if this will make you feel any better but I've had lots of friends and two sisters who have been told their babies are measuring really big. One was born early weighing a pound and a half lighter than she was told, and the others all weighed up to a pound less than expected. Perhaps your Dr. knows the weight is an estimate, but if he feels that way should probably tell you. On the flip side, I knew a girl who had a ten pound baby and didn't even tear. Good luck!",

    "question": "I am currently 37wks & 5 days and I found out I had gestational diabetes around 20 weeks. I was put on metformin and also insulin before meals and at bedtime. My blood sugars tend to run high (never higher than 180) and occasionally drop low (never lower than 56) my baby girl is already measuring 7lbs 8oz at 36weeks. My doctor does not act concerned at all. I am not a big girl and my doctor has made no mention of inducing. I have weekly BPPs and always score 8 out of 8. I do not want to have a 10lb baby but my doctor said it doesn't matter how big she gets. Does anyone else see a problem with this. I feel as though my fears are falling on deaf ears.",
