            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Evening rise in temperature is generally due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis.This along with the blood picture should be tested. This should not be anything serious, maybe just anemia or diabetes. However the area of your back which hurts should be screened through a MRI. Consult your PCP and get a referral for a neurologist and also get the requisite tests done.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
