    "question": "Ok, to begin, I am a 21 year old type 1 diabetic with high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Now for the symptoms... about 2 months ago I got an unexplained single swollen lymph node in my neck and was prescribed a 10 day regimen of amoxicillin. The lymph node went down but didnt completely go away and is still there...A couple of weeks after my antibiotic treatment I experienced a burning sensation at the bottom of my left foot that would happen periodically throughout the day... I had my diabetic doctor look at and he said with my good control it is not due to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, the burning sensation stopped and my whole bottom left leg and foot had a slight tingling sensation.\u00a0\u00a0Then that eventually led to random body tingles that would happen at any point in the day and would last for a split second several times daily.\u00a0\u00a0I had a general doctor look at me and he said it was anxiety but I havent taken any medication yet.\u00a0\u00a0Now I have random muscle twitching that can occur at any part of my body but all of this seems worse when I am relaxed and thinking about it.\u00a0\u00a0There has been a spot on my head that was numb/buzzing for a day or two but that is gone now.. occasionally my face gets tingly feeling.\u00a0\u00a0I also have another weird symptom where it feels like my left ear is slightly plugged up but I have no loss in hearing. I have not experienced any muscle wasting or weakness and I don't notice the twitching when I am active. Today, I have felt extremely tired, so tired I feel asleep at work...and then came home and took a 3 hour nap. But anyway, I have a neuro appointment in less than a week but I was curious if this sounds like lyme, MS, or anxiety to anyone who knows more about this than i do.\u00a0\u00a0Any help is appreciated thanks.",
