            "answer": "I had my baby the 6th of this month thank God I don't have to put up with that anymore lol but it honestly wasn't that bad and very much worth it in the end!!! I lucked out tho cause my sugars stayed good eating what I usually did just portion controlled I could actually cheat some and it not affect my sugar!! The scariest thing was what the doctors put in my head that I was automatically gonna have a big baby them she measured small and it was due to my diabetes and she had a growth restriction! I've never been so scared in my life but my baby girl came out weighing 6.3 pounds not bad considering I'm naturally a very small person and my sugars were controlled! Guess she proved them wrong!!! Like I said tho it was worth it and I'd do it all over again to have her!!",

    "question": "How many ladies are dealing with gestational diabetes? I've had it for a month now pricking my finger four times a day. I have up to March 18 for my son to be due. I was 33 weeks when my obgyn told me he was 5.5lbs. I keep a dialog of my readings. To be honest I don't mind ill do anything for my son(21 years of age). But how are you ladies handling the GB?",
