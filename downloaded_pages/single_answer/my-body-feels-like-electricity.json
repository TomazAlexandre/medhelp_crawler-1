            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms you describe in your sister could be due to acidity. This acidity could be associated with esophageal reflux (GERD), where the food in your stomach is thrown up into your food pipe or esophagus. Another possibility is hiatal hernia, where a portion of stomach herniates into the chest cavity through the diaphragm.Let her take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel after all major meals and see if it helps. If this does, then follow up with your PCP.Another possibility is low calcium and Vit D in body. Tremors/jolts are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do discuss these possibilities with her doctor and get your sister examined in this light.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "My sister says her whole body feels like electricity, mainly hurts around the stomach area right below the rib cage. The whole electrical shock is through out the body. She explains it to me like a buzzz feeling. She also feels numbness around her face and her skin feels like it bubbles up and snaps. The feeling in her body also changes with the temperture.She has gone to the ER room 6 times within the last 5 months. Had Cat scans and MRI but doctors could not find anything wrong with her. They keep giving her medication but just makes the electrical sensation worse. If anyone has any similar symptoms to this please help. Thank you.",
