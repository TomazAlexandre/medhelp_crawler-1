    "question": "I have been having non epileptic seizures for about a year. It took a long time to figure out they were seizures. I have started to notice that i get them often when I'm \"funky\" or hungry and also about 30 min after i eat. A nurse who saw my seizure said it looked like a diabetic seizure. While my blood sugar was 150 in the hospital the drs didnt seem to think it was a factor. Any thoughts?",
