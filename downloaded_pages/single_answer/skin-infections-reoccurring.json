This appears to be a bacterial infection which seems to be generalized and he may require systemic antibiotics. A culture of the discharge may help guide treatment. There are organisms we have to exclude here like MRSA and tuberculosis. It is best to think along this line so that immediate and proper management be given.",

    "question": "Reoccurring Skin infectionsJun 02, 2008 10:33AM - 0 commentsTags: Skin infections, swollen eyes, red swollen bumpsI have a friend who has recently moved into a new apartment with his girlfriend. For the last three months he has had reoccurring, sore red and inflamed bumps in different spots on his body. The first time it was a bump on his hand, which then became swollen. Next, it showed up in his eyes, leaving his eyes closed with crust. Now he has three small bumps that are painful on his buttocks, he can not sit down. He has been to Urgent Care 3 different times. The doctor first say it was a spider bite, next it was a bacterial infection and was given antibiotics. This infection keeps coming back and has caused him to miss a lot of work. His girlfriend lives with him and has not had any of the symptoms he has. I saw him yesterday and he was very weak and has loss weight over the past four months. Small bumps were forming on the lining on his right eye. Bumps on his back and buttocks are very red and swollen and\u00a0\u00a0has a middle area that is layer with a scab. Contains pus in it also. He said that happen before and his eyes crusted shut. Doctors say that it is something that is going around but cannot tell him what to do. Can someone help me with this problem? Thanks",
