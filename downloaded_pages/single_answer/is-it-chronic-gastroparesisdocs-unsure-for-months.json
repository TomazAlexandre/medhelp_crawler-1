            "answer": "Wait -- your friend had a gastric emptying exam, what was the total emptying time? (or did it simply not empty, period, even after hours?)What you describe is very much in line with gastroparesis, especialy if they're talking about inserting a gastric pacemaker (only about 400 of these are approved for use per year, as per the FDA). Is your friend on any medications. (I'll presume they answer's \"Yes, but they didn't work.\") Having a tube inserted is generally the next step, though it's not a great one. I highly -- HIGHLY recommend you find a gastroparesis group in your area (or on the Web: Yahoo Groups has one that's very good). This is the best concentration of info you'll find, and you may be able to get a name for a doc who specializes on the condition.Speaking of docs I highly -- HIGHLY -- recommend your friend do whatever she can to find someone who's dealt with gastroparesis in the past. Most docs see only a couple of cases per year and usually these are older patients. (FYI, diabetes only accounts for 20% of all gastroparesis cases. There are other known causes, such as MS, but the majority of all cases are idiopathic, meaning they have no known cause. Still, I can't help but wonder what the effect of the gallbladder surgery may have been on the condition, since someone who accidentally screwed around with the Vagus nerve could have been the root cause for this.) Your friend will also want to be tested for other conditions, to see if they can find a root cause. in fact, this is imperative for proper treatment. Finally, your friend would probably do VERY well to find a good acupuncturist in the area.Note that gastroparesis isn't usually referred to as \"chronic gastroparesis\" any more that diabetes is referred to as \"chronic diabetes\". It does tend to be a chronic disease, though in some cases, particularly those where the cause is viral, the person gets better, but these are few and far between.By the way, why did your friend have her gallbladder out? Stones? Low output? Polyps?",
