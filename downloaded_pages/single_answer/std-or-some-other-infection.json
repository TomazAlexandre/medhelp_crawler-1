    "question": "HI,I had a one time, protected sexual encounter approximately 8 weeks ago. Although I was drunk so cannot remember if genitals touched though if they did (not sure they actually did) it was only for a second.I had a sexual health checkup 6 days later. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV came back negative. I then thought that 6 days is not long enough for testing so took another screening 3 weeks later for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea and then HIV / Syphallis 6 weeks later...all came back negative.Note that over the past two months since the encounter I have been suffering from extreme health anxiety due to the fear of getting herpes etc. Not to mention that I am in a relationship so the guilt of the stupid mistake has been driving me insane. I avoided sex with my gf for a very long time over this fear.3 weeks after the sexual encounter i started quite an inflamed penis head. This was very much Thrush like symptoms (I have suffered from thrush in the past). Doctor told me it was thrush and gave me Canestan. I also took the tablet which help for a while then it came back. Clinic Medic told me that the canestan was irritating it further so my GP gave me antibiotics (for fungal infections) to take for 2 weeks which actually cleared the problem. He also sent me for a blood test for diabetes. Now the diabetes blood test came back normal but I had a letter to see my GP (not urgent) about low blood count). I went to see my GP and he said that he doesnt know why they called me in as its not urgent....Slighty low count of isolated white blood cells (began with an N...Neutrophil i think it was) He said not to worry at all just take another blood test and he's sure it will come back normal. Said it was probably that my body was fighting off some sort of infection at the time which got me worried again.I now have for the past two days a tickling feeling around my penis and in my bladder (think it is more internal then external) I dont know what it is and this is driving me nuts. I've seen about 11 different medics in the past 8 weeks who all don't think I have anything STI related as test came back negative twice. I dont know what to do...Could it be possible I have some sort of UTI or NSU. I had sex with my girlfriend almost two weeks ago now (unprotected) and she hasnt had any problems so far.Any help is much appreciated",
