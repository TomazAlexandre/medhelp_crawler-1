            "answer": "With the severe weight loss and not eating, your cat needs immediate veterinary care. Potential causes for her illness include kidney failure, diabetes, cancer, or poorly regulated hyperthyroidism. If her bloodwork and thyroid levels have not been checked recently since the thyroid medication was started a year ago, then they need to be checked. Depending on results, she may benefit from intravenous fluids and medications to stimulate her appetite.Good luck,Kimberly Coyner, DVM DACVD",
