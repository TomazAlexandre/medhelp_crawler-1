            "answer": "Hi,Sorry to know about your father and I sympathise with you as you seem to be the caretaker. Diseases of the nervous system are an equal problem and burden to the caretakers as to the patient.Age brings with it changes in the nervous system, which lead to some of the problems that you have explained. These issues are exaggerated and increased due to alcohol abuse. Cerebellar damage due to alcohol is a cause of the balance disturbances that your father has.\u00a0\u00a0The major causes of peripheral neuropathy are diabetes mellitus, Vitamin B deficiencies, specially B12, Hypothyroidism, alcoholism, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, kidney and liver diseases.You may correct me if I am wrong, but your letter makes me feel that your father continues to use alcohol. If that is so, then there is no validity of the statement that he is willing to go to any distance to find a cure. If he is unable to stop alcohol, then there is no use of going any distance at all.You might try to consult a psychiatrist who may suggest some therapy for alcoholism and also may give some medicines which may solve any component of accompanying depression that such patients have. This will improve the quality of his mental life, at least, at this age.Regards",
