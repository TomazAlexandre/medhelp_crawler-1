            "answer": "Seems she's struggling with fatty liver issues given the mild elevation in liver enzyme and diabetes. Diet and exercise is the key here and things can turn around rather quickly depending on the changes she chooses to follow. Her uric acid levels are slightly elevated so gout may showup. It's very panful so it will be obvious if it does present itself. I deal with it myself and my uric acid levels run about 10 to 11, but limits in my diet keep the gout in control. But that only if she has such issues, hopefully not. Take care.",
