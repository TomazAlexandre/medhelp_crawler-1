    "question": "In 2002 I was diagnosed with a stomach ulcer from taking arthritis medicatioh (not a cox2). I took Nexium which healed my stomach ulcer and have remained on Nexium ever since. In 2003 I developed peripheral neuropathy in my feet and lower legs. I also developed weakness in my legs with difficulty walking. I blamed all this on my spinal surgery for spinal stenoses. In 2007 I was diagnosed with Graves disease. Could all these be caused by malabsorption of B12 from taking Nexium which may prevent it's absorption: I do not have diabetes",
