    "question": "Ok for about three weeks I have had a discomfort nothing unbearable or even very painful in my left arm. The pain moves sometimes in my shoulder , elbow, upper arm, lower arm sometimes I lay on my arm. When I rub it down the pain stops and it does not hurt all the time. I am some what of a worrier so I just like to be sure I am 6'5 335 had a doctors checkup in Nov. 2007 and everything was fine of course the doc said I need to loose weight. I don't have a family history of Heart Dieses or Diabetes, but some things I was reading anytime I typed in Left Arm Pain or discomfort brought up heart attack. I have no chest or any where else discomfort, no other pains just the arm. I want to make sure it's not a silent heart attack or anything like that an just want to be safe. I don't have heath insurance so I want some advice before I go to the doctor or ER. Again no chest pain, no abs pain, back, or jaw pain just left arm discomfort. No problems breathing at all.",
