            "answer": "Hi!Please do not use band-aid. Take a pain killer like ibuprofen. You will also need oral antibiotics. If you have diabetes or likely to have due to a family history, then please get your blood sugar tested. Consult a doctor immediately before the cut gets infected really bad. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "yesterday i was doing crafts which involved alot of cutting, the scissors i was using caused a blister that peeled away on the top of my right index finger. i woke up this morning and my knuckle was very red and swollen and painful and the spot where the cut was was a black color. i wasn't able to bend my finger. i immediately washed my hands, rinsed the area with peroxide, applied neosporian and a band-aid. later in the day when i went to take a shower i removed the band-aid and the area looked more red and it was oozing. on the top of my hand following under my index finger also had a red area that was sore and my veins looked puffy. why is it doing this and what should i be doing to get rid of this?",
