    "question": "I'm a 28 year old, I've been with my husband for six years, married 4 months and we're trying to conceive. Had a pap done in January, no problems, except PCOS. She prescribed METFORMIN which was ironic to me, because my husband takes it for diabetes and My cycle is 7 days late, and I'm having lower abdominal pain and my uterus feels funny. took a home pregnancy test today and it was negative. Not sure what's going on, but I really want to have some cute cuddly babies! What could this be. Next Drs appointment isn't until June. Help!!",
