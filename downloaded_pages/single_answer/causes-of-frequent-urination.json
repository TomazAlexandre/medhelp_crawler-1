            "answer": "Frequent urinationGood afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0I know how unsettling it is when your pet is acting out of the ordinary.Polyuria, or increased urination, is seen in pets of all ages.\u00a0\u00a0Polydipsia, or increased water consumption, is commonly noted as well.\u00a0\u00a0Urine production and water consumption is controlled by the interaction between different systems within your pet\u2019s body.\u00a0\u00a0Increased water consumption is noted because the body is losing more fluid via urination so the body compensates for this loss.Causes of increased urination and drinking:1.\tEnvironmental (Heat and humidity)2.\tUrinary tract infections3.\tUrinary crystals or stones4.\tKidney infections5.\tKidney disease6.\tHyperadrenocorticism (Cushing\u2019s Disease)7.\tElectrolyte abnormalities (Sodium, Chloride, or Potassium)8.\tDiabetes9.\tBehavioral10.\tDrug induced\u2014if giving medicationsThere are more causes but this shows some of the common causes.It is important that you schedule an appointment with your veterinarian.\u00a0\u00a0At this appointment, make sure you bring in a urine sample to start.\u00a0\u00a0Your veterinarian will do a complete physical examination and my recommend routine blood work, stool sample and radiographs to explore the reason for the increased drinking and urinating.Good luck and I hope this helps.",

    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I have a pembroke welsh corgi who has recently started drinking water more than usual and urinating sometimes 4 times during each visit outside, of which there are about 5 potty trips daily.\u00a0\u00a0She can't seem to wait to get off the deck in some cases and urinates just outside the door.\u00a0\u00a0There is only one step off the deck to get to the yard and she doesn't seem to have troubles managing it, she just can't seem to wait.\u00a0\u00a0So far though, there have been no accidents inside the house.\u00a0\u00a0She has also pooped on the deck twice this week, which isn't normal for her either.\u00a0\u00a0In each case, we made sure she started in the yard and she ended up pooping on the deck after she finished in the yard.\u00a0\u00a0We've had some issues with her in the past with digestive problems.\u00a0\u00a0She seems to have a sensitive stomach and human food (even pieces of cheese for calcium and fresh vegetables as suggested by her previous owner) cause diarrhea leading to blood in the stool if left unchecked.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if one has anything to do with the other but we've only had her for around 9 months and it may be pertinent.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know what you think this might be.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your help.",
