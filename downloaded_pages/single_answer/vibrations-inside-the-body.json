            "answer": "Hi,Since your spinal and brain scans are normal most of the neurological lesions are ruled out. It is also important to rule out conditions like diabetes and B12 deficiency which cause peripheral neuropathy.Other conditions like fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome can also be considered.Please discuss these possibilities with your treating doctor as it is difficult to give an opinion without a clinical exam.Take care!",

    "question": "I have small vibrations, in my whole body. It is noticeable, when I am at rest especially at night. I don't have any tremors; and i don't have any vibrations at extremities. It started two years ago when I started to take medication Gemfibrozil for my high triglyceride; could be coincidence.; my body couldn't tolerate it. so I stopped taking that medicine. now I am taking diazide for high Blood Pressure and Tricor for high triglyceride. I had a spinal and brain scan done few months ago and my neurologist couldn't find anything wrong. Could this be any precursor to anything serious to happen or what?",
