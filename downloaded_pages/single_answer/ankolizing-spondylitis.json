    "question": "I have been DX with this disease and am currently on inflammatories and if I do not take them I can hardly get out of bed. Anyone know the causes of this disease??I am a vietnam veteran 60 years old with exposure to herbicide (agent orange) while in country. My other disabilities are DM2, PN, and CAD, this disease is probably the worst because of the pain factor involved. Is this caused by diabetes?? Also I have anemia and give myself shots every month.",
