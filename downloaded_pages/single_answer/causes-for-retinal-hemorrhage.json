    "question": "I went to the optometrist today for a routine eye exam and was also told I had retinal hemorrhage.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said the most common causes are hypertension and diabetes and that such systemic diseases should be excluded so I am seeing my GP tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0I am a medical student and we often practicing taking blood pressure on each other, so I think HTN can reasonably be excluded already.\u00a0\u00a0I am also an active 28 year old female, taking my multivitamins and trying to be conscious about how I eat (though my BMI is about 28) so diabetes doesn't make a lot of sense either.\u00a0\u00a0I do get migraine with aura and incidentally, have had 3 in the last month (which is extremely rare for me...I usually get that many in a year).Does this sound like a familiar pattern of symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Can retinal hemorrhage be brought on by bouts of high stress (like the first month back to school after a lovely relaxing summer?).\u00a0\u00a0Are there sometimes idiopathic causes and its truly nothing to worry about?Thank you,Samba",
