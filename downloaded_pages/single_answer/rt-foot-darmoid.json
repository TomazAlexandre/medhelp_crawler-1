            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What could have developed after needle injury is pus filled abscess or cysts. Since they are recurring, get your blood sugar checked to see if it is raised (both fasting and two hour after food). Generally diabetes is a predisposing factor. PRODOPHYLIN RESIN is generally used for warts. The warts on foot are generally on the plantar side. Salicylic acid is another option you can try. Otherwise you can go for cryosurgery.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
