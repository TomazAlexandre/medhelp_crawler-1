    "question": "Hi there - I'm a 24 year old female with, I think, symptoms related to anxiety though I haven't had it formally checked out and wanted to ask here first. Since I was young, whenever I got worried about something I would fixate on it for long periods of time and worry incessantly. I didn't develop gastrointestinal problems until about last year when my PCP prescribed some meds for what she thought was possible GERD, but since then my 'heartburn' has gone away and I just get bloated/gassy feelings. I'm wondering if my bloating/gas/gas discomfort is related to anxiety I get. I have never had a full blown anxiety attack - I'm just curious if these symptoms are related and if I should have them checked out by my PCP again. Most of the time these symptoms come about in the morning or at night and whenever I worry my stomach gets upset and I shake. I exercise 4-5 times a week for at least an hour, eat healthy, have good cholesterol and drink only water, coffee maybe a couple times a week. My gut instincts say this isn't serious, but whenever I get on the internet I start looking up all kinds of things related to my symptoms. There is no history of any kind of cancer in my family, just diabetes and heart problems, but I often worry to the point of making myself sick over diseases and think I may need help :/ Please advise.",
