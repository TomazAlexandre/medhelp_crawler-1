            "answer": "Hi,How are you? It is good that the CT scan was normal. Postural or orthostatic hypotension\u00a0\u00a0is a form of low blood pressure that happens when you stand up from sitting or lying down. It presents with feeling lightheaded, blurred vision, weakness, confusion and headache. If it persists, check with your doctor for proper evaluation. Direct clinical examination and further tests may be done to determine the underlying cause. Treatment will depend on the results. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am getting intense headaches that last for a few seconds... the pain is in the back and top of the head... initially I had the pain while getting up from the floor... when I had to stand up using my hands to support me ... but over the last couple of days the headaches happen mostly at night while lying down... I was having four to five episodes in a period of two to 2 1/2 hours... once I lay down on the recliner I was able to sleep through at a stretch for 4 to five hours... the pain is intense enough to wake me up... I had a CT scan done but it came back clear... I had diabetes and hypertension... and am not sure if they play a role in the headaches... the headaches leave behind a lingering feeling of a heavy head... Please help...",
