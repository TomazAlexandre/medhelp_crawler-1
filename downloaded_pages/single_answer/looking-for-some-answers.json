            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.It could be that your symptoms of chronic urinary infections are recurring. But it could also be that the kidneys are likely to be infected resulting in Pyelonephritis, as with your history of chronic urinary infections, this can spread up and affect the kidneys. An ultrasonography and kidney function tests can help diagnose this. Hope diabetes has been ruled out.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hello,Just looking for some insight on my situation.\u00a0\u00a0I am 30 years old, I have had frequent UTI's since I was about 19 years of age.\u00a0\u00a0I saw a urologist back when I was about 25, had ultrasounds and exams they could not find a cause of my UTI's, so I was put on a preventative daily antibiotic for a couple of years and it curred my UTI's while on the antibiotics.All was good then at 28 I became pregnant with my son and quit taking the antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0Everything was perfect during my pregnancy I didn't have a UTI once.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as I deliver my son they start reappearing.\u00a0\u00a0My son is 19 months old and I have had 5 in the past 7 months.\u00a0\u00a0This last one had me with a fever of 103, severe pain, blood in the urine and diagnosed with a kideny infection.\u00a0\u00a0I had a follow up yesterday to confirm there is no more infection, but I am still having symptoms. I am seeing a urologist again next week, but could this be a kidney stone or a more serious problem?\u00a0\u00a0Even with my urinasysis coming up clean?\u00a0\u00a0I have still not gotten the result of growth after 48 hours, but there was no blood or sign of infection intially.",
