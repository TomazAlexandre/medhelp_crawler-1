            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.Most likely possibility here could be related to neuropathy (nerve pain like numbness and tingling at affected areas) due to diabetes, alcohol abuse and stress or anxiety. This may lead to muscle weakness and coordination also. If you suffer continuous weakness and notice reduced strength of muscle bulk in your limbs, please arrange an appointment with a neurologist right away who may evaluate the possibilities first. These \u201cred flags\u201d could be indicative of progression of neuropathy and early treatment (like B-Complex) is essential if permanent damage needs to be avoided. Further referral to a physiotherapist for exercises could be beneficial and may produce relief of symptoms. Hope this help. Take Care & Stay Healthy!!!",
