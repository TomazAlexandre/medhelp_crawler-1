            "answer": "I agree with the tests for hepatitis.Further evaluation of the liver can be done with an ultrasound, which can look for fatty liver as well as anatomical liver disease.I would continue to serially monitor the liver enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0If they continue to rise (i.e. the ALT rises to 3x the upper limit of normal), a liver biopsy can be considered.The ultrasound is reasonable, you can discuss this with your personal physician, or in conjunction with another opinion.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patients education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.www.kevinmd.com",

    "question": "I realize that there are many possible reasons for elevated liver enzymes, but I've had them for years and my physician is not concerned; nor was I, but now recently I have become so.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate general advice, but more so on what my next steps ought to be.I'm an otherwise healthy married male, age 46, 5'10\" and 200 pounds with several allergies (non-food/drug to my knowledge) and minor asthma.\u00a0\u00a0During my every other year annual, my physician has indicated slightly elevated liver enzymes including blood sugar and cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0I had a physical in October with the same result, he checked and indicated that it didn't appear to be enlarged.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not one to take medications or drink heavily (1 to 2 beers or glasses or wine per week).\u00a0\u00a0I was on Trazadone at 45mgs, as a sleep aid due to stress, which I've been on/off for 2 years as needed which is pretty seldon except recently due to a new job.\u00a0\u00a0I also take a One-A-Day multivitamin, 1000mg of fish oil 3 times/day, Chrondointin/Glucasomine 2 times/day and eat fairly healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I am active runner/biker with 3 times/week at 30-45 minutes.My father, who's in his 70's, my height, weight was told he had fatty liver 10 years ago and he has high triglicerides and on Lipitor.\u00a0\u00a0My mother's has wheat allergy, high blood pressure and high cholesterol and on Lipitor.\u00a0\u00a0Her brother just passed away at 66 with liver failure attributed to alcohol, but his wife indicated he didn't drink hard liquor or have more than a couple of beers per days though most days; he had inflamated legs which was treated for diabetes.I just received back the blood test results from my life insurance carrier due to my job change and I'm now concerned; they've referred the results to my physician 3 weeks ago and he's still not concerned.\u00a0\u00a0I've stopped all alcohol and Trazadone in the last 2 weeks and had begun taking a Liver support supplement from GNC (200 mg milk thistle mostly) 3 times/day.\u00a0\u00a0Though now I feel a mild tenderness in my right torso just beneath my ribs and feel slightly more bloated; so, I've stopped that supplement for the past 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0My blood work results indicated normal except the following:Glucose - not valid due to glycolysSGPT (ALT) - 49 U/LGGT (GGTP) - 146 U/LCholesterol - 229 MG/DLLDL - 158HDL - 47Chol/HDL - 4.9Hep B & C were negative; Urine was normal.I'm not sure what to do since my physician's not concerned; should I get another opinion?\u00a0\u00a0Any advice on next steps would be greatly appreciated!\u00a0\u00a0I realize another blood test in a few days might be OK given the medication/alcohol changes, but the tenderness is disconcerning.Thanks very much in advance!",
