What is important is that the weight should not be below the normal percentile for his age, waist circumference and height.Also, worms in stool, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes or a chronic inflammatory bowel disorder can cause unexplained weight loss. So, check if he has been tested for it. Take care!",

    "question": "I have a 16 year old son who is currently 6'9\" and only weighs 163 pounds...about a year ago he weighed 175ish but has his wisdom teeth pulled and lost 12 pounds since then has been unable to gain weight. He is extremely active as a basketball player and eats me out of house and home, but still can not gain weight. He's been to the doctors and had tests run, everything normal. He tried to consume about 5000 calories a day but was just unable to do it as it made him feel sick, also he's tried protein shakes but nothing seems to be helping. Any suggestions???",
