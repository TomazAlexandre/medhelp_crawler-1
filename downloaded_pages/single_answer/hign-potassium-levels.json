I eat bananas like a monkey and ate banana cream pie just before I went to the doctor for a blood test. I have had some tingling in my hands, and had to use Ibuprobens also.What is \"too\" high a reading number? Can this be cured? Should I be worried?The doctor's office called me in for another test, but I haven't been yet; I am supposed to fast first.Please answer if you can, I'm 49, (my brother was just diagnoised with diabetes,) Might I get diabetes or worse yet die?Also I've just started taking Theeragran-M and Omega-3's.Am I a train wreck in the making?Sincerely,Cheryl",
