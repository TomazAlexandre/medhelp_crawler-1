            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!It could be stomach flu, anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
