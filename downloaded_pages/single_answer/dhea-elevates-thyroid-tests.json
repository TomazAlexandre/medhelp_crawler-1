    "question": "I have been taking DHEA on recommendation of a Professor of Endocinology in London, for nearly 10 years. Although it did not register with me at the time, I did notice a raised TSH, T4's etc in my blood test results. Then some weeks ago I was surfing the web and I read an article where it said that in some cases taking DHEA can give a false reading to your Thyrdoid blood tests, ie: elevating them, therefore making them read as normal, when they might be below normal. Have you ever heard of this? I have stopped taking the DHEA for 6 weeks as my GP said I can then have another thyroid blood test, to see if this is the case. I have a long and complicated medical history, with 2 Trans[pnoidla brain ops. 22 years ago. One for a Prolactinoma and the other because an abscess grew after that op on the Pituitary Cavity. After both operations I had adverse reactions to surgery and nearly died. Nevertheless I was discharged and it was some 12 years before I could get an Endocrinologist to believe I did have something seriously wrong with me. After many tests I was diagnosed with Hyppopiturism, including Adrenal failure, non-existant growth hormone. Then nearly 4 years ago, I started getting Diabetes Insipidus symptoms. Having suffered from it after the brain ops. I knew what to expect, what I didn't expect was this time I do not have a thirst. No Endo can understand this and look at me as if I'm an alien with my symptoms!! On top of that since I started with the DI symptoms, I have had over 2 years of UTI's and no amount of various antibiotics (now I'm constantly on them) has cured me. The doctors, consultants etc haven't a clue as to why I am like this. I could go on forever giving you a very long list of my ailments, but I don't want to bore you!! Suffice to say, after two low sodium crisis last July, when I was hospitalised and within a short time of going into total organ failure, life isn't so good. I remain upbeat, a happy sort of person, but I'd love to find some answers to my problems. I have wonderful GP's, they are so supportive, but they are just General Practitioners and they honestly say I know more about my Endocrine problems than they do. During the past 10 years - I have seen 10 different Endocrinologists, either Professors or Consultants, all who draw a blank on how to treat me and make me feel better. To say I feel exhausted from the time I wake up, is an understatement. I take 18 different types of medication during the day, from Cortisol to pain medication, growth hormone etc. I know I have written a lot, can you make any sense of it and help me?",
