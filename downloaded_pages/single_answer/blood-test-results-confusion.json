            "answer": "Have you been tested for Hashimoto's? The blood tests are TGab and TPOab. Hashi can cause these nodules and it also causes the high end TSH and the low frees.I think the problem here is that the doc is primarily concerned with treating TSH and not with treating your symptoms and your FreeT3/T4 levels. Some of us with hypothyroidism/Hashi do not feel better unless TSH is suppressed. That means TSH might be below the range that our doctor's prefer, but our bodies might just be different.Your TSH of 1.75 is high, IMHO. Your FT3 is way too low. I don't understand how a doctor can flip flop your meds by adding then removing Armour. Naturally, you don't feel well. If you do test positive for Hashimoto's, then it is imperative you stay on the thyroid medication or you will get worse.I have a wonderful endocrinologist who treats my Frees. TSH is a pituitary hormone, and not always indicates direct thyroid activity. The frees tell us exactly what the thyroid is doing.If you feel this endo is not treating you correctly, switch! I went through three docs until I found one who actually knows how to treat Hashimoto's/hypothyroid patients.Also, call the doctor's office and ask the receptionist how many thyroid patients the doc sees. My doctor sees 75 percent thyroid, not diabetes! Too many endos specialize in diabetes and don't know SQUAT about thryoid!Here's a website which lists recommended endos. This is where I found my new endo: http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/:) Tamra",

    "question": "Can anyone help explain? My blood test results were tsh 1.75 and free t3 185. My family dr had me on armour. I switched to an endo and these tests were taken 6 wks after being off the armour as he wanted to start fresh. My free t3 was low (230) initially which is why I was put on armour. The armour had brought me down to almost 0 for tsh. Now being off all meds my free t3 is lower than ever. My hair falls out terribly, my skin is dry and I have low energy and fall asleep in the afternoon. I feel overwhelmed very quickly. I am a 56 year old woman. I eat very little but can't shed a pound. I had a weight gain of 30 lbs during the first year of these problems which started 2 years ago. My appt is next week and I am afraid the dr will do nothing. I also have a small nodule on my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks if you can help!",
