            "answer": "After heart surgery, there is a period of recovery. However, this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be sexual or that you can\u2019t return to previous sexual activity after a period of time. What has your cardiologist told you about when you can resume being sexual with yourself or with a partner? You wouldn\u2019t want me to second-guess her/him when, a) I\u2019m not a cardiologist, and b) I have no idea of your medical history and whether your heart condition is complicated by such factors as diabetes, stress, diet, lack of exercise, etc. No one can evaluate your physician\u2019s advice without a thorough examination and health history.One important factor to consider is that the bone in the middle of your chest (the sternum) was opened during surgery. This bone does not completely heal for at least 12 weeks (3 months). For that period of time, no extra stress should be put on it.As to your motivations for being sexual: I hope you\u2019re not worried because you feel that you\u2019re not measuring up to some \u201cmasculine\u201d standard unless you\u2019re having sex with your wife and that you\u2019ll consider other reasons for being sexual than just an empty performance for someone else\u2019s benefit. In fact, when we have health challenges, sex can be very life-affirming; however, it\u2019s important not to risk re-injuring your heart.I\u2019m also wondering if you have asked your physician about the safety of any activities that might increase your heart rate at this point. Sex is like any other physical act: it raises your blood pressure and heart rate. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not running, jumping, playing tennis, etc.\u2014in short, anything that would put a strain on your heart. When you\u2019re being sexual, as you become aroused, your heart rate will increase in the same manner as it would during any heavy physical exercise like running. A specific question to ask your cardiologist is whether an increase in your heart rate is OK at this time. If you\u2019d like more information, I highly recommend the book, \u201cSound Sex and the Aging Heart; Sex in the Mid and Later Years with Special Reference to Cardiac Problems,\u201d by Lee Schengold, et al, widely available online both used and in paperback. Best of luck to you. Dr. J",
