    "question": "I am 62. I have abused alcohol for about 40 years. The last three years my drinking has increased and has caused me very serious health problems.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped cold turkey two days ago. I will NOT drink again. My questions are: How long before I notice improvement in the edema I have in my feet? How long before my liver gets back to a reasonably normal state? How long before my stomach allows me to eat without giving me severe heartburn? How long before my stomach returns to its normal size? How long before my urine stops looking like coca-cola and my stools have blood in them? Thank you.",
