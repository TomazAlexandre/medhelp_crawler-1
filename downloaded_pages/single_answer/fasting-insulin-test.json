    "question": "My a1c was 5.9\u00a0\u00a0and glucose was 133.I am eating appropriately for a person with diabetes.I am hoping to avoid getting full blown diabetes. I want to make sure from the beginning I get the proper lab tests to avoid mistakes in my diagnosis.AT what point do I get a fasting insulin test? I read somewhere, cannot recall, but the article said that the A1c must be given ALONG WITH a fasting insulin to get accurate results.IS this correct? thank you",
