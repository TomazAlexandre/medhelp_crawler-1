            "answer": "Hi,Numbness and feeling of pins and needles are usually related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased or injured. Prolonged period of sitting or lying in one position, can lead to nerve compression .The most common cause of thigh numbness without other symptoms is compression or irritation of the nerve that supplies the skin of the upper, outside part of the thigh which is the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve. The triggering factors are obesity, diabetes mellitus; tight clothing etc .Any disc problems compressing the nerves in the lower back can also lead to numbness in outer thigh.
