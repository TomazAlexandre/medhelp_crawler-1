            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are many causes of dizziness, lightheadedness, passing out, blackouts etc. It is difficult to comment without examination. I am just enumerating the possible causes. You can discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Dizziness could be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position), internal ear problems and cervical spondylitis or compression of cervical spinal nerves. All these cause dizziness when you get up from lying down position or when you change position that results in a change in the level of your head. Cervical spondylitis and ear problems also cause dizziness on changing the position of the neck.Other causes are anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling.Certain types of epilepsies and seizures too can cause similar symptoms. If she has an accompanying headache then you must also look at benign intracranial hypertension. Heart problems too have been looked at in her case. If all other tests are normal, maybe an ECHO should be done to rule out mitral valve prolapse. It can also be chronic fatigue syndrome if all other causes are ruled out. A brain lesion too can cause dizziness but often there are other neurological signs such as numbness, tingling, loss of function of a limb etc.Please discuss with your doctor as a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My girlfriend is 17 and randomly passes out. She doesn't do drugs and doesn't take any medication. Sometimes right before she passes out she gets dizzy, but other times there is no warning at all. She said sometimes she has a slight pain in her chest after waking up. When she passes out she is only out for about 5 to 10 seconds before she gains consciousness again. Today when she passed out, i caught her, and she woke up and her head hurt... but she said it wasn't like a headache though and didn't feel like she hit it. We took her to the hospital about 2 months ago when it started and they ran tests. They said her heart is perfect. The cardiologist said the same thing. They claim that she is dehydrated, but she drinks alot of water. She passes out probably once or twice a week. Please tell me what you think it might be.",
