            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.I always advise talking with your doctor about all medications that you take during pregnancy. Your doctor will be able to give you the most accurate information about what is safe for you specifically. Most doctors like to see you for your first prenatal visit at about 7-8weeks, so you should call to make an appointment if you haven't already. When you call you can mention that you take metformin and are concerned if it is safe. The doctor's office will be able to give you the most accurate information.Cathy",
