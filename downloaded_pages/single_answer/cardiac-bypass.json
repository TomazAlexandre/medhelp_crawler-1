            "answer": "I have heard of vein grafts collapsing in a couple of weeks, but to clog up again in that time? It obviously can't be blood clots because medication is available to bust those, so I am left to assume it's plaque. Becoming such a mess in 5 weeks? hmmm.Even if I could swallow that, I would want to know why they intend on repeating the same procedure when it failed so soon. What have they done to prevent it happening again?If arteries were to plaque that quick, I would have thought the surgeons would be questioning if it's worth another attempt. Have they looked at the possibility of dealing with the clogging using angioplasty? Something doesn't seem quite right here. I was refused a second bypass by a surgeon on the basis that the first one failed so quickly and there was too much disease for grafting. Maybe a second opinion would be a good idea?",
