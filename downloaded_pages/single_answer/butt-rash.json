    "question": "on monday morning i woke up and had a bump on my left cheek. i itched and itched it then it was fine.. then i woke up tuesday morning with two bumps on the top of the crack again itching and itching. my whole but is not covered but because i've itched so much i think it got irritated because now its raised. when i pull the skin it is back to normal looking but what could cause this? i keep putting anti-itch cream on it, but it's still here. i don't want to go to the doctors. i'm not sexually active. i started thinking that maybe i got bit by something. or maybe i need to wash my bedding. or maybe i have a weird disease of some sort. but i don't understand how i can just wake up one morning and have a rash on my rear. will i have to go to the doctors to treat it? or is there some type of rash cream that would work?",
