Smoking, alcohol, nicotine, anxiety or stress can also cause unpleasant body odor. You need to seek a second opinion on this for further confirmation. Hope this helps. Best.",

    "question": "hi, i am a 20 year old male.Pretty healthy.The reason i am here is because 5 years ago, i started having bad comments about my body odor.Few people said it was fishy or fuzzy, or just smell bad.I have consulted some great medical doctors, but unfortunately they werent able to smell it.Their answer, perhaps its a mental problem.Then i said to myself it could be true, because my friends dont smell it, my family and my girlfriend dont smell it.So indeed i went to see a psychiatric, but no great results.But i know its not all in my head, because i hear them, and i can see the bad gestures.Perhaps i wondered, that smell comes and goes, because sometimes everybody would get close to me like we were forever friends.I am the type of person who always shower before going out, i never wear a shirt twice.Due to this problem, i have used all the american d.o or antiperpirants that you could find at the drugstore.No results.I thought it was my diet that needed to be changed, but i leave bymyself so i dont eat that much specially spicy food.If there was something i could change about me would be it, get over with this problem, go back to school and enjoy life.I already thought that suicide was the right answer, but the worst part is that when youre gone the people who were making fun of you will stay in school, become someone, and enjoy their lives.So please if you have any suggestions youre welcome",
