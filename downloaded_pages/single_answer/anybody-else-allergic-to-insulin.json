    "question": "I have a lot of problems with meds for my diabetes so switched to insulin five years ago. Recently, I started getting hives every time I inject. My doctor says its a sensitivity, not an allergy, but whatever, it's driving me bonkers. I started on Lantus, once daily, and also very low carbs to avoid having to top up with rapid insulin. That worked for awhile. Now, I am itching day and night but especially after taking my Lantus, at midnight. Lately, I've started waking up (about 2 hours after going to sleep) with severe nervousness (hysterics, almost) and have to get up to try to calm down. Antihistamines helped at first but not so much recently. As a result, I am getting very little sleep and am nearly exhausted both physically and mentally.My doctor seems to be at a loss so any suggestions appreciated.",
