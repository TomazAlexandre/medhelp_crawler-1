            "answer": "Keep up the good work with your diet! Exercise as much as you can, then you will have more energy, more you exercise more energy your body gains. Learn the right breathing techniques. I know from experience, how much important is that. Don\u2019t starve yourself! Be sure you eat from all food groups, I am a believer of portion control, eat lots of vegetables and fruits, you must analyze and plan a head\u2026a day or two every bite you eat\u2026. The shortness of breath can be a warning sign: you must lose more significant kilos. This point I would concentrate only on that, it is a very hard work, but you are very young and it will make a world of different in your life.Don't forget you must burn more calories then how much you get from food every day...that is the key!Good luck.",

    "question": "I am a 38yr old obese female that for the last 3wks have been experiencing extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle aches in lower legs, extreme thirst, and heart palputations where my heart feels like is going to beat out of my chest.\u00a0\u00a0I am on blood pressure medicine which has kept my high blood pressure under control 119/80.\u00a0\u00a0Being concerned with heart problems (father) & Diabetes (mother,father,sister) running in my family I went to the doctor and blood work was ran which found that I had total cholesterol of 222 and a TSH level of 200.\u00a0\u00a0 Due to my weight I know I am at high risk for both of these diseases, however my doctor has not ordered any tests as in EKG or other tests to rule out heart problems since my blood pressure seems on target.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be more persistant with my symptoms being what they are to have these tests run or seek a second opinion if needed?\u00a0\u00a0I recently changed my diet quite drastically and have lost a little over 20lbs and it has only been since my change in diet that these problems have arisen.Thank You for your Time!",
