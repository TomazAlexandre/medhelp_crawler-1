            "answer": "I juss did my three hour today I hope I pass mine, my last pregnancy had gd and I hated it pricking your fingers every two hours after eating first thing in the morning ugh, plus I was on insulin. All i can say is if you do have it try managing it first with a diet then go to the pills and if that doesn't last resort insulin. Don't let the dr pu you on meds first try to manage with a good diet. I tried and nothing worked only thing was I kept losing weight nothing could manage it but insulin. Good luck to you",
