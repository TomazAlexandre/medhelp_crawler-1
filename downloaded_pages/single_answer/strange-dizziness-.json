    "question": "Hi there about two months ago we were heading to lunch at work and I suddenly became slightly dizzy as if I were almost buzzed (from drinking). I'm a healthy 25yr old with no previous health problems in my life and I do not take medication. It was my birthday and I was very stressed and anxious, and has just had a cup of coffee from starbucks as I usually do. The sensation scared the life out of me and slowly went away as we began to eat. A similar episode occured about a month later. This time I had been out at a halloween party the night before and got very little sleep and had eaten very little the night before. The dizziness wasn't as intense but it subsided after I lay down for a short while. Can anyone explain what might be happening? Friends have told me it might be blood sugar, etc etc.Thanks!",
