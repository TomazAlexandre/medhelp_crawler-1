    "question": "I am curious as to why i am the only one in my family to have worsening vision. My eyesight is 4 times worse than my father and brother and its keeps getting worse. I went to a specialist and he told me i developed Glaucoma because of some depression in the cup in my left eye...and that my field of vision is reduced. They told what is wrong, but I didn't get the answer i needed... WHY?My question is does Ritalin, Lithium and Seroquel cause or affect eyesight? I know, from the literature that Ritalin causes blurry vision, but they do not bring up long term affects regarding this matter. My eyesight is at -7.5 today. |It was -5.25 two years ago. Also i get horrible migraines that shoot right through my eyes to the back of my head. It sometimes hurts looking at any bright light (sunlight or TV).Thank you for your help and timeThis was not the case 10 years ago, before my diagnoses and having to take the meds.",
