            "answer": "It's probably a \"postprandial hypoglycemia\". The cause can be \"rapid stomach emptying\" that causes \"dumping syndrome\". Search for these terms...In diabetics this usually occurs due to impaired vagal nerve that controls gut motility. The nerve could be damaged due to long term sugar imbalance or due to atherosclerosis of abdominal vessels that would affect nerve blood supply.If you have dumping syndrome, you should avoid large meals and foods that quickly leave the stomach. I guess you would need advice from dietitian that have experience with diabetes and mentioned issues.",
