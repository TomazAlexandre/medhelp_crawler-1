            "answer": "Hello,Some of the important causes of leg spasms are overextension of the muscles,overweight,prolonged standing during the day,dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low calcium, sodium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism,peripheral vascular disease,nerve compression, and multiple sclerosis,spinal cord injury,cerebral palsy or stroke.Some of these causes like dehydration,being overweight,alcohol intake and prolonged standing are modifiable by efforts of the patient.My advise is to consult a physician and rule out the above medical conditions by thorough investigations as without physical examination and investigations, pinpointing a diagnosis is tough.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am a male in my late 30s.\u00a0\u00a0I had several espisodes over three days of spasms in my left leg, each episode lasting only a few seconds.\u00a0\u00a0I have consulted several doctors, but am getting differing opinions.\u00a0\u00a0Two doctors (one specializing in MS) have diagnosed this as possible MS and are encouraging me to begin medication immediately.\u00a0\u00a0A third doctor also specializing in MS tells me that MS episodes should not last only seconds and thinks that my symptomes are not typical for MS.\u00a0\u00a0He recommends that I wait, see if additional symptomes develop, and have another MRI in a couple of months.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone one have any experience that would suggest which advice I should follow?",
