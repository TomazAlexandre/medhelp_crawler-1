            "answer": "Hi!The symptoms could be related to neck-tongue syndrome. There is upper nuchal (neck) or occipital pain on one side of the head, with or without numbness in these areas. This is accompanied by simultaneous ipsilateral (same side) numbness of the tongue. This numbness is caused by compression of the second cervical root (C2) in the atlantoaxial space. . Do discuss this with your doctor (both dentist and orthopedic specialist) and get yourself examined.Hemifacial numbness could be due to common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth, dental caries, etc\u00a0\u00a0Hemi facial numbness is also seen in Bell\u2019s palsy, trigeminal neuralgia where a spasm may cause numbness, or due to acoustic neuroma which is a benign tumor of the eighth cranial nerve.Please ask your aunt to consult a doctor, preferably a neurologist. Take care!",
