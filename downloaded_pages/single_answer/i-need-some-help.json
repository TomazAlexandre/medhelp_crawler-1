    "question": "Hi, i have a female russian blue cat that's about 3 years old. Lately, i've noticed that she is getting thin. I make sure she eats, drinks, gets her exercise, and uses the litter box. She has the energy of a regular cat, but yet she is thin. I have heard from people that russian blues are thin to begin with. Can you help me?",
