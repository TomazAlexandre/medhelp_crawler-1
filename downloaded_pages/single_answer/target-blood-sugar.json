            "answer": "Hello Corkrin,We are volunteers here and not medical professionals, so I urge you to talk with your son's pediatrician about your concerns.\u00a0\u00a0I agree that 274 sounds high, but even a person without diabetes can have a high reading -- depending on one's other health factors.Hormones, medication, stress, and recent meals will affect blood sugar, so it's important that you keep track of your son's overall info and share that with his doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Also note mood, urination, hunger & thirst patterns.Since you're newly diagnosed, you might also be interested in visiting the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation website:\u00a0\u00a0http://www.jdrf.org where there's a link to a more personal Online Diabetes Support Team.\u00a0\u00a0Staffed with volunteers like us, they are also able to connect folks with others in your area.\u00a0\u00a0Look for the link to Newly Diagnosed.Good luck and do follow up on Monday with the doctor.",
