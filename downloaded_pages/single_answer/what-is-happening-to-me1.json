    "question": "I have type 1 diabetes, newly diagnosed in November 03.\u00a0\u00a0My dr thinks I have had it, undiagnosed for a few years.\u00a0\u00a0I think there are some lasting effects from it.\u00a0\u00a0The base of my spine, and my neck area give me problems, and seem to come and go, but get worse.\u00a0\u00a0At times, I feel like I'm going to faint, unless I get circulation moving, and cannot sit in my car and drive well, especially for a long time.I do have an abscessed tooth, of which I am taking clindamycin (an antibiotic) until it can get pulled and insurance dictates what they will cover to replace the tooth (former root canal gone bad).\u00a0\u00a0This condition is very scary.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if I should get an MRI of my head, as I also have headaches on that same side, which come and go for about the last five years.\u00a0\u00a0My dad and my aunt both died of subarachnoid hemmorhages (brain aneurisyms), so that is also making me worried.\u00a0\u00a0I have to move my head to one side, and arch my back to feel like the circulation is going to my head.My blood sugars have been fairly stabilized (when I don't try to cheat!), and I have checked my blood sugar when these episodes occur, and they are usually where they should be, so I don't think this is blood sugar related.Can anyone help me?",
