    "question": "Hi, I am a 19 year old girl, with type 1 diabetes.I have very healthy eyes, I have had multiple tests including MRI, VER test and eyes examined by opthalmologists. I don't need glasses.I got my first blind spot maybe a year ago, and it started off almost black and then faded to a permanant blind spot. Since then I have been getting more, I have LOADS in each eye.I can also see them more on a grid/lines I have other symptoms including legs burning, loss of appetite, not sleeping, eye pain occasionally and a numbness in my left little finger. My dad has MS very badly, but my MRI said I'm Normal. I'm worried. I have had stressful few years resulting in bulimia for a few years and now I'm better with that, yet still getting eye problems. Please help me, no doctor will listen to me now! I need help, it's very bad and I have cancelled my driving lessons as I can totally cover up signs or cars with my blind spots. Helpppppppppppp",
