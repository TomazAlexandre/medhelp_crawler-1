    "question": "A macular hole was found by a neuro-opthomologist on April 1st. He advised me to see my eye dr asap. Today I had an appointment. They dialated my eyes, put me up to a machine, and took computerized pictues of my eyes. After the exam, my eye dr told me yes she could see the hole. She did not tell me what Stage it is. She wants to do follow-up exams every two months, unless I have an emergency sooner. She said I may need referral to a Retinologist in the future for surgery.Is this the proper approach to take? On average what percentage of these macular holes need surgery? Does the vision improve after surgery? Since I drive for a living, I am greatly concerned about this problem. Any answers greatly appreciated. PS I am a 60 yr old woman, type 2 diabetic, no retinopathy seen, small cataract in same eye as hole.",
