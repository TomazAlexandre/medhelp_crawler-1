            "answer": "Hi!Yes, women with thyroid disorders can become pregnant provided their thyroid function is under control and they do not have any other associated problems like polycystic ovary or diabetes or liver disorders. In this case, all these disorders will need to be treated and brought under control before pregnancy is attempted. I suggest you consult an infertility specialist because they are the best people to help you. Otherwise, if your thyroid is under control, you can try. Today the chances of conceiving and carrying forward a full term pregnancy with a healthy baby are high. Take care!",
