            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I\u2019ll come straight to the point. Generally such wounds that do not heal are called no-healing ulcers in medical term. They could be due to underlying infection, low supply of oxygen to the wound that is reducing the healing process, underlying diabetes, or due to underlying dermatitis.Wounds heal slower in diabetics or smokers or alcoholics who have been drinking for a long time. So these have to be ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Also diabetes leads peripheral neuropathy, atherosclerosis etc which make wound healing troublesome.You need a culture sensitivity of wound scraping to know what antibiotics will suit the infection. If there is underlying dermatitis, then this needs to be taken care of. Wound debridement would be required along with plastic repair. If there is severe atherosclerosis preventing blood supply to wound, then this needs to be diagnosed by angiograms. Also too tight skin being stitched up can break open the wound when there is pressure on the wound. It would be a good idea to consult the surgeon regarding plastic repair by skin graft, after taking care of underlying cause.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
