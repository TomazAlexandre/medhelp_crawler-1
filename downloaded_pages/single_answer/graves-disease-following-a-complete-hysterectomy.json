            "answer": "I had the same occurance in 2000. I had my uterus and ovaries removed in different operations and then becam ill with graves' disease within 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0Now it has been 12 years and am beginnig to show signs of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I feel the changes of the endochrine system have been the cause.\u00a0\u00a0When you remove the estrogen, to which i stupidly took replacement for nearly 10 years, i believe the thyroid tried to compensate the missing hormone and then led to the graves' disease.\u00a0\u00a0Now. since the pancreas is also hormone producing, i feel the diabetes is another problem with the inbalance of the hormanl endochrine system. My hysterectomy, to me, was a botched mess of believing a doctor when i should have trusted myself. Now look where it got me. I was on an ever climbing amount of levoxyl over the last 12 years until this year they have reduced my dosage. My treatment completely stopped natural thyroid production and my weight has been fairly stable but at 30 ppounds higher than prior to onset. This situation is aggravating but very manageable.\u00a0\u00a0The only real complication i am bothered by is that the weight is tough to get back off.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes and good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Sandra",

    "question": "Four years again I had a complete hysterectomy. Six months after that I was diagnosed with hyperthyroid and graves disease. My whole life I was thin usually 120 lbs and I am 5'5\". I could never gain weight. Eight months after my hysterectomy I had a sub-total thyroidectomy. Now after both surgeries I weight 164 lbs and I am so unhappy. My doctor says my thyroid levels are correct but I still feel tired all the time and I am not losing weight even after drastically modifying my diet. I am not using any estrogen.\u00a0\u00a0Could this have anything to do with not being able to lose weight? I don't know where to start with weight loss and I am not getting any answers.",
