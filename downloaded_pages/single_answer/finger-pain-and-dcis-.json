            "answer": "How are you? Does your sister have diabetes? What are other symptoms present? Is there an involvement of the joints or just the finger nails? Pain affecting the fingers can arise from a variety of causes ranging from accidental trauma to nerve conditions. If there is no fracture of the finger or damage to the ulnar nerve, it could be Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy wherein a nerve damage that affects the toes, feet, and sometimes hand that produces pain. On the other hand, Raynaud's phenomenon is a disorder of the small blood vessels of the extremities, causing pain, the sensations of burning and tingling, and color changes.DCIS cells lack the biological capacity to metastasize, or spread elsewhere in the body, like cancer cells do.That is why careful treatment and follow-up is important to avoid the possibility of an invasive breast cancer developing. It would be good to see a doctor for proper evaluation and management.Take care and keep us posted.",
