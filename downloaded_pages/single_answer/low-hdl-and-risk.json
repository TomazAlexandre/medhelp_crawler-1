            "answer": "For patients with coronary artery disease or a coronary artery disease risk equivalent (i.e. diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, etc), the goal LDL should be < 100 (ideally\u00a0\u00a065, triglycerides < 150 and cholesterol\u00a0\u00a065 is counted more as a \"negative risk factor\").\u00a0\u00a0Keeping a healthy diet and being on a statin is the appropriate management for you at this time. I would also ensure you are incorporating a healthy cardiovascular exercise regimen as well.",

    "question": "My HDL has always been low, in mid to upper 30s.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0was 25 last week, so a big percentage drop from 35.\u00a0\u00a0 TC was 125, and LDL at 65, consistent with prior tests.\u00a0\u00a0 Triglycerides popped up from 110 to 150.I had stents put into my RCA 6 months ago so I am taking care to keep lipids low by eating almost 100% plant base diet.\u00a0\u00a0 My concern is that HDL is so low and the risk ratios of TC/HDL and especially TG/HDL has jumped significantly even with LDL low.Are these risk ratios as important when the LDL is low?\u00a0\u00a0 Any advice?I am on pravastatin (10mg)",
