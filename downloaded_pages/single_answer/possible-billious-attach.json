    "question": "My dad explained to me this morning that he was ill.His symptoms were severe light headedness, sensation of motion or spinning (room spinning and people in the room), loss of control, staggering much like being drunk.After laying down, he vomited deep yellowish fluids, since he had not eaten much the previous day, there was nothing for him to actually dispel. He was shaking and perspiring.He noted that he felt a littlen better after being ill, the sentation of motion has subsided.Google brought up a few links in reference to Inner Ear Disease, Diabetes, Hypertension, Meniere's Disease, Possible poor blood circulation, blood flow to the brain.If anyone can assist me with a possible diagnosis or better understanding of what would cause this onset, it would be most appreciated.Thank you",
