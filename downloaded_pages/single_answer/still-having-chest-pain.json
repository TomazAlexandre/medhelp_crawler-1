    "question": "i posted back in october about chest pain. i'm a 33 yr old male, a little over weight but overall decent shape. no family history of diabetes or heart problems. i started having left side chest pain in oct 06, seeing the family doc he put me on steroid pack and anti imflammatory pills. took about 5 weeks of anti-imflamm pills and had multiple ekgs, the chest pain doesn't hurt when breathing. my gallbladder has been removed already.i've been having some anxiety from the chest pain, it comes after dying thoughts enter my mind when my chest is hurting. the pain isn't a bend over hurting type pain, more like a cramping, squeezing aching pain. does shoot down my left arm and hurts around wrist occassionally. i've had all blood tests=normal, many ekgs=normal, a heart sonogram=normal, thallium stress test=normal, 64-slice ct=0 calcium index 64 splash rate? a clinically insignificant myocardial bridge, mri of neck and shoulder=normal, chest ct scan=minor lung scar tissue from pneumonia, bone scan=normal...endoscopy=minor gastritis and h-plaria?, i'm taking protonix for 4\u00a0\u00a0years now, seems to control heartburn great.\u00a0\u00a0i'm at a loss, don't even know what kind of doc to go to next.\u00a0\u00a0is there a muscle problem? shouldn't it be healed already? nerve problem-i've had the needles in my back from the neurologist? i get shaky in the mornings after eating and sometimes at lunch-eat a sweet then i'm fine. have lightheaded spells sometimes, i've attributed them to sinuses or either anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0someone have a clue?",
