            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well yes, irregular periods can be due to ovarian cysts especially since you have abdominal pains. However, it can also be due to ectopic pregnancy, which needs to be ruled out immediately by ultrasound. Hypothyroidism too causes irregular periods, constipation/gas, and hence abdominal pain. It can even be due to hormone imbalance, diabetes or due to adrenal gland problems.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your gynecologist for primary examination.Take care!",
