    "question": "Over the summer my dad had brain surgery to have a craniopharyngioma removed. He developed blood clots, an infection in his arm, diabetes insipidus, and a blood infection post surgery as well as losing about forty pounds during his one month stay in the hospital. Three months after his surgery he all of the sudden was having problems with memory loss and confusion as well as headaches. Scans found that he had a cyst blocking his ventricle (I'm guessing a colloid cyst from my brief research). He has been on a blood thinner due to an allergy to Heparin which caused the blood clots (deep vein thrombosis in his leg and a pulmonary embolism). What can be done for him keeping in mind his previous surgery experience and complications?",
