    "question": "Hi,First off, our 6 year old daughter has Type 1 diabetes.Over the last few weeks she has had short bouts of throwing up. Frequently these have happened in the morning - sometimes before, sometimes after breakfast.She'll say her tummy hurts, throw up hard for 1-2 hours, sleep, then wake up feeling fine and good to go.She's at it again right now, and this is the third time this week. The (very young) doctor we saw last week wondered if it might me anxiety related. We're wondering celiac.We're seeing a dr this afternoon, but any thoughts?Thanks",
