            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forumDiabetes is the most common cause of gastroparesis because high blood sugars can cause damage to the vagus nerve over time.\u00a0\u00a0The vagus nerve controls the stomach muscles.\u00a0\u00a0Damage to the nerve causes the stomach to be slow to empty.\u00a0\u00a0This results in the symptoms you have described.There are things you can do to manage gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0Eating smaller, more frequent meals can help.\u00a0\u00a0Walking or at least sitting up for 2 hours after a meal can help.\u00a0\u00a0Avoiding foods high in fat and fiber can also help.There are medications that can also help such as Reglan.\u00a0\u00a0YOu would have to discuss this with your husbands doctor.It is important to maintain tight blood sugar control which can also lessen the symptoms of gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0This may involve changing your husbands medication and timing of his medication.\u00a0\u00a0Again, this needs to be discussed with his doctor.IV hydration and blood sugar control are the correct steps when gastroparisis causes vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0But as you said, it would be best to try and avoid it getting to that point.Discuss your options with your husbands doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You can always get a second opinion as well if you feel his doctor is not really helpful or proactive.Good luck.Bridget",
