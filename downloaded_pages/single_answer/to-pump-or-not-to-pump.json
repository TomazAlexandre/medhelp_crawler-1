    "question": "My 18 month old daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in November. There is much talk about the pump, but I am unsure if she is too young yet. They say she will wear it as a back pack, but I am unsure how comfortable that would be to sleep on. I also worry she will tear it out at the injection site and cause herself pain and/or infection. I am wondering if anyone else has a toddler with a pump & how they made it work for them.",
