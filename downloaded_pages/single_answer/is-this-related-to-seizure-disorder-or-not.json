            "answer": "HiThanks for the detailed post. The type of seizure depends on the focus in the brain. One possibility is that a new focus has originated in the brain for the seizures. Another possibility is that you could be having TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack). \u201cA transient ischemic attack (TIA, often colloquially referred to as \u201cmini stroke\u201d) is caused by the changes in the blood supply to a particular area of the brain, resulting in brief neurologic dysfunction that persists, by definition, for less than 24 hours; if symptoms persist then it is categorized as a stroke.\u201d So you should rule out high blood pressure, diabetes etc which can cause TIA.However it is difficult to diagnose without examining and a detailed history. You may also need to take some blood tests and CT scans etc to reach a diagnosis. So please consult your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else.Please refer to this link for details on TIA: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_ischemic_attack",

    "question": "I have had a partial complex seizure disorder for 15 years. In 2004 I began having strange sensations in my lower right leg which soon moved up to my hip area. These sensations were like fleeting feelings of warmth followed by the loss of muscle strength. I soon could not keep my balance when one of these attacks occurred. My entire leg would give out on me and I would have no feeling in it whatsoever, and it was dead weight which would not support me. In 2005 these attacks began to worsen and involve my upper body, right arm and hand. If I was trying to speak during an attack, my speech was affected as well. These attacks continue to happen today and are happening once a week now. When I have an attack, my heart rate increases as a result. This happens automatically and is not in response to the attack, it is all part of it. After an attack has occurred, I regain my muscle strength completely, and don't have any residual weakness.I have attempted to change my diet to cut out things like gluten and to reduce refined sugars, but nothing has helped. The regular seizures that I have had for years are still happening as well, but are brief and only affect me on my left side.The neuologists that I have seen want to shrug it off and say it is part of my existing seizure disorder. But how could this be when the symptoms are so different?I have had to quit my job as a massage therapist and have not driven a car since 2005. This has greatly affected my life and continues to do so on a daily basis.If anyone has any ideas as to what this could possibly be or even remotely sounds like, please give me whatever information you have.",
