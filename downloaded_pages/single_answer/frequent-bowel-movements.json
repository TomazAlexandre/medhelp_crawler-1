            "answer": "Please, please, see a gastroenterologist. My husband had always had loose stools, them he developed a stomach flu which was still going strong after 2 weeks. The first few days were the usual flu symptoms (both our son and I had had it prior to him) then he started getting really sick. Lost 10 pounds in ten days and kept going till the friend of a friend recommended his gastro. Turned out to be ulcerative colitis. He has had it for probably 16 years now and is doing very well. He took medication for 1yr., the doc decreased it, took for another yr and now only takes prednisone when he has flareups, which are pretty infrequent. Keep in mind, because of my diabetes we always eat healthy, fresh foods. Low fat - fat and dairy bother him - good amounts of fiber, no tonic, fast food, bags of chips, etc. At the beginning he also had 3 Reiki practitioners work on him, one of whom became a Master and a Polarity Therapist and then continued to work on him regularly for a year. Apparently, it made a big difference. Stress is the major cause of flareups and you need to find a way of alleviating it. When my husband hikes (generally at least 4 hours round trip) he can drink coffee and have some sweet piece of cake, etc. with no repercussions. Exercise is a great stress reliever! Good luck!",

    "question": "Hi, I've been suffering from frequent bowel movements for a while now, about a year or so.\u00a0\u00a0Often times I'll have to go about every 2 to 3 hours, and often wake up in the middle of the night needing to go.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, very little stool is actually produced, and what is produced is rarely clumped together as a cohesive stool.\u00a0\u00a0Also there is often mucus, and pink or red floating bits in my stool.\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally there is blood.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't been able to afford to go to the doctor yet, because I just recently got health insurance through my work, and was just wanting a bit of forewarning about what I may be facing when I do go.",
