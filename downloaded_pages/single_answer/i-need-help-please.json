            "answer": "Wow! Sounds like you have a lot going on.. From what I can understand you have nerve pain from your back, throbbing head aches?, weakness, shaking, nausea and temperature regulation problems. Well, first of all no one can diagnose you but a doctor. AND, there are several tests you would have to take in order to find out what is going on as you may have problems in more than one area.\u00a0\u00a0Please SEE A SPECIALIST CALLED AN ENDOCRINOLOGIST for the symptoms regarding shaking, nausea and temp regulation. TELL THEM OF ALL YOUR SYMPTOMS. They will possibly run blood tests like\u00a0\u00a0a CBC with differential (checks for infection, anemia or other blood cell abnormalities), Thyroid tests (TSH, T3, T4), a metabolic profile (checks kidneys, liver), glucose (check for Diabetes),\u00a0\u00a0Electrolyte panel (checks calcium, sodium, magnesium, phosphate and potassium levels) and lastly they may check your adrenal system (random cortisol), and your sex hormone levels (testosterone, estrogen).For your back nerve pain, headaches and dizziness (if your blood pressure is normal) you need to see a NEUROLOGIST. They may order an MRI of your brain and where you have back pain to see what is going on.Seeing both these doctors will answer many of your questions. But be patient, you have a lot going on and ONLY A DOCTOR CAN DIAGNOSE YOU.It is normal to be irritable with so much going on. Reduce the stressors in your life, eat right, rest and SEE YOUR DOCTOR RIGHT AWAY! You may have something serious going on and must be examined and tested.There is no way anyone can tell you what is wrong via a website like this. Please dont delay! See a doctor immediately or go to your local hospitals emergency dept .",
