            "answer": "Hi,Darker skin is a normal feature in the genital as\u00a0\u00a0well as underarm areas of the bosy. There may be no cause for alarm in that case.Your doctor is right in thinking about Diabetes in your case. IN case the area in the neck is soft and velvety to touch, then an alternate danger would be a sign which indicates cancer in a part of the body. However, this may not have happened in your case.You may get a test done to rule out the presence of diabetes.Hope this helped. Let me know if you may need any more information.Best regards.",
