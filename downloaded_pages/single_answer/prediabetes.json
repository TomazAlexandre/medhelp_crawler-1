    "question": "I am a male 50 years old who successfully quit smoking for almost 7 months now after 30 years. Not slim not chubby, no family diabetes history, very sedentarian and with little or no exercise. I usually have Glaucoma results between 80 and 103 mg/DL (fasting blood) for years. Last week I was rushed to the hospital with a kidney stone. Lots of pain and stress. I have had a big coffee with three sugars like half an hour before the incident. They did a blood test and the result came 133 mg/DL. What do you believe should be the next procedure? I have been told that it might be form the stress. I usually tend to worry much. Thanks a lot",
