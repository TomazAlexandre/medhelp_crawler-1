            "answer": "Hello,Without examination, it is very difficult confirming a diagnosis but it can be due to skin conditions like fungal infections, sweat dermatitis, contact dermatitis or eczema. Systemic diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. Your wife should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. She should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch. Lastly, Phototherapy can also be tried.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how your wife is doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",
