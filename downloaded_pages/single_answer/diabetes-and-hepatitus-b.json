    "question": "I was diagnosed with HBV last summer. I caught it from a member of my family who is also diabetic like me and had been in a liver ward for a minor op. I must have used my family members glucose machine and hence BINGO I got infected. My question is if anyone knows about any problems with clearing HBV and diabetes. I was seeing my specialist yesterday and it seems that I have got to the end of my acute phase (now into the 8month of HBV) but that I still do not have the signs that would indicate chronic. He said it is like my immune system is having trouble wiping out the final bits of the disease and that this could be a result of being diabetic. He has seen such a case once before in a Type 1 diabetic like me who eventually did go on to clear the virus and become immune. Any ideas on this forum about this? I am worried thinking that maybe I am never gonna get rid of this condition and will then end up with 2 chronic conditions to manage? At present I have a low viral load and also have core antibodies and Hepatitus Be Antigen -ve and anti-HBe +ve. Is the diabetic immune system less able to fight viruses than non diabetic one? My first 6 months with this illness were fine as my body all but wiped out the condition without any tablets, but now its seems to have given up.Britgirl477",
