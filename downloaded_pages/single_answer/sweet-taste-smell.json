    "question": "Anyone experience a constant sweet taste/smell or have any idea what could cause it? I'm 6 weeks tomorrow and have been experiencing it for a few days, it makes me so sick!I've read it could be my prenatal vitamins or a symptom of diabetes (did not have diabetes before and I think its too early for gestational diabetes).",
