    "question": "I'm a 54-year-old male who has been on zoloft for several years.\u00a0\u00a0I'm in good physical condition, work out daily, no known cardiovascular disease, diabetes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0My last psa test was normal (6 mos. ago). Two years ago, I tried viagra to see if it would help with the problem of difficulty-achieving-orgasm which I noticed as a side effect of zoloft.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't have any impotence at the time.\u00a0\u00a0The viagra didn't make orgasm happen any easier but it did give me larger, more long-lasting erections so I continued to use it.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last year I have undergone major changes in my life including ending my marriage of 30 years and starting a relationship with a woman ten years younger than me.\u00a0\u00a0I have also gradually and successfully weaned myself off of zoloft.\u00a0\u00a0I had hoped that this would return my libido to its pre-zoloft level of vibrancy (I had been taking it for 15 years) so that I would no longer need to use viagra.\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately on the few times that I have forgone the viagra I have experienced moderate impotence for the first time in my life.\u00a0\u00a0I am able to achieve a half-erection but it is hard to maintain long enough to have an orgasm.\u00a0\u00a0The problem vanishes if I take the viagra.\u00a0\u00a0 When I occasionally masturbate at home, without using viagra, I achieve a rapid erection and orgasm as I've always done since I was 14 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I have become habituated to the viagra (at least when a sex partner is involved) but I also wonder if I've lost some of the sex drive I had as a younger man.\u00a0\u00a0The problem has led to some feelings of inadequacy, a sense of feeling \"prematurely aged.\"\u00a0\u00a0Do you know if this is a common problem?\u00a0\u00a0I really can't see that this could be related to any physical condition.\u00a0\u00a0Should I just forget about it and take the viagra?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance for any useful advice.",
