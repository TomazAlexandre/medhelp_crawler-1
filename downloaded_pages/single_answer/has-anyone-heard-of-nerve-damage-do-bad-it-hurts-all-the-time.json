            "answer": "Hi Des, I\u00b4m sorry about your pain. I have a stabbing (and shooting) nerve pain in arms and legs every now and then. But I was worse two years ago, then I had it nearly all the time. It is very painful and if it would last any longer than the seconds it does, I would be crazy from the pain. It can be because of pinched nerves in the back and also in shoulders and many more places. I sure hope you get better soon.My best,Dagun",
