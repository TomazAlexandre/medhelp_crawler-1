    "question": "My husband was just diagnosed with pre - diabetes. His doctor said he needs to lose 100 lbs. He has a long history of migraines, but had been doing a bit better (down to just one or two a week from about 4 or 5 per week).\u00a0\u00a0Now he has had a migraine and the sweats for 5 days now and barely has been out of bed for 5 days.\u00a0\u00a0He has virtually no appetite, plus with sleeping nearly round the clock, I know this can't be good for his blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0He has missed three days of work already this week.\u00a0\u00a0Can diabetes (or pre-diabetes, even) cause migraines?\u00a0\u00a0And can the blood sugar changes cause all this sweating?\u00a0\u00a0He seems to get really hot really easily, esp. at night, and has had even more sweating streaks the last 5 days with this bad migraine.",
