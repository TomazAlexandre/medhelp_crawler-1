    "question": "I have posted previously about possible CSF leaks coming from my left nostril with head pressure, ear fullness and some other neurological problems over the past 5 mths. But its all mainly been on my left side.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last 3wks I have been having increased muscle twitching and spasms throught both sides of body, with muscle weakness however in the last week I now have right sided ear pulsing- I can hear pulsing or heart beat or something in my right ear, feels likes its coming from my neck up into my ear and into my throat.\u00a0\u00a0My throat tightens up along with the right side of my neck and its just a very heavy pulsing.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it almost feels like my throat is spasm? very very strange.\u00a0\u00a0I get no pain with this and no ringing or other sounds but I do notice it does feel like me ear is full up when it happens.\u00a0\u00a0It was just happening to my right ear but now today its gone to my whole head.\u00a0\u00a0Pusling in my whole head from my neck.\u00a0\u00a0 I can hear it worse when laying down.I have been seing a general physician for ruling out major stuff. Thyroid is clear. Blood works are all normal, lupus, diabetes all clear.\u00a0\u00a0I think my next step is to see an ENT but was curious to know what this pulsing was?THank you",
