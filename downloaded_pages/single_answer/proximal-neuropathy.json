    "question": "My husband has severe proximal neuropathy (diagnosed in July). The treatment for diabetes was the beginning of the neuropathy. It basically affected his right thigh and leg though walking without support (walker) is not possible at this time. He is taking medication and going to PT.My question is this: When walking with the walker, even though feeling strong, a leg will collapse.\u00a0\u00a0He is learning the initial signs and is learnig to compensate but gets very frustrated. What is the sequence to learning to walk again? Why might the legs be collapsing? Is this a part of the healing process? What can we expect and for how long?",
