            "answer": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0You could have had a seizure, transient ischemic attack,\u00a0\u00a0vasovagal attack, a dizziness spell. An immediate neurological examination to check these, MRI brain, and EEG would be required. Certain systemic illnesses like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, need to be checked. Is there any sensory or motor deficit past the incident? Don\u2019t be unattended till these symptoms are diagnosed, since you are at risk of self hurting you. I cannot comment further at this point. Check with your PCP and keep us posted. Take care.",

    "question": "Woke up last night and felt like my body, especially my backside was on fire from head to toe. This lasted for at least 10 minutes and made me nauseous. I went to the bathroom, sat down and then next thing I knew, I was waking up on the floor. I have no idea how long I was unconscious. Crawled back to bed and slept till 11:30 this morning, which NEVER happens. Feeling tired and weak today with no appetite. What happened?",
