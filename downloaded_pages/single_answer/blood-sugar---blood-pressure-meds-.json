            "answer": "Hi,Those are certainly good points to consider when chosing your blood pressure agents.\u00a0\u00a0I think your decision to go with Benicar/Coreg is just fine, as long as the side effect profile fits you as well given that HCTZ and Coreg are very different drugs with different side effects.In addition you shoud know that in the end, as long as there isn't a significant change in glucose levels due\u00a0\u00a0to a BP agent, it is the effect on blood pressure that matters most---does this drug WORK for you or not.Good luck and take care of yourself.",

    "question": "Dr Ramsetty,My physician and I have considered a couple of combination therapy approaches to managing my blood pressure.One has been an Arb plus a diuretic (Benicar HCTZ), the other an ARB plus a beta blocker (Benicar\u00a0\u00a0and Coreg).I understand the current thinking is that HCTZ can increase insulin resistance due to its impact on lowering potassium.\u00a0\u00a0I also understand that the Beta Blocker Coreg actually increases insulin sensitivity?If either of these combinations were equally effective for me in managing my blood pressure, and the decision point was fundamentally that of diabetes risk (I have impaired fasting glucose), would you think the Benicar / Coreg combination seemed the logical decision?",
