            "answer": "Yes, you sound to me like you have it. I have cyst, weight gain, hair loss, and irregular periods. They put me metformin and I was able to loos weight :) and the dizzy spells are gone. we are now trying to get my hair to grow back, I believe it is the same meds as slowing down the facial hair. They need to do a GTT and testasterone test on you. This is my recommendation.Good luck",

    "question": "Ok 4 years ago I went to the doctor because i was 15 and still hadn't started my period not even spotting, they first did a MRI on my brian to see if my pituitary gland was alright, which is was. then a ultra sound, which appeared to be a 5 or 6 centimeter cyst, so they did a MRI on my abdomen, it also appeared to be a cyst. So i had lyprocospic surgery but when they got in they said it was just a large ovary and nothing was wrong with me. I'm on birth control (sronyx) which gives me my period every month. But what im curious about is the nurse at my college said im text book polycystic ovaries, the prepping nurse for a surgery i had in december 07 after reviewing my medical history said im text book polycystic. I have dark patches of skin on the back of my neck, under arms and inner legs, i have type two diabetes (controlled with diet and exercise). I diet and never seem to loose much weight. my skin isn't awful but it isn't great. i get hair growing on my chin longer and darker then peach fuzz, and my upper lip. its very embarrassing and i get it waxed. Does this sound like a Text Book PSOS case? should i make an appointment with my GYNO to look into this again? is there any medication i can take if i am? how likely can i still have children one day with this?",
