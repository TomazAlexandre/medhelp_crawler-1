            "answer": "Dear PhotoGirl54,Thanks for the query.I understand that you are suffering from Systemic lupus erythematosus, Hypothyroidism, Hypertension and Diabetes. You have been on steroids for a long period in the past and also on thyroid and other supportive drugs. Your concern now is related to hair loss.There are several possible causes for the hair loss that you are experiencing. Hair loss in arms, head and pubic area can be a part of the disease process of SLE per se. It can happen any time during the course of the disease.Exogenous steroids can suppress your Pituitary ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone ) causing reduced stimulation of your adrenal gland. Though ACTH is required mainly for the synthesis of Cortisol, it\u00a0\u00a0also has some influence on the synthesis of adrenal androgens that are responsible for hair growth in arms and pubic area.Another rare possibility could be Adrenopause , a phenomenon similar to menopause where your adrenal hormone secretion is reduced as you age. However, I would say that adrenopause is more of a theoretical possibility as this phenomenon has not really been proved.Hope that this information helps and hope that you will get better soon.Thank you for using MedHelp's \"Ask an Expert\" Service, where we feature some of world's renowned medical experts in their fields.
