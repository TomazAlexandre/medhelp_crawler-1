            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Tingling sensation in the hands and fingers has a large differential. It really depends on the location of the sensory changes. If they occur more on the lateral fingers, it may be carpal tunnel syndrome. However, if the sensation occurs on the medial fingers (pinky and half of the ring finger) and medial aspect of palm, it may be a neuropathy from the ulnar nerve. This nerve is also known as your \u201cfunny bone\u201d when tapped or hit. It has several sites of compression along its course \u2013 one site being at the elbow. Classically, it may be a truck driver who rests elbow on window/door. It should also be mentioned that with rapid weight gain or weight loss, the ulnar nerve or median nerve (which causes carpal tunnel syndrome) can be compressed and cause their neuropathies.Neuropathies can be caused by many mechanisms including microtrauma (overuse), hypothyroidism, weight changes, amyloidsosis, and diabetes, to name a few.I recommend that you follow up with your local neurologist. He/she will perform a specific neurological examination focused on the ulnar and median nerves. The neurologist may also elect to perform an EMG/NCS to evaluate the motor and sensory components of the median and ulnar nerves as they travel to the wrist. An MRI of the neck may be necessary to examine the discs in your back more closely to ensure no herniation of the discs and also ensure that there is no dilatation of the central canal of the spinal cord, which can cause cape-like numbness of the arms. An MRI of the cervical spine would also evaluate further if the pain in the feet is connected to the bilateral hands/arms numbness. Other labs, such as vitamins and autoimmune panels, may be ordered based on the history that the neurologist may obtain.Treatment options for the ulnar and median neuropathies (if diagnosed) include surgical release/correction. However, less invasive procedure such as splinting should be tried first, as you have done. Medications are usually directed at the underlying cause and include NSAIDs such as ibuprofen. However, if the neurologist, after examining you and obtaining an adequate history, neuropathic pain may be diagnosed. The treatment for this includes medications such as neurontin and lyrica and elavil (which is an antidepressant but has actually been found to be helpful with neuropathic pain as well).Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "Hi, I am 26 years old woman. For the last 6 weeks or so, I feel strong sensation of pins and needles and numbness in my thumb of left leg mainly on the outer side. Two weeks ago, I started to feel strong sensations of pins and needles in my little finer and ring finger of both hands. Few days after that, I started to feel burning sensations in outer side of the palm and forearm. I went to doctor (just general practitioner) week ago, had blood tested (everything seemed ok, not pregnancy, not diabetes, etc.) and was examined. Doctor said that it can be compressed ulnar nerves on hands and wrong shoes on leg and told me to wait for 6 weeks. But I am worried that this can be something else. It is common to have compressed ulnar nerves on both hands? I work as housekeeper 6 hours per day, little bit of lifting stuffs but nothing too heavy. My mother had rheumatoid arthritis... can this be connected?",
