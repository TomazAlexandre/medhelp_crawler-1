            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Difficulty in swallowing and regurgitation can be due to GERD or gastric reflux. It can also happen if you are tense and eating fast. Hiatal hernia is another possibility. It could also be due to delayed gastric emptying as seen in diabetes and hypothyroidism.I would strongly recommend you to see a gastroenterologist (a specialist who looks after the diseases of our digestive system).Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
