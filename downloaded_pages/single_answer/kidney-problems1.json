            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Do you mean the GFR or creatinine values? According to the National Kidney Foundation, normal results range from 90 - 120 mL/min/1.73 m2. Older people will have lower normal GFR levels, because GFR decreases with age. When the GFR falls below 15, it is defined as kidney failure and then dialysis is the option. Until then managing the hypertension, diabetes, bone problems and anemia form the basis of therapy.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
