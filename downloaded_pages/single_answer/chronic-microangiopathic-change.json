            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without knowing the relevant clinical details or a detailed clinical evaluation, it would be difficult to comment specifically on the situation. If the lesions due to the microangiopathic changes are small, this may not be something to worry about; however if the stroke involves larger/ important areas of the brain, it could be a serious situation. Management in most cases is largely symptomatic and preventive and may involve control or predisposing conditions such as high blood pressure, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes etc. I would suggest discussing the situation, the suggested management plan and the expected prognosis in detail with your treating neurologist.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
