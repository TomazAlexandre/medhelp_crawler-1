            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to boils. Apply warm compresses on the lumps and keep the area clean. Topical antiseptic treatment and topical antibiotics such as mupirocin or neomycin containing ointment is very useful. If still the lumps persist then specific treatment like antibiotics, vit A supplements, corticosteroid injections, isotretinoin, antiandrogens and sometimes excision and drainage ,laser therapy and radiotherapy are found useful. I feel that you should consult a dermatologist and discuss these options with him. Also get your blood sugar levels estimated as recurrent boils are often found in diabetes.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi, so im 18 years old. I used to have flawless skin, not until i was on vacation and caught a typhoid fever and afterwards my health condition went down and so as my skin condition. I started off simply having pimples, and then i started having acne (cheeks were filled with it) and slowly just about a year now, im having these boils (i didnt know they were boils until i went to a dermotologist). He gave me about a week's medication and sulphur mask + 2 ointments. And anibacterial facewash and 2 creams (day and night) which were oil-free moisturising creams.Currently, its been 5 months since i last had the week's medication, and i was still having painful boils coming over and over again. I went to a GP and i requested for a blood test, and the results came that everything was normal. However, i am still curious. I dont want to have a face filled with scars and red spots, or even experience boils again and again. Now even my back has a few boils (1 or 2) at times.I really need help to what i should do.",
