            "answer": "Quite simply, I have no idea what you are describing in the photo unless you can be more specific about what you are seeing.\u00a0\u00a0 Please talk with the ophthalmologist in charge at the clinic you visited and let him or her explain what was seen on the photo.\u00a0\u00a0I believe an optician is someone who makes glasses - so I don't understand how the optician had anything to do with your actual clinical eye exam.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps another country, another way of doing things.\u00a0\u00a0Again, don't jump to conclusions until you have had a qualified ophthalmologist go over your case with you.Michael Kutryb, MD",

    "question": "A year ago i was diagnosed with anemia and problems with blood. I was taken into hospital and recieved a blood transfusion and after every test known possible nothing was found except for B12 deficiency. Last week i went for a routine diabetic eye examination and on the digital camera pictures there was a black mark covering a third of my right eye and my lef eye was normal. The optician seemed shocked by it but said she couldn't diagnose it. i am worried it may be cancer as i have seen a similar photo on the internet of a melanoma in the eye. I this possible and could the confusion of my bloods be related to this problem. I also suffer from heart disease and diabetes, arthritis and asthma. Could any of this also be related. Thanks",
