            "answer": "Hi!Apart from anxiety and panic disorder, increased sensitivity to sound is seen in migraine headaches, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, TMJ disorders, Lyme\u2019s disease, post traumatic stress disorder, and ear damage by toxins and medications. TMJ disorders should be ruled out in your case by either an ENT or a dentist.The hyper-intensities in brain could indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. These can cause an overall decline in brain health and one needs to carefully keep the triggers like high BP or diabetes under control.The chronic tinnitus could also be the cause for your dizziness. This could be due to benign positional hypotension, Meniere\u2019s disease, vestibular neuronitis and labrynthitis.Of these vestibular neuronitis and labrynthitis are treated with medications and physical therapy. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have had migraines for years. The white blinding light, where you can't function for a couple days type of migraines. The neurologist tested my brain fluid for MS but it was negative. MRI's showed increased gray matter. Headaches lessoned for for a couple months, then started back even worse than before. I have ringing in my ears,, ear pressure, forgetfulness, ear pain, head pain, nausea, dizziness, constant headache (sometimes duller than others but always there), and serious pain from noise and light.I had another MRI done and the results say, \"Deep white matter T2 changes primarily bilateral frontal area question related to vascular headache.\" My PCP, thinks that it could be Meniere's disease, based on the symptoms. I had a cat scan which showed nothing. But was treated for an inner ear infection, but nothing helps. Did not feel any better after or during the antibiotics. I just need it to stop. It is horrible. I cannot enjoy life or my grandchildren because I cannot stand the noise of their talking. Please help I am at my witts end.",
