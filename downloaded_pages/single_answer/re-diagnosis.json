During the year following his heart attack he was treated for bronchitis and was taken to the emergency room once and told it was congestive heart failure. During that visit, he was given some sort of breathing treatment(he said it was like oxygen laced with Vick's) in addition to diuretics. This course of treatment really seemed to help. Although he has experienced a mild level of shortness of breath since the heart attack, he has had no problems serious enough to go to the hospital until recently.\u00a0\u00a0He began to experience severe shortness of breath and swelling of his legs and ankles.\u00a0\u00a0There was another trip to the emergency room, another diagnosis of congestive heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0He was given lasix, but no breathing treatment.\u00a0\u00a0His cardiologist sent him for a heart catheterization.\u00a0\u00a0After the procedure, he told us that diabetes has weakened my father's heart, he will have to retire, (he's 57) and even mentioned heart transplantation.\u00a0\u00a0I have a few questions.1. As soon as my father was diagnosed as diabetic, he modified his diet and has managed to keep his glucose count in the normal range using only diet and just began taking medication in the last six months.\u00a0\u00a0Does it make sense that diabetes has damaged his heart if he has managed it with diet (and recently medication) only?\u00a0\u00a0Can other underlying causes be ruled out simply by the heart catheterization?2. Up to the time of the heart attack, my father was a smoker.\u00a0\u00a0Shouldn't the lungs be looked at before blaming diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0From what I've been able to read, pulmonary problems can cause heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0Also, my father's symptoms went away after the emergengy room treatment a few years ago.\u00a0\u00a0This time they did not use it.\u00a0\u00a0He still has symptoms.3. In addition, my father has problems with his legs including cramping and numbness.\u00a0\u00a0He is having problems with sleep apnea.\u00a0\u00a0He also was recently treated with antibiotics for a viral infection.Should these other possible causes be explored before saying definitively what my father's diagnosis is?____: Dear Chellee,1.Unfortunately, the damage from diabetes starts to occur in the 5-10 years or so BEFORE the diabetes is even diagnosed! So modifying the diet after the fact might slow the progression of the disease, however it is surely not a cure.Once a heart cath. is performed, the doctor can say for sure that it is not coronary artery blockages in the large vessels as a cause.\u00a0\u00a0IF the heart muscle looks weak all around(not just in spots or regions) then it is more likely that something like long standing diabetes and or hypertension are the cause, and not\u00a0\u00a0multiple heart attacks.2.The lungs can cause right sided heart failure however they can not in and of themselves cause left sided heart failure which is what your father appears to have.\u00a0\u00a0You are right, the heart and lungs are very much interrelated, and disease of either has long standing effects on the other, however, I really do not think the issue is getting to the cause of the heart failure is as pertinent as your father getting the best care for his current condition. Heart failure is almost never reversible, and the patient should be aggressively treated for the heart failure at an institution that offers transplant and other options.3.The leg numbness sounds as if it is related to the diabetes which can damage the nerves in the legs.I hope this information has been useful, good luck to your father and write back if you have any further questions.Information provided in the heart forum is intended for general medical informational purposes only, actual diagnosis and treatment can only be made by your physician(s).",
