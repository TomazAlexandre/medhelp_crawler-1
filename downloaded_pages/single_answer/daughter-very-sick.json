    "question": "My daughter has been sick for the past 2 years . We can't seem to figure out what it is. Last year we thought she was having appendicits.\u00a0\u00a0She was very sick, stomach pain vomiting at night. Took her to the hospital twice. CAT Scan twice 2 different hospital. First one didn't get a good view . Second they said the appendix was inflamed and had to come out. The surgeon came to the hospital and said he wasn't convinced, he thought that it was some virus.\u00a0\u00a0Now she vomits atleast\u00a0\u00a01-2 times a month , usually at night.\u00a0\u00a0She gets very pale vomits then a few hours later she feels better.\u00a0\u00a0She just had a CT done of her sinus area.\u00a0\u00a0They said she has chronic sinusitis, she also has a chronic cough. She has been on antibiotics 8 times in the past 2 years!\u00a0\u00a0Mother's day weekend last year she was bit by a friends dog and got a very horrible infection and had to be admitted to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0The first course of antibiotics didn't work and it was spreading, they had to try something more agressive. Last week she woke up in the morning looking very ill, warm to the touch and had a 4inch by 4inch welt on her neck near her glands.\u00a0\u00a0It scared me to death.\u00a0\u00a0It went away after a few hours. That was the first time I ever saw that. It looked like a hive.\u00a0\u00a0She drink a lot of juice during the day , and loves to snack, she loves sugar and sugary snacks.\u00a0\u00a0She has to go to the bathroom a lot but sometimes it hurts her to go, we also had a urine test 2 weeks ago but they said it was fine.\u00a0\u00a0She has been very irritable lately and she always looks tired.\u00a0\u00a0I'm afraid she might be diabetic. Could this be, should I take her to the hospital.",
