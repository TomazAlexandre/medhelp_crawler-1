            "answer": "Hi,I\u2019ll suggest an ultrasound of the kidneys, ureter & bladder to rule out the presence of the stones in the urinary tract as that may cause the symptoms you have referred to of increased frequency of urination and decreased volume of urine. The other test I\u2019ll recommend is blood sugar as diabetes also need to be ruled out.I sincerely believe that helps. Please do keep me posted. Kind regards.",
