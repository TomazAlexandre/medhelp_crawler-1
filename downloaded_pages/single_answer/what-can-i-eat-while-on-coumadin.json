            "answer": "I do not take Coumadin, but, my mother's doctor told her that if she ate greens and such, to keep eating the same amount while on coumadin, she said if you only eat it off and on, then they have to keep adjusting the dose, but, if you always eat it, then, they can adjust the dosage accordingly enabling you to continue to eat healthier meals. I hate that drug, I realize some have to be on it, but, it sure does limit what you can and can not eat.I hope I made sense. I would discuss this with your physician and see if you can't continue to eat the good, green leafy veggies and have your strength prescribed accordingly.",
