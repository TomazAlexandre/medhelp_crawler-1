            "answer": "Hi there. The various causes for generalized muscle spasms are strenuous exercise, dehydration, electrolytes depletion, and atherosclerosis of arteries, nocturnal legs cramps and restless leg syndrome, diabetes, anemia, certain diseases of the nervous system like multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. Dystonias are movement disorders where group of muscles forcefully contract causing twisting and repetitive movements or inability to have a normal posture due to spasms. You could manifest torticollis or neck spasm and blepharospasm or uncontrolled blinking of eyes. You will need to check up with a neurologist for evaluation and would need a complete blood count for anemia, electrolytes, glucose, creatinine, thyroid function tests, electromyography, etc. treatment would depend on the diagnosis. Hope this helps. Take care.",
