            "answer": "I can't answer the non-diabetes questions. I do know that unstable thyroid levels will affect diabetes management so you do need to check and make sure your current dose of Synthroid is maintaining your thyroid at a good level.It is the nature of LADA/Type 1.5 to change over time as our pancreas produces less and less insulin and then we need to take more. Are you on a basal/bolus regiment (long acting insulin once or twice a day and short acting for meals.) Is your bolus matched to the carbs you actually consume? This is the most accurate way to manage diabetes with insulin. I suggest you see an endo to have your insulin doses reevaluated.",

    "question": "Was diagnosed with diabetes when I was 32 (almost ten years ago). There is no family history and I have never been overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I admit that I've been stressed out often for prolonged periods of time.\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, I have what is called type 1.5 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I tried the pills, they did not work at all.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking insulin and that seemed to work for a few years however, lately, my A1C has been gradually increasing no matter what I do.\u00a0\u00a0It's now 8.6 at last blood test.\u00a0\u00a0I also have hypothyroidism and take cynthroid.\u00a0\u00a0I also have ovarian cysts and my DHEA always comes back very low 63 was my last reading on that.\u00a0\u00a0My question is: is there a connection between my inability to absorb the insulin, my low DHEA levels and my ovarian cysts?\u00a0\u00a0if I have the cysts removed and start taking DHEA do you think this would allow my body to absorb the insulin? I do exercise regularly. At the very least, please help me know what to ask my doctor to test further for.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Very tired of doing the same thing and getting nowhere.",
