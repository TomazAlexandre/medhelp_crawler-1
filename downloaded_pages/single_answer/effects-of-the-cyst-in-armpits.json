            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If it is a cyst then the only way it can be treated is by surgery and by draining it under expert hands. A lump in armpit can be a swollen lymph node, in response to fungal infection or sweat dermatitis or infection of hair follicles. It can also be an enlarged lymph node due to malignancy of breast. At times it is a cyst too and this can get infected. Lipoma is also a possibility. A CT scan can be confirmatory or a fine needle biopsy. Treatment can vary from wait and watch to anti-inflammatory along with antibiotics to excision of the lump. Check for diabetes too as high sugar often results in repeated infection and boils. A mammography should also be done.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Take care!",
