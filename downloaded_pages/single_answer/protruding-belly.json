    "question": "If anyone could help or give advice I would sincerely appreciate it. I have a protuding stomach that makes me look at least 5-7 months pregnant and it's just awful. I have tried sit-ups, crunches, walking and even riding a bike, but the stomach is still there. I was diagnosed with have type 2 diabetes and really have to watch what I eat. My question to anyone out there is exactly what type of doctor deals with these type of situation. I have seen a gastroenterologist and they put a tube down my throat just to find nothing, gyn still saying exercise for which I have and now I'm at a dead end. Please Advise.",
