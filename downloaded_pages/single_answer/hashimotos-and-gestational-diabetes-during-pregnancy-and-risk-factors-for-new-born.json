            "answer": "Its sounds like you have taken good care of yourself and have had excellent monitoring in regards to both the Hashimoto's disease and the gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Under these circumstances, the risk to your newborn baby will be minimal.In most states, all newborn infants have a blood test to screen for thyroid problems (among other possible metabolic problems).\u00a0\u00a0The state newborn screen should detect whether your baby has abnormal TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the pediatrician will be monitoring your baby for any clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, including irritability, rapid heart rate, breathing problems, stooling issues, or feeding problems.\u00a0\u00a0If there are clinical signs of thyroid problems, the pediatrician will most likely check thyroid function tests immediately, and may need to give medications to normalize the thyroid hormone levels.In terms of the gestational diabetes, there is a chance that your baby may have low blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0It is likely that your baby's blood sugar will be checked, perhaps several times, to make sure that it is in the normal range for a newborn.\u00a0\u00a0This shouldn't prevent your baby from staying with you as long as he/she is otherwise doing well.\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally, the lungs of a baby born to a mother with gestational diabetes mature less rapidly than expected.\u00a0\u00a0The pediatrician will also be watching for any breathing problems after your baby is born.Overall, given the good control of your endocrine issues, I expect your baby to do well.",

    "question": "Dear Dr.I am G2 P3 currently 37 weeks - scheduled for a c-section 11 Feb 2009.\u00a0\u00a0I had Hashimoto's disease prior to this pregnancy and TSH levels has been regulated during pregancy - currently 0.5.\u00a0\u00a0At 28 weeks was diagnosed with Gestational diabetes - fasting glucose stayed between 6.0 - 6.6 mmol/l. Insulin was started - Novomix - 10 units in the morning and 12 at night.\u00a0\u00a0Glucose levels well regulated.My question relates to the baby - I would like to know what kind of complications can arise - I am aware of some and also aware that both my endocrine problems are well regulated.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to be prepared for any complications that might arise during the C-section and also prepare myself that the baby might not stay with me after the birth but be monitored in NICU.\u00a0\u00a0What is the normal practice and treatment for a birth scenario like this.Should i prepare myself for not being with my child for at least 24 hours - due to the fact that i have a c-section and cannot get up to go see him?\u00a0\u00a0How long will normal hospital stay be in this circumstances?Kind regards Elzette Willmore",
