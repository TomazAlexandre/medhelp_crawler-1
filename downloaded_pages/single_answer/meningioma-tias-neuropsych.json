            "answer": "Hi,The presence of lacunar infarcts in the brain, high BP, cholesterol and diabetes are risk factors for small vessel ischemic disease resulting in stroke. So this possibility needs to be explored further.As far as neuropsychological testing is concerned the tests conducted are for assessing learning and memory, sensorimotor functioning, visuospatial functioning and language and communication skills.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "I have had prior lacunar infarcs, and have a parasaggital falcine meningioma which is gamma knife treatable; after 10/08 episodes of blackouts with falls, what felt like TIAs (40-60 minutes in duration) -- saw neurosurgeon who referred me to neurologist, who ordered sleep study, sleep deprieved EEG, and neuropsych testing.\u00a0\u00a0I have definite memory issues, definite spatial issues, feeling blank spots, and falls where I don't make attempt to catch myself. I know there can be neuro and psych interactions, but my BP has been up and down, can't get it stable; cholesterol is higher than cardiologist & neurologist want, have type ii diabetes, and am very fatigue. Kind of have sunrise, and then nap, then good for a while, then sort of sunset.Question is, would like to go ahead with gamma knife and be done with meningioma, which has been stable on WAW.\u00a0\u00a0Am not convinced this is not related to small vessel ischemic disease which I also have.I have took 2 hours to type this on Word first -- what does neuropsych\u00a0\u00a0offer?",
