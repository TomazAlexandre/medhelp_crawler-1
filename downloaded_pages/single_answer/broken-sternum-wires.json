    "question": "I am a 54 yr. old woman,and I had a triple bypass almost 4 yrs. ago.I have had pain ever since for the past 4 yrs.,and had xrays that showed 2 broken wires.I have been to Cleveland Clinic several times and was going to have the wires removed,but for some reason or another they could not do the surgery.The doctors said they didn't think that's what was causing my pain.I have been in severe pain for the past month (more than usual)and am going to make an appointment with my cardiologist concerning this.I felt like C.C. didn't want to do the surgery because of me being high risk(diabetes,obesity,yeast infection caused by uncontrolled diabetes)plus they said they didn't think that was causing my pain.I can't handle this pain much longer.I don't know what to do.I go to a Pain Management Dr.,and am on 4 pain pills a day , but am still in a lot of pain.I am so afraid to have another operation because of infections and being high risk,was going to leave wires alone if possible,but pain keeps getting worse.What should I do,is there anyone else that is still in pain after 4 yrs. since bypass?This discussion is related to/posts/show/871093.",
