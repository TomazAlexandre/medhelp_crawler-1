            "answer": "Hi,How are you? As mentioned in the other post, diagnosis of ALS depends on a variety of factors including the symptoms and signs present, medical history, results of the neurologic examination and and diagnostic tests such as electromyography (EMG) or nerve conduction velocity (NCV). Although no one test can provide a definitive diagnosis of ALS, the presence of upper and lower motor neuron signs in a single limb is strongly suggestive. It is best that you have this checked by your doctor or be referred to a neurologist for proper diagnosis. Take care and best regards.",
