            "answer": "I was diagnosed with diabetes at 27 weeks. Since then I've had 2 tests for pre eclampsia. I am now 34 weeks. I get worried every time there's protein in my urine. Hopefully you don't have it. The doc told me the protein could be there because of the diabetes. Just try not to worry it's not good for you. Are they doing a 24 hour urine test?",
