    "question": "I have posted on a few forums over the past few years.\u00a0\u00a0I have been sick for 3 yrs, quality of life has gone from a 10 to a 1.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuro endocrine tumor 1.5 yrs ago, it was removed.\u00a0\u00a0I got better for 4 months and then got worse again to the point of the beginning.Throughout my ANA has been high, going from 640, to320, back up to 640 during a flare of symptoms, and now during another flare it is up to 1280.\u00a0\u00a0The pattern is diffused.All my other panels, Lupus, RA and Sjorgen's have been fine.\u00a0\u00a0Rheumy told me it was a phenomenon, not to worry.I can see that if I wasn't sick.\u00a0\u00a0But I am sick, and it is high.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to spike when my symptoms spike...Any thoughts?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you",
