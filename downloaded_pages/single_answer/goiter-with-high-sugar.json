    "question": "HelloA few years ago my dad was diagnosed with having a goiter. Nothing further was done.... no test.. nothing..I have been trying to get him to see an endocrinologist for about a year. Just sat he went to our GP and they told him his sugar was 250 and today it reached 300. My dad is overweight (just in the belly) and is 61 years old but I am concerned that this high sugar count comes out of now where and now he is a diabetic? Still no one seems to be looking at the goiter? Should I continue to get him to see a specialist.concerned for my dad",
