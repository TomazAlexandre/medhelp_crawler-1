    "question": "I'm 40 yrs. old, have had diabetes for 20+ yrs. and was diagnosed with proliferative diabetic retinopathy on my left eye and non-proliferative DR on my right. My doctor recommended immediate laser surgery (pan retinal photocoagulation)on my left eye but unfortunately,we could not proceed because I could not tolerate the strong light and could not keep my eyes open.\u00a0\u00a0He suggested to observe and get a check-up every 1 to 3 months and when he sees that the disease has progressed to a certain point, he will then do a vitrectomy. My questions are:1) Should I try to get the laser surgery done under sedation/general anesthesia instead of doing the observation/vitrectomy option?2)Assuming that I can do laser surgery under sedation, should I do it only on my left eye or also on my right (which is only non-proliferative DR)?Thanks,Chit",
