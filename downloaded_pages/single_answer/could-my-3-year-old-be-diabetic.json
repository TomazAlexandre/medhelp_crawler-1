            "answer": "Lack of urine usually means he's dehydrated, which would also explain the shakiness.\u00a0\u00a0With diabetes there is an increase in urine as the body tries to rid itself of the sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Shakiness normally comes with low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I would get him checked out, because something is obviously wrong, and it may be serious. This is confusing, I wouldn't take any chances.\u00a0\u00a0Has he been sick to where he was vomiting and/or diarrhea?\u00a0\u00a0If so he may have become dehydrated and has not gotten rehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0He need things like Pedialyte, bananas, orange juice.\u00a0\u00a0But if it's sever he need IV rehydration. It can be difficult to recover from dehydration, and this is why IV is the best way to go.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck with this and take care.",
