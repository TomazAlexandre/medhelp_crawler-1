            "answer": "Thyroid panel, for the win! In all seriousness, if you've never had thyroid levels checked, you should have this done--TSH, free T4, and free T3. If these come back abnormal or slightly high/low normal, you might want to consider having thyroid antibodies checked. You mention hypothyroidism...does this mean you had elevated TSH? How are you being treated for this? How were you diagnosed with Type II (borderline) diabetes, and what is your current treatment for this, also?The pupil size being different between your two eyes isn't necessarily the result of a thyroid problem...it's typically a result of one eye being weaker than the other, which is normal, from what I understand. Do you wear glasses/contacts to correct your vision? If not, you should consider having an optometrist do an eye exam. I've also heard that this can be a symptom of neurological problems, though I can't elaborate on this. Additionally, it could have something to do with a pituitary tumor (worry not--these are overwhelmingly benign and more common than you might think) exerting pressure on your optic nerve. This is a problem that would need to be corrected sooner rather than later, should it be the case.Your other symptoms are very general, and can be attributed to a lot of other health problems, which is why a thyroid panel is necessary to rule out the thyroid as the culprit.Bottom line: you know how you feel and you know if you're not feeling good, so don't give up on figuring out what's going on. It sounds like you're on the right track, but you haven't hit the nail on the head yet (i.e. thyroid problems and diabetes could be symptoms of the actual problem). It takes a lot of time, but I hope you get there soon and start to feel better and lead a \"normal\" life! :)",
