            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Recurrent urinary tract infections can occur due to improper hygeine, sexually transmitted infections, decreased immunity, diabetes, kidney stones etc.Using of diaphragm for birth control can also lead to urinary tract infections. Sexually transmitted diseases like chlamydia may show negative results on examination, but this does not rule out the infection. Examination of the partner is also necessary in certain conditions.As you mentioned that there is thrush at times, then there are more chances of a fungal infection to be present. Also due to some structural changes in the urinary tract there is a chance of recurrent urinary tract infections.Get an urine examination, culture and sensitivity and ultrasound abdomen done.Consult your urologist for further assistance.Take care.",

    "question": "I have had recurrent cystitis/UTIs over a period of 8 years. The infections tend to coincide with an episode of thrush (although not always) and only leave with antibiotics. If I don't take antibiotics the symptoms are unbearable to the point where I cannot think straight and end up sitting for hours on end in a bath or on the loo and sometimes it gets so bad that I'm weeing blood stained urine. Sometimes I go for months at a time where I feel like there is just something \"Brewing\" or as my husband calls it \"bubbling under\" where I don't feel I can get antibiotics as I feel I end up taking them too much when the infections are bad. When I take samples in for testing the G.P generally finds blood or cells but when a sample goes to the lab it is almost always negative. What is going on? Before I got pregnant with my first son (over 2 years ago) I was referred to a good urologist in the hospital where I work and he prescribed a low does of nitrofurantoin for a period, I then got pregnant and was fearful of infections during the pregnancy but thankfully got none and none after my baby was born either but they have recently started rearing their ugly head again with again negative samples. It does make you feel like you're going mental but when the symptoms are as real as they are (again weeing blood) what are you supposed to think? Has anybody else with the same issue had any answers?",
