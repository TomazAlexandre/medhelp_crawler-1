            "answer": "It depends on the adoption program you are with. Some only cover the actual birthing bills while others cover everything including maternity wear. If the $4,500 is medication specifically for the pregnancy then it is completly reasonable for the adopting parents to pay. If it is for something else (like diabetes or adhd meds) then it may be best if you split it or just talk to them. I would check with your agency.",
