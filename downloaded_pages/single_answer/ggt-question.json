            "answer": "Hi,Measuring the GGT provides a very sensitive indicator of the presence or absence of hepatobiliary disease. Raised GGT levels have been reported in a variety of clinical conditions including pancreatic disease, renal failure, diabetes, obesity, medication side effect and alcoholism. It is best that you discuss the results with your doctor for proper evaluation. A repeat test may be done to monitor the levels. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hi,I recently had blood testing done through my employer and my GGT level came back at 67 (0-65 normal for men). Everything else was in the normal ranges (ALP 67, AST 25, ALT 19).\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned with the GGT result and should I have a follow up test done?\u00a0\u00a0I don't generally exceed 12-14 drinks/week.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, I am a coffee drinker as well as having 1-2 diet sodas a day, and just take the regular vitamins (C, B12, E).\u00a0\u00a0I have used Ginseng periodically.\u00a0\u00a0The week before the test I think I had 4-5 drinks 5 days prior and 2 drinks 3 days prior.Does the GGT measurement change frequently and is it more weighted on recent drinking (last 2 weeks) or the average of the last month?\u00a0\u00a0Is there any reason to re-test or be concerned?Thanks.",
