            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.This throbbing or twitching feeling could be because of stress or fatigue. Cold fingertips can occur due diabetes, peripheral neuropathy like B12 deficiency and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) like reynauds disease. PAD is usually seen in people who have a long standing history of smoking.I would suggest you to discuss these possibilities with your PCP and do keep us posted!",
