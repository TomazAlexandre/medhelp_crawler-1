    "question": "My wife has been having bad yeast infections for the last 3 weeks. She has always been prone to them. About 2 weeks ago the following morning after having sex i noticed the skin on my penis was dry and flaky. Later in the day there was one area that even started to bleed (very, very slightly) around one of the dry areas. Within 2 days i was back to normal. Now a week later it has come back in exactly the same form as previously stated. Could this be directly related to having unprotected sex with my wife while she has been suffering from effects of a yeast infection? Could it be possible that my penis skin is reacting to something that her yeast infection is creating? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.",
