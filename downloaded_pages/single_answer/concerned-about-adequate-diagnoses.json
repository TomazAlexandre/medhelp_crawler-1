    "question": "I have hypothyroidism and have been on replacement medication for over 30 years.\u00a0\u00a0Approximately 5 years ago, I began having difficulties with the medication not working.\u00a0\u00a0My medication was changed; which did not help.\u00a0\u00a0I changed doctors, but his idea of regulating my thyroid was to put me on 3mg of estrogen replacement daily.\u00a0\u00a0This created a large weight gain and did nothing to regulate my thyroid problem.\u00a0\u00a0Subsequently I went to an endocrinologist who got things corrected. However, the last year I have been having new problem culminating with tingling in my hips, down the inside of my legs, becoming numbness in my feet. I also have weakness in my hips and thighs, keeping me from going on walks. I don't have diabetes, Lupis or MS. I am anemic and have an enlarged uterus with fibrois cysts.\u00a0\u00a0A stress test, upper endoscopy, three MRIs, an untrasound a CT and numerous blood tests later, no one seems to know what is wrong.\u00a0\u00a0As I have Hashimoto's disease, wouldn't that be a good place to start?\u00a0\u00a0What are your suggestions?Thank you, Arli",
