If you hear your tummy growl, that's your body burning off excess fat, a good thing. Don't worry, fasting is good and nothing will happen to you, nada, zero.\"I am supposed to take the pills twiceTwice-a-day a day and then take another one in the morning.\"You kept the type of pill a secret so I can't help you. Your doctor will tell you when and how to take your medication. Directions are printed on the bottle label.I have no idea what you're talking about blood issues. Again you kept that a secret.",

    "question": "Hello,I just found out that I have full blown diabetes. I also have another problem with my blood and my doctor is holding off putting me on the needle. I also haven't really dealt with it because the blood disease took priority. I had a pint of blood removed yesterday. Because of the blood issue, I don't know what my symptoms would be with the diabetes (I had symptoms with the blood issue.) I am not real faithful taking the pills at a set time and I never eat in the morning. Can anyone tell me how they feel if they do not eat for 8 hrs or so? I am supposed to take the pills twice a day and then take another one in the morning. I will be seeing my doc next week. I am sorry if I confused anyone...but this is so new to me and I'm really not explaining myself too well.Thanks so much.",
