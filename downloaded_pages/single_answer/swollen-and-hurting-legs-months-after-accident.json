            "answer": "Hi!If she has hit her knee then the foot on that side is likely to swell due to the knee injury. However, if both ankles and knees are involved and she has high ANA then she must consult a rheumatologist. Generally a high ANA titre indicates an autoimmune disease (SLE, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, scleroderma, polymyositis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, dermatomyositis, primary biliary cirrhosis, Addison disease, Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus). Mixed connective tissue disorders also cause a high ANA. What is important is the pattern of ANA staining: homogenous, speckled, or nucleolar. Depending on the pattern of ANA staining, other antibody tests will have to be done. Take care!",

    "question": "My girlfriend was in an accident last February 2012. Hit black ice while avoiding another car. She went into a ditch and rolled the truck hitting her knees on the dash and her back was hit by a 40lbs tool box i think.Xrays showed no injuries but months later she has swollen legs that hurt. She's trying to work at her first job as a nurse but she tells me her legs swell and hurt. Just the other day her knee gave out..She's 23 good health but has a heart condition where her heart might beat slower for a short time. Her Natural Antiboddies are also very high due to the house she's living in all her family have high N.A. countsI suspect helping her get into better shape might help.I don't know what to say as i'm a computer nerd and have no medical background",
