I only weigh 107.2ibs and the doctor said I will have to start taking a sugar pill until I'm about 8 months then I am going to have to start giving myself the shot. I am only 26 weeks and so little but the doctor said I may have around a 9ib baby. Also when I was there Tuesday they said it look like he was already growing out of room. Could this jepordize my son in anyway?",
