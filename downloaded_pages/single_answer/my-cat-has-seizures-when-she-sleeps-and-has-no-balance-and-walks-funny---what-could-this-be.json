            "answer": "Be sure your vet checks your cats ears as middle and inner ear infections are classic for balance loss. Get a complete blood and urine profile. The blood and urine profiles help to rule out other causes of seizures including kidney problems and feline diabetes and be sure your cat is also blood tested negative for Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), Feline Leukemia and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV).Dr Carol Osborne, DVM",

    "question": "Hi,I got a stray cat this year and she is about one according to my vet. What first drew my attention to her was that it was a horrible raining dark night when I found her and she was walking alone in the rain and suddenly fell over and lost her balance which is quite unusual for a cat. I took her home. She was very skinny, and when I took her to the vet to be desexed and vaccinated, she was also a couple of weeks pregnant.As I observed her over the coming days and weeks, I found that she has seizures when ever she falls asleep. They last for several minutes and her whole body convulses and her eyes roll back into her head. Sometimes I can snap her out of it, other times I can't and I just have to wait til she finishes. She is completely normal once she wakes up, not drowsy at all.In general, she is very off balance. She walks as if her hips are out, but this has been ruled out by X-Ray, as has her back, legs or pelvis.She trips and stumbles easily, and if you accicentally brush her as you walk past her that is enough to knock her off balance.When she jumps, she seems to kick her legs up high in the air before she lands, and when she jumps down again, she lands off balance.She isn't in any pain at all, she still runs and plays and jumps and does everything my other cats do, she just has this funny walk and balance issues. Sometimes when she's walking she suddenly shakes her head and loses her balance.She never has seizures when awake, only when she's asleep.She is always thirsty and drink way more that all my other animals put together but my vet says she is too young to have diabetes.My vet doesn't think it is epilepsy either, because apparently cats with epilepsy are normal in between seizures, where as Missy isn't as she has the balance and walking issues.Can anyone help my beautiful litle cat??Thank you in advance.",
