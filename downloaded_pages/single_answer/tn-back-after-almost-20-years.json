    "question": "I had very successful MD almost 29 years ago. I had a brilliant rock-star neurosurgeon and I was pain free. In the intervening years, I only had twinges of pain that went along with severe sinus infections. But that all ended this past spring. I had twinges that lasted and intensified. They got longer and longer with fewer pain free moments. Now the pain is constant with variations in intensity. My start point is in my ear, with pain in my teeth, across my cheekbone, under my lower jaw, and extending down my neck and into my shoulder. I had my surgery at age 33 and never thought that the pain could come back. I am depressed and upset. Medications don't work very well. I am on Tegretol, Neurontin, and percocet, with zoloft to help combat the depression. In addition, I have fibromyalgia, diabetes, and high blood pressure. I am due to see my neurosurgeon next week, I hope he has an answer. Is it usual to have this tn to come back? Can a Microvascular nerve decompression go bad?",
