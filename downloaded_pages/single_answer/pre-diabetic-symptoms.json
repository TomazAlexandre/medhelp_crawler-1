    "question": "I have made the journey from diabetes 2 diagnosis (1992 )with daily insulin\u00a0\u00a0to a situation that in 2006 I no longer need to do that. No insulin injections or medication. HbA1c runs at 6.0 to 6.3. My understanding is that in the prediabetic condition insulin resistance increases and one of the possible contributers to that is a low alpha lipoic level. Some research suggests that taking alpha lipoic acid would help in lowering sugar levels and improved utilization of insulin produced by the pancreas. Has anyone had any experience of this?In parallel with this I continue with my vegetable/fruit\u00a0\u00a0healthy eating program with further weight loss and getting my BMI below 25 currently 25.2 down from 28 plus.",
