            "answer": "Did someone suggest that the gallbladder problem was responsible for the constipation? It is not unusual for stools to loosen somewhat following cholecystectomy but constipation is not a symptom one would typically connect to the gallbladder. It sounds like you have the same chronic constipation that you had prior to the surgery. Your bowels were moving better after the misery secondary to the bacterial overgroth related to te antibiotics given for your abscess most likely.",

    "question": "I had gall bladder surgery laproscopically in late January 2012.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to the surgery, I suffered with constipation, pain, bloating when eating.\u00a0\u00a0The painful constipation and bloating, as well as nausea and vomiting continued afterward.\u00a0\u00a0Post surgery, I had a serious setback, an infection abscess at in the abdomen that had to be drained over more than a week and nearly 2 liters of fluid in the right lung that also had to be drained.I spent 2 weeks (6 weeks post surgery) in the hospital recovering from infection.\u00a0\u00a0During the time in hospital, I had regular bowel movements without pain.\u00a0\u00a0I get home, the painful constipation resumed, but no more nausea and vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0I followed the diet I had in the hospital, but continued with the same painful constipation.\u00a0\u00a0The only change was that while in hospital, I was given insulin instead of my regular diabetes meds (all oral meds).\u00a0\u00a0I did my own research and spoke with my doctor to change meds.\u00a0\u00a0After 3 med changes, the problem persisted so it was decided to discontinue one of the meds and wait and see if conditions improved.The pain and lethargy subsided, but the constipation continues.\u00a0\u00a0I am at a loss to know what else to do.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried OTC and prescription meds to help with regularity and nothing is consistently improving the constipation and pain associated with it.What am I doing wrong?",
