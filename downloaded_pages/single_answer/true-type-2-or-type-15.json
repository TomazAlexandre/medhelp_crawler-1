    "question": "I was diagnosed June 5, 2007.\u00a0\u00a0My eyes were always very good until 2003 i started needing glasses and forever they pretty much stayed as bad as they have been til i was diagnosed. My doc sent me to get my eyes checked when i was diagnosed, doc told me no blood vessels popped but needed major correction.\u00a0\u00a0I never got glasses so now more then a year later my eyes are really bad, seems every month for sure they are getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0I use to have trouble reading far, like a billboard with small letters.\u00a0\u00a0But now even seeing 3 feet in front of me looking at the calendar across my desk is where squinting wont even let me read it.My sugar has been out of control for past 2-3 months because i just havent had a chance to get to the doc.. last time i went my A1c was 7.5 from 8.1\u00a0\u00a0so it went down but i know its gone back up because during the last month i've gotten 300-400's and thats with taking 1000mg of metformin twice daily,\u00a0\u00a045mg actos once daily and taking 12units of Lantus in the Morning and 8 at night.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor gave me humalog for fast acting but its not in the pen form like Lantus, and i dont have access to a fridge everytime im gonna eat. so i never do it.\u00a0\u00a0I wanna ask him for the Humalog pen i've even printed out a free trial coupon to go with the prescription.\u00a0\u00a0But im scared to go because i know he'll be upset i didnt go sooner.\u00a0\u00a0SO i got 2 questions.#1: Do you think i could have Type 1 instead of Type 2 cause how could i progress so fast in not even 2 years yet, going from great control with just the metformin to poor control with so much, i've heard type 2s go to insulin but over 20 years not 2.\u00a0\u00a0And im only 22 and weigh 176, i've lost 20 pounds since diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0So shouldnt i be needing less insulin not more if im a true type 2?#2:\u00a0\u00a0Could my eyes go this bad this fast from my sugar, am i looking at blindness at a young age?Sorry for rambling..",
