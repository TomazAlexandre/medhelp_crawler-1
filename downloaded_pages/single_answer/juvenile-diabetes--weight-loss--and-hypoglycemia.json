            "answer": "If you are having to treat frequent lows, yes, it could eventually lead to weight gain. Glucose tabs are, imho, the best way to treat lows as it adds minimal calories (and also you aren't tempted to overtreat like when you use a tasty sweet!). If you are having frequent lows you might want to talk to your doctor and see if you can make a change in your medication doses to minimize them. If it is occasional I wouldn't worry about it. For myself I don't bother treating lows unless they are under 60, doctor's tend to differ on this. Certainly if you are in the 60s and it's time for a meal I would just go ahead and bolus and eat, just maybe reduce your insulin a tad and/or inject and then eat right away being sure to get some carbs in.",

    "question": "Hey everyone,I've never been on here before, but I was wondering if someone could help me with my juvenile diabetes and desire to lose weight. I have absolutely no problem dieting etc., but wonder if any of you have found it a challenge to lose weight with low blood sugar levels? My sugar just went down into the sixties and of course I had to have some glucose tablets. Will this contribute to weight gain? I'm sixteen years old, turning seventeen next month.LadyinOlive",
