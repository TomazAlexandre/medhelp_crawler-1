            "answer": "Hello,It could be due to cold weather and dry skin or parasthesia should be ruled out. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, nerve irritation, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Use moisturizers after bathing and humidifiers in your home. Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then get it evaluated from a doctor.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
