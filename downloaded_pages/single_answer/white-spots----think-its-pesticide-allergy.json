            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor with your parents to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.Fungal infections of the human body are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "I saw a forum about white spots. I was looking for some info on them and then I remembered my mother said a long time ago that she got them and her derm told her it was from unwashed lemons in her drinks and iced tea. She eliminated these, bought organic lemons, and they went away. This month I got saddled with a bag of cheap apples. I noticed I broke out something awful on my upper lip in white spots so thick you could barely see the pink part. Then -- ding! Oh, the apples! I bit into one to see where my lips touched it and, sure enough, the upper touches and the lower doesn't. This probably stimulates the glands because my face breaks out in acne from chemicals, too. I had terrible acne for years and then somebody convinced me to wash in gentle, \"natural\" stuff and now it's like I never had it. So I think some people are sensitive to these things and not others and whatever problems they get diagnosed with might be linked back to something as stupid as an apple!This discussion is related to/posts/show/241141.",
