            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.There are two types of sensory neuropathies in the body \u2013 large and small fibers. (I won\u2019t talk about large fiber neuropathy now, but with these there may be weakness). With small fiber neuropathies, symptoms including burning or buzzing or other vague symptoms starting in the feet and hands then in some cases spreading to other parts of the body. The EMG/nerve conduction studies (NCS) (tests done to check for neuropathy) will not show an abnormality, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a skin biopsy so that the number of nerve endings can literally be counted. There are other tests of the function of small nerves that can be ordered, such as QSART testing which looks at how much sweat the skin makes, since sweating is in a sense of function of these small nerves. There are several causes of small fiber neuropathy, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and autoimmune problems.Treatment for neuropathic pain (pain coming from nerves) includes gabapentin and pregabalin, and medications such as elavil (which is an antidepressant but has also been found to be helpful with neuropathic pain).I recommend that you be seen by a neurologist. He/she may order laboratory tests to evaluate for various etiologies and may order an EMG/NCS to determine if a larger fiber is involved.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
