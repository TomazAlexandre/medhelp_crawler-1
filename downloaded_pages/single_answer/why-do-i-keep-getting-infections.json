    "question": "I've been on antibiotics three times in the last five months. Once for severe sinusitis, once for an infected lump in my armpit, and now for a staph infection on the back of my neck that's spread (painfully) to the mastoid region behind my right ear.I've been checked for diabetes (my A1C came back at 5.8), and my liver enzymes were high enough that the ER doc suggested a liver function test once the infection clears up.I'm 60 pounds overweight, had a severe case of mono two years ago, and when my dad died last year the medical examiner said he had cirrhosis of the liver despite never smoking or drinking a day in his life (we're still waiting for the results of genetic testing).I suppose all my health issues could be traced back to my weight, but I know plenty of people bigger than me who aren't fighting a constant battle against chronic infection. The doctors I've seen just shrug it off and suggest I adopt a healthier lifestyle (and I've made great strides in that area), but it's hard to get healthy when your body is constantly under attack.I'm not even sure what my exact question is. I guess I'm just scared the doctors are missing something important, and worn out from this constant battle to just *function.*",
