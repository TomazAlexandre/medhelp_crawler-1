            "answer": "COuld be a problem, maybe partly a reaction or because she is just not used to what is in the pills. I would ask her doctor and probably take her off them. Diabetes is a funny thing, I have felt different reactions that might not be normal to a person who doesnt have diabetes so cant answer about centrum on that but I heard centrum can cause elderly to experience other things, like gas and cant remember what else, I dont know if I trust the pills as much as other brands but is only my opinion.",
