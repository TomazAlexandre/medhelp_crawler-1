            "answer": "I have had a hormonal imbalance ever scence i started af at the age of ten . I had six\u00a0\u00a0kids and before i got pregnant with my seventh\u00a0\u00a0that ended in miscarriage\u00a0\u00a0I got the dignosis of pcos . I was put on metformin a diabetic med to help me regulate I think it works because I did start to ovulate and did concieve\u00a0\u00a0. I have had a period a year straight and no period for a year . I also have had a period every ten days . I think i have another hormonal imbalance because It has been 7 weeks scence i miscarried and besides a few days of spotting i have had no af . I took bcp in october of last year for three weeks they made me super sick so i stopped and i dont think it helps one bit for regulating a period . I think pcos is a syndrome\u00a0\u00a0meaning sometimes it rears its ugly head and makes problems and other times it is hard to even notice\u00a0\u00a0u have it . my re said it is heriditary and u never get rid of it but it can be controlled\u00a0\u00a0so basicly ive always had it but it showed its ugly face again . Id ask about metformin and try to do a diabetic diet\u00a0\u00a0I dont have diabetes and i do the diet because it helps me lose weight and ovulate =)\u00a0\u00a0so yes i think you should get checked to see but it does take the adverage couple with no problems 1 year to concieve\u00a0\u00a0best of luck to you ssbd\u00a0\u00a0Loretta",

    "question": "5 years ago I had a hormonal imbalance and had mensus for 4 months straight (heavy!). I went to the doctors and had test after test done. The solution was to take BCP. They gave me a d&c and tested for PCOS. For all you ladies that struggle with this is it possible to develop this after testing negative or is it something you either have or don't.I don't really know much about pcos besides what it basically is and all i read about it on this site. I am just curious if it's something i should get checked for again should I struggle conceiving this year.Thanks In Advance,Ash",
