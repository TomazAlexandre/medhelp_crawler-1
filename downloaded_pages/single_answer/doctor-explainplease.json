    "question": "My dad is 58 years old. He was just recently diagnosed with stage 3 CHF, he was a longterm smoker, battled weight issues off and on, high blood pressure, as well as diabetic which he normally controlled by diet when he felt like it. Just today, he had a heart cath done, and the cardiologist said that he is at 30% heart function, his main arteries fused together so they couldn't get through them, and he has significant heart damage which is unrepairable. He is already on meds, as well as wearing a vest defibrillator. They said his only chance is a heart transplant, but with his age and diabeties, he doesn't qualify. Someone please tell me what all this means? There is nothing they can do which is what was said? What is his life expectancy? I am 8 hours from him, so I was not there to ask questions and with all of the info given, I can't piece it altogether. PLEASE HELP.",
