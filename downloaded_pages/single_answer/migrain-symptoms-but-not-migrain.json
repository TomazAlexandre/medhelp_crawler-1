            "answer": "Hi!First get your blood pressure checked. The head feeling warm could be due to high blood pressure or even due to BP falling suddenly. If need be go for 24 hour blood pressure monitoring because this is the simplest reason for your symptoms. The other possibility is clot in some blood vessel (say carotids). This can also give out heat sensation without there being any temperature. Hence dopplar studies or angiograms of carotids should be done.\u00a0\u00a0Hyperthyroidism, diabetes, temporal arteritis are the other possibilities. A simple test of ESR can rule out temporal arteritis since ESR is high in this. Other two problems can also be ruled out by blood tests. Sudden hypoglycemia too could be a cause. Low testosterone is another possibility. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "It feel like my head is heating up, even on a cold day. What will happen is that the blood vessels on my head will enlarge and cause severe pain on my head(not the side). I can feel the pressure point where the pain is. When I take a Relpax tablet the pain will go away but the 'heat in my head' will remain. The next day the cycle will start again, my guess is once the Relpax is gone out of my system.I used to get migraine, so although the pain is the same there is no symptoms.There must be some underlaying cause. Can it be something like male menopose? What do I do?",
