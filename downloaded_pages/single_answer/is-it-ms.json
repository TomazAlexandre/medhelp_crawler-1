            "answer": "Hi and thank for using the forum.I would try and see a different neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0It has been 5 years since your last MRI, so if the symptoms of heaviness in your legs is new, then it is probably time to repeat the MRI.\u00a0\u00a0Also, vitamin deficiencies should be ruled out as these can cause similar symptoms that you have described.\u00a0\u00a0Neuropathies are usually caused by something (diabetes, medications, vitamin deficiencies,etc.), so finding out the cause would be helpful in your treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck, I hope this helps.Bridget",

    "question": "I'm 55 yr old female. I have Raynauds, and Neuropathy (mild, per test), and restless leg. I'm at my wits end. For the past two weeks I have been experiencing my legs to feel heavy, (as though I'm moving in quick sand), my feet seem to trip at times, severe leg and foot cramps. The pain and heaviness use to be just in my lower legs, and only when I worked in the yard, but it now seems to be moving up, and even without strenuous exercise. Tingling, pins and needles is an every day occurance for me. At times I slur my speech, but don't know it until my husband points it out. Please any ideas? I had a MRI without contrast 5 years ago, but that was as far as it went because MRI was negative. All tests run associated with Raynauds was negative, so there is no reason to explain condition. I do get angina with the Raynauds, as well as dry gagrene, and I only have 1% circulation in toes, with a weak pulse in ankle. All the neurologists wanted to do was put me on a narcotic and I refused..he dropped me. No meds currently, and can't seem to find a doctor in this town that wants to help, without going further with tests. They seem to think its all associated with condition. Is that true?",
