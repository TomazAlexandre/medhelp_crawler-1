            "answer": "So now I have an additional question.\u00a0\u00a0My knees tend to get stuck, like they sublocate when I'm lying down, and I change position.\u00a0\u00a0Last week I ended up going by ambulance to the ER because I couldn't get my left knee\u00a0\u00a0back in place.\u00a0\u00a0After the doctor got it back in place, he told me he thought I had a torn miniscus, gave me a brace, and referred me to an orthopedist.\u00a0\u00a0Even though I told the orthopedist that this happens with both knees, and his evaluation showed that there was some catching in both knees, he sent me for an MRI on the left knee.\u00a0\u00a0Three days later, the right knee got stuck, but I managed to get it back in place on my own.\u00a0\u00a0So,\u00a0\u00a0my additional question is could this also be related to neuromuscular disease?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I feel like my whole body is falling apart, but the food allergies issue and the knees are the two things I can not attribute to Autonomic Neuropathy, if that is indeed my diagnoses, or can I?",

    "question": "I have a tentative diagnoses of Autonomic Neuropathy, without diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Recently I have experienced a typical allergic response when I ate tree nuts. (burning sensation in mouth)\u00a0\u00a0A few days later, I had a similar reaction when I ate some cheese from a ball that was covered in almond slices with the same burning sensation in my mouth and vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0The next few days I noticed that tomatoes and raspberries gave me the same burning feeling in my mouth.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, am I more likely to experience food allergies if I have neuromuscular disease?\u00a0\u00a0It seems strange that this should happen at age 51 with foods I have been eating all my life.",
