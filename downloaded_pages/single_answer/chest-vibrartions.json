    "question": "I am 51 year old. I always had Giddiness problem and used to take Vertin and it used to get controlled. To give a brief history, Once I was freely diagnosed\u00a0\u00a0which stated that I have a high BP and need to consult a Doctor. I took this very lightly as I had no health issues, I really don't know whether I need high BP to stay normal or not. One day while I was traveling I had a problem of giddiness+vomiting+lost complete control over my body. I was immediately taken to a Doctor, he had taken ECG, Brain MRI, Lupid Profile, etc.. The conclusion of my Dr was I have a border level Diabetes + High BP. He has started giving me medications on above two issues. Since last few days I am facing an issue of Chest Vibrations towards which Dr has done ECG but seems every thing is fine. He keeps adding to my above medicines but nothing works out. My body is just not having a proper balance after having so many medicines. Currently I am facing problems of Giddiness + Chest Vibrations towards which nothing is working out please help as every thing seems to be normal in reports. FYI, my BP along with medications are 140/80, Sugar level after food-228. I do not know what type of Diabetes I have. I seriously feel that after starting medications for BP and Diabetes my health has worsen.\u00a0\u00a0And now with new issue of Chest Vibrations and Giddiness. Please help whether this new issue of Chest Vibrations + Giddiness is related to BP and Diabetes or some thing new has emerged.",
