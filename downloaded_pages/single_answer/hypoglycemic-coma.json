    "question": "Before I ask my questions, I'll need to give you the backstory:A dear family friend, 50 year old woman in excellent health who has controlled her diabetes since she was 8 was found convulsing/seizing in her bedroom by my mother. She was nonresponsive, was given an injection by the EMTs to increase her blood sugar. Her BS was 30 when they found her, their injection did not work, she was in a drug-induced coma for the last two days and has just been taken off those sedatives. She will have an EEG & MRI done on Monday, but as of right now, she remains quite unresponsive - her eyes have opened sporadically, but she doesn't track anything, and she seems to have quick, sporadic movements of her body. She has been managing her diabetes with a pump, and doctors seem to think it may have malfunctioned since she received 37 units of insulin in an 8 hour period, and the previous day had received 20 units in 24 hours. I know next to nothing about diabetes and am trying to learn all that I can, but here are my questions:1. Are there any cases of severe hypoglycemic comas where patients don't respond to stimuli at first, but are able (after time) to come out of their coma?2. If question number 1 is a yes, how long did it take for them to come out of their coma?3. Was their any brain damage - what was the extent?4. She was ok at 11:30 pm and was found having seizures at 6:30 am - no one knows how long she was having those seizures for. How long would she have had to be having them for there to be irreversible brain injury?Some of the research I've been doing in the last couple of days seems to mention that sometimes when a person is in a coma for metabolic reasons (and not blunt force trauma to the brain) that person can potentially show no brain activity during initial tests, but can still come out of the coma and make a full recovery. I'd like to know if this has happened to anyone on this board. Also, if her pump malfunctioned and she received too much insulin, why are they saying she's in a hypoglycemic coma?Any information or insight is greatly appreciated - we are all very scared. She's in otherwise excellent health (manages her weight, food intake, activity level) is a nurse and knows how to control this. Has anyone else had a similar pump malfunction?",
