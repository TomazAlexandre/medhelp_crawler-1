            "answer": "Hi!If you had an unusually light period, then take a pregnancy test now. Urine pregnancy tests taken before the due date can be negative. So if you have the symptoms, maybe you are pregnant. If the test is negative, then your symptoms could be due to a gut infection, liver infection, diabetes or PCOD. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Take care!",

    "question": "Ok so I started hurting and cramping 2 weeks before my period was due and then 1 week before it was due I started feeling sick to my stomach all the time. I was getting dizzy and also I have been very tired lately. I just have felt pregnant, i have 3 kids already so i was pretty sure what i was feeling. I took a pregnancy test about a week before i was due and it was negative. I started bleeding yesterday, which was my due date but its not like my normal period and it is almost done now...i am also cramping and having really bad gas pains. Has this happened to anyone? Could i still be pregnant? Or am i getting my hopes up for nothing?\u00a0\u00a0Please help!",
