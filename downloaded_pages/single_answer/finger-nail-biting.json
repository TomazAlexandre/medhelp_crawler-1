            "answer": "Hi!If you are biting your nails then bacteria from your mouth can enter the tender skin beneath the nail that usually gets exposed and abraded or bruised by repeated biting. If the infection is not going away, you will need to apply an antibiotic cream and take anti-inflammatory drugs and maybe oral antibiotics. Also, you may need to get blood sugar tested as diabetes also makes healing difficult. You should ideally consult a doctor to see how deep is the infection because if the bone beneath gets infected then this will be very difficult to treat. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
