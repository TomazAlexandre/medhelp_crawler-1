    "question": "I have been worked up for MS and it was ruled out although brain mri wasshowing 4 hyperintensities. I do not have high blood pressure, diabetes and blood tests have ruled out other autoimmune disorders, thyroid dysfunction, b12 deficiency etc.But here's the problem. My left foot, sometimes entire leg will tingle severely, in the following circumstances: mostly when I wake up every morning unless my legs are not under covers; in the shower; after exercise or when really tired.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to me that the tingling is brought on by heat.\u00a0\u00a0 It is becoming more consistent, more frequent.Neurologist said take vitamin D and stay active. He described as possibly neuritis, neuropathy, although said this wasn't a diagnosis but description . EMG showed nothing , and physiotherapist as well as lumbar mri indicate no pinched nerve.But something has to be causing this. I am very concerned to know what in case it gets worse.\u00a0\u00a0 Neurologist asked if I'd experienced any drop foot and when I said no he just shrugged.Any ideas on causes or how to investigate further?",
