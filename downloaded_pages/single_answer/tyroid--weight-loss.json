    "question": "I was told by my doctor ten yrs ago i was hyperglycemic but not severly..ive always been underweight. I recently stopped taking oral birth control which i was on for two years and maintained a healthy weight of 110. I beleive it was making me depressed. I am feeling better now but after a few months being off of it i am down to 95 lbs. I cant gsin lbs, am always eating and always hungry and tired. I had my tyroid checked while i was in the b.c and it was normal...i am going in to have it checked again soon but is there a hormonal link here? Could i be producing too much testosterone? My mother has cronic fatigue, ive read it can be linked to hypertyroidism. I dont want to go back on hormones. Just trying to find some answers . Can anyone relate or help me?",
