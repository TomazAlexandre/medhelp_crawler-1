            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your discomfort/ pain. Possibilities that may need to be considered include neuro-muscular causes, infections, inflammations such as fasciitis, degenerations, heel pad syndrome, injuries, fractures, dislocations, vascular issues such as POVD, micronutrient deficiencies etc. Without a diagnosis at hand it would be difficult to suggest a management plan. I would suggest getting this by an orthopedician for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
