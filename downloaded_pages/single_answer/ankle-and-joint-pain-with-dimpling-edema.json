    "question": "I consistently have edema below my knees to my toes. After I excercise, mostly walking, my akle bones and foot bones hurt so bad I can hardly walk. Also, the edema is pretty bad. Usually it dimples and stays for awhile. After excercising, or even shopping for more than an hour, the next day the edema is still there. I am overweight, and I am trying to lose some of my wieght. I figure that my weight has something to do with this. I just want to make sure I don't need to see a doctor. Diabetes and high blood pressure runs in my family. Oh yeah, sometimes while excersizing, my hands go numb as well?Thanks for your help!",
