            "answer": "There is an actual condition called \"Burning Mouth Syndrome\" that covers many of your symptoms. I would advise seeing your doctor as there is usually an underlying reason for this condition. I have listed some of them, but the last one could well be your answer, but ONLY a doctor can diagnose you, so please see yours. I wish you the best.RubyWitchUnderlying problems that may be linked to Burning Mouth Syndrome include:Dry mouth (xerostomia), which can be caused by various medications, health problems, problems with salivary gland function or the side effects of cancer treatment.Other oral conditions, such as a fungal infection of the mouth (oral thrush), an inflammatory condition called oral lichen planus, or a condition called geographic tongue that gives the tongue a map-like appearance.Nutritional deficiencies, such as lack of iron, zinc, folate (vitamin B-9), thiamin (vitamin B-1), riboflavin (vitamin B-2), pyridoxine (vitamin B-6) and cobalamin (vitamin B-12).Dentures, especially if they don't fit well, which can place stress on some muscles and tissues of your mouth, or if they contain materials that irritate mouth tissues.Allergies or reactions to foods, food flavorings, other food additives, fragrances, dyes or dental-work substances.Reflux of stomach acid (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD) that enters your mouth from your stomach.Certain medications, particularly high blood pressure medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.Oral habits, such as tongue thrusting, biting the tip of the tongue and teeth grinding (bruxism).Endocrine disorders, such as diabetes or underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism).Excessive mouth irritation, which may result from over brushing your tongue, using abrasive toothpastes, overusing mouthwashes or having too many acidic drinks, such as lemon.Psychological factors, such as ANXIETY, DEPRESSION or STRESS.",
