This is merely an advice and not a substitute of clinical examination. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "Hey there,\u00a8I'm a male, but I'd rather not mention my age.I've been really confused lately, due to the fact that it hurts when i urinate. It hurts a lot.It started during the Summer of 2013, however, the pain sort of laid off for a while, until the beginning of November.Just today, I went to perform a urine test, however, there was no problem at all.No UTI. No STD. No nothing. I have also been told that it's not due to diabetes, or anything of the kind.Now, I've got two major questions:Do any of you have any idea why this is, and if so, could you tell me what I can do about it?And alsoMy doctor told me he'd wait for a few days, and see if anything had happened to said urine test, and that he would send me to an Urologist. What does this \"urologist\" do to examinine my... You know.Also, I want to make it clear, yet again, that I am a *Male*Thank you.",
