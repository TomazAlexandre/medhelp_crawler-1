            "answer": "Hey Angela!Yes, diabetes could slow the healing of infection. If topical anti-fungal agents have not been helpful, one may require systemic anti-fungal agents. I would suggest considering a review with your primary MD or consider seeing a dermatologist for appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "Over a year ago my Jack Russell terrier mix dog bit my left thumb and since then my nail does not grow and has thinned out and the lunula is swollen and very tender and very painful to the touch. A few months ago I showed it to my primary MD and she said it was a fungal infection and gave me a prescription topical lacquer to put nightly on my nail for 3 months. It has improved in its gross appearance, but it still is basically infected ---the nail doesn't grow and the lunula is still swollen and thin and painful to the touch and gets easily cut open and bleeds. Oh and there is still a brown streak under the nail that looks like dried blood but the MD said that that was a fungal infection and not blood. Do you think the healing might be slowed down due to my diabetes type 2?I am going to see my primary MD next Friday but I was just wondering if there was anything else I could do for my nail?Thank you,Angela",
