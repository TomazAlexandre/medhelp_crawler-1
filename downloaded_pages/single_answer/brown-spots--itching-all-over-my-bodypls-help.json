            "answer": "Hi,How are you? If you break out and itch a lot with pork intake, then you may have allergic reaction to this food. It is right that you should avoid this to prevent recurrences of your symptoms. Generalized itching can be caused by possible allergic reaction, irritation, infection and medical conditions such as diabetes, anemia and liver conditions. It is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Direct clinical examination and further laboratory tests will help determine the diagnosis. Take care and do keep us posted.",
