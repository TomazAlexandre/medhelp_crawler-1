            "answer": "Hello,I agree with your doctors that due to the wound, the hair follicles have been damaged. However for the thinning hair, the possibilities of telogen or male pattern baldness have to be ruled out. Androgenic alopecia is a common form of hair loss and typically occurs in M shaped pattern.Men who have this type of hair loss usually have inherited the trait. Other causes may be use of some drugs, infections and underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. A biopsy (taking a small sample of cells to examine under a microscope) of your scalp may be needed to establish the correct diagnosis.Medicines which are useful are minoxidil and finasteride. Finally one can resort to hair transplantation also. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi,I met with an accident in 3years back because of that I had developed a big bald batch behind my head. I consulted with three doctors and they had told me that the wound has damaged the roots and its not possible to get hair grow back in that area. Last week I noticed that due to hair thining my scalp is visible from some areas and if not taken care there will be bald patches . Could you please suggest what should I do? I had undergone the hair treatment with one of the reputed doctors for almost 18months but didnt find any improvement. The treatment was basically to prevent the existing patches from increasing and to stimulate the hair growth.Please suggest a good hair specialist in Mumbai so that I can start my treatment before its too late.Thanks for your help",
