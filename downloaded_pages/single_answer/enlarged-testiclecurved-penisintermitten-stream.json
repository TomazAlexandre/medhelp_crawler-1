            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Enlarged testicle, with jelly like feeling around it is usually due to hydrocele. It is a painless and harmless swelling, treatment is not required unless it is causing discomfort due it\u2019s size, infection and bleeding.Coming to curved penis, occurring suddenly could be due to recurrent UTI\u2019s or peyronnie\u2019s disease. Also inability to maintain erection could be a manifestation of this problem. But at your age and if you are having any other medical conditions like hypertension and diabetes, there could be some degree of erectile dysfunction.Intermittent stream can occur due to enlarged prostrate, stricture urethra, stones in the urinary tract etc. A DRE of the prostrate and cystoscopy would aid in making diagnosis.Consult a urologist and discuss the above mentioned possibilities.Best.",
