            "answer": "I am not aware of any pointers to Paxil as causing type 1 diabetes. It is thought that type 1 diabetes is caused by faulty genes (I have read that it is thought by some that we inherit one faulty gene from each parent, hence it doesn't tend to run in families) and an immune system triggered by some virus. Some researchers believe that they have even located some specific viruses that can work to trigger diabetes in these people. I have never read anything about Paxil or any other drug as being the cause.",
