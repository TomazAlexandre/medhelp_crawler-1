    "question": "This has been going on for a few days. I eat breakfast around 7:30 and have a pretty substantial meal (waffles, boost energy drink, banana). I felt really tired in school today and around 10:30 or so I began to feel dizzy and started having episodes of anxiety. I also noticed my hands were freezing (they were warm earlier in the day). I was afraid to stand in the lunch line (around 11:30) as I was afraid I was going to pass out. I sat down for a while and ate some of my friends crackers to calm myself down. After I finally managed to get my lunch I felt a little better and at about 12:15 I was myself again.I have passed out in the past and I have never been able to really put a finger on the cause. I know diabetes runs on my mom's side, but could this be genetic? I hate the feeling of weakness and I hate having to worry if I'm going to pass out or not.",
