    "question": "I'm a 51 year old male with no history of eye problems, diabetes, glaucoma, etc.\u00a0\u00a0About a week ago I noticed a shadow in the peripheral vision of my right eye which turned out to be a spot of \"lost vision\".\u00a0\u00a0I went to the eye doctor, who said she saw a \"white spot\" on my retina that would explain the condition.\u00a0\u00a0She said this was idiopathic something that may resolve itself and she seemed unconcerned.\u00a0\u00a0She was gone so fast that I did not ask the follow-up questions that I should have.\u00a0\u00a0Several days later, it seems the vision may be returning to this spot, but now straight lines appear to be bent in this area of my peripheral vision.\u00a0\u00a0Any idea what my \"ideopathic\" condition is?\u00a0\u00a0Should I go back to the doc?PT in Texas",
