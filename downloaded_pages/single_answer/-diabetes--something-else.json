    "question": "Still having tests as my blood glucose reading was abnormal when tested by Dr. Sample wastaken from vein and I dont yet know what the figures are. My own blood sugar reading whichwas tested with hubby's home monitor came out at 9.3 but I only tested once as I don'twant to muck up his personal readings.I don't want to lose weight, (112 lbs only) but have lost at least 1lb a week for thepast 6 weeks, due to poor appetite, diarreah and malabsorption. There is a question as towhether I am Celiac (not had this test back yet either) so I have been trying a gluten and sugarfree diet. I am trying to walk briskly everyday for at least 20 minutes but this is knackering meat the moment. I am normally able to walk way longer than this without feeling I did 10 roundswith Mike Tyson. More calories needed - nutritional deficiencies?This all seemed to start with 1 episode of constipation which I resolved with prune juice andthen this changed into diarreah. There was malabsorption during this time and some black andgreenish seed like things in addition to bits of food passed. Also on one occasion stool hadfroth/slime in it. After about 2 weeks of this my stools are returning to my normal.Another problem I have is that I think my sugar dips in the middle of the night???the night - Symptoms go like this:-\u00a0\u00a0I wake about ten to four a.m. and then the following symptomswash over me like a wave. My stomach area and vagina feel like they are burning and it feelslike the intensity (burning) increases in my stomach, my heart is beating fast now and I startfeeling a bit hot and sweaty all over but particularly my palms. I can also feel heartbeat inmy stomach area. Usually tinnitus is present. Then I feel a bit shaky and/or hungry and butt feels tingly/odd. Left hand feels stiff/tingly? and I feel a bit afraid. If I am not fully awake when this starts at the beginning I feel pureterror. The wave probably lasts a couple of minutes. Does anyone know what these symptomsare - Diabetes, Thyroid, Panic?? I am currently been treated for Anxiety, Panic and depression.and in Perimenopause - very close to menopause.\u00a0\u00a0Throughout the day if I mop the floor forinstance I get upper and lower backache. Sometimes my back feels shaky like it used towhen I had a period. Any help in shedding light on these symptoms would be fantastic.Thank you. Sorry don't even know if I have posted in the correct forum.",
