            "answer": "Hi Noelle,Just a reminder that we are not medical professionals but mostly volunteers living with Type I Diabetes or caring for someone who has it. I don't know as much about Type II Diabetes and I'm used to blood sugar readings in mg/dl, but I believe a reading of 9.2 mmol/L is about 160mg/dl, which, in case of a fasting sugar, is most likely considered diabetes. You can get more information on what various blood sugar test readings indicate on: http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/glucose/test.htmlAccording to the above website anything over 7.0 fasting is considered diabetes. However, if your doctor tells you there's \"nothing to worry about\" has he/she explained to you why he/she feels that way? Perhaps there's a good reason, such as the circumstances around which the test was done, any other health issues you may have, etc. My suggestion is for you to speak to your doctor, voice your concerns and ask specific questions as to why these readings shouldn't be of concern, what you can do to lower them and when, in his/her opinion, would it become more serious (at what glucose level)? If you don't get the answers you want or if your doctor is not the easiest person to talk to it wouldn't hurt getting a second opinion, if possible from an endocrinologist. It's understandable you're concerned about your health and if you have any doubts you have every right (and resposibility) to ask questions, get the right treatment and put your mind at ease. Good luck and take care!",

    "question": "I am a 31 yr old female with a history of Type II diabetes on both sides of my family. Recently, my doctor administered a fasting insulin test based on some symptoms I was having which indicated insulin resistance (ie, I have not been diagnosed as diabetic). My fasting test read 9.2. My doctor says there's \"nothing to worry about,\" but my own research indicates that a reading at this level should be taken seriously, as it arguably indicates pre-diabetes at the very least. Any one have any suggestions as to how to proceed with my doctor on this issue?",
