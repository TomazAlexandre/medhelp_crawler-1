            "answer": "I have deep chest cramps as I call them. They come on quickly, don't last long - less than a minute and then go away. I wore a monitor to record them as well as my other arrhythmia stuff. When I saw the cardio, he said he didn't have the results from the monitor but he didn't think it was cardio related. OK. He put me on a medication to control the arrhythmias a bit before I went into surgery. Amazingly enough, the chest cramps went away as well after a couple of weeks. Coincidence maybe. Bottom line is I don't know what causes mine. Most often they occur during strenuous activity and stop when I stop. If the doc isn't worried then I guess I won't worry either. Hope you get better answers.",
