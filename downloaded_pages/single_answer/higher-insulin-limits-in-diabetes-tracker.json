            "answer": "Hi there,You can add as many shots as you need through the day. Under the two you have entered for today, you can click on Add Another.\u00a0\u00a0You cannot add more than 100 units at a time. However, for instance if you need 150 units, you can enter two shots as one with 100 units and one 50 units.Does that make sense?Please let me know if you need any more assistance.Steph",

    "question": "I take a lot of insulin especially when I've had a bad food day and sometimes I go over 100 units/day. Would it be possible to raise the limits in the diabetes tracker? Also I take multiple shots per day (most diabetics do too) it would be very helpful to be able to track each shot, especially if it were coupled with the food tracker since I take a shot with each meal.Thanks",
