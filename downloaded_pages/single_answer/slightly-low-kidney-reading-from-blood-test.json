    "question": "Hello, My 72 year old mother was diagnosed with Diabetes Type 2 close to 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0She manages her sugar level quite well.\u00a0\u00a0She also has heart problems,\u00a0\u00a0and high blood pressure ---- which she takes medication for as well. At her recent doctor visit, she was told that \"her kidney was low\".\u00a0\u00a0She took the 24 hour urine test, and another blood test thereafter.\u00a0\u00a0Number did not change.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor wants her to increase her intake of Lotensin from 10mg to 20mg daily, and decrease her intake of Atenolol from 75mg daily to 25mg daily.Question - what kind of effect are they looking for by adjusting her meds?\u00a0\u00a0I read that Lotensin increases your sugar level, and that Atenolol causes kidney damage.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is that they're more concerned about kidney damage than her sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Is a slightly low kidney number need for alarm related to \"kidney disease\"?Thank you for your time.",
