            "answer": "Ok, first of all, you would not necessary feel worse than you do if you were diabetic. Many Type 2 diabetics don't experience any symptoms at all and just discover their diabetes from a routine blood test. There is no way to know from your post if you are diabetic or not. Some people do experierience hypoglycemia without being diabetic. I would definitely suggest not waiting till 11AM to eat, that would certainly make the problem worse. Eating regular meals or snacks could certainly help with hypoglycemia whatever its cause. However, as soon as you were able I would get a blood glucose reading. If you have a friend with diabetes perhaps they will do it for you until you are able to get to a doctor. Btw you mentioned \"crazy morning thirsties\" and extreme thirst is a key symptom of diabetes.",

    "question": "As far as I know I'm not diabetic, although being in between insurance companies at the moment, I haven't had my blood sugar levels checked since my last DOT physical back in 08 (which came back fine). For the last ten years at least once a month or so I would suddenly feel dizzy and heavy, I would sweat like crazy, my chest would pound\u00a0\u00a0and all I could think about was reaching for the fridge. Usually the only thing on my mind would be a grape jelly sandwich for some odd reason. After that and a tall glass of water in a few minutes, maybe close to a half hour I would feel just fine. Not a big deal for me except now it's become more frequent, closer to once a week.I don't believe it's a panic attack. I don't feel like I'm going to die or anything like that and it seems to happen close to the same time everyday right about the time i get home from my first shift along about 11 am. I don't drink coffee, don't usually have time to eat anything until then. Most mornings I'm just dashing out the door with a diet coke and a couple bottles of water to kill the crazy morning thirsties.I just don't know, I'm pretty sure if I were diabetic or something like that I'd feel worse than I do. Outside of these brief instances I feel just fine.",
