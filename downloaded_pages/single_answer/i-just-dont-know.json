            "answer": "Ok - a few questions/comments for you.\u00a0\u00a0I'm at work so dont know when I can reply though.Firstly, do NOT stop taking Wellbutrin without advice from a doctor - it can be dangerous to do so and you MUST have an appropriate tapering regime in place.Different SSRI's tend to effect different people in different ways.\u00a0\u00a0While Zoloft may have been effective at treating depression in YOUR case, Wellbutrin may not - side effects are also very different too.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it can take some time to find the medication, and appropriate dosage, that is right for YOU.\u00a0\u00a0This is complicated by the fact you are currently pregnant but it can be done.\u00a0\u00a0And YES!\u00a0\u00a0Medications CAN help.1) How long have you been on the Wellbutin for? It may take about 6 weeks before you notice any real effect.\u00a0\u00a0Its also possible you may need a dosage change.2) How long were you off the Zoloft before you were put on Wellbutrin, and when did you last take the Zoloft?\u00a0\u00a0Was there any tapering or substitution or were you suddenly just switched from one to the other?3) Have you spoken to your doctor about this?\u00a0\u00a0There are also other medications you can take while pregnant.Also, I am surprised you were taken off the Zoloft and put on Wellbutrin due to the \"risk categories\".\u00a0\u00a0Both drugs are rated category \"C\" by the FDA.\u00a0\u00a0My OBGYN actually told me that Zoloft was also one of the preferred drugs to take while pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Lexapro and Prozac are other good options but may be problematic down the line if you want to breast feed.Fingers crossed you have a happy, healthy, baby girl :)",

    "question": "Well I put in the Topic area as normal pregnancy but t me this is really far from normal. Update on who I am and What in the world's going on, I'm a 31 yr old mother of FOUR yes, I said FOUR BOYS! and I am currently pregnant (11 wks).\u00a0\u00a0Keep your fingers crossed that this one is a girl(please GOD). anyway, I have gestational diabetes (which I had the last 2 insulin dependant) which is hard enough. I have cronic pain from an accident that I had in 1996 shattered T-11 vertebrae, so I take pain meds daily (norco or viccodin) I was also on 200 mg of zoloft, because of it's category rate we switced me over to wellbutrin 300mg. I don't feel as great as I did with zoloft, but I hated the side effects of zoloft (no orgasim EVER) with that side effect why bother to have sex? How in the world did I ever get Pregnant? HA! Anyway, I need some advice on helping to relax alittle more easily on wellbutrin. Should I stop taking it all together? The gestational diabetes is enough for me to worry about and now I worry abou taking anything whatsoever while pregnant. Not to mention I breastfeed until 2 yrs. So what should I do? Does anyone know if meditation can really help? I try to use a lot of relaxation tech's but.....has anyone here had a baby on wellbutrin? Was everything ok? HOw about early gestational diabetes? HELP!MeleniaMother of 5 But 6 if you add my husband! :)",
