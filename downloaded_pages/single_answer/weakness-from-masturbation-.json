            "answer": "Hi!In all probability you are feeling the effects of not masturbating. Usually there is no harm in masturbating several times in a day as long as you do not let it affect your life. Resume masturbation and see if it helps. Otherwise you need to get a complete blood tests done to find the cause: blood count, hemoglobin, iron, thyroid hormone, diabetes, testosterone etc. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
