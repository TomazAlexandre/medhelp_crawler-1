    "question": "I am diabetic and have been diagnosed for over five years. My blood sugar has been good for sometime but in the past few weeks, it has been on the average of 228. Even in the mornings. I have been having a lot of joint pains, a tingling feeling all over my body and feel tired all the time. When my sugar drops to 160 I get even more tired because my body is used to being so high, it almost needs sugar to stay consistent.Can someone please advise what I should do beyond the medicines I am taking? Has anyone else experienced this?In addition I believe I may have been exposed to HIV two months ago. I know my symptoms can be HIV related but does anyone know if HIV can increase my sugar on a daily basis as it is. I guess I am confused and scared and need some guidance.",
