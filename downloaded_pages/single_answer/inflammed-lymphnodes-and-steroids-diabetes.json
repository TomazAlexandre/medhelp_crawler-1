    "question": "My cats started 6 months ago with diarrhea,slight weight loss and high white blood cell count. A thyroid test ruled out hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Then an ultrasound revealed inflammed lymphnodes in the stomach, She was then given only two Depo steroid shots within 4 weeks and the lymphnodes went away but not the diarrhea,the weight loss continued, the high white blood cell count too. The thought it might be IBS. The vet switched her to busimide and within\u00a0\u00a0her glucose levels shot up. He told me to continue the sardines fish canned food which is high in protein to help with the diarehha but to bring her back in to check her urine for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If the busimide gave her the high glucose levels what can I do for the lymphnodes, diarreha?",
