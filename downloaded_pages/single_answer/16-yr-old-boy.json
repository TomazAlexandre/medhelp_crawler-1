            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to obtain a history from your son and examine him, I can not comment on a formal diagnosis or treatment plan for your symptoms. However, I will try to provide you with some information regarding this matter.I am sorry to hear about your son\u2019s illness. Many infections can cause a post-illness syndrome which may include fatigue, muscle aches, headaches, night sweats, etc. These can last several months. You should continue working with your sons primary physician for monitoring and recommendations. I wish I could provide information for you, but your question may be best answered in an infectious disease forum or gastroenterology forum.Thank you for using the forum, I hope you find this information useful, good luck.",

    "question": "My 16yr old son came back from Corfu in August having suffered from a violent bout of food poisoning and with a chest and throat infection, since then he has been very down and not well at all. Our Dr said he thought it might be post viral fatigue but expected this to clear up within a month or so.\u00a0\u00a0His symptoms are: shooting pains in his head and sometimes in his chest, all over muscle ache, dizziness and nausea.\u00a0\u00a0He has become very depressed.\u00a0\u00a0All blood works have come back clear, he's been tested for diabetes, testosterone, thyroid, weils, toxoplasmosis, liver function. I am so desperate I don't know what to do next.",
