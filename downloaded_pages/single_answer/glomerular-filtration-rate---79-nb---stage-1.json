            "answer": "Ok, are you seeing a family dr and have you made an appt with a nephrologist? First, your GFR is not bad, its below normal but you need to find out what is causing the lower GFR. You need to research any medications you take, even over the counter, and prescription and see if any of them could be affecting kidney function. If you take alot of ibuprofen or NSAIDS, that could be part of it. These meds are hard on the kidneys, try to avoid them. Drink alot of water or Gatorade and dont let yourself dehydrate. If you dont have diabetes or hypertension, theres a good chance your stage 1 will stay that way and not get worst. Dont worry too much about this right now, just follow up with a specialist.",
