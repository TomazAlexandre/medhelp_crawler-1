    "question": "I am a male 71 yrs. Yesterday, after playing a round of golf ( I walk on the course). We had a lunch. After the lunch, all of a sudden, my right palm and fingers became numb and there was no movement. After shaking off my hand few times the feelings came back. This happened a few times. Once we left the restaurant, and began to walk to our car parking, it felt alright. This has never happened before. I spoke to my fam doc, he indicated it was a blood circulation issue. The question is why should it happen and is this a symptom of a possible bigger issue ?The other questions are if this is an early warning of a stroke or mere arthritis. I am a borderline Type 2 diabetes. As yet, I have not been taking any meds, but control it through lifestyle changes. I am of South Asian origin.Appreciate your feedback.jan201071",
