            "answer": "Dear Suresh,Many thanks for posting the question.With this sort of history, i would like to suggest you that you dad needs to be properly hydrated (salt water/ORS) so that the electrolyte balance is recovered.The body looses a lot of salts in loose motions along with the fluid. Due to improper salts in the body, he is getting cramps which will resemble myalgia.So give him rest, hydrate him well with fluids and give him adequate electrolytes.I would suggest you to stick on to ORS and not Electrol solution.He will take little more time to recover due to the age and diabetes.Also request you to cut down the Medicines for pain killers on regular basis.However if he is not responding well, then a General Practitioner's opinion would help.Feel free to discuss more,Regards",

He is a 57yrs, diabetic,no hypertension and an history of amoebiasis.\u00a0\u00a0Two months back, my daddy was suffered from a hyper pyrexia @102F only for one day at that time he took Cefixime 200mg per day.
