            "answer": "Hi ukechicagoVisual changes are a known side effect of Interferon. If your Dr made the decision to stop Tx without consulting an eye specialist I would want a second opinion. Tx modification may have all that was required. Note from below \u201cmost interferon-related retinopathy is asymptomatic and reversible.\u201dBelow comes fromhttp://www.hepatitis.va.gov/vahep?page=prtop04-cs-01Visual ChangesVisual changes are fairly common, but the exact incidence is unknown.(10) The most commonly documented eye complications are \u201ccotton wool spots\u201d and retinal hemorrhages, but most interferon-related retinopathy is asymptomatic and reversible.ManagementIt is reasonable to perform a baseline eye exam in any patient with diseases associated with the retina (eg, diabetes, hypertension) to establish a pretreatment baseline. Any patient who develops visual changes while on interferon should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist.Treatment changes can then be made in consultation with the ophthalmologist based on the findings observed. Patients should know that there have been instances of serious eye injury (eg, optic neuritis, visual loss, retinal detachment) in patients taking interferon, although these are rare and may improve with discontinuation of the medication.As for VX-950 several people on here have been involved in the trials. Unfortunately for you and your hubby, Telaprevir (VX-950) is taken in addition to interferon and Ribavirin.So if the retinal hemorrhages were indeed bad enough to be taken off Tx then how you can you take Telaprevir as it requires Interferon.Hope this helpsCS",
