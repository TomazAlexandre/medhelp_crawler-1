    "question": "I've been a competitive swimmer all my life and was always underweight, able to eat anything and everything and still look like the poster child for anorexia.\u00a0\u00a0In college my training is probably twice as rigorous and for the last 2 and 1/2 years I have gained weight and can't seem to lose it no matter what I do. My weight is centered all in my torso, shoulders and face.\u00a0\u00a0Although I have only gained about 22 pounds the shape of my body has drastically changed.\u00a0\u00a0I have been checked for diabetes and my thyroid test came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0When I go home people I knew in high school don't recognize me!",
