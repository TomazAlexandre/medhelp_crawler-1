            "answer": "Hi,Your daughter has frequent urination (frequency) which can be due to:1) Infection2) Sugar in the urine (Diabetes)3) Events that cause anxiety4) Infrequent urination (holding urine for too long a period of time)5) Structural abnormalities in the bladder or urethra6) Overactive BladderSome of the measures which can be tried are decreasing/avoiding her intake of soda and caffeine, urinating on schedule (every 2-3 hours), and giving adequate time to urinate and empty the bladder.Children usually outgrow this condition and it is usually not a sign of significant urologic problem but you should get a Ultrasound/CT scan of kidney and bladder done.Regards.",

    "question": "My 9 year old daughter has been complaining for 3 weeks that she still feels like she has to go pee after just peeing. She has been awaking in the middle of the night also to use the bathroom which is out of the ordinary and this was something she did for 4 nights before complaining about the feeling of having to pee even after just peeing. We have done urine screenings 2 times and all were negative, also did a culture of secrections from her vulva area which showed no bacteria or yeast. She says this feeling that she still has to pee is down there and points to her urethra area. Doctors physical exam of this area found nothing. Could you tell me what might be causing this problem for her and if there are any other tests that should be performed. Thank You for your time.",
