            "answer": "Is he having a diff time talking too?Has he had ne dental work...sounds like thrush.OverviewThrush is a yeast infection of the mucus membrane lining of the mouth and tongue.SymptomsThrush appears as whitish, velvety lesions in the mouth and on the tongue. Underneath the whitish material, there is red tissue that may bleed easily. The lesions can slowly increase in number and size.ausesThrush is caused by forms of a fungus called Candida. A small amount of this fungus lives in your mouth most of the time. It is usually kept in check by your immune system and other types of germs that also normally live in your mouth.However, when your immune system is weaker, the fungus can grow, leading to sores (lesions) in your mouth and on your tongue. The following can increase your chances of getting thrush:Taking steroid medicationsHaving an HIV infection or AIDSReceiving chemotherapy for cancer or drugs to suppress your immune system following an organ transplantBeing very old or very youngBeing in poor healthThrush is commonly seen in infants. It is not considered abnormal in infants unless it lasts longer than a couple of weeks.Candida can also cause yeast infections in the vagina.People who have diabetes and had high blood sugar levels are more likely to get thrush in the mouth (oral thrush), because the extra sugar in your saliva acts like food for Candida.Taking high doses of antibiotics or taking antibiotics for a long time also increases the risk of oral thrush. Antibiotics kill some of the healthy bacteria that help keep Candida from growing too much.People with poorly fitting dentures are also more likely to get thrush.",

    "question": "So, it is now Tuesday night. Some information: This all started Friday morning... My boyfriend wokeup late for work and was complaining about not feeling good. I didnt think much of it, because sometimes he complains when he wakes up late. Well I left for work, when I came back I found him sleeping with a fever.. He said he left work early due to not feeling well. I didnt have a thermoniter until Saturday morning so I'm not sure what his tempature was Friday. Saturday, his tempurature was ranging from 100 -102. Due to stupid circumstances he got called into work and worked 4 hours. When he came back he took a nap. I took his temperature and it was 103. By now his throat started swelling, and eventually swelled up terribley by sunday. Also, he was complaining about his gums and wisdom teeth hurting. With doses of tylonal, I'm getting his temperature to stay down to 99 - 101. Nothing was getting better, only worse. He woke up yesterday morning with a swollen tongue, and was complaining about THAT hurting now. We thought he had strep throat. So I took him to the urgent care, yesterday. Strep throat was not the case, a the doctor diagnosed him with a \"mouth and throat infection\" (I dont understand this, it is so vague). He prescribed him antibiotics and vicodin. The vicodin is helping with the pain, and keeping his temperture down to 99-101. There are FOURTY antibiotics (2 a day, thats 20 days). He woke up this morning and was complaining of a layer of gunk all over the top of his mouth and back of his teeth. Now his mouth his so swollen he can barely talk (it hurts him) and he can barely eat or swollow. And he is also coughing up blood.I'm just wondering if anyone has had this or knows anyone that has had these symptoms before. Or any advice or anything. Just any information, because the doctor did not go into any kind of detail at all.",
