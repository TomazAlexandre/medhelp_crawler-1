    "question": "I am 24 years old and I have a healthy diet and exercise regularly, although my weight is about 10 lbs over the normal range for my height (as it has been my whole life). When I go without eating for a few hours, I get the shakes. I frequently have to go to the bathroom and I am always thirsty. I have also noticed lately after feeling generally ill and taking my temperature that my body temperature is always below 97 degrees. I have just been put on welbutrin for anxiety and depression, as well as Lunesta for sleep. Could either of these medications be causing these issues or do I seriously need to consider that it might be Diabtese? Type 2 runs in my family on my father's side. Thanks for your help.",
