            "answer": "welcome to the cat forum I hope you can find some help here!.....its strange to me that the steroids would help for a short while than stop, that would indicate the problem isn't inflammation,so kitties problems are going to be harder to trace. IMO when theres a problem with gait it has to be either neurological (a nerve issue in the spinal column due to injury or diabetes) or mechanical somewhere in the leg or paw. have his paws been checked for any soreness?...something is causing him pain.On this forum we are only pet owners like yourself, I hope someone here can give you advice if they have encountered similar issues otherwise I would go on the EXPERT RELATED FORUMS (lower right hand of this screen) and have a Vet reply to you're question.If kitties symptoms become any worse in the meantime I would suggest seeing you're own Vet again soon.hope this was of some help, please keep us posted.",

    "question": "I have a 9 month old male kitten and about a month ago he started walking oddly. We took him to the vet and they did x-rays and everything is normal. He does not appear to be in pain and you can move his legs and feet without any reaction from him. The vet gave me a steroid for him to take everyday for 5 days and then every other day for another 5 times. He seemed to be doing better after the first set of steroids and by the end of the doses he seemed to be back to normal. Then two days ago I noticed he would not get on the couch and was only taking a few steps before he would sit down... This is the\u00a0\u00a0same symptoms as before. I am really worried for him... What could be causing this? Any suggestions?",
