    "question": "Has anyone here been diagnosed with fatty liver disease? My doctors told me to watch my glucose levels very closely, and I do, but I also do not physically have a pancreas inside my body which makes it more likely that my sugars will drop faster than the average diabetic. I can sit and type on the computer for 20 minutes and drop from a 200 down to a 48. Without a pancreas I cannot produce glucagon and have glycogen storage disease of my liver. Along with the fatty liver and diabetes, I have thyroid , adrenal, pituitary, liver disfunctions and Alpha 1 antitripsin carrier phenotype MM1, had my ovaries removed for PCOS, hysterectomy from endometriosis and uterine cancer, am on blood pressure meds, cholesterol meds due to metabolic syndrome,and am on antiseizure meds for epilepsy and antidepressants for depression. I have always had problems with my weight and a terrible time with glucose control due to other diseases I have in addition to the diabetes. If my asthma meds don't put me to sleep, my hypothyroidism meds aren't working properly. Something is always amiss with my conditions. I'm doing the best I can with what I have available now, it's just a question of if anyone else here has been diagnosed as having fat infiltration into their liver [faty liver disease]. Any and all comments are welcome.",
