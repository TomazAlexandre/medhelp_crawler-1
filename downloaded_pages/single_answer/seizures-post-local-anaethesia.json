            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. I understand your concerns and empathize that this incident happened. Considering the dentist would not have exceeded the safe permitted dose of local anesthetic for topical infiltration, toxic effects of anesthetic drugs occur with excessive blood levels due to rapid absorption from vascular sites like mucous membranes. Certain precautions however need to be practiced when using these drugs. The doctor should decide the concentration of the LA needed and calculate the total volume of the drug according to the safe mg/kg dose, which should be injected slowly. The systemic effects if there is an overdose are dizziness, tinnitus, numbness around the lips, drowsiness. A tonic clonic seizure reflects severe toxicity. Your child needs to be evaluated and ruled out for any other preexisting seizure disorder, diabetes, and the next procedure be done under the supervision of a trained anesthesiologist. Best wishes to her for a speedy and safe procedure.",

    "question": "My 16 yr old daughter recently had a seizure post local anaethesia for dental extractions, it lasted less than a minute and she was concious afterwards, but tired and nausious. It was a an early morning appointment and she never ate breakfast, so I was thinking maybe her blood sugars were low, they went ahead with the extractions anyway. she has to return for more extractions shortly and we are all very anxious this will happen again. Any advice would be useful? Or anyone who has had a similar experience? Thank YouM.ac",
