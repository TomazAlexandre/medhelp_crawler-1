            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A thick white discharge is normally seen in pregnancy. Yeast infection to begin with only causes a white vaginal discharge. Thick white vaginal discharge can also be due to cervical cancer or lichen sclerosus.Ulcers in this area are usually due to syphilis, herpes, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, and lymphogranuloma inguinale. Hence a STD panel should be repeated again for this. Other possibilities are disseminated lupus erythemosus, cancers, and Bechet\u2019s disease. It is difficult to comment beyond this on net. Please consult your gynecologist. There is another possibility\u2014an allergic reaction to something. Possibility of diabetes with pregnancy too should be ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "ok well to start off im pregnant and when i had visited my doctor he did give me a screening test [ about 3 wks ago ) . last week, when the results came in syphillis gonorreah herpes and HIV all came back negative. i was diagnosed and treated for chlamydia though. now, i have a canker like sore on my labia majora and a cut on the space between my vaginal and anal openings. i also have a thick white discharge that doesnt really smell but it is ALOT and the sores hurt when touched. im very scared and depressed and i dont know what they could be being i have had the std testing done. i am going to have it checked during my next appointment but any other information before that [ 2 weeks ) would be very helpful. thanksps ive done some reading and most the stories like this say they have the flu/ cold and so do i so i was wondering if that might in fact have something to do with itThis discussion is related to/posts/show/356892.",
