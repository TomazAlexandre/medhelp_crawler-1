            "answer": "I could have done a better job explaining. It is much more likely that your pain is from the rib fractures than the gallbladder. Without any symptoms prior to the fall it would be odd that you suddenly developed gallbladder troubles at the exact time that you fell and broke a couple of ribs. I would consider your gallstones an incidental finding. In the face of asymptomatic gallstones, there are only a couple of situations where surgery would be recommended.

Is it possible that because of this fall in the bathtub, and the subsequent injury of the fravtured ribs of the 9th and 10th rib, and as well as having diabetes, that the pain and discomfort I have felt from what I thought was gallstones (which I do have) may be a result of the fractured ribs? Because I don't have symptoms of jaundice, and I haven't had much, if any nauseau. If I had a c t scan done over the weekend, can I request to see the x-rays (both from the normal x-rays and c t scan? vern.",
