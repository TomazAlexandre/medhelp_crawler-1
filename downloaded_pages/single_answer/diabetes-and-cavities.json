            "answer": "The good news is if your diabetes is under control, you are less likely to develop periodontal diseases than someone whose diabetes is poorly controlled. A study published in the Journal of Periodontology concluded that poorly controlled diabetic patients respond differently to bacterial plaque at the gum line than well controlled patients with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0So to answer your question it depends not only on the state of your oral health, but the type of control you have with your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0With poor glycemic control and/or periodontal disease this will cause the increased destruction of bone supporting the teeth. A careful oral health assessment and treatment is imperative to limit dental problems.My son has had diabetes for 19 years and unfortunately his control in his early years, following diagnosis, was not the best.\u00a0\u00a0And I believe this is a contributing factor to the dental problems he has experienced.\u00a0\u00a0But with the better control he has now established, many of his dental problems have been lessened.Good luck to you,Debbie",

    "question": "I am diabetic and considering I eat many small meals during the day, I was wondering if there is any correlation between cavities and a this type of diet? Also do diabetics lose their teeth sooner than non-diabetics? Thanks-Rob",
