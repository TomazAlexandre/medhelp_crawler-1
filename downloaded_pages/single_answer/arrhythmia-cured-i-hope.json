            "answer": "I understand the desire to come off medications, but please reconsider restarting the statin.\u00a0\u00a0The studies for statins reducing cardiac events dwarfs any possible and unproven benefit of fish oil and CoQ10.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, the studies of fish oil in people with known scar from previous MI are not favorable and I would not advice it.Regarding your heart beat, I am not sure that I understand what the rhythm was -- atrial fibrillation perhaps?\u00a0\u00a0If you it is atrial fibrillation, consideration for coumadin should be made to decrease the risk of stroke as you have several risk factors.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure that I know what to say without knowing what the rhythm is.",

    "question": "Following a heart attack (MI) 1992 and a significantly raised heart beat 180 in resting mode and diagnosed as diabetic type 2 I have been on a cocktail of drugs including amiodarone, lisinopril, simvastatin, atenenol, digoxin,imdur and consistently over the years my ECG confirmed that I had Arrhythmia until a few weeks ago.Prior to this point I have reversed my diabetes and no longer have to inject insulin reduced my weight increased my exercise no longer take statins, atenenol and reduced lisinopril dose.As far as I can tell the change occurred not long after taking 1000mg of fish oil and 60mg of CoQ10. My blood pressure has dropped from 160/100 to an average of 110/ 75 and my cholesterol is below the European target figure.My blood pressure meter detects arrhythmia but my result was confirmed by ECG. Do you think my analysis is correct?",
