            "answer": "Hi there,You should get investigated for hepatitis viral profile. High levels of SGOT and SGPT can be seen in liver diseases and muscle diseases. Chronic hepatitis C infection can cause mildly elevated liver enzymes. Acute liver disease will cause a marked rise in liver enzymes. Fatty liver can also cause minimal elevation of liver enzymes. The interpretation of elevated AST and ALT levels depends upon the entire clinical evaluation of an individual. You seem to have elevated hepatic enzymes and alkaline phosphatase.Elevated ALP can be seen in infectious mononucleosis, bile duct obstruction, hepatitis, heavy alcohol consumption, and fatty liver. In fatty liver there is fat in the liver, along with inflammation and damage. Fatty liver due to alcoholism is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. An ultrasound will confirm whether you have fatty liver or not. Consult your doctor for more queries and assistance. I hope it helps.Best wishes and kind regards!",
