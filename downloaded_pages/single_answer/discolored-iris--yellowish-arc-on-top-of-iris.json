    "question": "I'm 40. Have worn contacts for about 10 years. Very good health and see my physician regularly. No signs of high blood psi, diabetes, or very high colesterol\u00a0\u00a0(210).\u00a0\u00a0Have not been to my eye dr. in about a year.\u00a0\u00a0I am blue eyed.\u00a0\u00a0I just noticed what look like yellowish (or greenish) arcs across the top of both of my eyes. The seemely appeared overnight. they are inside of the outer dark boarder of my iris, and thin. Thickest at 12'oclock and taper off to nothing around the 10 and 2 oclock position of the iris.\u00a0\u00a0They follow the dark boarder of my iris and are semetrical and identical on both eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Any idea of what this could be?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
