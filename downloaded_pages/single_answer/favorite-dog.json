            "answer": "Hi,Neurogenic bladder is dysfunction of the urinary bladder caused by\u00a0\u00a0inability of the nervous system to control micturition. Possible causes of neurogenic bladder include\u00a0\u00a0diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0acute infections,\u00a0\u00a0accidents that cause trauma to the brain or spinal cord,\u00a0\u00a0genetic nerve problems, or heavy metal poisoning.\u00a0\u00a0It may also be mistaken for urinary tract infection and\u00a0\u00a0kidney stones. It presents with urinary incontinence, small urine volume during voiding,\u00a0\u00a0urinary frequency and urgency,\u00a0\u00a0dribbling urine and\u00a0\u00a0loss of sensation of bladder fullness.Aside from complete medical history and physical examination, diagnostic procedures such as\u00a0\u00a0 x-rays of the skull and spine,\u00a0\u00a0electroencephalogram (EEG), imaging tests of the bladder and ureters, or IVP. Treatment for neurogenic bladder may include insertion of a catheter to empty the bladder at regular intervals, and prophylactic antibiotic therapy to prevent infection. Surgical treatment and placement of an artificial sphincter may also be done. This link may be helpful:http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic3176.htmTake care and regards.",
