            "answer": "Hey 82baby.Welcome to the forum.No menstruation in 5 years is far too long!Your condition is called Secondary Amenorrhea.You need to see your Doctor or a Gynecologist asap!This long without menstruating could have different health implications.Because you are young you should try to find the cause of theabsence of periods, instead of just any treatment.Your hormone levels should be checked .Also check for other deficiencies and get tested for diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0as it may be indirectly connected to the cause of your amenorrhea. And get your thyroid checked as well.Your gynecologist should recommend all those tests .Do you also have fibromyalgia or fibro like symptoms?Just wondering, since you posted here.Wishing you well.NamasteNiko",
