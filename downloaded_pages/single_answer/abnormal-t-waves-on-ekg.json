            "answer": "Hello. Nobody can diagnose through internet but generally speaking, the presence of diffuse negative T waves in the precordial leads (V1-V5) in an electrocardiogram can have ischemic (decreased oxygen supply to the heart muscle) and non-ischemic causes. As you are asymptomatic (non chest pain or shortness of breath), the probability of this finding to be related to and obstructed coronary artery will depend on your risks factors (age, gender, smoking, cocaine use, family history of heart attack at young age, diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure). As you already posted that your blood pressure and cholesterol are normal, the other factors will be more important (gender/age, smoking/cocaine use, body mass index, and family history). The fact that you are asymptomatic (no chest pain and good functional capacity) propose that is probably safe to wait until your appointment, but I recommend to consult to the closer emergency department in case you start with symptoms. Your doctor will probably request an echocardiogram that is an ultrasound of the heart and maybe some type of stress test to look for changes in your heart during exercise. The workup may result completely normal as these electrical findings may not be new, so it will be useful to take any previous EKG to your doctor for comparison. Good luck.",
