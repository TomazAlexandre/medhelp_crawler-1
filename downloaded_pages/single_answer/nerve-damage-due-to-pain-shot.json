            "answer": "Hi,Injury to a nerve due to an injection usually causes severe shooting pain and rarely, if ever, numbness.Tight shoes 2 months ago and numbness developing now- may not be related. Even if it developed at that time, you need to rule out causes of peripheral neuropathy, like diabetes mellitus, B12 deficiency, liver and kidney diseases, Guillian Barre syndrome, infections, vascular diseases, thyroid disorders. Even the butt numbness may be related to the same.Do consult a GP to pinpoint the cause and then visit a specialist.Do keep me postedRegards",

    "question": "i recived a pain shot in my upper hip on my back side for a migrane and now(4 days later) my upper buttock is numb. Is this normal, because i have recived these types of shots before and this never happened. I am a little worried because 2 months ago i wore high heel shoes that were tight and now my big toe on my left foot is numb all the time, is my butt going to stay numb as well? Why would this happen and is there anything i can do. I am 6 months away from getting to nursinging school, i am still doing my core classes, and i think the nurse who gave me the shot hit a nerve and i was wondering if this could be correct or if it could be somthing else?",
