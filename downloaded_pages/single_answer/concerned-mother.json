            "answer": "All of the symptoms you mention are indeed symptoms that could point to diabetes, except that in the case of untreated type 1 diabetes, the patient cannot gain weight, but instead loses weight despite eating a lot. But it is possible that diabetes is just starting and weight loss has not happened yet.The tests will determine if her glucose levels are elevated or normal. Steroids do tend to elevate glucose levels, so if I were you, I would ask about whether these meds should be changed or whether her doctor thinks that they don't have an effect. In true type 1 diabetes, the cause is not something like steroids, but is due to an autoimmune system malfunction whereby the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the pancreas. There are tests that can be run to determine whether a child has the genetic predisposition to become a diabetic.If her tests come back positive, I recommend that you ask to be referred to a type 1 specialist who deals with pediatric endocrine issues.",

    "question": "My daughter just turned 5 on March 20th. On the 21st she had her 5 y.o. well check at her pediatrian. The doctor asked me if I had any concerns these are the things that I listed:* She is constantly hungry. She will cry for food.* She is constantly thirsty.* She is constantly urinating.* She has a dark brown velvet like ring around her neck.* She is gaining weight like crazy. She has been through 3 sets of winter clothes!At the appt. they found that she is having vision loss in her left eye, a UTI and he noticed what I had pointed out to him.He ordered some blood work. I am really worried that she has diabetes after the 4 years she has been on steriods from her asthma.Any input on how diagnosing diabetes in children would be great! Thanks in advance.",
