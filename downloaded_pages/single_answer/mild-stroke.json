            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The treatment of stroke aims at removing the block, dilating the blood vessel and preventing further blocks. This can include medicines like antihypertensive, anti platelet agents, and anticonvulsants; stenting; surgery; dilatation and ballooning. The treatment depends on the position of block, neurological symptoms, associated conditions like hypertension, diabetes, seizures and the general condition of the patient. If the stroke happened due to a bleed, then this is controlled. If it is due to worms in brain, then a long term treatment to kill the worm is started. Hence treatment also depends on the cause of stroke.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
