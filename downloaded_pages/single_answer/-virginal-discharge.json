            "answer": "This fluid flows out of the vagina each day, carrying out old cells that have lined the vagina. This is your body's way of keeping your vagina healthy and clean. The discharge is usually clear or milky and doesn't smell bad.The colour and thickness of the discharge changes with your monthly cycle. The discharge is thicker when you ovulate (when one of your ovaries releases an egg), when you breastfeed or when you're sexually excited.Changes that may signal that something is wrong include an increase in the amount of discharge, a change in the colour or smell of the discharge, and irritation, itchiness or burning in or around your vagina. This is called vaginitis. A discharge that's stained with blood when you're not having your period could also be a sign of a problem. These signs may need to be checked by your doctor.These changes can occur if the normal balance of healthy bacteria in your vagina is upset. Many things can disturb the balance of a healthy vagina, including douching, feminine hygiene sprays, certain soaps or bubble baths, antibiotics, diabetes, pregnancy, infections, aging and intercourse.So only you can know if this is normal or not. Is this the first time having this then that could be a indicator that it's something else then just your body cleaning itself.",
