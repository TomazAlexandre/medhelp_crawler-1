            "answer": "Hi,You need to consult a neurologist at the earliest. Even if antidepressants help in some cases, they can only be prescribed by a doctor.You need to get your blood pressure and blood sugar checked. Are you taking any medications, of which headache is a side effect? Could this be postural headache?Do you remember any trauma or injury to the site?It will take some time to see a neurologist and till then it would be advisable to get yourself seen by a physician or an urgent care clinic - something would probably be done for pain relief.You would also need to get an MRI done to find out any cause of the headaches and associated tenderness.Are you getting adequate sleep? Is the headache worsened by light or noise and is it associated with any nausea?Do schedule an appointment at the earliest and let us know about how you are doing.Hope this helps.Good luck.",

    "question": "HiI posted about a headache I had on the right side of my head a few weeks ago. After that it stopped, I took a few pills, different ones, last one being norgesic. I don't know if they actually helped or the pain just stopped itself.Last Saturday, I started to feel a dull pain again on the right side of head.This time nothing is helping. The pain is like a constant pressure on the head. I feel it as soon as I wake up. Sometimes I just feel the pressure without the pain being too severe. The pain is normally located in a small area and moves around a bit but always on the right side. Last night I woke up with the pain for the first time. It was really scary... I have never felt such a BURNING sensation in my head before. It feels right under the scalp.My work doctor has mentioned tension headaches a few times and also suggested to take one antidepressant before I sleep.Can anyone suggest something please? I am very anxious by nature so probably I am making it all worse. When I touch where it is hurting, normally it is quite tender and\u00a0\u00a0painful.I have diabetes and a heart condition called SVT. It is only this past month that I have felt such a pain. It is very different to any type of headaches I have felt before.Thanks to anyone taking the time to read and help me out. It means a lot.",
