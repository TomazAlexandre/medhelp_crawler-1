            "answer": "Hi,Please consult your GP and do a blood work.If you are diabetic ,these symptoms could persist,Dont be shocked when I ask for your diabetic state at 28,there is something called juvenile diabetes.Do not work heavily in the gym till theses symptoms are off.Do consult an neurologist if the numbness persists for longer duration.A simple gastritis can cause numbness and pain your shoulders ,it is called 'reffered pain',the pain is due the reason that both a part of the stomach and the shoulder are supplied by the same nerve and it branch,the phrenic nerve.So dont panic.Do the tests and keep me posted.Goodluck",

    "question": "i am a 28 year old healthy male. a couple of weeks ago i had a stomach bug. it lasted for a week or a little bit longer shortly after i started to notice numbness in my left hand(particularl on side of palm and small finger).after about two days it went away but then i noticed when i shrug my shoulders up and down i get a sensation shooting down to the side palm and small finger on both sides. I also experience buzzing or tingling feeling in my arms and legs if i am in a certain position. I still try to work out at the gym it does not seem to affect my strenght. But after i work out the buzzing and tingling is more intense but no pain whatsoever.I do have a history of anxiety attacks,panic attacks, I'm also a bit of aa hypocondriac. any time i get sick i obsess that is is a deadly disease until i acctualyy give my self the symptoms of a paticular disease. just wonder if these symptoms could be related to this because i watch a special on MS disease about amonth before all of this hppened or do ineed to go to doctor even though i just had a physical 9 months ago.",
