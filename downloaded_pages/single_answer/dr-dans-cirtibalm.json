            "answer": "Hello,It is true that some of the drugs can cause elevated liver enzymes but it is true with mostly antibiotics rather than topical steroids. Moreover the absoption via this route is less that that by oral and intravenous route and it bypasses the liver. Elevated liver enzymes are found in hepatitis, fatty liver, alcoholic liver disease,obesity, diabetes(uncontrolled),mononucleosis, autoimmune hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, gallstones, tumors of liver, pancreas and bile ducts and side effects of medicines like certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cholesterol medications, antibiotics or anti-seizure medications.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am a 31 yr old male and have been taking Accutane for one month. I recently got my blood test back and had high cholesterol, high LDL, and double over normal liver enzymes. I have been taking Vitamin B Complex, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, an Omega 3, 6, and 9 pill, and Osteo-BiFlex supplements.Finally, I have been taking Dr. Dan's Cortibalm, which is a hydrocortisone lip balm used for severely chapped lips.My question is: does hydrocortisone overtax ones liver to an extent that someone with elevated liver enzymes should consider discontinuing this treatment because the risks outweigh the benefits?\u00a0\u00a0This lip balm is by far the most effective treatment I have found for chapped lips!\u00a0\u00a0Also, do any of the above supplements overtax the liver as well?Thank you!",
