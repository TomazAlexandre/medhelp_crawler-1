    "question": "My recent blood test results showed my glucose at 104. By the time I had my blood drawn I had fasted for almost 14 hours. Is this to long to fast? I heard your glucose can possibly increase if you fast to long. Is 104 still in the \"OK\" range? My doctor wants to put me on Actos. It actually went down from a year ago when my test showed 108. I exercise and eat healthy most of the time with an occasional night out. I weigh 170 and am 5' 5\" have a muscular build with 17% body fat so I don't consider myself overweight.I am having my blood tested again in 3 months. What can I do to get my glucose under 99 next time? Thanks.",
