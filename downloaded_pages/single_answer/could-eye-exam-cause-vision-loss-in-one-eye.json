            "answer": "No it shouldn't.\u00a0\u00a0The only things that have definitely been related to eye exams and subsequent injury:\u00a0\u00a01. in very short eyes with very narrow anterior segements it is possible to cause an attack of angle closure glaucoma.\u00a0\u00a0This problem does not occur in eyes that have had cataract surgery. The other is relatively minor and that is a flare up of dry eyes or an accidental corneal abrasion due to rubbing the eye or a very infrequent reaction to the drops.The most common cause of your problem would be non-arteritic anterior ischemic arteritis. This is a very common problem and while it is more common in smokers, alcoholics, HBP, diabetes, high cholesterol and obesity it can 'just happen\" due to bad luck. I see someone with this every 2-3 months.",
