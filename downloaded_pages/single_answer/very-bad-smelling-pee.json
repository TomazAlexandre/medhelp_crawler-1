            "answer": "Hello,Ammonia smell in urine could be due to bacterial infection in the urinary tract without regular symptoms of UTI, dehydration, consumption of red meat or high protein foods.I think you should consult your doctor and get the urine examined for infection, ketones etc. You may also need to get a urine culture done. Frequent urination can also be due to urine infection or kidney conditions and diabetes. Your blood sugar levels also need to be checked.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
