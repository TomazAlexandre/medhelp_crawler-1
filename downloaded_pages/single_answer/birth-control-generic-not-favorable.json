            "answer": "Wow , im glad to hear you say this because i am going through a similar situation. My insurance company switched me from my effexor xr to the generic and i am experiencing the feelings i used to have before meds. I have been feeling up and down, very irritable, sad, paranoid, on edge, like im having a severe case of pms. And I also have hypothyroid along with but it 's under control. You were asking about the symptoms, and yes you're right about the symptoms but allot of things can cause these same symtoms, like your iron being low. So just go have your blood drawn for thyroid, hemoglobin, etc... Let me know how you make out! And by the way, I am also losing my hair right now. It's terrible. In the shower drain catcher, it's like the size of a mouse, and when i run my fingers through i gae lots then too. I also take adderall , 15mg 2x daily.",

    "question": "I have worked in pharmacy (CPhT) for 9 years so I know the generics differ by way of binding; I recently switched from brand name Estrostep to generic Tilia. I am not happy with the outcome. My cycles are lasting days longer, \"pms\" is worse (cramps), cranker than with brand name. I also have new side ffects that I wonder if there is a relation:my iron seems low (cold, very tired, etc.), my hair is thinning when I run my fingers through it there is \"shedding\", an RPH that I work with mentioned low thyroid can also cause these effects. In your professional opinion (yes I will see my dr) could the Tilia generic have any impact on this and what would be other signs of low thyroid (if synthroid or armouir thyroid were needed)? I know my cholest. is\u00a0\u00a0high but other that that Im healthy. The only other med I take is Adderall 20 mg ... tid /prn. I also have a history of diabetes (gestatonal that lingered but finally returned to normal).Thank you for your input.",
