            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Well, maturbation can leave a smell if you do not clean yourself well after it. The other possibility is sweat. Lingering sweat in clothes and armpit and groin can cause a bad odor. Alcohol intake and poor personal hygiene are the other cause. Smelly sock are the other reason. All these can be taken care of by maintaining good person hygiene, takin a regular bath etc.Apart from this uncontrolled diabetes can result in a fruity odor from the body. Other medical conditions to be ruled out are thyroid disorder and carcinoid syndrome. Medicines such as antidepressants too can cause a bad odor from the body. Discuss this with your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
