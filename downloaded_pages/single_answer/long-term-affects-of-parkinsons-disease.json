            "answer": "Dear Robin:Sorry to hear about your father.\u00a0\u00a0Parkinson's responds well to treatment, as a rule.\u00a0\u00a0We initially start a dopamine agonist and then eventually treat with sinemet (L-dopa and MAO inhibitor).\u00a0\u00a0Some people begin with a MAO inhibitor and this is by personal preference.\u00a0\u00a0Alot depends on how long your father had the symptoms without a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the time it is months to years, but still the medications should be of great benefit to him and he has alot of years ahead of him.Without an etiology of your sensory neuropathy I cannot really give you an predictions.\u00a0\u00a0Since all the usual things like carpal tunnel, amyloid, sarcoid, diabetes, alcoholism, etc have been ruled out, it is difficult to assess.\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry that I can't give you a better answer.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "This is a great website for people who have neurological problems.\u00a0\u00a0I just found it and I am glad that I did.\u00a0\u00a0I have two questions for you.\u00a0\u00a0One for myself and one for my dad.\u00a0\u00a0My father has parkinson's disease.\u00a0\u00a0He was diagnosed at 74 and he is now 76.\u00a0\u00a0I notice that he now has trouble getting up from chairs, walking, and he can no longer do the gardening that he used to do.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, do people with this condition become paralyzed and if so, do many years usually pass before this happens?\u00a0\u00a0I know that these things can't be predicted, but I wanted to know what the general progression usually is in patients with this problem.My next question (sorry for two at once) pertains to myself.\u00a0\u00a0I have a sensory peripheral neuropathy in which I have pain in my right hand only and the etiology is unknown.\u00a0\u00a0After two years with this problem, I still have not experienced any numbness that they talk about.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I was told that eventually people's hands will go numb and they won't be able to use their hand for basic purposes such as writing, typing, or holding objects.\u00a0\u00a0Is that true?\u00a0\u00a0Does this happen to people in your experience?Robin",
