            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Many neurological diseases including ALS can progress fast even though in general, they are relatively slow in progression. The symptoms can be due to MS, ALS, peripheral neuropathies due to diabetes, thyroid disorders etc or due to pinched nerves in the cervical spine.Depending on the results of the clinical examination, you may need to undergo blood tests, MRI, spinal tap etc.The symptoms can also be due to severe anxiety and stress. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
