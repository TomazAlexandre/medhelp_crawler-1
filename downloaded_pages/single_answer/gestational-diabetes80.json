    "question": "So i had my gb test a few weeks ago and the results came back that i was only one point away from having gestational diabetes. I asked the doctor if she was going to test me again but she said since I'm so close, they don't need to. I just need to avoid sugary stuff.But im so worried that i am going to get it and they won't know.Im 34 weeks so i still have several weeks left. Are there any signs or symptoms i should look for or that the doctor would be looking for?",
