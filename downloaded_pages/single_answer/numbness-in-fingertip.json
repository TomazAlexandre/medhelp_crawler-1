            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for posting.Numbness in the finger tip can occur due to neuropathy due to diabetes, B12 deficiency, and thyroid dysfunction.Other possibility is nerve compression at the wrist or elbow. If you have a history of smoking, the possibility of peripheral vascular disease also needs to be looked into.This warrants a full clinical exam. Please schedule an appointment with your GP and in the meantime take OTC B complex supplements.Take care!",

    "question": "Off and on I have numbness in one fingertip from the last joint all the way to the tip. I can't feel anything with it. At first I thought I had just gotten it too cold but after running hot water on it I did not get any relief. Now, after 10 hours it is still numb and white. What causes this? What should I do if anything. It is not constant but today it has lasted longer than it has before. Has anyone had this problem? If so what did you do about it. It doesn't hurt it just concerns me right now.",
