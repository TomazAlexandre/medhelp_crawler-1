            "answer": "Hi, was the hemoglobin rechecked? if this is normal its unlikely that your symptoms of breathlessness are due to anemia. Inadequate oxygenation can produce symptoms of breathlessness, as the body tries in an effort to compensate for the decreased oxygen supply. Breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Certain systemic disorders like diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can also cause these symptoms. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time. Regards.",
