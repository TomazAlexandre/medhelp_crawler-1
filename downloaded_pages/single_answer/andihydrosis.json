            "answer": "Hello,Anhidrosis can be due to dehydration, sweat glands injury of the area, underactivity of the parasympathetic system and various other causes like diabetes, autonomic neuropathy, ectodermal dysplasia(rare inherited condition which affect the ectodermal skin layer which includes the skin, hair, teeth and nails), or supranuclear palsy.In my opinion you should consult a neurologist and get it evaluated.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
