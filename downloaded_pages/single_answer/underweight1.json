            "answer": "From the measurements you wrote, his weight is about on 3rd percentile and his height is on the 95th percentile for his age. If these are right, he appears even thinner than he is due to his height. From what you have described, he does not have the symptoms of diabetes; however, if you are concerned suggest bringing him to the doctor for testing. To help him gain weight, suggest giving him yogurt smoothies (yogurt, fresh fruit, and frozen fruit blended together), since he eats yogurt. Another suggestion is to engage him in the kitchen. Have him help you with preparation of food and setting the table. Hopefully this will increase his interest in other types of food. Let him eat what he wants and introduce new foods every few weeks gently. The new foods should be related to the foods he eats so he may accept them. Relax and if he does not want it, do to not make a fuss and let it go. Hoped this helped you.",
