            "answer": "I know you have probably explored these options, but for what it is worth....I would think of: snoring (some kind of obstruction in nasal area or sinuses),\u00a0\u00a0night terrors,\u00a0\u00a0pain,\u00a0\u00a0separation anxiety,\u00a0\u00a0pinworms,\u00a0\u00a0or diabetes.Good luck...it is difficult on you as a parent to continually lose sleep, but it is hard on the child also. Try to establish regular sleep patterns with calming pre-bedtime routines, limit daytime napping, and every so often, get grandma to keep the kids overnight so you and hubby can sleep.",

    "question": "My DS will be 4 in Febraury.\u00a0\u00a0He has never been a good sleeper.\u00a0\u00a0I always knew this, but now that I have my DD who is three months, it is even harder to deal with.\u00a0\u00a0He frequently wakes up screaming and crying and can't really tell us what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes he needs to go to the bathroom, but sometimes he doesn't need anything.\u00a0\u00a0My three month old is sleeping all night and has been for some time.\u00a0\u00a0I know God knew I could handle another one that doesn't sleep!! LOL!\u00a0\u00a0My husband has been out of town all week and my DS has had a really bad week as far as sleeping goes.\u00a0\u00a0He was sick last weekend and has missed daddy this week, but he has been waking up several times each night screaming.\u00a0\u00a0Last night it woke up the baby because he was so loud.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like we have tried everything.\u00a0\u00a0We sometimes give in and let him come in our bed, but things are no better.\u00a0\u00a0My fear is that he will continue to wake the baby and mess up her great sleep habits as well.\u00a0\u00a0I have talked to two different peds. about it when he was younger, but their suggestions don't help.. Do any of you have any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0I lay there at night feeling so mad and frustrated that my 3 month old can sleep all night and my almost 4 year old can't sleep more than a couple of hours at a time.\u00a0\u00a0I need some help!!",
