    "question": "My dad (73) has newly-diagnosed CHF plus diabetes (7 years), and had open heart surgery to repair/replace 2 valves this summer. He's been home 5 weeks (7-8 weeks post surgery now), gradually improving (stable, no oxygen, driving) but had extremely high blood sugar (400-500) for a couple of weeks, and this week he is back in the hospital because of lung congestion/shortness of breath, sudden weight gain, and angina. Doctors apparently solved the blood sugar problem yesterday by *removing* his Actos (which had replaced Avandia for him) and upping his insulin, however the breathing problems persist and he is having multiple tests of his lungs, heart, kidneys, legs to determine a likely cause this time. What we know: Heart function post-surgery is good (measuring 70% vs. 60 the surgeon was shooting for), kidney function is poor (creatin level 1.9 vs. 1.5 acceptable), lungs are almost clear and have no clots, and blood sugar is again in the 100 range. My dad's frustration is with the ongoing tests, including various scans/scopes/xrays, where he doesn't feel like the doctors know (or said?) what they are looking for. Part of the problem is obviously communication and part maybe expectations, but at least this time around he does feel like one of his internists is coordinating across the other various specialists. I think he does have a complicated problem, and he may have to wait longer for any answer. What we're looking for: More information about what *tests* (and results) might be typical for persistent shortness of breath where the doctors already seem to understand the heart and kidney function? Are lung specialists brought in to help make diagnoses like this, or does the cardiologist cover the lung evaluations in a case like this? THANKS.",
