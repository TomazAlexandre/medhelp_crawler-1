However, the laser has caused traction and I am now required to have vitrectomy surgery.My main concern is whether or not i can have another child. Doctor, would you recommned that a diabetic patient who has existing retinopathy to have a baby? What could I be risking? I know pregnancy hormones can progress retinopathy but at what stage do things settle.",
