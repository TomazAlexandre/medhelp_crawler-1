    "question": "Hi I had vaginal sex with a woman for about 1 minute with a condom as well as protected oral sex with a condom a little over 2 months ago. About 4 days later I noticed I had discomfort on the shaft of my penis and I had the urge to urinate alot, even when nothing came out. I thought it was a possible UTI, I drank alot of cranberry juice and water before I took a urine test at the doctor the next day and a UTI test came out negative. I was given some bactrim which took away the initial discomofrt of the shaft. A week later I had some discomfort on the left side of the shaft, my doctor gave me some cipro and that took away any discomfort right away. In the last week or so, a red bump appeared on my scrotum which hasnt developed into a blister or sore and isn't painful but won't go away, it seems like a pimple but I cannot be certain. Also similar discomfort came back to the shaft. I feel the discomfort before I have to urinate, when I sit down for a long time or make sudden movements. It's almost like a pushing of the shaft. The discomfort decreases day by day though. I feel when i drink more water that I urinate clearer and more fluid when at times there can still be a urine blockage in the last week. There is no burning when I urinate or pain though. With that said I have a couple questions.1) Could this be herpes?2) Could this be prostatis?3) I am seeing a urologist next week, can I get more answers about this there.Thanks for your time.",
