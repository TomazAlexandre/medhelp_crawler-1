            "answer": "Hello,It is very difficult to make a diagnosis without examination but some of the possibilities for your symptoms are dermatitis(contact,irritant or allergic), atopic dermatitis like eczema, sweat dermatitis,dry skin (xerosis),allergies or psoriasis.Systemic diseases like like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia can also cause itchy skin(localized or generalized).Take antihistaminics like benadryl or Claritin(zyrtec).Sometimes they may be needed for prolonged periods.Also apply calamine or mild steroid cream like dermacort on the bumps.Severe cases may require oral steroids for which prescription is needed.Pls consult a dermatologist then.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing..",

    "question": "Last night I discovered tiny bumps on my left ear.\u00a0\u00a0They are more noticeable to the touch than to see them, and are on the itchy side.\u00a0\u00a0They extend from my lobe, up around the edge, slightly around the backside and onto the skin near where my lobe attaches as well as the skin behind my ear.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is an allergic reaction to something, but I have no known allergies and would have expected it to have faded by now (several hours later) if that were the case.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?",
