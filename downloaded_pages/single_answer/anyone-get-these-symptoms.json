There are more combos, you just need to do the math.\u00a0\u00a0This will be a trial and error process and of course will take a lot of time and patience, but well worth it when you hit the right dose.As far as the fainting episodes, is not my forte'.\u00a0\u00a0You might go to the Doctor Thyroid Forum and ask Dr. Lupo athttp://www.medhelp.org/forums/show/120\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ORList at right of main page, 3 down just below \"Community Members\", titled \"Related Expert Forums\"Diabetes - Adult Type II and Thyroid, click on \"thyroid\" it will take you to the forum.ORGo to the Medical and Health list of Doctor-to-Patient or\u00a0\u00a0Patient to Patient Forums at:http://www.medhelp.org/forums.htmand choose a forum that fits your condition and/or needs.If you have posted more than one post per the sites rules for doctors forums, you probably won't get answered.\u00a0\u00a0Or if the forum is full and not taking any more questions for the day, you can try another day.Good luck and Best of health!",

    "question": "I had a bad crash 6 years ago and became hypothyroid from the whiplash apparently. It took almost a year to diagnose because my symptoms are backwards. I was dropping weight like crazy and lost 70 pounds in 9 months. When I get low, I get anxious and feel shaky. I also get EXTREME large intestine pain. The lower left side of my gut especially. When low, I feel like I am living on adrenaline and can't sleep. I have been tested and yes, I truly am low. When I get the meds right, I feel fine. If I get a bit high thyroid, I get similar symptoms except no gut pain and added heart racing all the time. Even more fun is that I am VERY sensitive to the thyroid hormone and I MUST take it at night or I can't sleep. If I take it during the day, I get all edgy and hyper and sweat like a pig. It's like I only need it at night for some reason. If I take 66 I get hyper and at 62.5 I get sluggish and feel low and lousy. How can I split the difference with such small tablets? I can't accurately get 2 mcgs. out of the tablets I have.Now the fun part... I just started having fainting episodes and when I come out of it, after 10 seconds I get room spins for 10 seconds. Now that is a fun ride! NOT! I just got out of the hospital after a three day stay and they ran every test they can think of. My blood sugars was fine at the time and I actually had an episode at the hospital where I was hooked to the monitors and my heart didn't skip or slow or speed up and my blood pressure was slightly high (140/105). I was NOT moving at all and had been stationary for 1/2 hour or more. They did cat scans, MRI and MRA scans, heart scans and a treadmill stress test followed by more heart scans. All were normal. The only thing they found was slight sinusitis in the right side and some slight blood and heavy wax build up in the left ear. They gave me something for motion sickness and it seems to have helped keep the episodes away but I still feel like garbage.Please help me.",
