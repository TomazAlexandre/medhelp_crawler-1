            "answer": "Hmm, your liver may be partly responsible for your inability to lose weight, but not likely, unless you have liver disease or any factor which affects liver function.I would say that estrogen dominance is a moresuspicious and this alone would explain the tendency togain weight (and potentially leading to other serious chronic illness).Avoiding phytoestrogenic foods, plastics, stress, estrogen- loaded contraceptives (if female-your profile states male).Do follow a diet which includes insoluble fiber, take probiotics daily of the highest quality you can afford,get a bioidentical progesterone cream and apply daily(vary the part of the body constantly) and consider gettingliver function testing.The other possibility would be sluggish thyroid function, but beware the standard thyroid tests only test for serum levels of thyroid hormones and NOT thyroid function.The recommended tests for thyroid function are Free T3,Free T4 and Reverse T3. This way thyroid resistance or type 2 hypothyroidism can be ruled out 100%.I hope this helps.Best wishes,Niko",

    "question": "I am a little stuck with my dieting.All my life I have noticed that if I eat a larger than a serving (palm sized meal) I can't lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0I've done all the tests for diabetes several times in life and it seems that I don't have diabetes at all.\u00a0\u00a0(Type 1 or 2).I can verify that standard sized meals (what most people can eat) will prevent me from losing weight.\u00a0\u00a0That's a mystery.... But...I recently cam to understand that a taxed liver can cause weight gain if you rush it by eating too much at once.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe it's the flow of nutrients in my blood stream which it can't handle and that tends to lead to fat storage.\u00a0\u00a0I also suffer from what is probably high estrogen levels as I'm a mad who collects allot of fat on his chest.\u00a0\u00a0My father did too and he didn't live very long.Even though I don't drink (but my father did) and don't smoke and eat healthy, could I have inherited a condition where my liver may function less than optimal?\u00a0\u00a0 Can anyone help me understand this?Thanks",
