            "answer": "Hello,Itchy crawling skin can be due to neurodermatitis or parasthesia skin. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have had this itching crawling sensation since 2000, when I use to use a tanning bed. It starts in mid summer and progressingly gets worse as the warmer month come. It happens when I get wet, work out, sweat, just lying in bed to name a few. It lasts anywhere from 10 - 30 minutes and is so extreme that i can't focus on any thing else and I do with all my power not to scratch cause that only makes it last longer and the sensation worse. It used to effect my entire body, legs, arms, butt, back, chest, stomach, and shoulders. It now only effects my back, shoulders, chest and stomach more then anything. This summer it has been at it's best and at it's worse. I've tried everything, from anti fungal creams, anti itch creams, lotions, dye and frangrance free soaps, detergents, tried medicated powders. I have yet to see a professional cause I'm worried it will be a waste of my time cause it just plainly seems like I'm nuts. And when this sensation begins it is so bad that it looks like I am freaking out. my muscles tense up and I suffer and there has been nothing I can do that I have found. Also there is no rashes no bumps, red marks or any signs other then when i do scratch it, it will turn red in the areas that I scratch. My girlfriend is really worried about it as am myself. Please give any recommendations of a specific doctor I should see or other things I should consider. I know you can't give advice legally, but just want some where to start and get this out of my life.",
