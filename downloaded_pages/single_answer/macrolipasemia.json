            "answer": "Hello,I have the same problem as yours. My amylase though is a little bit elevated, otherwise everything else is normal. My lipase has been elevated for 3 months now. It started as 2000+, and the lowest was 129. It is starting to creep up again. I feel stomach discomforts but I coulndn't say that it's actually painful. Just concenring and annoying. I am still on a hit and miss with my diet but because of this development I decided to stick to fruits, veggies and liquids to give my pancreas a rest. My doctor also mentioned Macrolipasemia. I have an upcoming test still apart from a battery of tests already done, and that is MRI with secritin to check how my pancreas functions once the medication is injected. My concern though is the damage that persistent elevated lipase would cause my pancreas eventually. I hope anyone out there who has the same experience could share some light to us still looking for answers.",

    "question": "High lipase of 2900 over 2 months ago. I don't drink alchohol, smoke. No diabetes, excellent cholesterol level, and blood pressure is excellent 107/68. I am 5'8\" and weigh 180. I am very active. In July of this year I was hospitalized for 5 days on an IV and NBM (nothing by mouth) with lipase over 2900. Upon discharge my lipase was 2245. The lowest my lipase has been during the past 6 weeks has been 399. Recently it went up again to 499. I've been watching my diet with plenty of salads (lemon juice instead of dressing), fruits, vegetables very little meat (no red meat, no butter, no gravy, nada). Lipase is still 449. I have had a complete body scan, two cat scans, ultrasound, xray of chest. Nothing. My doctor has labeled this macrolipasemia. No other explanation other than this could be a baseline for me. Never heard of this before. Has anyone else? My father died in 1962 of some type of intestional blockage. We never knew what caused it. He was very healthy as well and suddenly developed this pain in his stomach. Within a few days he died.",
