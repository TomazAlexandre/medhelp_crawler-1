    "question": "I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes over 17 years ago and then again 1995. I did great with my new diet, monitoring my blood sugars, and taking my insulin. I had 2 healthy (just over 7 pounds) babies as a result. I was diagnosed with type 2 in early 1996. I have been on Glucophage and Glipezide. At one point last year I was put on Byetta but it only made me nauseous and quit after 28 days. My PCP, who also has diabetes, has tried to help with my crazy high sugars (last A1C was 10.6) but the last few years have gone to one endo MD after another...the last one spent under 10 mins with me. I am tired of being treated like white trash and going away feeling more down than when I went in. (Due to much stress in my life I have been on anti-depressants for 16+ years now). I am beyond tired 24/7 now and feel totally disfunctional in all areas of my life. BTW...I am now also on cholesterol lowering medication and suspect my thyroid is now outta whack but cannot seem to get my PCP to order ALL the thyroid blood test. I AM DESPARATELY LOOKING FOR A D.O. IN SW FLORIDA WHO IS WILLING TO SPEND TIME WITH ME AND BE OPEN TO ALTERNATIVES TO THE DRUGS I HAVE BEEN ON FOR SO LONG. Though I am now searching...if anyone out there knows of one...please let me know. I am so over my disease being 'swept under the drug'. I lost my dad in 1987 at age 48 from horrible complications from diabetes...blind, lost limbs, kidney transplant...I am a 46 year old mom who is sick and tired of being sick and tired...my family needs me......",
