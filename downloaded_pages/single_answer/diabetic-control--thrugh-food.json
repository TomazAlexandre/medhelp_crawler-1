            "answer": "Diabetes Type I and Diabetes Type II are diseases.\u00a0\u00a0When you have Type I diabetes your pancreas no longer produces insulin.\u00a0\u00a0The only way to maintain good health is to inject insulin, carefully monitor blood sugar, and eat a healthy balanced diet.\u00a0\u00a0Type II Diabetes is different because the body still produces insulin, but has a harder time using it efficiently.\u00a0\u00a0Type II Diabetics usually maintain their illness with food plans and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Some Type II take pills and sometimes have to take insulin injections as well.I have read nothing about Brewers Yeast and am always extremely leery of things that say they can lower blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0A well balanced food plan and regular exercise are two of the best things you can do for maintaining good health and lower blood sugar.",
