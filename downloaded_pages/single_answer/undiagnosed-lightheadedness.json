            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of his symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include hypoglycemia, hyper/ hypotension, dehydration, micronutrient deficiencies, anxiety/ stress, hormonal/ endocrine/ metabolic issues, primary cranial headaches such as tension headaches, cranial neuralgias etc. I am not sure what all have you been evaluated for in the list, though I would suggest considering an initial evaluation by an internist and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, ut can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
