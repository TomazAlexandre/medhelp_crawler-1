    "question": "My 12yr old daughter has been having keytones daily even without high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0She hasn't lost any weight it isn't dieting or starvation.\u00a0\u00a0Her keytones range from Moderate to trace but have rarely been negative in the last month.\u00a0\u00a0She had Mono 6 months ago then strep.\u00a0\u00a0She struggled with high sugars w/ occasional keytones through the illness.\u00a0\u00a0She was feeling better for 3-4 weeks then began having severe fatigue, trouble with concentration/memory, muscle pain, nausea, dizzy and headaches.\u00a0\u00a0We first noticed keytones with a high sugar reading, but as we treated for it the keytones were slow to lower.\u00a0\u00a0She still had small keytones the next morning with normal sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Her sugar control has been good and doesn't seem to closely relate to the keytone level.\u00a0\u00a0It isn't the flu and the pediatric diabetes team doesn't know what to make of it.\u00a0\u00a0She doesn't have celiac, thyroid problems or anything that basic blood tests can detect.\u00a0\u00a0Her Dr. is still trying to rule out causes.\u00a0\u00a0She's missing a lot of school and can barely function.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone heard of this type of problem?\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions on specialists that might help us?",
