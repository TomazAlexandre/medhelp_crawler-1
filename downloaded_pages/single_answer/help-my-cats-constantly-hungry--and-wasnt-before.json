    "question": "Hi,I have a male cat around 7or 8 years old. He is new to our home since June this year. He has always been a bit aloof but likes being petted, only when he wants. He is an outdoor cat.He used to eat wet food, but would not eat all of it (1/2 can of small Friskies) I would supplement with a little dry food. He would stop eating and run away if someone walked past him.We had to go away for 2 week to visit a sick relative, we left both our cats with a friend who's 10 year old son feed them both. They were not allowed out for obvious reasons.Now we have them back he is fatter and seems hungry all the time, I give him the 1/2 can and he gobbles it all down, never used to do this and he always wants more. He even sniffs the floor for food like a drug addict! He wants more attention now, but he is going out.We am very worried about\u00a0\u00a0him, could it been stress/depression or medical like roundworms or diabetes?It's has only been a week should we wait and control his diet and see if he calms down or take him to the vet.",
