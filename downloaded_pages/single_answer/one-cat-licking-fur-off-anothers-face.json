            "answer": "awwww, I'm so sorry to hear that :(at first I thought it was affection b/c Princess and Jester always lick each other (mom and daughter)... I also thought that maybe Harry is getting bald spots from something else and Toby is just trying to help. But if Toby is CAUSING the bald spots on Harry then I would take them both to the vet... or you could try the \"Ask the Expert\" Forum for pets?? I hope all goes well with your little fellas - let me know how it turns out",

    "question": "My oldest cat, Toby, has been licking my younger ones face, causing bald areas and sores.\u00a0\u00a0I do my best to keep them separated, but they like to sleep together.\u00a0\u00a0Toby also likes to lick me a lot, but I don't let him because it hurts me.\u00a0\u00a0He was diagnosed with diabetes last November and is currently receiving insulin injections twice daily.\u00a0\u00a0When it does happen, I clean the licked area with water and then dry it thoroughly.\u00a0\u00a0Although I tried putting antibiotic ointment on Harry's face (he's the younger cat that is being licked), of course that caused him to try to get it off, resulting in further irritation of the already tender area.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has any suggestions or opinions on why this is happening, or how to stop it, I'd really appreciate it, and so would Harry!",
