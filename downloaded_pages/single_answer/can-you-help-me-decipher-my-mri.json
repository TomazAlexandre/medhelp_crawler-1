Small vessel ischemic changes on MRI usually suggest chronic diseases affecting blood vessels causing their narrowing and consequent ischemia. These are hypertension and diabetes, and increase the risk of a stroke. Usually these changes are seen in small vessels supplying blood to the junction of brain cells and neurons. These changes could be an affect of aging, migraine headaches, and hypercholesterolemia also. Gliosis is seen when there is damage in the central nervous system, usually proliferation of astrocytes. Since you have headaches clinically, and the small vessel ischemic changes in brain could be due to hypertension or migraine causing the subcortical gliosis. There are other specific causes of subcortical causes also and is seen in neurodegenerative disorders like alzheimer\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis, however, need to be correlate clinically. Consult your physician for these symptoms and the management of primary diseases could decelerate these changes. Wish you all the very best. Take care.",

No recent infarct, abnormal parenchymal enhancement, intracranial mass lesion, or mass effect. can anyone help me understand what the first half of this means?",
