            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The symptoms at least do not point towards a brain tumor. You appear to be very stressed out. Try yoga and meditation. It will help. Tinnitus can be stress related and so also forgetfulness and a feeling that you are going to faint. TMJ could be another cause.There are many medical causes for tinnitus. Look into them if stress has been ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0Exposure to loud noise or vibrations may also cause tinnitus.Other possible causes of tinnitus have their origin in either your ear, or auditory nerve (which carries signals from your inner ear to your brain), infections, side-effects of medicines (aspirin, quinine, some antibiotics etc) you have taken or because of problems with your jaw or teeth. These include: M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, otosclerosis, middle ear infections,\u00a0\u00a0 acoustic neuroma, wax in your ear canal and TMJ. Please consult an ENT specialist.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
