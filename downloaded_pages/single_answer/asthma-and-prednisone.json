            "answer": "You should be weaned off the prednisone, reducing the dose by 10 mg a day. That being said, many physicians don't sonsider \"weaning\" significant., so it isn't malpractice. Let's say there are potential problems when you don't \"wean\". As you know prednisone affects glucose levels. Suggest to your physician you want to try Foradil Aerolizer (formoterol fumarate inhalation powder) to control your asthma. It gives excellent results without racing the heart.",

    "question": "Hi everyone,I am a 21 year old male with type 1 diabetes and occasional asthma.\u00a0\u00a0I was recently in the emergency room because of 5 days of shortness of breath that progressively got worse.\u00a0\u00a0After going through several tests and a CAT Scan of my chest to see if I had a blood clot in my lungs the doctor said I just had severe asthma from something (allergies?).\u00a0\u00a0I stayed the night at the hospital while they treated me with Prednisone, through an IV, Albuterol mixed with something else, and Ativan, because I told the doctor my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest from my high heart rate.\u00a0\u00a0They gave me intensive asthma treatment of Prednisone and Albuterol mixed with something else for the time I spent there.\u00a0\u00a0I never got any sleep the night I spent there. The following day, after the nurse gave me Prednisone and Ativan through the IV, I fell asleep for a short while until the phone rang and I freaked out, jumped out of bed and ripped the IV cord from the machine giving me liquids.\u00a0\u00a0Blood was dripping out of the IV and one of the NA's came in and took my IV out. I guess the PA said I could go home shortly anyways.ANYWAYS, I have been prescribed Prednisone for 5 days, 40mg a day.\u00a0\u00a0I have had higher blood sugars, chest pain, pressure, sore sides, sore back, bloated stomach, diarrhea, and I am urinating all the time.\u00a0\u00a0This Prednisone also gives me a high heart rate especially when I use the Albuterol.\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully my neighbor is a PA and gave me some Xopenex samples from her office which doesn't race my heart as much as Albuterol because it's already racing enough with this steroid.I have heard weening off of Prednisone is better.\u00a0\u00a0So when day 5 comes around and I take my last 40mg of Prednisone will that cause any problems or should I ask my doctor to ween me off this more gradually?Thank you!-Rob",
