    "question": "I am just a concerned daughter writting about her dad. You see he's a thirty eight year old going on to thirty nine. He has a case of high blood pressure level. He drinks a lot of water and eats a lot of chocolate. I haven't noticed that he doesn't have to go to the bathroom a lot, though. I've obviously did some research on this. He gives blood once a month, that probably doesn't have anything to do with it but just incase. When he gets some tests back for his blood pressure it showed he had a very low glucose level. He won't go see a doctor and when I tell him he has some symptoms he won't ask his doctor about it, he just gets mad. I've noticed that he drinks a lot of water. I think that he might have diabetes type two if he does have diabetes. He's lost a lot of wait so far this year. I'm very concerned. Should I be? Or am I just concerned about nothing? Should I enforce him going to see the doctor more? I really don't know and need help! I'm very concerned about my father. He seems like he may have diabetes. PLEASE HELP ME!",
