            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If no neurological cause for pain in the arm is found like a pinched nerve, get a color dopplar to rule out a clot in blood vessel (either thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis). It can also be due to inflammation of the muscles or myositis or even muscle injury. Other than that, get a nerve conduction velocity test to know if there is any nerve compression. Metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism and low calcium could also be a cause and hence get this checked. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been experiencing chronic pain on my\u00a0\u00a0right arm just below the shoulder. Almost feels like I pulled a muscle, but I haven't done anything to have done that. The pain actually started when I took a far on slick ice.\u00a0\u00a0I did not fall on my arm, but actually my back, which I am experiencing pain usually towards the afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0And my husband felt a knot just below the midline.\u00a0\u00a0Could this possibly have something to do with having pain on my arm?",
