            "answer": "Hi!One possibility is yeast infection. Vaginal yeast infection which can be brought about by antibiotics, birth control pills, pregnancy, menstruation, condom use, sexual intercourse, diabetes, and a weakened immune system. Usually there is a thick curd like discharge with it which may or may not be evident externally. Herpes and\u00a0\u00a0trichomoniasis (STD) and bacterial vaginosis are the other possibilities. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
