            "answer": "The pediatric endo is your best bet.\u00a0\u00a0You could also call around and see if there is an adult endo who takes peds (and is a specialist in thyroids).\u00a0\u00a0You could also try an ENT to get her started on meds and run additional tests.You could also post this question to the \"expert\" area of the site under pediatric endocrinology.It's frustrating, I know.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter had thyroid problems and my son had diabetes problems.\u00a0\u00a0Good pediatric endos are few and far between (finally ended taking my daughter to *my* endo for thyroids).",

    "question": "My daughter has had \"high\" thyroid tests for over a year now.\u00a0\u00a0Her pediatrician kept telling me it \"wasn't off enough to make much difference\".\u00a0\u00a0However, we've started noticing symptoms other than the weight gain and sluggishness we initially took her in for. She has awoke several mornings with a puffy face and neck, she has keratosis pilaris (skin condition), her dentist says her xrays are unchanged over a period of two years and that her dental progress is definately delayed. Our pediatrician suggested that she wasn't eating right, so we have visited a dietician, I've kept food journals and make sure she gets excercise and she is still gaining.\u00a0\u00a0I finally called in December for a referal to a pediatric endocrinologist, It will be May before we can get in.\u00a0\u00a0I keep calling, but there are no openings at the children's clinic in Nashville. .There are no pediatric endos in Bowling Green Ky,where we live.\u00a0\u00a0Is not being able to see the DR for nearly 6 months after noticing the worst of the symptoms going to be damaging to her in anyway?Any information or suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated.",
