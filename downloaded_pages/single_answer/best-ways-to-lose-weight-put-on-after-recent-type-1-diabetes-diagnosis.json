            "answer": "Reducing your carb intake will both help control your blood sugars, reduce your insulin needs and help you lose weight. That in addition to the exercise routine which you have already gotten down should help you slowly (best way) get back to a healthy weight. If you are still having trouble losing, you might want to eat less fat, but it's hard to do both low carbs and low fat. Just be sure if you lower your carbs significantly to make sure you lower your insulin doses so you don't go low. Hopefully you have already learned your Insulin:Carb ratio to dose your bolus and don't just do a set dose which is a sure way to gain weight because you are eating to the insulin rather than the reverse.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed a little over 6 months ago. My fasting sugars were in the 600's and my A1C was 16.3 (alarming). I lost a great deal of weight during this time. While I was super skinny, I do understand it was a sickly skinny, not healthy. Before all of this happened I was always a very lean and tiny girl weighing 118lbs at my heaviest (im 5'4). I put on about thirty pounds after it all was said and done, and I am now 140lbs. I have been working out almost 5-6 times each week (running for 35 minutes and doing weights). Ive been doing this on and off now for a while and have recently gotten my sugars back under control. Im just trying to figure out if I am still in my \"honeymoon\" phase and if my body is still getting used to the insulin and how long this may last, or what are my best options for getting back to my normal self, or is that even possible? I would love any suggestions for a diet or workout to really focus on as well!",
