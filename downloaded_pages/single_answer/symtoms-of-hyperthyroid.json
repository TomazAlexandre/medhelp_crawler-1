    "question": "Dear Doctor,I am a 52 year old male married with 2 young children and my wife and I have a good life and good jobs.For the last 6 months I have been experiencing, bad anxiety, digestive problems, sweating, waking out of sleep from sweating, irritability, loss of weight, loss of appetite, dizziness when getting up, heart palpitations, head feels in the clouds.I have had all the test performed for the digestive problem, upper and lower colonoscopy, MRI, CT scan, barium drink for upper GI, even swallowed a capsule camera to take pictures of my upper intestines from the inside had stress test for heart, ekgs. It all came back OK.A friend of mine told me that the Thyroid can throw your body all out of whack and could be creating these symptoms I am having and it is known as Hyperthyroidism. I called my doctor and asked if I could get a test for my Thyroid and he said sure and I went and got a blood test a couple days ago. No results yet.Both the doctors I am dealing with (one GP and the other GI specialist) have given me Effexor the anti depressant. The only depression I have is from not knowing what is going on with my health. I really don't want to go on something like Effexor which I read has many bad side effects until I am sure they can't find anything at all. It is real frustrating and in the medical industry today everything takes so long to check out. I need to be able to function for my family and my job.My question to you is, from the symptoms I stated above could this be Thyroid related in your opinion. I don't have a great family history for my mother died at 56 from cancer and my father died young from diabetes. Almost all of my father\u2019s family side have passed on and I don\u2019t know their history. My mother\u2019s side is also pretty thin and mostly lives in Germany with a language barrier.You\u2019re so kind to offer this site!Your opinions and answers are greatly appreciated.",
