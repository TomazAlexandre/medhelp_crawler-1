    "question": "Hi, I'm expecting baby number 2 but I feel like I'm brand new at this with being diagnosed with gestational diabetes since I didn't have it with my first. I'm 35+2 and have been having lots of pressure in my pelvic region. To the point where I have to stop what I'm doing. Could this be a sign if baby coming before my due date? I don't remember having this with my first either and he came on his due date",
