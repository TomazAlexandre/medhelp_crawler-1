    "question": "I had unprotected sex approimately 6 weeks ago (12/6/09). The encounter was short but still unprotected. About 7 days later - i developed a white coating on my tongue. I noticed it while brushing my teeth early that morning. The first thing that came to mind was thrush and my intial thought was that it came from consistent and repeated daily overuse of hydrogen peroxide as a mouthwash. Just a thought. I had just started this and I was performing this the week prior to my sexual encounter everyday about 4 times a day. I thought, maybe it was destroying the good bacteria in my mouth - after rinsing with this my tongue would be coated. So since I self diagnosed myself as it being thrush - I searched on the internet to find out how to get rid of it - but instead found that people infected with HIV get oral thrush and it could be a first symptom. I freaked out. I then went to the emergency room to get an accurate diagnois - and it was in fact oral thrush. I'm currently swishing and swollowing Nystatin since 12/22/09 to help the thrush. In additon to oral thrush, my lymph nodes in my neck and groin area were swollen, i believe i have a mild case of vaginal yeast infection as well, i also began to have headaches and muscle aches. I've been under stress and anxiety because of this. I have not had any fevers nor can I recall any flu-like symptoms or night sweats. Please help!! Does having oral thrush mean i've been infected. I've had no previous antibiotics, no known diabetes. How long does it take oral thrush to show up in HIV + individuals? I'm so scared!!",
