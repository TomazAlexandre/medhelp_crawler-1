He also keeps the typed notes in my paper files for later consideration, if necessary.",

    "question": "I have been dealing with\u00a0\u00a0metabolic syndrome, taking clonidine and hyzaar for blood pressure; tricor and zetia for cholesterol; and metformin for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Metformin (glucophage) doubled me over w/pain and doctor switched me to januvia, at my request.\u00a0\u00a0I decided to take myself off the tricor and kept taking Zetia and 900 mg of Pantethine a day, kept taking the clonidine and changed the hyzaar for cozaar.\u00a0\u00a0This was over a nine month period.\u00a0\u00a0The pantethine was presumably for the lipid issues, my HDL went from 55 in Feb. to 59 in Dec. My LDL wemt from 94 in Feb to 141 in Dec.\u00a0\u00a0Worst of all my ALT went from 22 to 103 from the time I began taking the pantethine in Sept.I read everything I could find, nothing seems to associate elevated liver enzymes with pantethine.\u00a0\u00a0To the contrary, pantethine is offered as a possible way to treat high ALTI do wonder why there are very few up to date studies of pantethine.\u00a0\u00a0Did it become unfashionable as an alternative to\u00a0\u00a0treat lipidemia, or did I miss something somewhere.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor has told me to stop taking it, and has told me to stop taking anything for cholesterol.( I am apparently allergic to statin drugs)\u00a0\u00a0What next?\u00a0\u00a0I can't fit all my thought into my allotted time with the doctor",
