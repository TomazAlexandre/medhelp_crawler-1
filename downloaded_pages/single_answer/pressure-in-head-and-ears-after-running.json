    "question": "Hi,I have been running for over ten years - between three and five miles every evening. My health is fine otherwise, but lately, when I am resting after a run, I get an incredible pressure in my head and ears. It is not painful at all, just intense pressure and quite frightening. Any ideas what may be the cause or why the sudden occurence? I feel like my head will explode!",
