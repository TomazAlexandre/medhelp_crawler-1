    "question": "I have hypertension that started as \"white coat\" in nature and has progressed to chronic. It used to be that my BP would be a little elevated in the clinic but normal at home.\u00a0\u00a0Now it's high even when I check it at home.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like there's a very strong \"stress response\" component to my HTN, as I have a strong physiologic response to stress at times (for example, when I go in for a doctor visit, I have palpitations and get sweaty palms as soon as they start coming at me with the blood pressure cuff).\u00a0\u00a0In fact, in the past I've been treated for anxiety disorder.\u00a0\u00a0So I have 3 questions:1. I know beta blockers are not typically used as first-line agents, but I'm wondering if I should give it a try in my case?2. What are the long-term effects of beta blockers (I've read beta blockers + diuretics may increase risk of diabetes type 2)?3. Should I go with a cardioselective or nonselective beta blocker, or does it matter?(I have no personal or family history of diabetes and no lung disease.)Thanks!",
