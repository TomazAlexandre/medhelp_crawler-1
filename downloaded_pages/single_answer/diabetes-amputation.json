            "answer": "Hi,I am sorry your father and your family went through such a traumatizing experience, but glad he was able to recover. Any surgery is very serious, and amputations in the setting of diabetes often happen in individuals with other health issues due to diabetes. So recovery form surgery is often more difficult and complications can be common.\u00a0\u00a0Reactions to the medications, heart problems, blood pressure problems, glucose being too high/low and infection are only some of the issues that may have caused your father's complications.I am very glad he is on the road to recovery. All the best.",
