            "answer": "I'm so glad to hear that everything is going well with your little one! Hope your blood pressure turns out to be a non-issue soon. I think the fact that a high risk OB doesn't think much of it is promising! I haven't had issues with high/low blood pressure but am kind of struggling with the thought that I may develop gestational diabetes. I failed the 1hr test. :(But let's try to remain positive, as long as the babies are okay, all is good. :)REST, REST, REST! Take care.",

    "question": "I just posted four new pics from yesterday's ultrasound! Jack is now 21 weeks 4 days and things are looking good.My blood pressure has been up, so they put me on bed rest for 4 days. I'm already so bored.Right now it's just mild hypertension but it's something they're keeping a close eye on. I'm on a BP medication (the second day of it) and hopefully that'll do the trick. My OB had me really worried but I saw a \"high risk\" doctor yesterday just to be checked out and he didn't seem to think I was high risk at all. It's confusing.I don't have protein in my urine or any other pre-eclempsia red flags (besides headaches but we all get those right?) so hopefully that is something this will not turn into.Anyhow, that's my update. The baby looks great, is a great size and everything so I'm just going to listen to the doctor and hope this BP thing levels out.Anyone else have BP issues in pregnancy???Heather",
