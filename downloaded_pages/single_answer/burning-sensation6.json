            "answer": "Hi!After undergoing an operative procedure on an operating table, this burning sensation on both legs can be due to either deep vein thrombosis or due to pinched nerves in lower back. It is urgent to rule out deep vein thrombosis as this can result in clots lodging into heart, brain or lungs. The burning sensation due to pinched nerves can be corrected by using a heating pad in lower back, rubbing in a muscle relaxant and by physiotherapy. However, you need a doctor to look into this. A third possibility is a peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes which can get aggravated by surgery. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
