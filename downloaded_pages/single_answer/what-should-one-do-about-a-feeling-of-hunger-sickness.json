            "answer": "You should see a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe a gastroenterologist who could be able to help you.When you're experiencing these symptoms, it could be wise to eat on time.\u00a0\u00a0Eat on a schedule, do not starve, do not over eat, and do not go to bed hungry or on a full stomach.I had very high insulin levels because I have issues with Lyme disease also my work would lead me to starve myself, and then over eat, and then sleep.\u00a0\u00a0It really screwed up my whole body and now I have diabetes and screwed up insulin levels.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, doctors don't test for high insulin, only blood sugar.You need help.\u00a0\u00a0Over time the acid coming up from your stomach (called GERD)\u00a0\u00a0will cause the esophagus to be irritated and erode and can cause a condition called Barrett's syndrome which can lead to cancer.My mom has that same issue, and she would sleep and wake up coughing and choking as the acid would enter into her lungs.You may want to sleep on a wedge to keep the acids from sneaking into your lung or esophagus while you sleep.\u00a0\u00a0You may not have coughing, but may feel a little heart burn.\u00a0\u00a0Seriously need to see a doctor, because it can become a slow chronic issue that lead to bigger problems later on.",

    "question": "When I get hungry, such as late at night or if I have not eaten breakfast yet and have been up for a long time (although at other times too), I get a feeling probably best described as 'hunger sickness'. I feel sick in my throat and very hungry for 5 minutes to an hour, and the sick feeling will spread to my stomach over time. I may get stomach pain and acid in the back of my mouth, and feel as though I will throw up. However, if I eat something, almost anything at all (although healthy food works better for me because too much unhealthy food at a time makes me feel ill) the feeling goes away, although comes back if I do not eat for a prolonged period of time afterwards.What I would like to know (I don't necessarily expect answers to all of these):- Why does this happen? (I know everyone gets hungry, but why like this?)- Can I stop the sick feeling without eating something?- Is this normal? (Does it occur to others, that is).Note: This cannot be anything to do with pregnancy, etc... because I am not of the appropriate age for such things. I",
