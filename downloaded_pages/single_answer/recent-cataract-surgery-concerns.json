    "question": "Recently, I had an IOL for distance placed in my left eye. Surgery went well with one major concern. My surgeon never discussed focal length with me even though on first appointment I was told it would be discussed later. While on the gurney for surgery I finally brought it up and he said it was a monofocal for distance. (discussion and questions followed). I am disabled and my world revolves around my desk here in my home with a radius of 4 feet or less (95% of waking hours). I drive maybe 1% of the time.\u00a0\u00a0When I, after surgery contacted the doctor he said he defaulted to distance because I am diabetic. He never discussed that with me. My bother's doctor says focal length should not matter due to diabetes. My retinas are in great shape. Why was I not consulted regarding focal length? I am just very upset now and am wondering about an \"IOL Exchange\" operation which I guess I will have to pay for. I apologize for the length of this 'question'. Thank you.",
