    "question": "Lately my husband, who has diabetes II, has been cheating on his diet, which is somewhat unusual for him. Also in the evening he has been getting hypoglycemic and needs a sugar fix. He saw his doctor yesterday and she is pleased his readings and told him to lower one of his medications.I take ashwagandha for cortisol control. My husband started taking it also a month or so ago. It was tonight that I made the connection. In researching ashwandha some time ago I remember reading that it was used to normalize insulin. Is there anybody on this forum who has experience using the herb to control diabetes. If so, how much do you take and when do you take it? I would appreciate any advice you can give.",
