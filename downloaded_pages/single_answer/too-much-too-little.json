            "answer": "Hello,What you are having is an erectile dysfunction. The causes are many like diabetes, depression, autonomic nervous system problem, excessive alcohol ingestion or tobacco smoking etc. You may need to consult your doctor to see which amongst these causes are responsible for your problem. The commonly prescribed drug by the doctors is sildenafil, which causes erections to be stronger and long lasting. But it is not safe to take this drug without doctor\u2019s advise.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
