            "answer": "Hi,Thank you for writing on behalf of your husband. This is indeed a serious situation, and puts both your husband and other people at risk. It is common for people to develop what is called \"hypoglycemic unawareness\" after having diabetes for a long time and recurrent lows--their bodies get used to being low so the usual alarms do not go off anymore. It is extremely dangerous because very low levels can happen without warning and lead to passing out or seizures.Please continue to stress to your husband how serious this is and that harm can come to him and others. If he continues to ignore the warnings, you may need to get assistance from his doctor or other family members to take a strong stand(possibly take his license away), because this could become very very serious.take care.",
