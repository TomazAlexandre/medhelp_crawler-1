    "question": "For about two years now I experience tremors that spread throughout my body, from my chest to my arms and legs and neck. It's almost as if I'm shivering uncontrollably. It happens when I get tired or nervous or upset usually, and sometimes when winding down from something. I'm 19 years old, healthy weight and diet and whatnot. I've been tested for diabetes and recently for Lupus due to a number of symptoms and my grandmother having it, but it was negative. I have solar urticaria, but it's doubtful anything has to do with that.My doctor excused the tremors as not having enough symptoms to be anything. But they are something I'd like an answer to. Should I check with a neurologist? Or could it be something simple?Thank you for any help :)",
