            "answer": "Your sinuses are fine...which means they have ruled out sinus infection...but it means that the pain is from elsewhere ( the migraines).The scattered T2 is normal...it just means that there is air spaces ( for lack of better wording ).The \" incidental note is made...anterior clinoids\" means they are looking to see if you may have or may develop an aneurysm.\u00a0\u00a0They sometimes get a false reading if your skull bones/nodules are in the way. If you have larger bones/nodules on your skull it can interfere with proper readings.Hence the \"incidental note\" as it is not a diagnosis, but rather a \"let's keep an eye on this\" statement.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I am a 54yo woman who recently had\u00a0\u00a0a cranial MRI on account of increasing frequency of migraines and persistent headaches for a month.\u00a0\u00a0The Findings were as follows:The ventricles and CSF spaces are normal for age . Diffusion-weighted imaging is normal. There is no evidence for haemorrhage, demyelination, ischaemia or mass. A few scattered T2 hyperintensities in the supratentorial white matter are non-specific but likely to represent minor microvascular ischaemic change. There is no surface collection. The craniocervical relationships are normal.Incidental note is made of asymmetric pneumatisation of the anterior clinoids. The orbits and\u00a0\u00a0paranasal sinuses are normal.Could you please tell me whether I should be concerned about the scattered T2 hyperintensities in the supratentorial white matter and/or the asymmetric pneumatisation of the anterior clinoids?I have had several DVTs in my calf during my lifetime, none of which could be attributed to any specific cause.\u00a0\u00a0I have normal blood pressure and don't have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I don't smoke or drink alcohol. Occasionally my vision blurs, particularly in the morning, but I have put this down to the ageing process.\u00a0\u00a0I wear glasses for reading.I'd appreciate your views.",
