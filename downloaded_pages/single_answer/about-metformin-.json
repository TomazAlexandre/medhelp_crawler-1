            "answer": "Metformin is used to treat type 2 diabetes and should be used along with exercise, a good diet, and weight control. Make sure you are eating foods(drinks too) that keep your blood sugar levels relatively stable, no high sugar sweets. If you have any concerns about this medication or what you should be doing, don't be afraid to call up your doctor and ask any questions you may have. That is what your doctor is there for(to help you), so make sure to talk to him or her. I don't know your medical history or anything, so talking to your doctor about all of this can greatly help you.",
