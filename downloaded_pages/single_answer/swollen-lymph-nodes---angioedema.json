            "answer": "Possible Gerd? Not sure, but how do you know it is swollen lymph nodes? Did they scan his throat? So many possibilities it is hard to say. If you are worried about lymphoma it is usually accompanied by many other symptoms. Google the side effects of the medications. Best thing would come from that appointment you made.",

    "question": "My husband was in the hospital for a stroke on May 9, 2008.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor prescribed a new BP medication called Enalapril 5mg x 2 day.\u00a0\u00a0Around 10 days after he came out of the hospital, he began complaining of his throat area being swollen.\u00a0\u00a0He also complained that it was more uncomfortable when he lied down.\u00a0\u00a0He has several other medical conditions and thought originally that the throat problem had to due with his bulging C6 and C7 which has caused him alot of back pain. He also has a\u00a0\u00a0history of kidney stones, gout (on medication ), diabetes Type II (on metaformin 1 per day) and of course high blood pressure. It has gotten to a poitn where he feels it is had to swollen.\u00a0\u00a0He is taking an Allevel at night in order to deal with the pain. I made an appointment with an ENT doctor for tomorrow morning. I am thinking he has had an allergic reaction from the medication\u00a0\u00a0because the symptoms began soon after the enalapril was prescribed.\u00a0\u00a0Any feedback or thoughts would be appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
