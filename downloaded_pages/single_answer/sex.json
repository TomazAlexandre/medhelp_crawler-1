    "question": "Me and my boyfriend are having issues regarding sex. He never hits my g-spot and I am just loosing my sex drive, I don't care I we have sex Anymore cuz what's the point he gets off and I'm left feeling like its just not worth it anymore, I love him and we h e tried lots of positions but nothing works for me and soo I bought myself a dildo because that's the only way I can have an orgasm. I'm taller the him and like 220lbs and he is a twig. Nothing works and idk what to do. We were just trying doggy style and he barely had it in there and already came. It's beginning to feel like a waste of time and condom. Help me idk what else to do!",
