            "answer": "Hi!On net it is very difficult to determine whether you have autoimmune hepatitis or not. For diagnosis you need to get liver function tests which will be grossly abnormal. Liver biopsy will show chronic hepatitis.\u00a0\u00a0Presence of anti-liver kidney microsome type 1 antibody (anti LKM-1), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and serum IgG confirms diagnosis.In autoimmune hepatitis the body attacks its own liver cells causing inflammation and destruction, and hence yes, it is a serious disease. It can eventually lead to scarring of liver and liver failure.However, if caught in time, it can be managed with steroids and other immune-modulator drugs and has a slow course spanning several years. Often other autoimmune diseases like diabetes, thyroiditis, nephritis, anemia, and ulcerative colitis co-exist. Do discuss in detail with your treating doctor. Take care!",
