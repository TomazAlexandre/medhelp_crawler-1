            "answer": "Hi!If there is a colic type of pain that makes the person roll in pain, then it can be either gall stones or kidney stones. In the former the pain is more in upper right side of abdomen and in latter it is in sides of abdomen or in lower abdomen. An ultrasound of the whole abdomen should be done. Other than this trapped gas can also cause similar pain.If there is fecal loading then your nephew would be suffering from constipation. Is this so?\u00a0\u00a0If yes, then causes of constipation will need to be looked into such as diet poor in roughage or fiber, dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. Please discuss with your doctor. Treating the cause will take care of pain. Something to control acidity will need to be taken along with diet high in fiber and water. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.
