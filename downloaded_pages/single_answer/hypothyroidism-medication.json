            "answer": "I found a great blog on this entitled My Hypothyroid Roller Coaster Ride that goes into a good list of reasons...\"The following all have supporting scientific references. (If you'd like any to show your doctor, just ask. Whether their pride will let them take a look is another matter..!)Time - It can take a while for your medication to kick in; anything from weeks to a whole year. You didn't get ill overnight - likewise you're not going to get better overnight!Dose - You may be under-medicated and need to be on a higher dose, despite what your blood tests say. Before the TSH test was invented, people increased their medication until they got better. The average dose used to a lot higher. The test has been proven to be a poor tool for assessing dosage. Its reference range is also far too wide.Fillers - You may be allergic to the fillers in your medication. Try a different brand. Don't mix two different brands.Conversion - Stress, depression, malnutrition, obesity, excessive exercise, iron deficiency, illness, and exposure to toxins and plastics can decrease conversion of T4 to T3, leading to reduced tissue and cellular thyroid levels. T3 or T3-containing medication is beneficial.Receptor resistance - Stress and illness contribute to the blocking of T3 from the cells. The exact mechanism isn't known but it's thought that the T4 converts to 'reverse T3', which blocks the receptors. A slow build-up of T3 medication is needed.Vitamins and minerals - If any of these are low, thyroid medication won't work properly: ferritin (iron), vitamin D3, vitamin B12, magnesium, folate, copper and zinc.Gluten sensitivity - There's a strong link between gluten intolerance and Hashimoto's. Standard tests are not sensitive enough to diagnose milder forms, though they can diagnose full-blown celiac disease. Other food allergies can also harm thyroid hormone uptake.Hormonal imbalances - Get your sex hormones tested. Oestrogen dominance and progesterone deficiency impairs the uptake of thyroid hormones.Mercury poisoning - Check with your dentist that you don't have amalgam fillings, because they can cause thyroid problems.\"",
