            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Therapy for aortic regurgitation is with medications, if not controlled with this surgical therapy is planned. Surgical therapy for aortic regurgitation is based on the clinical symptoms, left ventricular dilatation\u00a0\u00a0and Ejection fraction. The ejection fraction is a useful measure of left ventricular performance. The normal range is 63-77% for males and 55-75% for females. It reflects the pumping capacity of the heart. Left ventricular dilatation may be present. Next we should check to rule out if there is decreasing exercise tolerance on exercise stress testing. Based on the collective data therapy can be planned.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
