            "answer": "Hi,Cardiomyopathy may be due to any of the following: long-term high blood pressure, heart valve problems, heart tissue damage from a previous heart attack, chronic rapid heart rate, metabolic disorders, such as thyroid disease or diabetes, nutritional deficiencies, pregnancy, excessive use of alcohol, chemotherapy drugs, or certain viral infections. In your case, it is most likely due to the chemotherapy drugs.In particular, dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common type of cardiomyopathy. The left ventricle becomes enlarged and its pumping ability becomes less forceful, and blood does not flow as easily through the heart.\u00a0\u00a0Overtime, this resulted to congestive heart failure (CHF), wherein the heart can not pump enough blood to the body's other organs. As blood flow out of the heart slows, blood returning to the heart through the veins backs up, causing congestion in the tissues. This results to swelling or edema in the legs and ankles, or any part of the body. Sometimes fluid collects in the lungs and interferes with breathing, causing shortness of breath. It also affects other organs such as the kidneys which further increases the edema.Most people with mild and moderate congestive heart failure can be treated. Lifestyle modification, proper diet (less salt) and exercise, modified daily activities and medications such as ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, beta blockers, digitalis, diuretics or vasodilators are used to treat congestive heart failure. They perform different functions. It is highly recommended to have your weight checked daily and see if there is any increase which may be due to the fluid build up.ACE inhibitors and vasodilators expand blood vessels and decrease resistance. This allows blood to flow more easily and makes the heart's work easier or more efficient. Beta blockers can improve how well the heart's left ventricle pumps. Digitalis increases the pumping action of the heart, while diuretics help the body eliminate excess salt and water.Specific cause of congestive heart failure should be treated or, if possible, corrected. If there is an abnormal\u00a0\u00a0heart valve, the valve can be surgically replaced.If the heart becomes so damaged that it can't be repaired, a more drastic approach should be considered. A heart transplant could be an option.Discuss your worries and present state with your doctor and do not hesitate to ask if there are things that are not clear. He is there to help. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "HelloI was diagnosed with Moderate left ventricular enlargement with left ventricular hypertrophy with global hypokinesis; estimated left ventricular ejection fraction at 25-30% with diastolic dysfunction; moderate to severe mitral valve regurgitation & mild tricuspid valve regurgitation from the echocard. I had in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0My dr. mentioned congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy -- is that was all this means?\u00a0\u00a0All other valves, etc. appear normal.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just trying to determine how to explain it to my family and what it means and what my options are.\u00a0\u00a0Right now I'm on the normal medication for all this but he said if it doesn't work he would recommend a defibrillator.\u00a0\u00a0I read up on those and do not want to go that route.\u00a0\u00a0Any other options if the medication doesn't work?\u00a0\u00a0Again, please explain in layman's terms what I have and what the severity is.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much. (P.S. I had chemo for breast cancer and they said the 2 drugs (Herceptin and Adriamycin) most likely caused this.",
