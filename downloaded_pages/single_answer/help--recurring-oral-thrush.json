    "question": "I have had oral thrush 3 times in the past 3 months.I got an HIV test at the end of Februrary and ended up negative.Got a blood test and have normal blood sugar ( therefore not diabetic ).I know that the medical community doesn't believe in systemic candida unless they are diabetics or aids sufferers..\u00a0\u00a0but I'm suffering a host of other symptoms like depression and erectile dysfunction.After reading William Crook's book the yeast connection it could seem possible that yeast overgrowth in my intestine is causing all of this.I can't figure out why the thrush keeps coming back.I've taken nystatin twice.Now I am taking nystatin and diflucan.\u00a0\u00a0I hope everything goes well....",
