            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Since you have pain in the armpit, groin and testicles at one time or these are the areas that are affected, it is possible due to heat intolerance and due to sweat dermatitis.It is also possible due to peripheral artery disease. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, chemical burns due to any deo or lotions you use, peripheral nerve compression are the other possibilities.The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
