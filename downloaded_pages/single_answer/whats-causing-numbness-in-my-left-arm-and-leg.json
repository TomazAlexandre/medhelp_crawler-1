            "answer": "Hi,Numbness or loss of feeling or sensation in any part of the body usually arises from damage or disease of nerves. Possible causes may include the following: paresthesias, nerve disorders, nerve entrapments , nerve compression syndromes, repetitive motion disorders, carpal tunnel syndrome, circulatory disorders, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis, hyperventilation, stroke or transient ischemic attack . Numbness can affect various body parts and its cause depends on the location of the numbness.If numbness starts in the left hand and moves to a different part of the body, it could be related to a circulatory, neurological, or muscle-related condition. Try to avoid drinking alcohol if this seems to be related. Are there other signs or symptoms present? A complete medical and physical examination as well as imaging studies such as MRI are important in reaching a diagnosis.Take care and keep us posted.",
