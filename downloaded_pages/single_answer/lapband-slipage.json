            "answer": "Hi!If the lap band was detected in the esophagus then probably it has slipped up. Yes, you could be putting on weight once the band is deflated. You need to stick to old portion sizes, eat healthy and exercise. Also, you need to find out whether you have diabetes, hormonal problems or thyroid disorders or anemia that could be contributing to weight gain. Treating these disorders will keep the weight in check. You could ask your doctor to prescribe a drug for controlling obesity for the time that you wait for the surgery. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
