            "answer": "Hello,Lantus is typically only dosed once a day (even though the duration of action is only about 20 hours a day.\u00a0\u00a0Following are some ideas to run past your dr.1. Take your lantus at night (instead of in the morning), if you are not already taking it at night.\u00a0\u00a0This way, at least it will be fully active over night.2. Split the lantus into 2 doses to get better coverage.\u00a0\u00a0The doses may not necessarily be the same.\u00a0\u00a0ie. You may need a higher dose at night than in the morning.3. Try levemir (a different long acting insulin), which is typically dosed twice a day.4. Ask your dr to prescribe you the new insulin Tresiba.\u00a0\u00a0This is an ultralong acting insulin and seems to help many people with avoiding high morning sugars.5. Take your breakfast soon after you wake up (you will need to dose Novolog to provide both a correction and to cover the food).\u00a0\u00a0it will be best if your breakfast is very low carb ie. eggs or meat and some veges, to avoid further increasing blood sugars too much.\u00a0\u00a0 Eating may actually help stop the liver putting out sugar, which it does in response to an overnight fast.6. Set an alarm clock and take an early morning correction of novolog to counter the rising blood sugars and prevent them going too high.7. Ask your Dr to refer you to a diabetes educator, who can help you in developing strategies to control your blood sugar better.8. You may also need to do basal testing to be sure that your dose of basal insulin is correct.Some good books are \"Using Insulin\" by John Walsh, \"Think Like a Pancreas\", \"Diabetes Solutions\".\u00a0\u00a0All describe how to test and adjust insulin dosing rates to get better blood sugar control.",

    "question": "I take 40 units Lantus (long acting), and sliding scale Novolog (fast acting) insulins.\u00a0\u00a0My bg is always so high in the mornings, I have to take Novolog and wait for sugar to come down to eat.\u00a0\u00a0I've had diabetes for many years, but never knew for sure which one!\u00a0\u00a0My dr would switch my diagnosis all the time.\u00a0\u00a0But went to endo and they did a blood test, and said I'm type 1. I'm angry my dr. never did anything about this.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter splits her insulin dose, 1/2 in the morning, and 1/2 at night.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if this would help?\u00a0\u00a0Also how to do it?\u00a0\u00a0My dr won't help me. Thank you in advance :)",
