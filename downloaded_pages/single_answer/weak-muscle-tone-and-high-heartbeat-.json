    "question": "Hello,I am a diabetic for little over 3 years and this year in March I had chest pain and went to doctor .They did blood test and found my Troponin a bit elevated .It was at 15 and then 19. However they did many additional tests like Nuclear mibi ,Treadmill and x rays and declared that my heart was fine .However I have been having many problems like high heart beat to a point that I become breathless and tired so quickly .Biggest issue is carrying weight , A small bag of groceries sometime leaves me breathless and often initiates a sort of shaking in my body which\u00a0\u00a0lasts for many hours and sometimes all day. Nowadays walking briskly for few minutes leaves me tired and my body shaking. I don't feel like going to doctor again and again .A friend of mine suggested that its not heart problem ,Its a muscle toning issue . Is that really the case ? What can I do to improve myself physically ?",
