            "answer": "For your height, your recommended body weight should be around 86kg. It is good that you are using weights in a gym to build lean muscle. Suggest you eat all the food groups, including fruits and vegetables, 3 times a day with snacks between meals. Try nutrient dense drinks 1-2 a day, either purchase them, such as Ensure or Boost, or make your own milkshakes - milk, ice cream, and frozen fruit blended together or yogurt smoothies - yogurt, milk, and frozen fruit blended together for additional calories, protein and nutrients to help increase your weight.",

    "question": "I,am 21 years old 6\"2ft and only weigh 77kg i would like any advice on how to gain weight as I am clearly able to see my hip bones and other bones on my body stand out aswell because of my low weight.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried taking weight gain formulas and eat regularly through the day eating fruit and usual main meal foods and vitamin tablets, i also eat junk food. I also go the gym to put on muscle but not really much progress. I believe going the gym has benefited me as I do have defined shoulders and arms and my chest muscle is improving. Even though my weight is low I can bench press 8kg under my own body weight and i am able to pull down 170lbs with my back and shoulder muscles so i believe i have benefited from the workouts in some way. also could any one tell me what would be a recomended body weight for me I am also going to have a test for diabetes as It was suggested to me.",
