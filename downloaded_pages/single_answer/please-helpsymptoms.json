            "answer": "Because the symptoms follow on eating, you might borrow or buy a glucose meter and test your own blood sugar; or else have the doctor do an OGTT which gives you a sugary drink and then tests your blood sugar over a period of a couple hours. If you have hypoglycemia or diabetes and your doctor just tested randomly or fasting, he might not have picked up your reaction to food.Other possibilities that doctors don't often think of are Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Depression (which often manifests with physical symptoms as well as sadness, hopelessness, lack of motivation). If you think this might be the case, I would see a therapist who can assess you better than a regular doctor.",

Always had mild insomnia5. Need to urinate slightly more often than usual6. A few times recently ive either had nightmares or woken up dazed and confused feeling a bit frightened7.Sometimes feel nausea and have been sickThe longer this goes on the more i start to doubt myself and even though I know I\u2019m not making it up its extremely distressing.Thank you for your help",
