            "answer": "Hi there. The cause of numb face or decreased sensation in face includes either nerve dysfunction or damage. It can result from an injury to face or exposure to cold temperatures. Numb face may be caused by neuropathy, where nerves relaying signals between body and the brain do not function properly. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic condition that results in facial numbness. Neuropathy can be due to specific diseases like diabetes and vitamin deficiencies. Numbness of face can also result from injury, tumors of brains or nerves. Symptoms caused by injury often have a sudden onset. Consult a neurologist for these concerns and investigation and management. Hope this helps. Take care.",

She was just sitting on the couch and her face went numb. Any ideas? She has not fallen, been hit, not bruises or trauma.",
