            "answer": "DUe to your hyperopia (farsightedness) you eye has to do extra work all the time to focus both distance and near. As you get older (even in your 20s) the eye is less able to do this. If you are sick, ill, have used alcohol, taken some legal drugs, are emotionally upset, or physically very tired or just woke up it can interfer with the ability of the eye to focus.Keep your appointment but the above is the most likely cause. At some point you will be in glasses all the time and bifocals sooner than others.JCH MD",

    "question": "Hello!I am 25 years old, female and relatively healthy.I have never had any eye problems, apart from a slight hyperopia ( farsightedness) since my childhood that has never caused me any serious trouble. I only wear glasses when I have to study or when I feel tired. My last eye check was last year and it came back normal. No history of diabetes or high blood pressure. No family history of eye problems (apart from a grandmother with a cataract onset at the age of 69).This morning I woke up and i immediately realized that I had pressed the left side of my face too hard upon my fist.I opened my eyes and the sight on my left eye was really blurry!I panicked but after 15 minutes it almost came back to normal. I can see well but I feel that there's something different with my left eye today. It feels tired and... different!Note that it is not inflammed and that I do not see flashes of light or floaters or dark shadows or anything.My vision is clear now but my left eye feels tired and if I close my good eye, my left eye takes a few split seconds to focus and see clearly.I called the ofthalmologist and I booked an appointment but it's for the 10th of May.Can someone tell me what could be wrong? Could this be something serious like retinal detachment?",
