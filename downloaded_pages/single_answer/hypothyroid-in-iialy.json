            "answer": "Too much t3 can be over-stimulating to the heart so we are cautious in dosing it -- this risk appears to increase with age.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, liothyronine (t3) should be available in Europe readily -- ask at your local farmacia.\u00a0\u00a0I usually combine t3 and t4 when using t3 so the current tiroide vister may be fine but likely needs closer monitoring -- ie check TSH to keep around 0.5-1.5 and be consistent with the dose.\u00a0\u00a0The weight gain is likely in part thyroid but also after menopause there is an unfair slowing of metabolism -- the key is less calories in and more calories burned off.\u00a0\u00a0A general endocrine evaluation to look at pre-diabetes (insulin resistance) or excessive cortisol (unlikely) may be appropriate.I would not recommend ordering meds from the internet unless you have a local doctor monitoring and prescribing the meds.",

    "question": "I'm taking a natural thyroid pill(tiroide vister) which has t3 and t4. When i tried a synthetic pill with only t4, I had problems. My blood tests for t3 and t4 show i have a low t3 but normal t4. I would like to just take t3, because that seems all i need, also because I'm having some problems with facial swelling (forehead and under-eye) and blurred vision but I don't know how to get just t3 here. I understand there's a product called cytomel in the US, is there anything similar in Italy? Can I order cytomel over the web etc.I started thyroid therapy about 5 years ago (after menopause) when my thyroid really plunged and I looked like I was preganant going from a size 10-12 to a size 18+!!!! but I think I've always been hypo because my body temp was always below normal even as a kid and I've always had to be very careful with my weight.Now, I start and stop the tiroide vister: stopping it when I see bumps, starting it again when I bloat like the expanding universe... but that doesn't seem to be a great solution. Can you offer any advice? Besides everything else, I've got arthritis in my feet so I can't afford to gain weight. I'm 60, about 5'7\" and about 145 lbs.Thanks",
