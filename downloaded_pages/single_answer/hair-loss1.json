            "answer": "As far as I know diabetes may cause thinning of the hair and in some cases hair loss. In your daughters\u00a0\u00a0case more background information is needed to rule out diabetes as a cause; how much hair loss your daughter is experiencing [is it just some thinning; is it in globs]; if this started after Metformin. Those of us who never have had to take Metformin before do experience some hair loss [thinning] with the introduction of these chemicals into our bodies.I suggest you read through this link for some helpful tips on hair loss not related to diabetes, including the link under References, \"Hair loss in teens.\"http://www.ehow.com/facts_5561323_causes-hair-loss-yearold-girl.htmlLastly, I suggest you seek consultation with a Dermatologist for basic testing to determine if the origin of the problem is hormonal, dietary, disease related [diabetes], drug related [Metformin, etc], stress-induced or the result of physical activities. Many hair loss problems are resolved with simple therapies. Good luck",
