            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms it can be ringworm or nummular dermatitis. Nummular dermatitis is a sort of eczema and allergic reaction is an important cause. Take some antihistaminic like Benadryl or Claritin and apply some calamine lotion on the rash. Also wear cotton clothes and keep the skin sweat free. If the symptoms persist then please get it examined from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Doc,I am 28 male, 6'1\" 185 lbs, healthy athletic, no diseases or health concerns.I have developed a red, 0.5 inch oval-shaped patch of skin on the dorsal head of my penis (pics). The red patch has persisted for more than 7 days without changing and without me disturbing it. It is mostly smooth, slightly red, the skin appears shiny with a different texture than surrounding skin. There appears to be a border around the area where the redness is more pronounced. No itching, no burning, no discharge, no pain. The skin feels slightly scaly to the touch, is noticeably altered and is not the normal smooth feeling skin of the penis. From my own research, it looks nearest in appearance to a minor burn, ringworm or granuloma annulare. It seems to me to be a fungus of some kind.The most recent sexual encounter that preceded the red patch was receiving extensive oral sex from a type 1 diabetic. She is known to battle infection such as yeast etc due to long term chronic diabetes.I took a pill of Fluconazole and have also applied tolnaftate, no effect on the red patch.I will include pictures for viewing, I took the best picture possible but the discoloration is less noticeable than it is to the naked eye. I first noticed the area while masturbating in the dark I felt something odd on my penis to the touch and investigated and discovered it was this small patch of skin.Please let me know if you have any ideas what this could be. I am 100% confident it is not \"irritation\". I have thick strong skin and almost never experience reaction or irritation.",
