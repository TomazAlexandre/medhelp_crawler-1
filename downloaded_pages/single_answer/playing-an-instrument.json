            "answer": "I am not a lung expert, but the pressure during trumpet playing is generated with a closed glottis, so it is not transmitted to the lungs. But it is an exacerbated form of a maneuver called valsalva, in which the abdominal pressure is increased, and which decreases the filling pressure to the heart and also the arterial pressure. This can prompt unwanted lightheadedness, dizziness or syncope, so if she experiences any of these symptoms she should stop.",
