            "answer": "Hello,An erection problem is the inability to get or maintain an erection that is firm enough for a man to have intercourse. If the condition persists, the medical term is erectile dysfunction. Causes may be psychological, smoking, alcohol, illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord and neurological causes. To exactly pinpoint a diagnosis you need to get a complete examination done from a urologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "hello, the reason that I am asking this question is because its been couple of weeks now that something just feels wrong in me. I used to have sex up to maybe 10 times in 24 fours and my erections were fine and there was nothing wrong and I could stay hard till the end of intercourse. but its been couple of weeks now that when I try to have sex for the second time for example in a day I seem to have a problem with getting erected and keeping it and it just goes off. I read couple of articles about ED and I just wanted to know if I will be okay because its effecting my relationship and I am absolutely in a very bad mood and its taking so much away from me. after reading those articles I do have couple of assumptions. my lifestyle is healthy and I do smoke 3-5 cigarettes a day and one more thing that caught my eyes while reading those articles was the fact that if my partner is on top of me and the penis doesnt go inside and hit a hard part of her body accidentally something like this would happen since its like dropping weight on my penis. so that has happened to me maybe 3 or 4 times in my life and the last time would be 3 weeks ago that it happened and I feel like since that time I'm facing this problem and Its really a weird feeling because even from inside of my penis I can feel that something is wrong that I'm not getting erections as often as I used to during the day and when I do it is not fully erected. please I would love to hear from you.",
