    "question": "My son is a 6 yr old type one diabetic. About 3 mo ago I noticed that his right eye was dilated and the left was normal and when I checked him later the were equal and reactive.\u00a0\u00a0He had a Dr's appointment for his diabetes about a month ago and I told the Dr. and at that time his Rt.eye was slightly bigger but not fully dilated as before. She basically blew it off as normal! Today my son was sick and I went to school to pick him up and the nurse said she was concerned about his eyes! I said why? She told me to look at his right eye! It was fully dilated and the left normal! I asked him if he had a headache or neck pain! He said no. I had him cover each eye and asked him if things were clear or blurry! He said clear for both. When we got in the car just a few minutes later I looked at his eyes and they were normal! It is almost like the right pupil is getting stuck!\u00a0\u00a0We are trying to get him in to an eye Dr to get looked at as I speak! Does anyone have any ideas!",
