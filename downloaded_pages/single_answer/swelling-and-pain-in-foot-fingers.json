            "answer": "Hi!The simplest reason is tight foot wear. So change your foot wear and see. Another possibility is gout which generally affects the great toe in 75% cases. However it can affect the little toes too. This is due to high uric acid in the body that gets accumulated in the joints. Another possibility is Chondrocalcinosis which is similar to gout but caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate rather than uric acid. Rheumatoid arthritis is another possibility. Bursitis\u2014inflammation of the joints, fungal infection, peripheral neuropathies like those of diabetes are other possibilities.Is there a deformity in the toes? If there is then chances are that you have bunions or hammer toes.Pseudogout is inflammation of joints caused by deposits of crystals, called calcium pyrophosphate. It mimics the symptoms of Gout. It is also called Chondrocalcinosis. Conditions like hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, hemochromatosis, and hemophilia generally co-exist, but is not a rule. Diagnosis is by finding the crystals in joint fluid by joint aspiration.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
