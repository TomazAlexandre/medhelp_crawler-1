    "question": "Lately, I've been having bouts of severe chest pain that last about 5 minutes each. First, it feels like my chest is constricted and then extremely compressed, like there's a great weight sitting on it. It's very painful, and it makes me lose my breath. Shortly after it's begun, my right arm around the shoulder socket will also hurt. It's happened quite a few times over the past couple of months, and each time it's only my right arm that hurts. I'm only 18 and I'm in very good shape, though I do have a history of heart disease and diabetes in my family. When I was 12 or 13, I also experienced a lot of chest pain that felt more like a stabbing feeling on the left side of my chest, which was diagnosed as possibly indigestion. I'm very worried because I'm very healthy otherwise and I eat well. I feel that I'm too young to be having these issues, so it's making me kind of paranoid. Any help would be sincerely appreciated.Thanks,TM",
