            "answer": "Hi there,In fatty liver there is fat in the liver, along with inflammation and damage. You should refrain from taking alcohol, as this will cause further injury to the liver. Fatty liver due to alcoholism is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. If this condition progresses it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. So avoid alcohol and treat diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels if present. Adopt lifestyle changes like weight reduction, exercise etc.Consult your doctor for more queries and assistance. I hope it helps.Best wishes and kind regards!",
