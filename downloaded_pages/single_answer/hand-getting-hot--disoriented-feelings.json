    "question": "Occasional hot feeling in my left hand. It comes and goes. By that I mean, it may happen 2-3 times a day, then it'll go away for weeks before happening again. I have also been feeling \"weird\" lately however I think that has to do with averaging 4-5 hours of sleep per night. I'd like to know if its more likely just exhaustion, diabetes (Im a big guy, working out and in my twenties), multiple sclerosis, or maybe something different?Any ideas?Thanks",
