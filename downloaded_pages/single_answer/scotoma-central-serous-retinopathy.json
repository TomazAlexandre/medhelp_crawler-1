    "question": "I'm an 18 year old boy with Type I Diabetes for 14 years. I have been seeing my Ophthalmologist yearly and a Retina Specialist recently. I have been told that I don't really have any damage from being Diabetic yet. But about 6 months ago, I was looking at the computer and instantly I got a dark spot in the middle of my right eye. It's like when you stare at a lightbulb then look away. (the after-image) But it never fades and I can see it even with my eyes closed. I also had a really bad headache that I got at that same moment, and felt really sick. I went to several doctors at that time, besides my regular Ophthalmologist: a Retina Specialist, another Retina Specialist at Northwestern in Chicago, he referred me to their Ophto-Neuro Doctor. I had multiple scans, with dye, visual fields, etc. Nothing shows up. So, I've been trying to deal with it. But 3 days ago, I got another spot in the same area, only bigger. I also (at the same time as the 2nd blind spot, got a big floater right in the middle of my vision.) I don't think I have anything going on with the other eye. I'm so depressed and worried. I can't stop thinking about it.",
