            "answer": "Hi, the condition strongly suggests angioedema and atopic dermatitis which is due to hypersensitivity reaction (type 1). We cannot rule out the allergen, we can just guide to rule out the probable allergen. Drugs like amoxicillin, certain painkillers, certain garments, environmental allergen and certain food (fish, mushroom, peanuts, soy etc) can cause such reaction.You need to keep track of things (maintain a diary) you were exposed to such as food, cloths, drugs etc. and you should avoid further exposure.This is a emergency condition because there will be associated laryngeal edema leading to breathing problems. Drugs like anti-histaminics and corticosteroids are the standard mode of treatment which should be taken after consultation from physician. Take care and regards.",
