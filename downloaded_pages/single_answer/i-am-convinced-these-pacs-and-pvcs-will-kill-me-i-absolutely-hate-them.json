            "answer": "Magnesium deficiency caused a lot of symptoms for me from anxiety to heart rhythm problems. Causes of magnesium loss are numerous including sugar, stress (both mental and physical), alcohol, coffee, too much calcium, too much vitamin D, insulin resistance/diabetes. My combination to cause severe magnesium deficiency was sugar, insulin resistance, too much vitamin D and stress from surgery. Try some good quality magnesium supplements and see how you feel. I take chelated magnesium for good absorption.",

    "question": "I am fed up of these skipping heart beats. Doctors say they are benign, but they do not feel this way at all.I am 30, I have had them since I was 18 years old. They started shortly after I was diagnosed with anxiety. Over the years they have increased in frequency. Although, reading some posts on here I don't get them no where near as many as some.Anyway, like today I was standing at the fridge eating some crisps looking for dinner, and all of a sudden I felt a skip as I swallowed, then a burst of skips really fast and then what seems like a pause. It's like a \"flip flop\" that hasn't yet \"flopped\". Like there's a delay with the flop. Then another skip and back to normal.In total, it lasted about 3 seconds. Maybe 4. It felt nasty. I was trying to remain normal as it happened but I couldn't and just quickly left the room. I can handle PAC's and PVC's when it's just one at a time. I can't hack them when they flair up in a burst like that.I am more stressed than usual. I've just moved home, I hate the area. My savings are running low. I have 2 jobs piled up here that I need to complete for my clients. I am feeling so stressed out.When these \"attacks\" hit it leaves me feeling low and depressed. They ruin my day. I could be having fun doing something, then they hit, and I'm left feeling crappy worrying over these stupid things!How can a doctor say these are not harmful? They don't feel like that when they hit. I've had them for so long and I still can't get used to them.Any comforting advice from anyone? Anyone else had these? Anyone get them worse?",
