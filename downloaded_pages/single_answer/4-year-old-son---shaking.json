    "question": "My 4 (5 in April) year old son has shaking/trembling hands almost always.\u00a0\u00a0He has be tested for diabetes twice (I had gestational diabetes when pregnant with him) and said to be negative.\u00a0\u00a0He's on the hyper side and has trouble sitting still in pre-school but not much worse than other kids.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I should post this question to another forum other than neurology but I don't know what it could be.\u00a0\u00a0He could just be super sensitive to blood sugar drops, hot/cold-- maybe it's an adrenalin issue or even blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I'm baffled and a little worried.\u00a0\u00a0It's not normal for a little kid to have trembling hands.\u00a0\u00a0Got any ideas",
