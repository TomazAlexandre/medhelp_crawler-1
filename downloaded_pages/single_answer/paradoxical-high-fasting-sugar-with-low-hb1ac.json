            "answer": "Unfortunately you are still pre-diabetic. Fastings of from 100-125 are considered pre-diabetic. Even if your fastings were lower, it doesn't mean the condition has gone away, just that you are managing it well with your weight loss, diet and exercise (congratulations on that, by the way!). For example I am a type 1 diabetic and my last A1C was 6.3 which is below the level where diabetes is diagnosed. But if I stopped what I am doing (in my case injecting insulin) it would go up...and up.Many type 2 diabetics have something called Dawn Phenomenon which means you have higher numbers in the morning which might keep going up until you eat. Google Dawn Phenomenon or go on a website with more type 2's and pre-diabetics (pm me if you want a site) and you will get some hints on dealing with DP. If you are unable to get it down you might need to start an oral med.But keep up your good work!!",

Since then i exercised, lost weight, and ate properly (but no medication like Metmorphin).By July of 2010 my Hb1Ac levels came down to 5.8.I assume that i am no longer pre- diabetic.But my fasting sugar does fluctuate between 115- 125.What does that signify?",
