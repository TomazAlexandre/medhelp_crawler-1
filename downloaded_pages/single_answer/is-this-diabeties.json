            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.I don't know what medications you might be taking, but some medications can cause sleepiness, or a \"foggy\" feeling. Some depression/anxiety medications can cause feelings of excessive thirst. The thirst could also be related to the urinary tract infection and kidney stone. Patients with these conditions should increase their fluid intake. Kidney stones can be related to dehydration.If you are worried about having diabetes, I recommend seeing your doctor and having your blood sugar checked.I hope you are feeling better.Cathy",
