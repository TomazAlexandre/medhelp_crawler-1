    "question": "I had a single right coronary by-pass 15 years ago, using a vein in my left leg. Since then I have been relatively health, but have acquired type II diabetes. I regularly exercise for 1 1/2 - 2 hours rigorous cycling, with a peak heart rate about 160 and an average rate of 139.I bike an average of 4 times a week. I am taking both beta blockers and ace inhibitors. I have lost 25 lbs in the last 3 months of exercising. I am concerned whether my graft will last. I have had no symptoms and my ejection fraction has significantly improved to 51 at rest and 61 after exercise. How will I know if/when I need another by-pass?PoseurThis discussion is related to/posts/show/250668.",
