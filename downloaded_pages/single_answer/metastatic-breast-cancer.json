    "question": "My wife is presently taking Femara for metastatic breast cancer that has spread to her lungs and spine.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor stated that this type of cancer is slow growing and her goal was to turn it into a treatable disease such as diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The cancer seems to be growing rapidly as she is now experiencing more pressure on her lungs, a burning sensation and pain in the area of her largest tumor(5cm). Her symtoms are becoming more noticable/aggressive every week. Do you know of any drug or treatment that is more effective than Femara?\u00a0\u00a0Also, what do you know about Cesium drug therapy(high ph)?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
