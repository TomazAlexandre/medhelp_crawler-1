            "answer": "How are you? Was there a prostrate surgery done? Retrograde ejaculation can be caused by medications, health conditions or surgeries that affect the nerves or muscle that control the bladder opening. Several conditions can cause this condition such as: surgery in the bladder neck or prostrate, side effect of certain medications (high blood pressure, prostate enlargement and mood disorders); nerve damage caused by a medical condition such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis or a spinal cord injury. Diagnosis is through urinalysis obtained shortly after ejaculation which will show an abnormal level of sperm within it. Retrograde ejaculation does not require treatment unless it interferes with fertility. In these cases, treatment depends on the underlying cause.
