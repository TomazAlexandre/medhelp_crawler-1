            "answer": "You may have Polyglandular Syndrome Type II (also called Schmidt's Syndrome).\"Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type II (PGA-II) is the most common of the immunoendocrinopathy syndromes. It is characterized by the obligatory occurrence of autoimmune Addison disease in combination with thyroid autoimmune diseases and/or type 1 diabetes mellitus (also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or IDDM). Primary hypogonadism, myasthenia gravis, and celiac disease also are commonly observed in this syndrome.\" - Excerpt from medscape - Type II Polyglandular Autoimmune SyndromeThe American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) have estimated over 13 million Americans with thyroid disease remain undiagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0Hashimoto's thyroiditis (autoimmune hypothyroidism) may show no symptoms in the earlier stages of the disease.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid tests should include at least: TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), free T3, free T4 and thyroid antibodies - thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb).As noted, Polyglandular Syndrome Type II is associated with Celiac's disease and primary hypogonadism (decreased functional activity of the gonads resulting in lower amounts of testosterone). To add, hypothyroidism is one of the causes of low testosterone.As for vitamin B12, there are two pathways for absorption:Primary B12 absorption:- Vitamin B12 with intrinsic factor (produced by the parietal cells of the stomach) absorbed in the ileum (end of small intestine)- Absorbed vitamin B12 binds transcobalamin II (transports vitamin B12 to the tissues)Alternate B12 absorption:- Pathway independent of intrinsic factor and ileum- Absorption of up to 1% of large oral B12 doseExcerpts from Vegan Health - \"How Recommendations Were Formulated\":\"Norberg (1) (1999, Sweden) points out that investigations in the 1950s and 60s showed that oral B12 is absorbed by an alternative pathway not dependent on intrinsic factor or an intact ileum. Approximately 1% of an oral dose in the range of 200-2000 \u00b5g/day was absorbed by the alternative pathway in those investigations.\"\"Kuzminski et al (3). (1998, USA) studied 33 newly diagnosed B12-deficient patients (almost all had malabsorption) who received cyanocobalamin as either 1 mg intramuscularly on days 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, 30, 60, and 90; or 2000 \u00b5g orally on a daily basis for 120 days (4 months). See Table 1.Kuzminski et al. conclude that 2000 \u00b5g/day of oral cyanocobalamin was as effective as 1000 \u00b5g injected intramuscularly each month, and may be superior.\"You may want to try 2000mcg (\u00b5g) daily of oral B12 (i highly recommend sublingual spray) and retesting B12 levels in 8 weeks. Optimal B12 serum is over 800pg/mL or 600pmol/L.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps even combine oral with B12 injections if needed.There are numerous causes of iron deficiency but include untreated Celiac's disease (or intestinal damage that has not improved with a gluten free diet); not enough iron in the diet; other nutrients needed for optimal iron absorption: vitamin C, vitamin B12, folate or zinc; low stomach acid which is associated with many conditions including Celiac's disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\u00a0\u00a0Low stomach acid leads to any number of nutrient deficiencies.The following steps help to determine your stomach's acidity:1. Perform this test first thing in the morning on an empty stomach (beforeeating or drinking)2. Dissolve \u00bc teaspoon of baking soda into an 8 oz glass of cold water3. Drink the solution and start timing4. Record the time until you first burp up gas5. Perform this test for 5 consecutive days (or longer) at the same time each day to give a better estimation of your stomach\u2019s acidityTime until first burp:If you burp immediately and excessively your stomach acid level is probably too highUnder 2 min: indicates normal acidity2-5 min: low-normal acidityOver 5 min: possible hypochlorhydria (low stomach acid)No burping indicates possible achlorhydria (no stomach acid)",

    "question": "Hi,I have been diagnosed with Celiac Disease (Nov 2009) and Addison's disease (May 2011). I also am being investigated for autoimmune hypopituitarism due to low LH/FSH/Testosterone as well. My question is regarding my vitamin levels. Here were my levels pre and post treatment:-------------------------------------------------------------------August 2011------------B12 = 151 (range 150 - 900)Ferritin = 46 (range 30 - 300)Free Testosterone = 4 (range 30 - 90)LH = 1 (range 4 - 12)FSH = 3 (range 3 - 15)September 2011---------------B12 = 75 (range 150 - 900)Ferritin = 20 (range 30 - 300)* Started B12 Injections every two weeks *Feb 2012 (levels taken 2 weeks after last injection)---------B12 = 160 (range 150 - 900)-------------------------------------------------------------------My questions are,1. Is it normal for my B12 to only be at 160 after all these injections. I would think two weeks post injection, my levels would still be higher.2. The doctors said while my ferritin is low, it is common in celiac and is not urgent to be treated. I would think a 25 year old male should have a ferritin much higher than 20 and does anybody know what would cause it drop so quickly?3. Does anybody know why testosterone levels would drop, no pituitary tumors were found.I know nobody hear is a doctor, but any input is appreciated. Thanks a lot!!",
