    "question": "I recently had a blood vessel broke inside my right eye. My opthalmologist sent me to a retinal special specialist who suggest an injection of avastin into the eye. I am very concerned with all the side effects especially since Diabetes is very common on both sides of my family.The retinal specialist said there is a 1in 5 chance that it will clear up. Knowing the side effects, isn't the risk of having the injection too high for me to take knowing that i might not regain clear vision in my eye? Are there other alternatives for me to consider?",
