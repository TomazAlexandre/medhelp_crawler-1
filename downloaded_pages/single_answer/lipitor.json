    "question": "I have been on Lipitor for less than a year. Has brought my cholesterol down from 260 to 175. Triglycerides though are still 338. I am not overweight and try to be healthy. I have to be because I am a 2 time cancer survivor. Anyway, just had blood work and my glucose level has shot up. I had to fast before the blood work, so my glucose level should not have been elevated. I have never had a problem with my glucose level until now.\u00a0\u00a0I am reading where Lipitor is causing diabetes and there are lawsuits against it. I don't need anymore health problems than what I already have. I am quickly learning best to research these meds before side effects do set in. I am now being considered a borderline diabetic. Anyone else have problems with Lipitor causing diabetes? Thank you.",
