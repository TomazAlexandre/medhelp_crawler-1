            "answer": "Hello and thank you for visiting MedHelp.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you are very aware of the risks of type 2 diabetes and are trying to avoid any complications by careful monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0This is always a good idea.\u00a0\u00a0Better to overload your doctor with too much information rather than not enough.I will answer your questions as best as possible, but a couple warnings first.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a doctor, you should always talk to your doctor about your health.\u00a0\u00a0We have our averages we work with, but your doctor knows what is best for you.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, I am more familiar with type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The ranges are pretty similar, but not exactly.\u00a0\u00a0Now on to the answers.I found a website that might help you out a little.\u00a0\u00a0Its address ishttp://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/type1and2/print_chart_1.htm#1That is a chart with the approximate target levels for blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0It has targets for before and after eating.\u00a0\u00a0Basically between meals you want your blood sugar in the 90-130 range between meals, and below 180 after.\u00a0\u00a0The most common number thrown around is below 100 between meals.\u00a0\u00a0I have heard arguments for and against that low of a number though.Please stay in touch with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0If you stay on top of things you she be looking forward to a long, healthy, diabetes free life.",

    "question": "Thank you for taking my questions- much appreciated.1. What kinds of readings are deemed appropriate after eating ... for example: after 2 hrs, after 4-6 hrs ? My results after eating 5 hrs are typically 85-90 steady ... after 2 hrs they go up to 120-130 and then back down to 80-98 after two hrs after eating.2. What is considered to be a healthy reading after several hrs of no eating ?\u00a0\u00a0My understanding is that anything between 80-90 is where you want to be consistently so as not to be hypoglaecymic or have too much blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0Is the idea that your pancreas regulate in stable zones at most times? If so what are the zones that we should be at? For example: When I get readings of 68-70 after 4 hrs of not eating I feel tired and sluggish. Not sure what to make of this.3. I am 39 male, both parents are type 2- mother insulin dependent at age 57 now 62, dad takes pills from 57 now 64. I want to avoid the onset of diabetis for as long as possible. Dr. suggested I loose about 7-8 pounds and this should control things better.Thanks-",
