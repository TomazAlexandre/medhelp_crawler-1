            "answer": "Hi,We are all born with all our hair follicles in place and under normal circumstances do not produce any more. A proportion of these follicles are programmed to grow relatively long, thick, pigmented hair, for example scalp, eyebrow and eyelash hair. These are called primary terminal hairs. Other follicles grow short, fine, non-pigmented or only slightly pigmented hair, primary vellus hair which covers most of the body. This is often not visible to the naked eye.With the ageing process there is regression of the follicles containing the hair and thus this can lead to a loss of hair, especially in the limbs which already has fine hair.There are medical conditions which cause hair loss but they will manifest with other symptoms.So if you are generally in good shape there is nothing to worry about.ref:http://www.bad.org.uk/public/skin/growth/",

    "question": "70 year old female just wondering if the almost complete loss of hair on my legs over the past year is normal? Hair on forearms also lessened. I have mild Type II diabetes controlled by diet and exercise, no drugs. This isn't a complaint, just concerned that if it's abnormal and a sign of something that ought to be looked at.",
