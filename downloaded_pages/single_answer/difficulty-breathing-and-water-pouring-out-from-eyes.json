            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.If there is itchiness and watering, the eye symptoms can be due to an allergen. Allergens include pollen, mold, dust and pet dander. The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Breathlessness on exertion could be due to the decreased lung function. Again in cardiac disorders the heart is unable to pump the blood adequately, more so when subjected to stress like exercise. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. So please consult your primary care physician who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test to rule out a cardiac cause for the symptoms. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
