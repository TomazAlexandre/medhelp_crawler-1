    "question": "I just got back my most recent Lipid Panel and don't know if I should be worried. I am a 53 year old white female, non-smoker, no diabetes and with a BMI of 21.5. I am on 3 blood pressure medications now to control what was urgent hypertension (186/116) last summer. My last lipid panel (fasting) came back with these results (which are consistent with the upward trend of these numbers over the past 7-8 years):Cholesterol Total\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 278TG\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 151HDL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 149My doc seems to think that since the ratio is good I shouldn't worry about the High Total and what seems to be an unheard of high level HDL. Is he right?? I should mention that I have had symptoms and some ambiguous lab results which appear to indicate I have SLE (lupus).",
