            "answer": "Hi!It could just be impulse transmission you feel, which is magnified if you have a peripheral neuropathy from diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s or lupus. It is possible to feel vibrations if you have vit. B 12 deficiency too. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
