            "answer": "Hi!Ventricular septal defect is a congenital defect. It is known to run in families and the risk of another child in the family having VSD is higher than a family with no history of VSD. However, it is more common in children born of mothers with rubella infection, uncontrolled diabetes or those who drank alcohol during pregnancy. If you have a person with VSD in the family, then taking into consideration various other factors such as race, age, family history, frequency of VSD in family etc, a genetic counselor can predict the risk of another VSD in the family. VSD can also occur in babies born in families with no known VSD history. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
