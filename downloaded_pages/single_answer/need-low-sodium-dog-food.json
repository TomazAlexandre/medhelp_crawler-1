    "question": "We are moving an 8yr GSD/Australian Shepherd mix from England to the U.S. at the end of the year.\u00a0\u00a0He has nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and is on a low sodium dog food - Hill's Science Plan Adult 7+ Lamb and Rice dog food.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to switch him to Hill's Science Plan and it instantly caused a UTI.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, it has too much sodium.\u00a0\u00a0Is there another food that I may purchase in the States that is low sodium and is not Hill's? (Science Plan seems to be the only Hill's product that he can digest without problems).Cheers",
