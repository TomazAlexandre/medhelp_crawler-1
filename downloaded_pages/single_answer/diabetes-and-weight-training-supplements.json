            "answer": "Dear neallnds,I am not a physician but someone who can give you my personal experience as a longtime volunteer.There has always been a debate on whether certain supplements are harmful to people with diabetes. It is very important that before you start anything to speak with a knowledgable endo or specialist who is very familiar with both diabetes and any supplements. I do not seem to have any websites in my files regarding whey protein or creatine specifically, but there is a website that you may want to look at. It is www.childrenwithdiabetes.com. This is a site that I trust and they do have some information regarding excerice and supplements that may be helpful.I am sorry I couldn't be of more help but watch for other comments that may be posted with more information.Good luck,dm",

    "question": "I was diagnosed about 7 months ago and have not been the best at watching my sugars, but I have become very healthy with my exercise and dieting. I have begun weight training and was wondering what effects any common supplements would have on a diabetic. I take my Lantus in the morning and usually lift wieghts around noon. I havn't started taking any supplements such as Whey protien or Creatine yet, but would like to. Contrary to all the \"steroid and insulin\" talk, I'm worried that this may have great affects on my muscle gain but very adverse affect on my liver and kidneys. Any ideas?",
