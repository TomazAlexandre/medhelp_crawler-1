    "question": "Hi,I started noticing a higher urinary frequency about a year ago. During this time I was going through several changes of command in the military and constantly having to relocate throughout the country and abroad, and was not able to undergo a comprehensive evaluation. I went to a doctor on three separate occasions in three separate locations. I was initially tested for STD's / HIV ( with a urine sample, penile swab, and blood test ) with negative results, and recommended to see a Urologist. However, due to the relocation, I was unable to make the appointment. Again in my new location saw a doctor, tested this time with a blood test for diabetes and took another urine test. Again, negative and recommended to a urologist, left the area before being able to see one.Now I am on a military deployment in a third world Asian country with no adequate medical professional for hundreds of miles. The frequency to urinate has increased to an unbearable degree, and I also have accompanying pain towards the tip of my penis, my testicles, and my lower abdomen. If it is any significance, I have been taking 100mg of Doxycycline everyday for the past 5 months as prescribed, for malaria and other diseases prone to the region. I have also tried taking a cranberry concentrate supplement for the past few weeks to no avail.The urinary frequency and pain is truly making my life miserable and rendering me unable to preform my job in an acceptable manner. I have no idea what to do, and I am extremely concerned about my health.Thanks in advance",
