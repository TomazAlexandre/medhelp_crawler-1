    "question": "I am a 50 year old Asian female and since I was a teenager I have been having a tender scalp mostly / always on the rear area of the crown of my head. It usually becomes obvious when my hair becomes greasy, which is every second day after I wash my hair. It is somewhat relieved by putting oil on my scalp and by massaging the area very hard, such as with my knuckles or some blunt object and also by pulling the hair near the scalp. When I was young, movement of my hair at the root level also caused a very unpleasant sensation. In all my life, I have only found one other person who has had this same condition, again an Asian woman, but who also had not found a cause or remedy.Would anyone know a cause or remedy for this?",
