            "answer": "Hi,It can be very difficult to change your eating habits, in one direction or another. The five small meals is thought to be better in terms of giving your\u00a0\u00a0body a more steady flow of calories(and production and need for insulin) and thus avoiding peaks at certain times of day. It can be difficult to eat when you are not hungry, but in the long run it may help stop you from over-eating later. If you want to stay with the 5-meal plan, I suggest picking speific time periods in the day when you will have these snacks, and so your body will get used to the idea of eating at this time. You will have to do some meal planning and bring your own foods along for meals if you plan on staying within a specific calorie guideline.It does take some work but slowly this will all become more of a habit. If the 5-meal plan really does not work for you and your lifestyle, you may need to speak with your diabetes educator/dietician further to work out another way of eating that fits you better while tempering the risk of gaining more\u00a0\u00a0weight.Take care.",

    "question": "I am having difficulty in establishing a meal regimenation.\u00a0\u00a0My diabetic advisor says that I should try to eat 5 small meals a day, with a snack in the evening before bed time.It's hard to eat when not hungry, so I don't.\u00a0\u00a0I wait until I do get hungry, then I probably eat to much.\u00a0\u00a0Eating like this seems impossible to lose weight as well, which they tell me I need to do.Do you have any suggestions?Thanks,TFL",
