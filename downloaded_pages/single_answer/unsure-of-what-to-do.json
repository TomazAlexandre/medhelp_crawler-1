    "question": "I love my husband very much, but I am worried about him because he lacks confidence in bed. He is having problems with his penis as far as having any sort of normal sensation. He can't feel anything while we have sex, but he has an orgasm very quickly. He gets so upset with himself, because he feels like he's letting me down. What can be the cause of the lack of sensation in the penis? How can he last longer, so he feels confident again? Any help would be great.",
