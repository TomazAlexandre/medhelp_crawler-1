            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If this occurs only during sleep then you probably have restless leg syndrome. Any abnormal sensation in lower extremities (legs or ankles\u2014which includes pain, cold legs or feet, crawling sensation etc) while trying to sleep is usually due to \u2018restless leg syndrome (RLS). Usually cause of RLS is not known but few medications such as lithium, antidepressants and beta-blockers (such as bisoprolol) can trigger the symptoms. Other reasons of RLS could be rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, diabetes or any underlying heart disorder. In addition restless syndrome has been found to be associated with stress, fatigue, magnesium deficiency, vitamin B-12 deficiency, anemia and other systemic diseases.Though there is no permanent cure of RLS, regular & sound sleep helps get relief from symptoms. Supplements of iron/vitamin also help some. Sometimes medications such as levodopa, bromocriptine, oxycodone may be tried to provide some relief from the symptoms. Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may partly relieve your symptoms. Other useful measures are stretching, alternate hot and cold packs or baths, massage and applying vibrators on the feet and legs before bedtime. Relaxation and meditation can also help.Please discuss this with your PCP and consult a sleep specialist if need be. Take care!",

    "question": "Every now and again while I am sleeping, my ankle seems to \"freeze up\" and I get this excrutiating pain up the lateral side of my ankle and half way up my calf.\u00a0\u00a0I try to walk it off but the pain is so unbearable that I can't put weight on it.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to happen after drinking things with high sodium content?! Could this actually be the reason for this or is that just a coincedence?HELP!",
