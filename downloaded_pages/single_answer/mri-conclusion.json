            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The report states that there is diminished blood supply to the brain causing severe hypoxic (low levels of oxygen) ischemic changes in the brain. So, the therapy will be focused on improving blood supply to the brain with blood thinners. Also the cause for the narrowed vessels needs to be dealt with, like diabetes, hypertension, smoking or hyperlipidemia. This will prevent further narrowing of the arteries. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
