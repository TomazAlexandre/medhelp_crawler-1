    "question": "My father is 57 years old, has Hypertension and Diabetes since 15 years. He was undergone a Treadmill test, a few weeks ago and the Doctor observed borderline positive Treadmill Test and suggested an Angiography. He undergone Angiogram a couple of days ago and the report said that the Right Coronary Artery is 100% blocked. According to the Cardiologist, who performed Angiography, the blockage is old. But, my father has no pain (Angina), no fatigue and other common symptoms of Coronary Artery Disease. He\u2019s perfectly alright. Also, his Left coronary artery is completely Normal and another Non-Dominant artery is 30% blocked, but, other parallel branches are normal. Doctor suggested that Angioplasty and Stenting may cure this and may not be able to cure. He has no problems at all. Should he go for Stent implantation? Is it risky? His Ejection Fraction is 60%. If he doesn\u2019t undergo Angioplasty and Stent implantation, is it risky? His Cholesterol level is around 130 and Fasting Blood Sugar is around 120 and 130.",
