    "question": ": My recent Lipid profile came back with Total Cholesterol = 194, HDL = 61,: LDL = 76 and Triglycerides = 287.: At the time, no blood suger test was perfomed due to my regular monitoring: of blood glucose (two hours post meals, readings generally average 125: and then begin to reduce).: There is Type II diabetes in my family (mother and her sisters and their father).: Would you recommend a formal blood glucose test done?\u00a0\u00a0Would high: triglycerides suppress the results for the glucose or other lipids?: Are the high triglycerides elevating my heart risk factor?: I am a 42 year old female; non smoker; light drinker (one glass wine/week); overweight, but otherwise in good health.: Thank you for your response.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Jessica A.:You should definitely be tested for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0As a first step, you should have a blood glucose checked after an overnight fast.\u00a0\u00a0If you are found to have diabetes, in addition to altering your diet, I would recommend weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0Just a few pounds can make a lot of difference in Type 2 diabetics.Your level of triglycerides would not affect any of the other tests.\u00a0\u00a0If the triglycerides were checked after a meal, that would raise their level.\u00a0\u00a0Triglycerides are usually measured after an overnight fast.\u00a0\u00a0Alcohol consumption can also raise triglyceride levels.Whether elevated triglycerides are a risk factor for cardiac disease is widely debated.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is a strong risk factor for heart disease, and diabetics often have elevated triglycerides.\u00a0\u00a0Elevated triglycerides with an associated low HDL [you do not have this problem] can increase the risk of heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0No one knows for sure\u00a0\u00a0whether\u00a0\u00a0isolated elevation of triglycerides of the modest degree you have is an independent risk factor for heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0I would be more concerned about your genetic tendency towards diabetes.If you wish to be evaluated here at the Cleveland Clinic, please call 1-800-CCF-CARE for an appointment with a preventive cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0Information provided in the Heart Forum is for general purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Specific diagnoses and therapies can only be provided by your doctor.",
