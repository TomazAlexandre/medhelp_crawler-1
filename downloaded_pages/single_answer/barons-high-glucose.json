            "answer": "Hi.I replied to your prior post on this ... here's what I wrote:Changing insulin without veterinary advice and supervision can be quite dangerous, but I understand your financial limits and the reason you went down this route. I can't tell you how much Novolin your dog needs in comparison to the Humalin. Insulins are a variety of strengths, with some acting in different ways (some longer acting, for example). So, you need to be super-cautious.If he's drinking more, it is a sign his blood-glucose is climbing too high. The keytones are a bad and dangerous sign of the diabetes getting seriously out of control.I would seek advice from a vet, even if it's a one-off just to get advice about the right level of insulin to be giving. Explain your financial constraints and that you would prefer getting him under good control using Novolin, if that's possible. Regular daily (several times daily) blood glucose testing will be essential - and certainly in the first few weeks of finding good control. After that, once or twice daily morning and night time should be enough. You need to work out how much insulin is safe to bring high blood glucose levels down - and how much foodstuffs will bring low blood glucose up to a safe level. Ask your vet about these things - or seek help and advice from an animal welfare agency in your area.Hope this helps.TonyPS Reducing the amount of sugar and carbohydrates in food will not bring the blood-glucose level down on its own. Diabetes means that the cells that ordinarily do this (in the pancreas of your dog) are not working properly and this process is likely to continue. Insulin is needed to bring the blood-glucose down to a safe level, but insulin is a very dangerous substance and it really is not safe for you to try devising your own regime (it could kill your dog). There is no alternative - you need a vet - if you cannot afford one, take your dog to an animal rescue centre.",
