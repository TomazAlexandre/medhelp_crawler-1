            "answer": "Hi,\"bedwetting in adults could be due to lack of the necessary muscle and nerve control due to injuries in the brain or spinal cord.Excess production of urine at night, urine infection, alcohol, coffee or diuretic medicines, sleeping tablets like valium, diabetes, stress and anxiety, having a big prostate, strictures that cause narrowing of the ureter also breed this habit. \"www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/health-and-living/Bedwetting_in_adults_indicates_a_problem.shtml\"\"Fear of coition, fear and dreams of rape. Many problems around menstrual period. Every emotion attended with throbbing. Sadness and weeping from music.\"\"They wet the bed during the first sleep from which they are roused with difficulty. They frequently dream that they are passing urine in the proper place, but they wake up, also, to find out that it has been done in the most incompatible manner and in the most improper place.' (Choudhuri) 'Nocturnal enuresis from too profound sleep. Child cannot be awakened when taken up.' (Clarke, 1900. Vol II p178)\"www.smeddum.net/articles/enuresis.htmExhaustion and excessive fatigue at the time of sleep can cause one to sleep deeply and experience enuresis.Depression also delays awakening from sleep to cause this issue.Even if the problem can be associated with a psychological issue, it is possible to correct it with a few simple measures.Daily intake of at least 2000 ml of fluids per day.Restrict fluids about 4 hours before bedtime.Void bladder before going to sleep.Advance bedtime by 1 hour every 3 days until you are able to wake up at night to pass urine.Set an alarm to go off 30 minutes before the time you usually bedwet. When the alarm goes off, get up and go to the bathroom to void bladder.In the day time try to train your bladder by resisting the urge to pass urine for at least 30 min from the time you feel the urge.Avoid caffeine, alcohol and tea at least 4 hours before bedtime.You can follow the above measures singly or as many as you can incorporate into your life style.Do keep us posted on your doubts and progress.Regards",
