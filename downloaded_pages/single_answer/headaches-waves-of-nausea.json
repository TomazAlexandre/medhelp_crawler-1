    "question": "I'm wondering about potential causes for the following set of symptoms:I've been getting intermittent headaches for weeks - usually on the right side, behind my eye near my temple.\u00a0\u00a0The pain can radiate to other areas of my head.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the headaches can be preceded (or followed) by waves of nausea.\u00a0\u00a0Basically, going back and forth between head pain and nausea, not always at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0There are also periods where I feel just fine.The pain is not debilitating - just irritating.\u00a0\u00a0So is the nausea.I also have a history of iron deficient anemia, but I believe my counts are good right now as I have been diligent with my iron therapy as of late.Any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0Do migraines last this long?",
