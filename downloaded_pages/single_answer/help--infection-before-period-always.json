    "question": "For a few months now, I've been on the birth control Loestrin 24, and ever since I've been getting a yeast infection the week before my period. As soon as I'm free from the symptoms,\u00a0\u00a0my period starts. I've never had problem with this before going on the pill. I am sexually active but I know it is not my boyfriend because we use protection but I've narrowed it to the week before my period. I'm 16 if that helps... I'm going to the doctors this week, but I would like to know if anyone has had something like this or may have an idea what it could be. Any help would be great! Thanks!",
