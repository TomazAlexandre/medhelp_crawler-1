    "question": "Good morning everyone. I hope someone can help me. I have been experience nerve pain all over my body for the last 2 months. It feels like someone is shocking me. This occurs on my fingers and toes., my back, thigh and legs and alarms. Then it can switch to burning sensations in that area as well. If that does not happen then my thigh to genital area will itch. When one symptom goes another one comes. I also feel slightly fatigued and get tired easier. I got tested for diabetes and i don't have that. Any help would be greatly appreciated",
