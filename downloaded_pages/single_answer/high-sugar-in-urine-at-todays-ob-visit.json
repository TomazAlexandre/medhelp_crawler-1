            "answer": "I am in the same boat as you. I have GD and am developing hypertention as well.I will say it does NOT look good for you not to have GD. When your body expels sugar in your urine it means that there is so much of it in your body it has nothing else to do with it. It happened to me with my first pregnancy.I think you will have to wait for the results and meet with a dietician, and possibly go on some sort of oral meds to start, glyburide is the med of choice for GD, next to insulin that is.I met with a dietician the other day and she showed me exactly how to look at carbs and measure them and how many servings I should have a meal. It helped a ton!!! My sugar was low all day today until I strayed from my diet for a bit. But other than that it was great! So don't get overly stressed, like i do lol. A lot of GD can be controlled with diet and pills. If you want to talk more just PM me",

    "question": "I went for my OB visit today (I'm being seen once a week now for high blood pressure) and the OB told me I had high level of sugar in my urine. I was just monitored at the hospital on Tuesday for blood pressure and they took urine there, and it wasn't high. It wasn't high last Thursday's visit either. I'm just at that time for the gestational diabetes testing pregnant women have between 26-28 weeks -- so she's having me come in for it Monday.Now, I'm a total wreck. I am already dealing with high BP and don't need another problem. Could I have just had high sugar in today's urine and NOT have gestational diabetes? Anyone have sugar in urine and turn out to be just fine? I'm not overweight at all and think I'm having a decent diet through the pregnancy. I did consume a lot of carbs and some fruit today (grapes, etc). Can anyone give me some insight?Thanks! Heather",
