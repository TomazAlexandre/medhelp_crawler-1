            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to hormonal problems, anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 Postviral fatigue syndrome is another possibility. Persisting EBV infection or mono can also be the cause. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "Okay, so about three weeks ago I started getting very tired even with a full night of sleep. Along with this, I am experiencing headaches, not just any headaches, bad headaches almost to the point that they make me cry. I also can't eat, and trust me, i LOVE to eat, and it's very strange for me not to feel like eating, but I just can't. Today I started getting the chills. For a very long time I have been experiencing nausea. I don't know what's going on, but if anyone could give me any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it.",
