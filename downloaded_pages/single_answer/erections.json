    "question": "I am 43, and I have Diabetes. I have great desire to please my partner, but I can't get a FULL erection prior to intercourse. Neither Levitra, Viagra, nor Cialis works. I've tried this pill a friend gave me called Magic For Men, and it seems to help with my Libido some, but not much. The doc says it's just a part of life if the pills can't help and I don't want them replacing my testicle with a pump.Any other ideas?This discussion is related to/posts/show/919476.",
