            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Either you have Sjogren\u2019s syndrome where there is decreased sweating, or you have hyperthyroidism or diabetes with increased water loss. Another possibility is diabetes insipidus, where there is increased thirst with increased water loss. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Take care!",
