    "question": "What can I possibly do to have more energy, gain a feeling of better general health, and see results from eating a proper balanced diet with moderate exercise?I'm a female in Michigan, 47 years of age (next month), 5'5\", 187lbs, have given natural full term birth 5 times (children are grown ages 27-16), work a desk job 6-10 hours a day, 5-6 days a week (varies day by day) for the past 12 years, married with two house cats.I am seeing a great number of responses to my concerns but none of which are correct in my case. My blood sugar levels, thyroid levels, hormone levels and such have all tested in normal range. The only level imbalance is my cholesterol, which I have been successful in bringing back down to healthy levels.Here are my symptoms: sleepy within five minutes after any size or type of meal, feel like I'm choking when eating - even soft foods such as instant mashed potatos, no energy for exercise,\u00a0\u00a0severe heartburn randomly (no food/drink intake neccesarily involved), night sweats even though hormone levels tested normal, unable to lose weight even with strict eating and exercise plan.I have gone to several doctors and have been diagnosed with depression, acute anxieties and menpause, which I have been given medicine for each that have had no affect on any symptoms mentioned above. When I returned to the doctors, they run more test and keep dosing me for symptoms without a straight answer of what is causing even one of them.I have already been told by more than one doctor that I do not have diabetes, narcolepsy, hypoglycemia, or hypothyroidism.I sometimes think I need Dr. House, MD.",
