            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Needless to say, this is an uncommon problem in adults. I fully empathize with you and ask you to seek medical help immediately from your doctor.The reasons could be stress, functionally small bladder, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, urinary bladder wall instability, UTI, stones and neurological problems.I think you should discuss this with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. You will need to undergo a few tests to reach a diagnosis. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 23 year old male. I wet the bed when I was younger up until the age of 9 or 10. About 6 months ago I woke up just as I was urinating. This was the first time this had happened since I was a child. Then about a week ago it happened again.It is very embarrassing (especially if my girlfriend is around). What could the causes of this be?I remember having very distressing dreams both times, and I'm not sure about the first time, but the second time ended with my urinating in my dream. I had repeated dreams about work and it was stressful, so I am wondering if it was simply caused the stress from these dreams, but then again I'm sure I've had stressful dreams before and also dreams in which I urinate and this hasn't happened.",
