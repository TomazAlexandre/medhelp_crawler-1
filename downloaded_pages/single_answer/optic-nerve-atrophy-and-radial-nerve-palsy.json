            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Radial nerve injury if partial can recover to a great extent through proper physiotherapy and electrical stimulation. However, since both arm and leg are involved, the injury appears to be higher up\u2014either at cervical spine level of due to brain injury.I suggest you visit a nearby big city with a good neurology center with recommendation of your local neurologist. Get proper assessment of the nerve damage. Today there are various exercises which you can be taught that will help you in nerve recovery.Also diabetes and blood pressure need proper control as high blood pressure and prolong diabetes can interfere with recovery.Take care!",
