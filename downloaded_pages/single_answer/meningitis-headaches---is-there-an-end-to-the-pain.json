    "question": "My question is about the recovery and long term pain of meningitis.\u00a0\u00a0This is a long story, but I will try to be brief.\u00a0\u00a0My boyfriend is a correctional officer, who was struck in the head by an inmate with a garden hoe in July 2011.\u00a0\u00a0Workers comp hospital sent him home with 17 staples and no tests, x-rays, MRI etc.\u00a0\u00a0In Sept, 2011,\u00a0\u00a0I took him to a different hospital after 3 days of severe headaches.\u00a0\u00a0A CT Scan showed he had a fractured scull and a lumbar puncture revealed\u00a0\u00a0meningitis. The diagnosis was reactive meningitis because tests ruled out viral and bacteria. He was in the hospital for 10 days and needed a blood patch. WC only had him out of work for 1 month. Five months later and he still has headaches every day.\u00a0\u00a0He takes 12 to 15 Excedrin daily. On his good days that keeps the pain at bay, but on his bad days it doesn't touch the pain.\u00a0\u00a0The worst headaches also involve neck pain.\u00a0\u00a0His WC doc will not prescribe pain medicine.\u00a0\u00a0Will these headaches subside?\u00a0\u00a0I don't think he can handle this much longer. The pain also keeps him from sleeping much. He has Type 1 diabetes and needs to exercise to keep it in check, but he has been unable to work out since his hospitalization.\u00a0\u00a0What can be done? Please, he needs help.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Marlo",
