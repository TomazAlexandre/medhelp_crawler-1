            "answer": "I'm sorry no one has responded to your questions.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not too familiar with metformin, but I don't think it's addictive.\u00a0\u00a0I know it's quite often prescribed for people with PCOS or insulin resistance as well as full blow diabetes.Your doctor would be the one to determine if you need to be on this med for the rest of your life, but you said in your original question that he only prescribed it for 2 months.\u00a0\u00a0Some things (like thyroid med) are like that though.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can be prevented, usually with weight loss, proper diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you doctor has that in mind.Talk to your doctor - s/he is the one who will be able to answer your questions, specific to your case.Good luck",
