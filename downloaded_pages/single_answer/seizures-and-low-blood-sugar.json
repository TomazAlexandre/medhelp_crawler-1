            "answer": "Hello raider92,I am not a medical professional, so the most accurate info. will be that given by your son's pediatrician.\u00a0\u00a0I am a mother of a 10 yr. old who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 3.Here is the info. that I found in regards to hypoglycemia in non-diabetics\"For those who have symptoms of hypoglycemia and do not have diabetes, the disorder is diagnosed by:- measuring blood glucose levels while the child is experiencing the symptoms.- observing that the symptoms are relieved when the child eats food with a high content of sugar.- Laboratory tests to measure insulin production may also be performed.Treatment for hypoglycemia:Specific treatment for hypoglycemia will be determined by your child's physician based on:- your child's age, overall health, and medical historyextent of the disorder- your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies- expectations for the course of the disorder- your opinion or preference\"It was very smart of you to test your son's blood sugar during these episodes, as well as working with the pediatrician and neurologist.Please let us know the outcome.It does make sense that hypoglycemia could be the cause of the seizures, but I think the doctors will be the ones to best determine that.I am sure you will receive comments from others who know more about hypoglycemia in a non-diabetic.SS",

    "question": "My son was diagnosed with partial epilepsy at 4 months of age.\u00a0\u00a0He was put on anti-seizure medication.\u00a0\u00a0His seizures always happened in the morning and often left him limp and lethargic.\u00a0\u00a0He is now 20months old and continues to take seizure medication.\u00a0\u00a0There have been mornings in which he doesn't actually have a seizure, but is very limp and \"bug-eyed\".\u00a0\u00a0A few days ago, we took his blood sugar during one of these limp morning episodes.\u00a0\u00a0It was 43.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, we have taken it every morning and he has been as low as 37 and as high as 75.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, since there was nothing found in his EEG's and MRI in regards to a seizure disorder, could these episodes be brought on by low blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0How young can hypoglycemia become apparent and is there a blood test that could shed more light on this?\u00a0\u00a0I am working with my pediatrician and neurologist, but was curious if anyone else out there has experiences like ours.",
