            "answer": "I am glad to hear that your daughter is doing well. No, I have not heard anything about this kind of research in recent years. Most of the research I have been reading about involves attempts to prevent the immune system from attacking islet cells or research into various ways to encourage the body to re-grow its own islet cells. Or both.",

    "question": "My daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when she was 15 years old.\u00a0\u00a0The diagnosis was made as a result of blood tests done for a sports physical - she had not yet developed symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Looking for experimental treatments we found a doctor at the University of Michigan who was using a TB innoculation with newly diagnosed Type 1 patients.\u00a0\u00a0In spite of receiving the treatment, my daughter developed symptoms nine months later and started insulin injections.\u00a0\u00a0She has maintained excellent control over her diabetes for fifteen years and now has four beautiful children.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if anyone was familiar with that experimental treatment and any follow-up studies that may have been made.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your response.",
