    "question": "Hello,I was Dx with small fiber neuropathy two years ago. The first symptoms started about 5-6 years ago. I take Methadone, Lyrica, Cymbalta, and Hydrocodone to manage the pain. I also take several other medicines. I am a 49 year old male who drinks little water. This past summer I started to notice foam in the toilet each and every time. My (PCP) Primary Care Provider felt it was from all the medicine that I take. My creatinine was 1.6 in July and after a re-test it was 1.4 in late August which is normal for me. My BUN was 17. To date my nero has not found the reason for my neuropathy. He has suggested Amyloidosis, but feels it would have shown itself by now. I have no symptoms of an Amyloid. I am pre-diabetic, my A 1 C was 5.6. My PCP has given me a Rx for a complete blood work up. He said if the creatinine is high, he would order a 24 hour urine collection looking for protein. This is where I get scared! Amyloidosis is an illness that deposits protein on the bodies organs and foam in the toilet is a sign of protein leaking from the Kidney's. I was tested for Amyloidosis about 18 months ago and the result was negative. My PCP thinks my neuropathy is genetic. My dad and uncle both had neuropathy. My dad did develop diabetes years after his neuropathy started.Dr., do you think that taking several medicines could cause foam in the toilet?Do you also think that Amyloidosis would have shown itself by now (5-6 years after symptoms)?Thank you.",
