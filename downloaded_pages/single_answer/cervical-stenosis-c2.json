    "question": "I had an MRI which revealed severe cervical stenosis with disc bulge at C2.\u00a0\u00a0I am 78 years old and active. I have a history of hypertension and diabetes controlled with medication. I was told that I need surgery because if I were to be hit from behind or fall and hit my head, I could become paralyzed or risk death. Due to my age, I am very concerned that I am risking death anyway with the surgery. I only have neck pain at this point and no neurological symptoms. My question is whether conservative treatment would help or whether this is so lifethreatening that the benfit of surgery outweighs the risk of just living with it at my age.",
