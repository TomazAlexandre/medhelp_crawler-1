            "answer": "Yes, I certainly would want to explore the possibility of diabetes a bit more. I don't know what the urine test was (protein in her urine?) but the standard for diabetes is a fasting blood test called an A1C which shows blood sugar averages for a period of a couple months and/or an OGTT which would give her a very sweet drink and then test its influence on her blood sugar over a couple hours. I would press the doctor to do these tests and if not see a different doctor. It could be nothing, but that would be good to know as well.",
