            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Tingling sensations can be due to deep vein thrombosis or due to a clot in the deep veins. The sensations of pins and tingling are generally due to peripheral neuropathies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism and diabetes. Get a thyroid antibody test too.Neck strain, spondylotic changes in lumbo-sacral vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,I'm 18 years old, and 5 ft 2in. I have recently gained some weight, I went from being 100 lbs to 105 lbs (over 4 a period of months). I sometimes feel this tingling sensation in my leg, below my knee and above my ankle. It's always in the same place and is prominent on certain days. It has been going on for about two years, but occurred rarely (maybe about once a month). Yet, as of last week, it has been very prominent (occurs almost on a daily basis). I concerned because I'm not very old and I don't have any chronic illnesses that would cause it.Thank you for you help!",
