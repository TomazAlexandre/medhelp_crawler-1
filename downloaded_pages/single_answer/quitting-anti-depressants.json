    "question": "Hi, I have taken three courses of anti-depressants over the last 6 years, each time for a year to a year and a half. First time I took celaxa, second time celexa plus wellbutrin, then lexpro and wellbuterin. When I got out of the depression and was well for a few months I always wanted to get off the meds. After getting off I would end up in a phase off being more irritable. Last time I went off I also experienced insomnia, being irritable and eventually getting depressed again.Is is possible to experience mild manic symtoms from getting of anti-depressants or does this indicate bi-polar depression? Would it be better to stay on anti-depressants all the time in order to avoid relapse?",
