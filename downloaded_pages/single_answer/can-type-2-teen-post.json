Trust me - we all hate this disease (at least I do!).\u00a0\u00a0Don't know what you mean when you say \"out of control\".\u00a0\u00a0Sure hope you have a physician who can not only run test but put you on medication to help control this.My niece was over 18 when she discovered that she had Type 1 so I know that this stuff is quite crazy.\u00a0\u00a0This ailment runs in both sides of my family (my dad & my mother's brother)No matter what age you are when the Diabetes is discovered you need to have medical supervision & regular test.\u00a0\u00a0Don't know exactly what help you want here but give out more information and someone here will certainly have answers.\u00a0\u00a0Believe me - no matter what, we have all been through it.Anita",
