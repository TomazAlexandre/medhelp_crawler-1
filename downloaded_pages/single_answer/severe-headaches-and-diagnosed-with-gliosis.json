            "answer": "Hello my 90 yr. old grandmother was rushed to the hospital yesterday by ambulance with dry heaves, dehydration and a severe headache. She has a history of diabetes but her blood count was only 126 she was diagnosed with a Urinary tract Infection, she has no energy and can't walk so the hospital admitted her. They hooked her up to an IV and did further testing. The hospital gave her a cat scan that came back fine and is now doing an MRI and also a PET scan. They are given her morphine that at first was not helping her so they turned it up a notch and it seems to be working. I am quite concerned with her and her physician stated that the headache can be affiliated with her UTI. Can a UTI cause a headache so severe ? My girlfriend next door said that they may be looking for Cancer. Can this be true ? I am just trying to get the best care and tests done for my grandmother. Can you make any suggestions on further testing? Any help from anyone would be greatly appreciated.Thanks in Advannce to Anyone to Responds to this postingLinda Jimenez",

    "question": "In July 2005, I had a headache that felt like the top of my head was getting blowed off, and have had a few more episodes of such a severe type of headache, but have a daily headache that I describe as a \"hangover headache\", but I don't drink. CT scan & MRI showed multiple white matter lesions in the brain. I have been tried on Amitryptiline, vistaril, midrin, topamax, keppra, naprosyn, and none of them seem to help.\u00a0\u00a0Brain biopsy showed \"mild gliosis\", and I have been told that it looks like MS, but isn't. Headaches and mild confusion are my only symptoms. I have went to several doctors, and they really don't have any answers for me. My neurologist now and my family doctor are trying to help me, but haven't yet come up with anything. Has anyone reading this heard of anything similar to this, if so, PLEASE help me try to help myself.",
