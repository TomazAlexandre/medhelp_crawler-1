    "question": "Hello,I am a 23 year old male who rather regularly has had UTI problems.\u00a0\u00a0I can take ibuprophen and the \"burning\" sensation will go away on its own, or after drinking lots of water.\u00a0\u00a0I sometimes wonder if I can relate the problem to having too much alcohol or having too much caffeine.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been sexually active for quite sometime and know that it is not chlamydia.\u00a0\u00a0I will sometimes get this sensation after masturbating too.....Any thoughts? I'd appreciate any insight..Thanks.",
