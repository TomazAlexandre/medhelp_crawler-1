            "answer": "Well, your HDL cholesterol levels (aka the \"good\" and protective cholesterol) are pretty low. I was told that, in women, they want them to be at least 50 and above. Your ratio of LDL to HDL cholesterol is also disturbing.Your BMI of 26.1 puts you in the range for being overweight. How is your diet? Do you eat a lot of sugar and/or foods high in saturated fats (most fast food, fried food and even breakfast foods at places like iHop) Do you work out regularly?According to mayoclinic.org, heart.org and my school textbooks (I'm an RN student), your optimal total cholesterol (HDL + LDL + 20% of your triglyceride level) will be a number less than or equal to 180-200 mg/dL, so your result of 256 is a bit high, particularly if you are already at risk for heart disease.Your LDL of 173 is also considered high, especially considering how low your HDL is. A really good (read potent) fish oil supplement could possibly help lower this number for you (depending on why it's high)Triglycerides levels of 200-499 are considered high, so your result of 233 means that you should make a follow-up appointment to get education on why your numbers are high and what you can do to lower (and raise in the case of HDL) them. Statin drugs may\u00a0\u00a0be suggested and perhaps Niacin to raise the HDL level, but only your practitioner can tell you what you should do there. Please take my humble advice with a grain of salt. I am currently trying to raise my HDL level as well.Your A1C is normal. It's a test used to assess blood glucose management over an extended period. Higher levels can indicate diabetes, however other factors could also be at play.Hope I've helped some. Have a good day!",
