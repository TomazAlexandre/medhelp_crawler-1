            "answer": "Hi,Neuropathy from diabetes really is a troublesome complication and it can be hard to treat. The first thing you need to do is make sure your glucoses are well controlled as this can stop further damage from happening, and maybe even improve some symptoms you have now. There are a number of good medications on the market that are used for this including Lyrica and Gabapentin--please speak to your doctor about those. A referral to a Neurologist is often a good idea so you can have a formal examination, and know about some other possible treatments that can be offered.Take care. This is my last day on Medhelp but please return in future as there will be another physician then.",
