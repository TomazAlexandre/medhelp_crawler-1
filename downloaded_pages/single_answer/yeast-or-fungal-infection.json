            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Chronic diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations, hence a stool test is a must.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc. HIV too could be a cause, though chances are less after a single unprotected oral sex.

    "question": "2 months ago I started having frequent diarrhea, Afterwards my groin area would itch on and off. I did take antibotics for an abscess in my mouth around this time but not sure if it was before these symptoms started. My first thought was some std since I did have a sexual encounter at this time but no symptoms and sex was condom procted, except oral. My genital area will sometimes have an odor as well. Is this a yeast of fungal infection?",
