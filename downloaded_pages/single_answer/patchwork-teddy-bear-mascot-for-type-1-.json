    "question": "I have an adult friend who has had type 1 diabetes since she was a kid. She was diagnosed in the 80s. A few years ago she mentioned that there is a juvenile or type 1 diabetes mascot. We are \"online\" friends so this information was written to me not actually spoken so I could be forgetting some important details about what she actually said. Does anyone know of a mascot for type 1? If memory serves it was a teddy bear and had something to do with patchwork. Either her/his whole body was patchwork or parts of him/her were. He/she might have even been multicolored. I thought she/he had a human name as well. Again this description might be my own fabrication but these are the pieces of the conversation I think I recall. She had mentioned that she wanted to make this mascot into a plush bear. If I'm right about what I remember and this bear exists I plan to make it for her for Christmas. So any information, photos, descriptions would be greatly appreciated. I would ask her but I think it might get her thinking about why I suddenly brought it up and the surprise would be spoiled. Hopefully someone here can help me? Thanks!Patchwork Teddy Bear Mascot for Type 1? If you know anything about it please contact me.",
