    "question": "I had a very jolting pain yesterday, like 20 knives sticking me in my middle left back. I got up and walked it off in one minute. The left side of my body felt a little numb but went away in 2 hours, I still have a slight headache this morning.Reading many posts, 9 out of 10 strokes have no pain? I thinking this was a pinched nerve? I can't stand to go to the hospital/emergency it would have made me more jittery and maybe another pinched nerve?I have Diabetes, high blood pressure, but this is in very good control.Any thoughts? please? thanks.Al",
