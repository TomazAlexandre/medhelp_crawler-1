    "question": "Posted By Rebby on July 25, 1998 at 16:54:35:Today on the news,I heard that a person with Type2 diabetes has 6 more times the chance of having a heart attack than one who already has had a heart attack with no diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I had a miscarriage last year and had no history of sugar problem\u00a0\u00a0 Two months after the miscarriage, I was feeling bad and none of the doctors discovered my sugar problem.\u00a0\u00a0My mother did by buying a kit in the drug store.\u00a0\u00a0It registered bright gold (the highest listed) My sugar was 300 when I saw the doctor. He put me on a lil pill and it brought the sugar down...Last week, I had blood work again without fasting and it registered 109.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor took me off that little pill and will check my blood again in a month.\u00a0\u00a0Question:\u00a0\u00a0Even if one has type2 diabetes under control, should I\u00a0\u00a0expect a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know if my pregnancy caused this or genetics or by me being 30 lbs. overweight.\u00a0\u00a0Mom is not diabetic nor is my Dad or my brother. Great g'ma was (maternal) and Great g'pa was (paternal)\u00a0\u00a0 Should I stay on diabetes meds the rest of my life even though it is within normal at this time to prevent a Heart Attack...I am very concerned by today's medical report on TV.\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you, doctor.....Rebby\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0P.S. What causes pregnancy to bring on diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My husband would like to know this also.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again.",
