            "answer": "Hello,Such non healing of anal fissure even after surgery can occur if there is any recurrent fissure or the anal fissure extends into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed (internal anal sphincter). This makes it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal.For these non healing anal fissures, it is advisable to get these two possibilities evaluated from your operating surgeon.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hello,In October last year I had an anal fissure surgery. It was supposed to be a very simple procedure, but it went wrong because the wound hasn't heal. I've been in pain and bleeding for the last eight months so this has turned into a major issue in my life.I am following a treatment with my proctologist, but I don't see any change and I believe my condition now belongs to the dermatologist area.I live in Berlin, Germany. I am a man, 37 years old. I just ran a diabetes test and I don't seem to have it.What would be your advise?Thank you so much",
