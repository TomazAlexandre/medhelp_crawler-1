            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Yes, you must consult a doctor. Insect bites that do not heal could be due to infection or due to high blood sugar as in diabetes. Frequent scratching can cause infection to enter from the nails. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
