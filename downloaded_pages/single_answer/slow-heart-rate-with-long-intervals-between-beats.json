            "answer": "_Dear Mary,Firstly, there are a number of physicians answering the questions on varying days, and as it states in the opening of this forum, the questions will be answered as soon as possible and more than likely with in 4 or 5 business days.As for your question, the exact mechanism by which the diabetes leads to a malfunctioning sinus node is not known, but surely the cause is related.\u00a0\u00a0Smoking if anything speeds up the heart like caffeine.Smoking is deadly as it is, BUT in a diabetic, it is even more deadly.\u00a0\u00a0Tell your husband that he is at greater risk for heart disease (heart attacks and heart failure), loss of a limb from poor circulation, and loss of the ability to have an erection, kidney failure-JUST from the diabetes AND HE IS MAKING HIS RISK MUCH WORSE BY SMOKING.I hope this information is useful. Information provided in the heart forum is forgeneral purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Only your physician can provided specific diagnoses and therapies.Feel free to write back with further questions. Good luck!If you would like to make an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Heart Center, pleasecall 1-800-CCF-CARE or inquire online by using the Heart Center website atwww.ccf.org/heartcenter.
