            "answer": "Hi!On the scalp, localized hair loss or failure of hair to grow can be due to scarring alopecia (discoid lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, lichen planopilaris), alopecia areata, tinea capitis (fungal infection), sarcoidosis, and other such conditions. All these can become painful, cause localized swelling and the pain may radiate to upper arm. You could also be having a pinched nerve in addition to this. TMJ is another possibility. It can also be due to staphylococcal skin infections. A culture sensitivity of the pus can tell which antibiotic will best help eradicate the infection. If your blood sugar is high as in diabetes, then too you can get recurrent boils. Please consult a skin specialist and your PCP regarding this.\u00a0\u00a0You may need to consult a neurologist too.Take care!",

    "question": "I have pain in my head, teeth, neck, and down my arm all on the left side of my body. My head swells up from time to time and my neck gets little lump like spots on it . My head swells on the right side to but in the back of my head. In those spots where my head swells the hair won't grow either. This has become more and more painful and is making me think tumor or tumors. Can someone please tell me what's going on?",
