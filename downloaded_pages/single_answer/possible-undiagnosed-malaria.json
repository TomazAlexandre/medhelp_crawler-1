            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Malaria is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium, which is transmitted via the bites of infected mosquitoes. Symptoms of malaria include fever, headache, and vomiting, and usually appear between 10 and 15 days after the mosquito bite.Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease and prevents deaths.People with untreated malaria would not last for as long as 12 years. Diabetes, however, may present with\u00a0\u00a0the symptoms that you mentioned especially if the blood sugar is not controlled. Check with your doctor for proper evaluation. Take care and best regards.",

    "question": "HiI'm a 43yr old male, was very active in my teens and 20s, but after visiting Goa on honeymoon 12 years ago, I noticed that my energy levels were low, I was exhausted most of the time and had difficulty thinking straight.I had numerous blood tests to no avail - finally 2 years ago I demanded a stringent series of tests from my GP and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.Although management of my blood sugar levels have helped a bit, I can't help but wonder if the honeymoon to Goa instigated this, and whether glucose intolerance is a secondary complication to a more serious issue.Is it possible to contract malaria, but not be diagnosed with it, not get really ill, but have long term health issues?",
