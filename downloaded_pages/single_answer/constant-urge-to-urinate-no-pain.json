            "answer": "Hello,Since you are having unprotected intercourse, so first would be to rule out any pregnancy since frequent urination is one of the earliest symptoms of pregnancy. I would suggest you to get your serum HCG levels estimated for that.The other causes are diabetes, diabetes insipidus,glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism. In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen , intravenous pyelography , thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis. I sincerely advice you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
