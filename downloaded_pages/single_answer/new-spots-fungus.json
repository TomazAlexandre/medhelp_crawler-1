            "answer": "Hello,Various reasons for recurrent or persistent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Treatment resistance can be overcome by applying a cream with a combination of antifungals (Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1% and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%). You can also take oral antifungals after consulting your dermatologist.Hope it helps. Take care and do keep us posted on how you are doing.",
