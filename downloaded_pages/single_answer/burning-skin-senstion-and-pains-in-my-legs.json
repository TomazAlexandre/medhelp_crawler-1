            "answer": "Hello Paul.Hope your burning sensation is lesser as you are reading this.I suspect a neuropathy in here. These symptoms are typical of neuropathy. We have different nerve endings spread throughout the body in our skin. These serve to make us aware of the surroundings. When these nerves are affected by any disease or injury / compression, neuropathy ensues. The nerves transmit too many or too less of sensations. That's why you have the burning sensation.There can be different causes for neuropathy. Some of the common ones are diabetic neuropathy, demyelinating neuropathy and compression neuropathy.Do you have diabetes? Since you may have hypertension, you should also screen for diabetes. These two conditions are often encountered together.Have you had any problems with the neck?Regards",

In the last few months I has also had aching pains in my shins. I have also has a dull ache in my left side. I have been to my doctor and she has said I have hyper tension.
