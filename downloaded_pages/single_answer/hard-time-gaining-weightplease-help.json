            "answer": "Did you get your thyroid antibodies checked when you had thyroid bloodwork done? You might have Graves disease, which can cause nodules on the thyroid, in addition to making it very difficult to gain weight (it's like your metabolism is super-fast when it shouldn't be). Did you have an adrenal panel done, as well, to check for adrenal insufficiency? Diabetes should also be included in the differential--did you have your blood sugar levels checked recently?If you're a hypochondriac and you have the tendency to worry a lot, you might have a fast metabolism to begin with...meaning you're burning off most of what you intake, which probably isn't helping your situation.Keep me posted; I'm interested in hearing if the doctors are able to find anything.",
