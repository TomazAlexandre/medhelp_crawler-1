    "question": "Hi,I am a 30 year old female of ideal weight for my height and last night i wet the bed, seemingly for mo reason at all. I am currently undergoing all sorts of tests as I have had no periods for over 3 years, somehow in the middle of this I managed to get pregnant, which my partner and I were delighted about. My baby is now 11 months old and my periods have not returned.I am under an endocrinologist as there seems to be a problem with my pituitary function, I also have a swelling on the left side of my abdomen that has been confirmed to not be a hernia, it is also very painful for me to have intercourse and also for my nurse to carry out a smear test. I have recently had antibiotics for a water infection and feel as though there is pressure on my bladder but have never experienced incontinence or bed wetting before, I am quite concerned and I don't know if any of these factors mentioned above could be linked.I would appreciate your opinion.Many thanks.",
