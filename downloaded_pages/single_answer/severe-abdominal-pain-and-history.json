    "question": "I am a 48 yr old woman. In 2003 I had my gallbladder removed after years of episodes of pain that came and went. within a year I also developed diabetes. Given my age and weight they diagnosed me with type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0For months I complained that I was still having the same problems and high blood sugars. And was told it takes time. Meanwhile I was losing weight unintentionally.\u00a0\u00a0In Feb of 2004 I was rushed to the hospital for ketoacidosis.\u00a0\u00a0The hopitalist in charge of my case said that I was not type 2 infact I was type 1.\u00a0\u00a0Within 2 more months again I was hospitalized again with the same thing. I am now on two types of insulin and still have trouble with my blood sugars, but not nearly as bad as they where. over the past few years I have had frozen shoulder in both my arms and have also developed severe neuropathy in my legs and lower back that affect my lower organs. I have been told that I have diabetes due to an non aids autoimmune problem.\u00a0\u00a0Recently I have had trouble eating. I can only eat very little before I am full and have a stomach ache or feel nauseous. On Jan 4th I was rushed to the hospital with severe upper abdominal pain, nausea, and constant vomiting . They didn't do much for me ... gave me a bag of IV fluids and phynagrin.\u00a0\u00a0When they wheeled me out to my car I was still vomiting ( just plain bad care in my book, but anyway) So, the question I am getting at is, could this actually all be caused from chronic pancreatitis. i know that in some cases sometimes there is no pain and at others sever pain. Could I have developed diabetes and now having adominal pain be the actual cause of my problem have always been pandreatitus that was not caught and not actual autoimmune as was told to me. And if so how and where do I get help. I have a difficult time getting doctors to listen to me. Case in point I have been unable to get adequet pain management for my neuropathy and have suffered greatly over the past few years. I am worried that this may be the problem and if not taken care of properly could be the end of me. Please help!",
