    "question": "I have Hashimoto for over 7 years, and just got the diagnosis of diabetes two months ago. With the ultrasound test, my left kidney length is 13.7cm and right one is 13cm. I am 172cm tall Asian female. Is it the normal size? I googled and found the normal size should be less than 12cm. But I had some urnine test and my doctor said the kidney function seems OK. Since I had diabetes I feel nervous of my kidney function. Do I need to see a Nephrologist?Many thanks",
