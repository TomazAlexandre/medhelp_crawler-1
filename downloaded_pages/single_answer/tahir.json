            "answer": "Hi,How are you? It is difficult to say what it is without examination. But the most common causes of non healing of a wound could be infection, disruption of blood supply to that part of the body, diabetes, infection etc.As you mentioned that pus oozes from that wound, I would suggest to get a culture done of the pus, which would help in using the appropriate antibiotic for that infection.Consult your orthopaedician to rule out all the possible causes for this.Best",
