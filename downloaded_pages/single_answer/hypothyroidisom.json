            "answer": "Vitiligo is common in people with certain autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases that are associated with vitiligo include: hyperthyroidism (overactivity of the thyroid gland), adrenocortical insufficiency (the adrenal gland does not produce enough of the hormone corticosteroid), alopecia areata (patches of baldness), and pernicious anemia (a low level of red blood cells caused by the failure of the body to absorb vitamin B12).In some cases Vitiligo may be hereditary and run in families.The basis for the association between vitiligo and\u00a0\u00a0autoimmune diseases is not well understood. Moreover, the connection between them seems optional. Most people with vitiligo, fortunately, have no autoimmune disease such as hyperthyroidism, adrenocortical insufficiency, alopecia areata or pernicious anemia.",
