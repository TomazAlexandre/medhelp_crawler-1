            "answer": "Hi there,There are certain prerequisites to be followed before a person can be considered eligible to donate kidneys. A person with a history of prior or current kidney disease, human immunodeficiency virus or cancer cannot be a donor. The donor should not be significantly overweight or have a history of alcohol abuse. A person suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes, mental illness or heart disease cannot donate kidneys. Someone suffering from serious infectious disease cannot donate kidneys. Your daughter was suffering from mono and cervical cancer years ago to which as you said she has been cured. So you may discuss with the transplant doctor about the chances of her being a potential donor for you. Do keep us posted.Take care and regards!",
