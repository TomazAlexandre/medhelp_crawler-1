            "answer": "Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults is serious. Within 3-15 years, people with LADA will have to take insulin. LADA is associated with being insulin resistant.Former University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics worker Billie claimed Type 2 sometimes turns into Type 1. However, she more likely carries LADA. She is five ft 8 1/2 inches tall; she is brunette. Billie more likely carries LADA because she has a family history of both Type 1 and Type Two diabetes.",

    "question": "Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults is STRONGLY similar to both Types One & Two Diabetes. Contrary to the usual beliefs, some people carrying Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (LADA) DO have family history of Type 2 Diabetes. Family's History of Type 1 may be also there for some LADA people. Furthermore, some people having LADA ARE overweight or obese (mildly to moderately). LADA is also characterized by being insulin resistant, similar to Type 2; unlike T2DM, however, metabolic syndrome is NOT present. Individuals having LADA progress from having to use oral medications to having to use insulin between three and fifteen years following so-called Type 2 diagnoses. In contrast to LADA, 10% to 29.9% of those with real Type 2 use certain insulin medicines; ALL Type 1s use insulin RIGHT from diagnoses. LADA, though, begins differently than Types One and Two: it has insulin resistance matching Type 2, though hits people REGARDLESS of skinny or overweight-obese. LADA was first observed around 1990, though might have begun during early to mid Seventeen Hundreds.",
