    "question": "I've been having pins and needles in my feet since November. I've been to my PCP and 2 neurologists. All tests have come back negative for diabetes, hypothyroidism, ncs, ms and scoliosis. I used to take an anti-seizure medication for migraines more than 10 years ago, could this be source of my problem? I also have HSV- 2, could this cause chronic pins and needles?",
