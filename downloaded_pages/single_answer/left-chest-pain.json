            "answer": "If you are having chest pain, you should probably see a doctor and have it looked into. Six years was a long time ago, and a lot could change in that time frame. Aside from family history, without knowing your risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, tobacco use, etc), it is hard to know how much risk you have for coronary artery disease.Chest pain related to heart disease is usually described as a heaviness in the chest, sometimes radiating to the jaw or left arm, sometimes associated with shortness of breath, nausea, sweatiness, and/or lightheadedness. However, that does not mean that everyone who has coronary artery disease will have these symptoms.Typically, a pain that is \"constant\" as you describe is not from the heart.If the pain continues to happen, I would definitely talk to your doctor about it.",

    "question": "I have aches/pains in the left side of my chest, it seems constant. My left arm will ache as well. I've been diagnosed a long time ago with mitral valve prolapse. My mother and her paternal side of family have a strong history of heart problems.\u00a0\u00a0Frankly, I don't know what I'm feeling...I know it's not \"right\". I don't want to over react and scare everyone but I don't want to be a fool either.\u00a0\u00a0Approx. 6 years ago, I had a very strong 'chest pain\" that seems to last for several hours to a day. I made an appt with my Dr. A stress test, ekg, blood work etc. all were normal. It was determined at the same time I had some female issues that were surgically corrected. On Monday, I will have some dental work done and I am getting apprehensive.\u00a0\u00a0I need some advise and guidance with out panicking my family.",
