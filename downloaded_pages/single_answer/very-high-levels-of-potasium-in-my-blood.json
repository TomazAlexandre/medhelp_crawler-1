            "answer": "Hello,High potassium levels in blood is called hyperkalemia which is normally 3.6 to 4.8 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) and in hyperkalemia it is higher than 6.0 mEq/L and occurs due to kidney disease, kidney failure, Addison\u2019s disease, alcoholism, Excessive use of potassium supplements or diabetes type 1.Sometimes there may be a false increase in the potassium levels which may be caused by the rupture of blood cells in the blood sample during or shortly after drawing the sample. The ruptured cells leak their potassium into the sample. Hence get a repeat sampling done after a few days.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I recently had some blood work done due to feeling extremely fatigued and \"not myself\" the results came back that my potasium levels were extremely high. My doctor told me to avoid eating any foods high in Potasium. My problem is, once I researched what foods to stay away from I realized that I never eat any of the foods that were on the list? So I'm curious as to what could've caused my levels to be so high in the first place? Also, if it's not the food, what else can I do to bring the level down?",
