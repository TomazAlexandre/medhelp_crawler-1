            "answer": "Hi,A seizure occurs when there is a sudden change in behavior due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. There are a wide variety of possible causes which include developmental problems, genetic conditions present at birth, or injuries near the time of birth. Brain injury due to trauma as well as metabolic abnormalities can happen at any age and can result from: complications of diabetes, kidney failure and uremia, liver failure, nuritional deficiencies, or use of cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol, or certain other recreational drugs. Other differential that should be ruled out are: infectious in nature, or\u00a0\u00a0tumor. It is important that her medication is regularly taken to avoid future occurrences. Further testing may need to be done to determine the underlying cause.Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hi, my wife had a seizure back in June 1, 2005 and gave her medication to control the seizure. One year ago the doctor removed her from taking the medication, and this year on Dec 25, 2008 at 10:45 PM she went into a seizure and they put her back on medication and also prohibit her from driving for one year. This seizure has happened when she went to sleep, but not every time she goes to sleep. It's occasional, while under the medication she is normal, but when she was not taking the medication it took about one year and then she went into seizure. I'm trying to determine if it is lack of oxygen or something else. She had a Pulmonary Embolism in Aug 2004, and was pregnant at that time and also had a miscarriage, and now she is on coumadin. She fell down the stairs few months later and then in June 2005 she had the seizure. She don't like the medicine because it makes her dizzy and a little memory disorder. Any ideas to this problem? Help!",
