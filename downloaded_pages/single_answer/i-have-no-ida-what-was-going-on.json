Sine in the stds examen i had antibodies for Hep B, now i don't remenbered if i took a shoot or i got it in this sexual contact. I also had herpes 1Can herpes 1 and Antibodies for hep b delay antibodies for hiv to show up?Can hepB caused the fever, rash? i remenber that after the exposure my urine was dark yellow,I have read the oraquick look for hiv 1, and oraquick advance for both. The label in those clicnis said oraquick only, so i guees they just look for hiv 1, Now i think i have hiv 2. How rare is hiv 2 in the US? I'm just nervos because i don't want to die i;m jus 26 yrs old and i had my life in 1 direction, now...how long can i live if i have hiv 2?Which one is worst, 1 or 2?i think 5 months is enough time to my body to show up antibodies, but i don't know what to think.If i'm infected, can i have kids w/o infecting my wife and y kid?just remembering this fever and the rash that i have in my arms reminds me about hiv eventhough my last test after 5 mons and 1 day is negative.I took the test but i ate like 40-50 min before could that affect the negative result?Thank you once again for your time.HIV is a cronic but managable deasese like diabetes/?",
