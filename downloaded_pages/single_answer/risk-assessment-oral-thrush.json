            "answer": "I think the PA overstated things.\u00a0\u00a0While it is appropriate for the PA to consider both HIV and diabetes since thrush is seen at increased rates with both of these disorders, not everyone or even most people with thrush have either diabetes or thrush.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, while if the PA thought you had thrush it probably was, there are many other benign oral processes which can mimic thrush.\u00a0\u00a0If you were treated for thrush and got better, this is probably what was going on but, just to be clear, all that appears to be thrush is not.Thrush occurs when fungus (called Candida) which is present in nearly everyone's mouth for some reason overgrows.\u00a0\u00a0As mentioned above diabetes and HIV (as it advances) can both lead to thrush.\u00a0\u00a0In your case, the sexual history you provide suggest that you are at low risk for HIV.\u00a0\u00a0Your partners are relatively low risk and you have taken appropriate precautions (condoms) with your higher risk partners.\u00a0\u00a0Having said that, while there is nothing in your history or description to cause me to call you high risk or to worry.\u00a0\u00a0I predict your HIV test will be negative.\u00a0\u00a0 On the other hand, you describe unprotected sex with multiple partners and have not been regularly tested.\u00a0\u00a0Thus you qualify for periodic STD \"screening (testing in the absence of symptoms) because you have had multiple partners over a period of less than a year.\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of personal protection, we recommend annual testing for anyone who has had two or more sex partners in the past year (we consider this to be health maintenance- we also recommend you get your blood pressure and cholesterol checked regularly).Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0EWH",

    "question": "Dear Dr.,\u00a0\u00a0I recently visited a physicians assistant-I was having discomfort on my tongue.\u00a0\u00a0This could be related to kissing a high class sex worker (used a condom for sex).\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, he scrapped my tongue and looked at it under the miscroscope and diagnosed me with thrush.He also ordered a diabetes test (negative) and HIV test, since I am a healthy 30 yr orld not using medication.My last hiv test was about 4 yrs ago (negative).\u00a0\u00a0My profile and sexual history are as such.\u00a0\u00a0I am a drug-free, circumsized, heterosexual, I have never had an STD, and I only have vaginal sex.\u00a0\u00a0In the last 4 yrs, I have had 5 sex partners.\u00a0\u00a03 were girlfriends, who told me they were hiv negative; with whom I had monogamous relationships (we didn't use condoms because of our agreement).\u00a0\u00a01 was a sex worker with whom I had protected sex with but at the time I had a fresh cut on my scrotum from trimming my pubic hair earlier in the day.\u00a0\u00a0Finally I had one 1 night stand (vaginal sex) with a female physician without using a condom.\u00a0\u00a0My questions are:1)\u00a0\u00a0What do you think is my general risk?2)\u00a0\u00a0The physician assistant strongly suggested the thrush could be HIV related.\u00a0\u00a0Would thrush usually present itself so early or is it more associated with AIDS patients?\u00a0\u00a0Do you think the thrush is hiv related?\u00a0\u00a0The PA insisted my immune system could be compromised because \"the thrush should have self corrected\" (my appointment was 4 weeks into the thrush symptoms).\u00a0\u00a0I was surprised by his insistence since I generally I feel healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I have gained about 10 lbs each year and I really haven't even had a cold in the past two years.\u00a0\u00a0I am waiting for my hiv results but I am very worried. Your comments would be very helpful.",
