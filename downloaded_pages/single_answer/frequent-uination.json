            "answer": "Hi,How are you? It is good that urine tests and culture showed normal results after treatment. Aside from infection, your symptoms may also be caused by diabetes, caffeine, interstitial cystitis, medication side effect, overactive bladder syndrome,\u00a0\u00a0anxiety, vaginitis or pelvis growth. Additional diagnostic tests like cystometry, cystoscopy, ultrasound and complete neurological test may need to be done to determine the underlying cause. Take care and do keep us posted.",
