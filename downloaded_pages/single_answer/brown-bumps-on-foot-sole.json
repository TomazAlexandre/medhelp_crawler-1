            "answer": "Hello,One of the possibilities for your symptoms can be lichen planus of the sole of the foot. The other possibility is of hyperkeratotic papules like corn or callus.I suggest you to get it examined from a dermatologist because you have a history of skin malignancies. Although it does not sound like any melanoma, but it needs to be ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am a 19 year old female with medium dark complexion. There is a history of diabetes in my family.Three days ago I noticed a brown, circular, dime sized spot on the sole of my right foot. There are pin ***** sized raised bumps in it, that do not itch or hurt. I remember a smaller spot on that same location a couple of weeks ago, very close to a pin ***** raised bump with the brown color.I have used cortizone and antibacterial creams on it, however, the spot is still there.",
