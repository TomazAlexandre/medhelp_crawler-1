            "answer": "Hi,There are some reports of conservative surgery (involving preservation of the penis) but this requires radiation treatment after surgery with chemotherapy given during radiation (this was done in the UK).This kind of cancer is pretty rare, hence, it would be hard to find a clinical trial, most of the experience is likely through accumulation of cases. Most trials are usually done in hospitals with university ties- you may want to look at some cancer centers in your area.Your concern with recurrence despite surgical intervention is valid. Since the cases are few, the power of such statistics to predict individual outcome though is not as strong as the statistics for more common cancers.You could discuss your issues with your doctor. Diabetes is generally problematic when it is uncontrolled. If you have adequate control, there shouldn\u2019t be much risk added with this additional problem.Stay positive.",

    "question": "Hi DavidC. I have also have been diagnosed with urethral cancer (adenocarcinoma) last July 2007. The mass was seen at the posterior bulbomembranous urethra. Surgical excision of the mass was done. I had undergone an external radiation therapy from december to january (with about 28 sessions). I had an MRI done last April 4, and it shows that there is a recurrence of the mass in the region of the bulbomembranous urethra and is already extending into the surrounding perineum including the ishio-cavernous muscle with anterior portion of the levator ani and outer layer of the anterior rectum. it also infiltrates a portion of the inner gland of the prostate gland. there is also a small irregular enhancing focus in the floor of the urinary bladder adjacent to the prostatic urethra which appears to be an extension of the mass. My doctor advised me to have a radical cystoprostatectomy and penectomy (exit bladder, urethra prostate and penis), and he will make a urinary diversion (ileal conduit). i am 50 years old and a diabetic. i am very much concerned with the wound healing and chances of survival after the surgery. i've read that there is 50% chance of recurrence even when surgery is done. i currently have a urinary catheter, and i am experiencing mild infections. i would like to know the progress of your treatment. i hope you can share it to me.i also hope that someone can help me with this and advise me on what's the best treatment option for my case. i am also interested in clinical trials if there are any, so please do inform me about this matter.",
