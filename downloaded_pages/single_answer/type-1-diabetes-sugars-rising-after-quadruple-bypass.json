    "question": "My friend has type 1 diabetes and recently underwent a quadruple bypass surgery. When released they put him on a sliding scale of long acting lantus for night and novo rapid during the day. Since then his blood sugars keep rising no matter what he eats or how much? Has this happened to anyone out there and if so what did they do to level out the sugars???",
