    "question": "I am 35, had 75% of my thyroid removed at 21 be/c of a tumor.\u00a0\u00a0At the time, I didn't know it was a big deal and left the details to my parents.\u00a0\u00a0I was told 25% is the minimum function before needing medication.\u00a0\u00a0Originally thought to be cancer- my Dr. took all that was connected to the tumor.\u00a0\u00a0I have not taken any medication and get my blood checked every few yrs- levels have been fine.\u00a0\u00a0Now I have severe kidney pain (could be something else- in that area) gaining weight/loosing muscle texture, and having trouble regulating body temperature at night.\u00a0\u00a0I was told tyroid levels could be checked all together- giving you a false sense of \"normal\" levels.\u00a0\u00a0I really want to avoid medication if I can (at least before having children).\u00a0\u00a0The kidney pain is getting harder to deal with- it seems many here are dealing with the same thing w/out Dr's knowing how to treat them.\u00a0\u00a0What type of Dr. do I see? Urologist?\u00a0\u00a0Any feedback?",
