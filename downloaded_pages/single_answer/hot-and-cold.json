            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are a lady in menopausal age group, then it could be due to hormone imbalance. You would need to consult your gynecologist regarding this. Hormone replacement therapy usually helps. Alcohol, certain drugs, allergy to food additives, heat intolerance, hot beverages and food, anxiety, orthostatic hypotension, certain endocrine disorders like those involving the adrenals, thyroid, diabetes etc all cause facial flushing or face blowing hot and cold. If there is a flush only during the day and after sports then it could be heat sensitivity. Apply cold compress on and off during the day. Splash a lot of cold water (not freezing cold but cool) on face on and off. See if this helps.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Take care!",
