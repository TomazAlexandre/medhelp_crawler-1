            "answer": "Please be careful, patients are not permitted to fly when there is a large air bubble present inside the eye. When a person travels by air, there are changes in air pressure which can result in expansion of the air bubble and increased eye pressure. In order to prevent this complication, patients are restricted from any type of air travel until the bubble is nearly gone, or small enough that the patient\u2019s eye care provider considers it safe to fly. Your eye surgeon will\u00a0\u00a0need to give you clearance before you fly.\u00a0\u00a0As far as the time frame is concerned most patients fall into the 6 to 9 month category before getting cleared for air travel.\u00a0\u00a0This time frame may vary based on size (area) of surgery and air bubble. Also, pre-exsisting conditions such as diabetes may increase your healing time.I hope this helps.",
