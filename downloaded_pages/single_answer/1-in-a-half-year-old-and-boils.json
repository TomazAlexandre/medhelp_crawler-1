            "answer": "Hi!If there is a history of diabetes in the family, please get her tested for juvenile diabetes. Usually children with diabetes get recurrent boils and skin infections. Diaper rash and allergy can also cause this type of problem. So make her wear cotton panties. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "My daughter is 1 1/2 an she has been getting these boils on the outer of her private area and on her butt cheeks, this has been happing since she was 6 months, the first time they tested it and said that it was MRSA but the second time they said there was no sign of MRSA..that they just happen for some people. I have put hot/warm compresses on them every time, along with her soaking in warm baths 2-3 times a day and they will not bust/drain on their own, this will be the fifth one that she has had and it has became a pain, because we have had to get them lanced and drained every time which is very painful for her. I don't know what else to do or if there is any thing else that we can do?",
