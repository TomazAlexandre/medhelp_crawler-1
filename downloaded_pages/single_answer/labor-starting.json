    "question": "Okay I apologize for how long this will be but I wanna include all details. I'm a ftm 33+3 weeks with a boy. I have diet controlled gestational diabetes. I have been to the hospital three times for preterm contractions and once for preterm labor due to a car accident. As of last Thursday I wasn't dilated at all and not effaced. Yesterday was my day off and everyone told me I was nesting cause I cleaned the whole house, all the babys clothes, and bottles. Today I came to work at 7am and at about\u00a0\u00a08:30 starting having very light contractions but everytime id have one id feel like I was gonna puke. Now they've been getting stronger(probably a 5 out of 10) and I feel really sick and I have a ton of pressure in my pelvis and it's hurting to walk. Could this be labor starting? I have a drs appointment after work but I'm so uncomfortable id just like answers.",
