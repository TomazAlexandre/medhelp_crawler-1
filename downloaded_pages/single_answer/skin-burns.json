            "answer": "Dear Tonkee:It looks like you may have peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes.This is from National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse (NDIC) on \"Diabetic Neuropathies: The Nerve Damage of Diabetes\":**************************************************************************************\"Diabetic neuropathies are a family of nerve disorders caused by diabetes. People with diabetes can, over time, develop nerve damage throughout the body. Some people with nerve damage have no symptoms. Others may have symptoms such as pain, tingling, or numbness\u2014loss of feeling\u2014in the hands, arms, feet, and legs. Nerve problems can occur in every organ system, including the digestive tract, heart, and sex organs.About 60 to 70 percent of people with diabetes have some form of neuropathy. People with diabetes can develop nerve problems at any time, but risk rises with age and longer duration of diabetes. The highest rates of neuropathy are among people who have had diabetes for at least 25 years. Diabetic neuropathies also appear to be more common in people who have problems controlling their blood glucose, also called blood sugar, as well as those with high levels of blood fat and blood pressure and those who are overweight.\"http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/neuropathies/**************************************************************************************It is very important for you to have regular physician and clinic visits with your diabetes. What is your fasting blood glucose? What is your A1C? How about your blood pressure and cholesterol?I see you are taking metformin, which is an effective anti-diabetic medication. However, it is important to know if you are under control by knowing your personal medical data. Please know that in order to achieve the best diabetes management, you need more than medications. You also need to be proactive in eating healthy and in active lifestyle. Please join American Diabetes Association for more education.Since it is outside of my scope as a pharmacist to diagnose, you need to consult your physician for further accurate assessment.Take care!For more information, please go to:1.
