    "question": "I was wondering that now a days it's been said that for pregnant women a 100g Glucose and 3 hrs test gives a valid result as compared to 75 g glucose 2hrs test. What do you say about it? I live in Oman and had my GTT with fasting level of 3.89 and after 75 g 2 hrs test 8.6 mm/mol. After this I was required to do a hyperglycemic profile and it was normal. I took the GTT in the evening and I was wondering my high blood sugar level might be due to slow metabolism in the evening. I am now required to repeat the test and I was wondering that should I ask for a 100g Glucose 3 hours test instead of usual 75 g 2 hrs test? Your comments would be really helpful.Kind RegardsRitu Mehraa",
