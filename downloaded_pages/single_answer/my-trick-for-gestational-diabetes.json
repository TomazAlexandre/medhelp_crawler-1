    "question": "Okay hey guys... I was told I got gestational diabetes a few weeks back and I have been struggling with only my fasting numbers as my numbers after my meals were fine. But to cut the long story short for those also struggling with just their fasting numbers; this might sound silly but it really works for me. Eat something sweet before you go to bed e.g. A sweet, ice cream, anything sweet. Ice cream really worked for me... Good luck everyone :) x",
