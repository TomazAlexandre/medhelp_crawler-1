    "question": "Hi,I've been diabetic since I was 9 years old. I used to have great control of it as I was younger but now I'm 21 and I dont have control of it at all. I never check my blood sugars and base it off how I'm feeling (Dangerous I know) I eat unhealthy, and just don't seem to care much. I'm on Apidra and Basaglar. Overall I'm pretty skinny, but I have a large stomach. I look almost 5-6 months pregnant. How can I get rid of this? (I even stopped doing my shots in my stomach.) and how can I find more motivation to actually care to take care of myself?! Also I am on medi-cal and wondered how I can get a pump? I've had one befor and loved it.Thank you !",
