            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. If you have weakness in both arm then you need a detailed clinical evaluation. This has to be followed up with tests to rule out pinched nerves in neck, MS, ALS, peripheral neuropathies (diabetes, thyroid disorders, lupus, etc) or muscle diseases. You may need tests like MRI, EMG, spinal tap, blood tests etc. Please consult a neurologist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
