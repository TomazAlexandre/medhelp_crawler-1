            "answer": "Ok, take a deep breath because your life and your daughters is about to change significantly. There is a lot to learn about managing Type 1 diabetes and it can be overwhelming. The important thing to remember is that in time it will become routine and a part of her life, and that Type 1 diabetes is a manageable condition. There is no reason at all she can't live a normal life and do everything she wants to do. Plus there have been significant improvements in management of diabetes in the last 20 years and there is more to come so the future will no doubt be easier for someone diagnosed today. I highly recommend the book Using Insulin by John Walsh. I am also going to send you a PM with the name of a website with significantly more Type 1's including many who were diagnosed as children and with a special forum for parents. The more you can connect with others the better and down the road you might check into diabetes camp for your daughter as everyone says it changed their lives when they were able to meet other type 1 children and not feel so alone. You might also want to ask your doctor or endo if there are any support groups in your community.Type 1 is an autoimmune disease, and sometimes people with type 1 diabetes have other autoimmune diseases or develop them down the road. I myself am a type 1 who also has thyroid disease. I'm not sure why they are testing for that now unless there is something in her symptoms that they feel is unaccounted for by her diabetes. As far as tests you will want to make sure she has an A1C test which is an average of blood sugars for a couple months and will give you a baseline in knowing where she is at as you establish goals. I strongly encourage you to get a referral to a pediatric endo and not to rely on your regular doctor to help her manage her diabetes as they just don't know enough about it. Once they start her on insulin you will want to learn about carb counting so you can match her dose to the carbs she is eating. One step at a time and you want your daughter to be as involved as she is willing to be from the start and to take over the management of her own diabetes when she is ready. Look for my PM. Best of luck to you. It will get easier, I promise.Zoe",
