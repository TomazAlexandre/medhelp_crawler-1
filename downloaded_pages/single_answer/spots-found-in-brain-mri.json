    "question": "I am a 48 year old Male. I had a motrocycle accident about four years ago and they never found anything wrong in my MRI. About 4 weeks ago i have been having chest pains, and later found out about that i had two blood clots in my coronary arteries. They took out the 99% blood clot, and while taking out the left one (the second) my heart stopped and they had to resesitate my heart. So for now they can not do anything about that left side one. About a week in a half later I went in for a check up and than my blood pressure dropped and my face turned pale white. Taken into the rescue into the ER, and once again another two weeks in the hospital. I have diabetes and cholestrol problems. I feel as if i have 200 pounds hammering down on the head, and feel very dizzy constantly. They performed an MRI and found a spot in my brain and now they will not let me know what it is until another\u00a0\u00a03-4 weeks to perform the same MRI to see if that spot has grown. Any suggestions in what healthy natural foods to consume.?",
