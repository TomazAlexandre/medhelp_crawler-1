    "question": "Hi, I was wondering if you could answer my question. I have been having bad pains in my hands for over five years now in my hands starting when I was pregnant with my first child. I was 18 at the time and was told by my Ob/gyn that it was just from being pregnant and retaining water. Now I am 25 and it still has not gone away. I comes back ever so often. It seems like it's been more often lately. My hands swell up either in little areas or the whole hand. I\u00a0\u00a0really don't know what to do. I don't get any answers just googling swollen hands so this is the first time I'm posting a question. I am hoping you can help me. My family has a history with high blood pressure, in which i do not have, cancer, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, bronchitis, and thyroid problems as far as I know. I know, I know, it's a lot but i cant handle the throbbing pain sometimes. Thank you bunches.",
