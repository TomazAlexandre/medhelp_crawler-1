    "question": "My question: Is ICA testing beneficial and accurate in really predicting which kids and adults are prone to type I diabetes? Some background. Type I, diabetes is very very genetically prevalent in our family. I have a sister who is diabetic since she is 12. I have 2\u00a0\u00a0maternal first cousins who got it at 7 or 8 and a maternal uncle who has type 1 as well but it afflicted him in adulthood. Now, a nephew, the next generation, another sister's son was diagnosed.Understandably, I and the rest of my siblings (very large family) are concerned for ourselves and our children. Hence the question-should we bother testing ourselves and our kids? If the tests are positive, then what? If they're negative are we safe? Thanks to everyone in advance.",
