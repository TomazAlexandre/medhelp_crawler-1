            "answer": "I am terribly sorry! Most OBs don't know thyroid. Many endos don't know thyroid, either. Find an endo in your area who specializes in thyroid, not diabetes.Yes, hypos can miscarry if they are not treated properly. I've read that in books, too. Mary J. Shomon wrote a good book about pregnancy and thyroid.Fatigue is common with pregnancy, but considering your hypo situation, your TSH, FT3/FT4 should be monitored closely. Find a good doctor and take care!I wish you all the best.:) Tamra",

    "question": "Hello, I am 8 weeks pregnant, but expect to misscary because the heart rate has dropped to 47. My OBGYN did not check my thyroid or tell me to go to my endocrinologist when I had the first appointment at 5 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I had previously informed him that I am hypothyroid and my file included that I am on 50 mg of synthyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I figured out that I needed to increase the dosage because I had been so exhausted and read about the connection to misscairage in a pregnancy book.\u00a0\u00a0It was too late though.\u00a0\u00a0Do most OBGYNs know the connectionb between hypothyroid and misscairage?\u00a0\u00a0Would most check my thyroid levels immediately?\u00a0\u00a0What should I do next time around?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
