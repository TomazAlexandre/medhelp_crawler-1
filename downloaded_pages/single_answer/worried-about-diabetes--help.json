    "question": "I'm 19 nearly 20 and i'm very health paranoid due to the fact i have very bad Anxiety. I was tested for Diabete's about 2 years ago (via blood test) and they actually found that i was very Anemic. But i still worry.All i drink is water so i found i get dehydrated more quickly then most people, is this normal? It's not extreme thirst.I am tired most of the time more than likely because i don't go to bed until the early hours of the morning (3-5am) and don't wake up until lunch time so i assume my body clock can't cope with my mad sleep pattern.Because i suffer from Anxiety i do have a natural body tremble, when i'm anxious i get very shakey, but cos' i'm anxious most of the time it's hard to really know if it is just Anxiety.I don't urinate an awful lot either, just the normal amount, even though i drink alot of water.Because of my Anxiety i've developed IBS and become constipated on a regular basis, i can be struggling with it for 1-2 weeks then as soon as i relax it goes back to normal.I have lost some weight (3 pounds or so) but i put that down to my Anxiety and constipation, because i'm constipated i obviously find it hard to eat and get full very quickly, so my appetite is all over the place at times.These are some of the symptoms of Diabetes but i have more likely reasons for them as you can see.So what do you think? Should i stop worrying?What else should i look out for?How long does Diabete's take to develop?x",
