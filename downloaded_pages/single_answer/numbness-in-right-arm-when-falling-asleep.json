Nerve conduction studies, MRI of cervical spine, dopplar studies, sleep studies etc may be required for diagnosis. It can also be a peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes and thyroid disorders.\u00a0\u00a0The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Take care!",
