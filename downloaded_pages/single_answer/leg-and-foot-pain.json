    "question": "I am a 47 year old overweight woman. I have had pain from the back of my right buttocks to the the back of my knee for a couple of years. I thought it was the way I slept - on my right side. They did a MRI of my hip and found nothing. The last few months, it has gotten worse with pain down the back of my right calf and to my right foot. My foot feels tingly and kind of numb. It is not a constant pain or shooting pain but more like a dull ache. If I take ibuprofen, the dull ache on my hip/buttocks/leg feels better and I can sleep. The doctor took a diabetes blood test and is going to take a nerve induction test. I haven't received results from blood test yet. Any ideas?",
