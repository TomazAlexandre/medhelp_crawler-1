            "answer": "Hi there!The antibiotic is unlikely to have affected the erection, though infection/ inflammation could be a temporary contributing factor. Other possible contributing factors include psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders, peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, hypertension, diabetes etc. Assuming it to be due to the infection, this is likely to get better in a few days. Anxiety and stress play an important role in compounding the issue and at a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors with your partner. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, I would suggest seeing your urologist for appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "In January of 2012 I was diagnosed with Epididmytis. I was given Cipro for 10 days and then 20 days and it did not work. I was then put on Doxycyclene (sp?) and that did the trick until about 6 weeks later and I can still feel it.My other concern is that its affecting my erections and they are weak. My Dr. says there is no correlation but I respectfully disagree. My erections are soft and my ejaculate is certainly different.I have to go in for anothe urinalysis but I want to know what I should be doing and is it really affecting my ability to maintain an erection.It is starting to affect my marriage as well. Thank you.",
