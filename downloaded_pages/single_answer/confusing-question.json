            "answer": "Hi!Eating disorders are a product of mind and body. It is very important to control mind in order to control the body. Hence mental therapy is scheduled along with other treatments. Apart from consulting a specialist, you can also consult a nutrition expert for a low calorie, nutritious diet. Apart from it consult a physical trainer to help shed extra weight. Also, you could be having a problem that makes you gain weight like diabetes, hypothyroidism, anemia, hormonal disorder. Hence you need to consult a doctor to rule these out. All these steps will help you keep fit, look healthy (not fat) and energetic, and help you overcome your eating problems. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 19 years old. I've had trouble eating since I have been 10. I was an obese child and lost 80 lbs when I was 11 (I was 220 lbs at the time), and every since then I have been counting fat, carbs, and calories and eating very very little and exersising. When I was 15 I began taking laxatives, water pills, and vomiting. Now, as a college student I am very stressed. I either dont eat, eat very little, or purge after I eat. I recently lost 60 lbs. My teeth are no longer white and pretty, my skin is no longer clear. It has blotches of white. I have stomach and chest pains everyday.Now my question is, can I get the physical help I need, without getting the mental help I should probably be getting? I KNOW this is bad and I should get help but I've been doing this for so long I'm not ready. My best friend has offered time and time again to go to therapy with me. I went to therapy when I was 16 and it worked- a little too well. I gained 50 lbs, thats what I am afraid of. Im not thin now. I am 5'9 and weigh 165 lbs. I am so confused. I just want to be healthy",
