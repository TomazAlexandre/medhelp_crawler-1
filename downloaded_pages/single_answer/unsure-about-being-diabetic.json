            "answer": "It sounds like it could be either hypoglycemia OR diabetes, and they are treated very differently. I suggest that you ask your doctor to do a hemoglobin a1c test, which will answer the question once and for all. This test is a simple blood test done in a lab that will give a number that shows what your AVERAGE blood sugar has been over the past 3 months. So if you are running high, the number will be elevated, and if low, it may be lower than normal.Once you know the results, then you can perhaps either get medicine if diabetic, or change your diet according to what the problem is. Do check out the hypoglycemia website I am giving you here for lots of good information about hypoglycemia:www.hypoglycemia.org",
