            "answer": "The tsh is normal but you have to look at it in relation to his free T4 and total T4 but not sure if he is growing well that he has a thyroid problem.When teeth don't erupt easily this makes me think of growth hormone deficiency but you mentioned that your ped was happy with his growth and development so I am assuming that he is not suspicious for having gh deficiency.You are not making something out of nothing, I always tell myself to listen to the moms, go with my gut but always listen to the moms. (and dads)so work with the child psychologist cause really the main medical concern you are describing is a behavioral concern(this always sounds like a fake thing but it is a part of our medical problem list!)The ODD diagnosis is important to monitor and address, his past history is very normal, hernia, tonsils. The delay in tooth eruption bothers me some and I suggest you see a pediatric dentist, just so his\u00a0\u00a0permanent teeth have a place to go!Hang in there, take your time with his psychologist and keep with your pediatrician for his checkups so you don't miss anything.",

    "question": "My son is almost 7 years old.\u00a0\u00a0For the past four years I have known that something was not quite right, but couldn't put my finger on it.\u00a0\u00a0His medical history: born 3 weeks early (I had gestational diabetes), has had two hernia surgerys, had his tonsils and adnoids removed, went to an allergy specialist for testing and was allergic to nothing, wakes frequently at night, has dark circles under his eyes all the time, he has not lost any of his baby teeth!... Pediatrician says that all his labs are \"normal\" and he is a healthy boy.\u00a0\u00a0However, because of his behavioral problems, she referred me to a child psychologist who diagnosed him with Oppositional Defiance Disorder.\u00a0\u00a0I took him back to the pediatrician and insisted on a thyroid test because I recently discovered that according to the new lab ranges I have hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Again, she said that everything was normal.\u00a0\u00a0His TSH looks a little to high ( 2.97).\u00a0\u00a0What do you think?\u00a0\u00a0Am I really making something out of nothing?",
