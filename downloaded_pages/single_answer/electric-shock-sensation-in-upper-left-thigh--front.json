            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. Your symptoms appear to be due to restless leg syndrome, which can be seen secondarily in pregnancy, varicose veins, diabetes obesity. This is seen in pregnant females during the last trimester. you need to consult a physician for detailed assessment, blood flow in the legs need to be checked since you have varicose veins and it is a risk factor for RLS. Try to get some good sleep, warm and cold baths. Medications like requip are prescribed if the diagnosis is confirmed. Hope this helps. Wishing you all the best.",
