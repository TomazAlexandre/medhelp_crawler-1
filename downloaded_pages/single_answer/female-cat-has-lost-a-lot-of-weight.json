            "answer": "It's possible that your cat is suffering from the onset of diabetes or hyperthyroidism. It's not uncommon for a cat of that age to develop either condition. It's possible it's a parasite not treatable with pet store medication, although usually you see a change in stool along with vomiting.A cat of that age generally needs annual check ups so the vet can monitor her for changes over time. I'd say take her in and get her checked. both conditions are easily treatable and can be managed, giving kitty many more happy years.I'm sorry for the loss of your mum, by the way. You're doing a good thing taking her \"cat-kids\" in.",
