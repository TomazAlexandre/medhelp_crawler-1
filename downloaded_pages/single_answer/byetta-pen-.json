            "answer": "I am not a doctor but rather a diabetic patient like yourself.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on Byetta 5mg in March and have thankfully lost 30+ pounds since then.\u00a0\u00a0I am curious though why your doc took you off all meds and you only use the Byetta now.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to ask that first of all.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the Byetta did not give me the other effect you are experiencing, but rather now I must force myself to eat.\u00a0\u00a0I personally think that if you were still on at least some of your other meds + the Byetta your numbers would probably come down.\u00a0\u00a0I know mine have.\u00a0\u00a0As you said, I believe the Byetta works immediately as good as it ever will as soon as you take it.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that the Diabetes Nurse suggested to me was that if I was not eating enough, they might need to put me on the 10mg.\u00a0\u00a0I believe you need to be back on some meds but write a list of questions for the doc before you phone and check this out immediately.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I am not a doc but your situation does not sound good to me.Please post what happens after you speak with the doc.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure that I am not the only one who would like to know what happens!!Good Luck - God Bless, Anita",
