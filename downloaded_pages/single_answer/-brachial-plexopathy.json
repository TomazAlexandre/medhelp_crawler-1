    "question": "Rear ended in auto accident. Diagnosis most likely is diabetic brachial plexopathy. Lost a lot of use in left hand and arm. Lot of pain. Physical therapy for months. Question is---can an aggravation of a pre-existing condition (diabetes) like a rear end car accident cause brachial plexopathy? I never had a problem at all and sugar has been good for a long time.",
