            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your grandson. Fever with bodyache and rash is especially seen in viral fevers, dengue, typhoid, malaria, and H1N1 infection. It can be due to measles, chicken pox, or due to group A streptococcal infection. Other possibilities are rheumatoid arthritis (already being tested for), lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your grandson\u2019s doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!",
