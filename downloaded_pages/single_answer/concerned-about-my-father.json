            "answer": "Type 1 usually starts in childhood, and requires insulin shots. Type 2 usually develops later in life. It also can require shots if severe, but there is also oral medication that is given. His diet is very important. Also testing, and controlling his glucose levels. There are a lot of complicatins. Loss of sight, loss of limbs, liver and kidney damage, etc. BUT if he starts controlling his diabetes, this doesn't necessarily have to happen. Support him as much as you can. A good dietician could help him make the healthy choices he needs to make. He sounds like a wonderful father, and you a wonderful child, for caring for him. It doesn't have to be life-threatening if he will take control of his problems. Good luck, I know it's hard to get a parent to do the right thing.",

He is a wokohalic and put of his doctor appts for a few years. The family recently came together and forced him to go to the doctor.
