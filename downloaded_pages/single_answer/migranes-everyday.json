            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Yes, the attack that took her to ER does look like a stroke or TIA. Your mother needs to consult a neurologist and get a CT scan or MRI. However TIAs are often missed on CT scans and MRIs. It could also have been an attack of hypoglycemia. Diabetic neuropathy too should be looked into.As you know by now migraine is caused by different triggers. Please read the matter on.http://adam.about.com/encyclopedia/infectiousdiseases/Migraine.htmTry to identify what causes her headache.Today many types of treatments are available for migraine, both pain relieving and preventive. Please talk to her specialist about this. Also explore the possibility of this being a case of Multiple Sclerosis with a neurologist.You must talk to your physician regarding all these possibilities and maybe you would need to consult a neurologist too. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care! I too hope your mother is her normal self soon!!",

    "question": "My mom is 43 years old and about 10 years ago she was diagnosed with fibromylagia, I was wondering if that had anything to do with her migranes. She has got migranes every single day non-stop just some days are worse than others. Is there a cure for her migranes. My mom don't do normal day stuff because she can't get up and move because her migranes are bad, she can't work. I want my mom to feel normal. On March 27 she went to the emergency room because her body went numb and she didnt have control over what her body was doing she collapsed 3 times that day, than on Sunday she had the same symptoms and again on Monday night, the emergency room kept telling her that it was her diabetes and fibromyalgia but it looked just like a stroke. I really need help. I want my mom to do things with her kids and be around to see her grand kids grow up. So if you know anything that will help please let me know.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jessica Henderson",
