            "answer": "Hi Omega,Is that you name? How old are you? Does your profession involve you to sit in a place for long hours?Tingling, numbness, and buzzing are usually due to nerve pathology.Signs of nerve dysfunction are pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness along the distribution of nerve.This could also be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your case it appears to me as some impingement of nerve at exit from vertebrae causing the symptoms.Have you checked for diabetic status?I think a visit to an orthopaedician with imaging studies of lower back is helpful.I would be interested to know about your decision.Keep me informed.Bye.",
