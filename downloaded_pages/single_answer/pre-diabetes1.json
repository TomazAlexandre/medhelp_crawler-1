            "answer": "Hi,The reading on the glucometer is usually fairly reliable, although you can recheck it another morning to see if another reading is in the same range, or ask your doctor to do a formal fasting glucose. The 100mg/dL is right at the borderline of normal and pre-diabetes. It can happen in any age group, so I am afraid that being young doesn't give exceptions. The symptoms you describe are not actually consistent of diabetes unless your blood sugars are high during that time--have you ever checked your sugars during those shaky periods?Have your doctor do a fasting glucose or a 2 hour glucose challenge, this will give you the most information right now.take care.",
