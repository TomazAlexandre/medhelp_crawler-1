            "answer": "Sorry to hear how bad it has been for you. I assume that you have had a look inside your bladder (cystoscopy) as well as urine cultures and maybe even an x-ray of your kidneys.You should consider an evaluation by a specialist within urology who is concerned with pelvic pain syndromes. I think that the National Institutes of Health may have a listing of such specialists. If you are a female, consider a female urologist (a urologist who specializes in the urinary problems of women).Good luck!S.A.Liroff, M.D.",

    "question": "I've been to 3 urologists to try to cure the burning urination problem I've had for 2 years.The last urologist suspects it's cystitis, but isn't sure, and just subjected me to a \"cocktail\" of medication administered through an insanely painful catheretization.\u00a0\u00a0(I now have an infection, worse pain than before, urgency, and some difficulty controlling leakage.)\u00a0\u00a0I'm loathe to continue with this doctor since it seems I have been damaged and made worse by this treatment he has administered.I seriously need to find someone who is a genuine expert in this field, and one who will not damage me and cause me severe pain in the process.\u00a0\u00a0(Whatever happened to anaesthesia?)I live on the West Coast (LA area) but am considering traveling to find treatment if I can be convinced it will actually work.For the record, I have been checked for stones, VD, tract infections, cancer, and diabetes--all negative so far.Please help point me in the right direction;\u00a0\u00a0the pain has been 9/10 on the scale, and is now getting worse because of this last treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
