I do not take meds and insulin because my sugar has always been in control throughout whole pregnancy but since ive started my ninth month it has been getting veryy difficult to control. I eat very less avoiding potatoes rice and all high cArb food. I was wondering does eating less would affect my bAbys weight? Does anyone have gestational diabetes ? How do you control it without effecting bAbys weight? My baby weighs 2.7 kilograms.",
