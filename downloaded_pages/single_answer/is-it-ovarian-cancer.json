            "answer": "It's good that your mother will be seeing a gyn/onc. That's the best course of action at this time and it seems your doctor is on the right track. I'm so sorry that they feel that it may be malignant, but the surgery will tell you for sure. I'm not sure that we can add much more.. I'm just glad they're taking action and surgery will be scheduled quickly. Please keep us posted.If it does turn out to be malignant, there is a wonderful Ovarian Cancer Forum where you will find ladies with a lot of experience .. Hoping that won't be the case though..Take care and let us know,Sandy",

    "question": "My mother had a transvag done, and a cantelope size tumor/mass was found in her pelvi/abdomen area. She is a 73year old white lady, who is 5'3 and 164lbs. no major surgeries. She does have high blood pressure,diabetes, hypertension, and takes pertonics. An mri was done. besides what was found on sonogram, the mass is behind the uterus possibly with bowel involved. very large tumor, hard to tell. some fluid found under liver(assites). Obgyn assumes it is 75% cancer, at least a stage II ,possibly III. Symptoms were for 3 to 4 weeks. Constipation, constant urination, blockage feeling, cramps, pain in abdomen /stomach area, and some shortness of breath. No ct skan/ chest x-ray has been done at this point. This process has taken 4 days. In 4 more days will be seeing a gyn oncologist, Her gyn said it is very serious, and most likely surgery will be 1 week from oncology visit. What is your prognosis? and what other info can you add ? Is this correct, and is this the right path? Please help! p.s. ca-125 was 65, and colon cancer (her mom and aunts's x4), and sister had breast cancer and 3 aunts and first cousins x 4 also.",
