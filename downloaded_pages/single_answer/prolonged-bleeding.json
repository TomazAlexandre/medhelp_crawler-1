    "question": "I'm an 18 yr old female with type one diabetes. I have horrible back pain and even worse pain in my abdomen. I have been bleeding for almost 2 years straight. I've lost about 30 pounds. I have the implanting and have had the depovera. I also tried taking the pill in hopes it was a hormone imbalance. My period has not stopped in nearly 2 years. I frequently go through maxi pads and can't eat very much at one time. Even a child's size meal is too much. I weigh 103 and I'm 5\" even. What's happening?",
