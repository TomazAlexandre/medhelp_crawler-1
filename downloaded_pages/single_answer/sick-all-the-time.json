    "question": "My blood sugars are very controlled under the pump, but I'm continually sick all year round, more specifically around winter time. My diabetes doctor tells me its normal, even with controlled blood sugars, but I'm having a hard time believing this. Is anyone else sick all year round? Are you on the pump and not sick at all?After extended periods of exercise, do your hands swell up? Is there a home remedy I can use for this? (Because my doctor also told me this was normal, but I don't think this is acceptable.)",
