    "question": "by Connie\u00a0\u00a0Nov 4 08Hi, I've been on 3 different AD for 9 years, I started weaning off Prozac and maybe didn't do it right, too fast??I experienced dizziness, food cravings, not sleeping, crying and weeping, anger and rage, whole bodyaching, numbness and tingling in fingers. I hadn't had the AD for 2 weeks when this started but because I have CAD, diabetes and osteo-arthritis, and have had eating issues for years didn't realize it could be the AD as a cause.I went to the walk-in for the dizziness after I found out the blood work was ok, diabetes numbers ok, heart cardiograph ok and talked about my history and read on line about withdrawal and I've been able to stay off for another week, but today I couldn't handle it anymore and filled a prescription and started back on 10 mg. I can't get an appt with my GP for a bit and the pharmacist suggested this.Hope I'm doing the right thing. I feel like a failure that I couldn't get off. But can't handle the symptoms",
