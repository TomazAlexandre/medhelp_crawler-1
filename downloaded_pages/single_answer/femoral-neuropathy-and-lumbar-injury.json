            "answer": "Go back to the orthopedic specialist who said you should have back surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Whether diabetes figured in or not, he saw the pictures and tried noninvasive treatment, and then opted surgery.\u00a0\u00a0You fell down the stairs, for crying out loud.\u00a0\u00a0Surgery has a good chance of giving you permanent pain relief or at least some help with some of the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Opiates are a good alternative to the Lyrica you've been getting, by the way... and also, you could go up to 450mg on the Lyrica before they should declare it unhelpful.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I hope you will also go back to the person treating your diabetes, and make sure you are receiving adequate treatment for that, just have them look you over again.\u00a0\u00a0In the end, if better pain relief and better diabetic control turn the tide, then of course avoid surgery.\u00a0\u00a0But let the orthopedist help you with that decision, in regards to positive long-term prognosis with your condition.",
