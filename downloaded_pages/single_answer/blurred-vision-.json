If it\u2019s persistent or if it\u2019s a new onset, your OB may recommend that you see an ophthalmologist, but at the very least, you should have your blood pressure checked, and possibly your blood sugar too.~ Gestational diabetes may be a culprit since glucose can hang out in the lens and may cause differences in the cornea. Blurry visions can also be related to retinal detachments, which can sometimes be caused by hypertension disorders.~ If your blurry vision is accompanied by a headache, swelling, abdominal pain and rapid weight gain, you may have preeclampsia, in which case you should seek medical treatment ASAP.+ http://pregnant.thebump.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-symptoms/articles/blurry-vision-during-pregnancy.aspx?MsdVisit=1+ webmd.com/eye-health/pregnancy-and-vision",
