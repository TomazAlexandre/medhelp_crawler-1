            "answer": "Hi there!Diabetes is neither an indication for gastric bypass nor does help cure diabetes, though it \u2018may\u2019 help control blood sugar levels in patients where it may otherwise be indicated such as with morbid obesity. Diabetics who undergo gastric bypass usually do experience weight loss over time and a better blood sugar control. However similar levels of blood glucose levels can be achieved through diet control as well. Post surgery the blood sugar levels may vary a bit due to the stress hormones kicking in, these are likely to settle with time. Diet control and exercise (if feasible) need to be continued even after the surgery. Medications may also be continued further, if required. I would suggest discussing the management plan in detail with your treating endocrinologist.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "Hello...in 2008 I had a gastric bypass.\u00a0\u00a0I was so excited about the possiblity of being \"cured\" of my type 2 diabetes....but at no time, even during the phase where i was on all liquids and immediately after my surgery while i was in the hospital did my glucose numbers drop...they were even higher in some instances.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't lose that much weight either in the first phase post op.\u00a0\u00a0I think I may have dropped about 20 lbs the first month after my bypass.\u00a0\u00a0My family physician said he didn't really understand how i didn't react better to the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I am 60 years old on disabilty for COPD (not dependent on O2 ) but still am limited to how I can exercise though.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had this experience?\u00a0\u00a0Especially because of all the news of how this could be the standard to treat diabetes reports on the evening news...i am really upset and somewhat depressed.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had the same results as myself or have an idea why i reacted this way?\u00a0\u00a0The best thing that happened to me is that I am on Januvia (added to Lantus, metformin regimen)\u00a0\u00a0thats a good thing!!",
