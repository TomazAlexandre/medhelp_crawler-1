            "answer": "HI,How are you? What diagnostic tests were done already? Aside from infection, this could also be due to underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, bladder issues as well as other urological condition that warrants further evaluation by a urologist. Additional diagnostic tests such as cytoscopy and imaging studies may also be done to determine the underlying cause. Take care and do keep us posted.",
