            "answer": "I am a 52 year old male that had triple bypass in June 07.I too experienced the pain that you describe.My Dr.(my surgeon )sent me to a neuro guy suspecting brachioplex problems due to the the positioning of the body during the harvesting and reroute of the chest wall artery.The bad news is the pain, very occasionally;comes back in a much milder form.The good news is that the majority of it subsided with time.It generally was worse when I tried to overextend my reach when picking up,or when I slept in the wrong position.It would actually wake me out of a deep sleep.I would re-adjust my sleeping position; with my arms at my sides; and it would go away.Yes; ask your physician,just for peace of mind.I hoped this helped.

    "question": "I had a triple by-pass in mid Jan 08 and my right arm has had some aching and now it is increasing to the point that it's difficult to pick up a cup of tea . It throbs but not in the joints and even some tingling to the hands. It's not caprl tunnel - had that surgery. Everything else is great: lower weight, good number and diabetes is under control - no more isulin during the day! I am concerned. Should I be concerned enough to speak to my physician?",
