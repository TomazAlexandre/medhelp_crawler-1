            "answer": "Hi, I just had a 3 hour glucose test. Shortly after coming home I was swept over by heart pounding, sweats and shaking. I thought I would pass out. I have had this happen to me several hours after a high carb meal but this was very severe. I am being tested because my fasting sugar was a little high. I am 54 and had gestastional diabetes. My father has type II. It has been well over an hour and I still don't feel 100%. Any info on this would be appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Lynn",
