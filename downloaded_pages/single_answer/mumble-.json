            "answer": "HiSorry to hear that your mum is not well.\u00a0\u00a0Has she been diagnosed with stroke?Just to clear things up, speech difficulties such as mumbling are often a *symptom* of stroke not a cause.\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, depression can occur after a stroke during recovery, it does not cause stroke.The speech problems result when the part of the brain that is responsible for speech is damaged by the stroke.Stroke are usually diagnosed by a CT &/or MRI scan.\u00a0\u00a0Causes of strokes are usually diagnosed by a range of clinical & laboratory tests.\u00a0\u00a0As each stroke is different, it is impossible for me to tell you the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Please speak with your mothers doctors.The brain is a remarkable organ.\u00a0\u00a0Whilst the dead parts stay dead, it can lear to \"re-route\" the signals, so a different part of the brain takes over the duties of the part that died.\u00a0\u00a0So yes, recovery is possible, the extent of recovery is dependent on the amount of damage & the person's commitment to rehabilitation.HTHSue",

    "question": "Hi! My mother went on vacation in the province just recently and she needed up in the hospital. She had: Hypertension, type 1 diabetes. she went to see her long-time missed relatives and all of the sudden they opened up a topic that is too sensitive for her. When on their way home my brother noticed a slight \"mumbling in her words\", until in the middle of the night she fall out of her bed. Then the \"mumbling words\" become worst until they decided to bring her to the hospital, she was admitted then. My question is, \"the mumbling words is the cause of depression the lead to stroke? Is there a chance for a recovery? What are the necessary tests/laboratory needed to know the cause of her mumbling? Thank you so much for enlightening me. God Bless.",
