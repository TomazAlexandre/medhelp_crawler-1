            "answer": "Hello.It appears that your symptoms are not related to the initial left foot injury. It could be a coincidence that the symptoms started after the hurt.The pattern of your symptoms suggests a progressive neuropathy. The buzzing, tingling, numbness and sometimes burning sensation with pain are common symptoms experienced due to a neuropathy. Stiff knees are most probably due to collection of fluid under the skin around the joints.It is best to wait for the Neurologist's opinion. Additionally, I would suggest a Blood Sugar test. Diabetic neuropathy is a common cause.Do you have a family history of Diabetes Mellitus? Have you, in recent times, got yourself checked for Diabetes Mellitus ?Regards",
