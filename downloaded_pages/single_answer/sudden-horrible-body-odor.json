    "question": "Hello, within the last week I've developed horrible body odor under my arms.\u00a0\u00a0No matter what I do (showering and shaving everyday; scrubbing with baking soda, witch hazel, baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, you name it; using conventional aluminum-containing deodorant by Secret; and using natural enzyme-based deodorant), I stink within two hours of doing absolutely no strenuous work and having zero stress.\u00a0\u00a0In case it's related, I just had my period last week, but I've never had this happen following any other period.\u00a0\u00a0And I've NEVER had any abnormal body odors before.\u00a0\u00a0I was dealing with a cold last week, so I took slightly higher doses of vitamin D, but I don't see how that could have any relation.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't changed my diet, which consists of whole foods and absolutely no junk/sugary foods.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you in advance for any advice.\u00a0\u00a0I seriously don't know what I'll do if this doesn't stop!",
