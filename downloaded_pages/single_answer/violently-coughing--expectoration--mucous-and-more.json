            "answer": "By the way, 2 details I forgot:1. I found out that when I massage a lower part of my throat, I feel like my whole problem is in this certain point, and I have a sudden reflex to *gently* cough. I mean, it just comes out. And it's not a violent one, it's a completely normal cough...I guess it's normal though.2. My room has dust...above-the-average in it, because of old toys we kept for my nephews. Not way too much dust, and I'm quite sure I'm not allergic to it.",

    "question": "Hello people. I'm new over here, hope you could help me. I'll try to give as much details as possible...(I'm 16 by the way, and I'm a guy).I have a problem that bugs me for years. My coughing sounds really violent 50% percent of the time. I tend to expectorate (like doing \"uhm uhm\") a lot because something feels stuck in my throat.Every time I get a cold, I start looking at the mirror with my mouth open wide and I see mucous over my throat. It keeps staying there for a while even when I'm practically healthy (and so are the violent coughs, even a month after I'm completely recovered from a cold I keep coughing violently, sometimes more, I just stop noticing that).I'm not the only one in my family who expectorate a lot. One of my brother does it too, and so does my father. Both of my sisters tend to clean their nose a lot but they don't have the other symptoms I do. Nobody in the family has my violent coughs.Lately I started doing some voice-stretch releasing exercises I learned from a video of the vocal coach Jaime Vendera, I thought releasing the stretch in my throat wouldn't hurt. It does get slightly better, but I guess I need some further help.About my drinking habit - I'm trying to make sure I drink only water lately. I used to drink quite a lot of Diet Coke (diabetic type-1 here), but I stopped a few months ago.Aside of my diabetes (which I take care of by an insulin pump) I suffer from Hashimoto\u2019s Thyroiditis, which I take care of by taking Eltroxin tablets of 50mcg once a day.By the way, when I tried going to an Ear-nose-throat doctor, he laughed and said it's not a big deal...hope you guys could help me though, it's really bugging me.Thanks in advance!",
