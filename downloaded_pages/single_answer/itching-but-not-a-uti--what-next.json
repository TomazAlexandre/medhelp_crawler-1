            "answer": "Hello,There are a few causes of sugar in urine chief ones being diabetes, Cushing\u2019s syndrome and kidney disease causing chronic renal disease. I suggest you to get your blood sugar levels done and if possible get your HBA1C levels done which gives more consistent results than blood sugar levels. Also get a urine culture done after leaving antibiotics so that the exact antibiotic can be started.Hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",
