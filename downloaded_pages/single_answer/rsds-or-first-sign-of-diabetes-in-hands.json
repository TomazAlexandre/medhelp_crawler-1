            "answer": "A patients clinical history (signs and symptoms) are the major factor in diagnosing RSD. There is no specific blood test or other diagnostic test for RSD. Some tests that may help in trying to diagnose RSD:\u00a0\u00a0X-rays can show thinning of bones. Nuclear bone scans can show characteristic uptake patterns which help diagnose RSD. You can also have a sympathetic nervous system test which will check for any disturbances. A thermography test measures blood flow and skin temp in RSD-effected areas.",
