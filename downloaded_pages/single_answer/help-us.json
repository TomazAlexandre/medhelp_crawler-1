            "answer": "Hello,Cialis and Viagra cause erections to be stronger and long lasting. However it may not be effective if you have uncontrolled diabetes, very low blood pressure (hypotension) or uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease or heart failure, stroke or you are taking any nitrate drugs for angina, blood-thinning (anticoagulant) medications, antihypertensives or alpha blockers for enlarged prostate. This may be reason for the drug not working in your case. Also if you are having low testosterone then you may need testosterone supplements. So you should consult a urologist and get blood tests, urine analysis, ultrasound penis and overnight erection test done.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
