            "answer": "Stress, sleeplessness might be the reason behind this. But good to know that you are non diabetic and non hypertensive.

At times, my feet feel clumsy and this morning walking into work, I tripped and broke a toe.The doc did a blood pressure test on my ankles and says its not due to poor circulation (but I am getting vericose veins).\u00a0\u00a0She ordered a EMG test, but I'm worried it's some weird thing.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone offer suggestions of what I should seek out medically?\u00a0\u00a0I am also very fatigued and Vit.
