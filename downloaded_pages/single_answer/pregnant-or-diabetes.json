    "question": "I went to the Emergency Room after almost fainting after eating out with a group of friends. I feel constantly tired, dehydrated, hungry, and feel nautious and can't concentrate. I have been flipping out on people around and very moody. They did the diabetes test and the pregnancy test, but I have to wait 3 weeks to get the results back. I am also over a month late on my period and haven't had it since before Christmas..",
