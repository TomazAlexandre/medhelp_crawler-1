            "answer": "Hi,How are you? I understand your concern about your son. Over eating at this age may indeed be something to be concerned about especially if there is personal and family history of diabetes. Bedwetting usually goes away on its own and it is important to provide support and positive reinforcement during this time.\u00a0\u00a0Reassure your child and try to remind your child to go to the bathroom before bedtime. A support group for parents with the same experience may also help. Take care and do keep us posted.",
