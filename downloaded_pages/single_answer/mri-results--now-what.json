            "answer": "Hi.Small vessel ischemic disease is basically a disorder affecting small blood vessels in the brain and is most often associated with hypertension.Vasculitis is a condition characterized by necrosis and inflammation of the vessel wall that can eventually result in segmental alteration of the vessel caliber, occlusion, aneurysm, and areas of hypervascularity. Causes may be infectious or non-infectious.Multiple sclerosis is a progressive neurological disease of demyelination and can be suggested by white matter lesions in certain brain areas on MRI. Other tests such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis can provide more clues on the presence of this disorder. CSF analysis would also rule out the presence of infection.While MRI can visualize some blood vessels, it cannot directly visualize most pathologies of these vessels. MR angiography might be more sensitive for these purpose.Hope this information is of some help to you.",

    "question": "I just received a report of my brain MRI done without and with contrast. It showed a 4mm focus of high signal in the left frontal white matter. It is a solitary lesion and is nonspecific. Gray & white matter otherwise has normal signal Other finding was left maxillary sinusitis, which I knew I had.Impression: solitary nonspecific 4mm left frontal white matter lesion which could be related to early small vessel ischemic disease, vasculitis, past infection and much less likely ms, since it is solitary. I ama 60yr old female, with Type 2 diabetes, degenerative osteo-arthritis DDD, and fibromyalgia.What procedures do I follow to find out which of the above diseases it is? It was done on a T1.5 machine, so other lesions could have been missed. Do they do MRI's of blood vessels? I don't know anything about the disease mentioned, and I don't see my PCP until 1-17. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",
