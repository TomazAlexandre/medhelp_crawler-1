            "answer": "Hi!I can understand your worries since the symptoms are persisting after six months. Since a confirmed diagnosis is not possible, I\u2019ll discuss the various possibilities with you.One possibility is recurrence of scabies. The original infection may not have died down completely and in presence of heat and moisture the symptoms recur. Please ask your doctor whether repeating scabies treatment will help. Other agents which can be tried are Lindane (kwell) 1% lotions and precipitated sulfur in petroleum. If this does not help, then in such refractory cases oral drugs like Ivermectin are used.Scabies can recur or persist if you have diabetes. So, please check your diabetes status through appropriate blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0Also, scabies can worsen existing eczema, dermatitis and sweat dermatitis. So, this aspect has to be looked into.Another thing which should be looked for is whether someone you know suffers from scabies. This can cause re-transmission of infection to you. This person should also be treated for scabies. Also, all your family members should be treated with topical application of permethrin.Other possibilities that cause inflamed raised patches and should be considered are psoriasis, poor hygiene, fungal infection such as candida and tinea infection, pubic lice, herpes, trichomoniasis, extension of balanitis to shaft, or contact dermatitis due to latex condoms, soaps, oils etc.A confirmed diagnosis of the cause of recurrent raised inflamed bumps on penis can be made through examining the skin scrapings under microscope. Please consult your dermatologist regarding all these possibilities. Good Luck and take care!",

    "question": "Hello,I am looking for advice regarding post scabies symptoms. I was diagnosed his past August and most of the symptoms cleared up after two applications of Permethrin. Symptoms started with an inflammation of, what I was told were, sweat glands on the shaft of the penis. This progressed to itchy, red dots/spots on the penis shaft, arm pits and chest as well as bumps/bubbles on the webbing between my fingers. After the treatment, the itching went away quickly, red spots took longer to fade and bumps on hands lasted through October although decreasing in pronunciation and frequency. The sweat glands on the penis shaft also persisted and when I followed up with a dermatologist in October, I was told that this was normal and that my body was still working out the scabies debris.The bumps on my fingers are no longer an issue but the sweat glands on my penis shaft have persisted and increased in frequency. In August one got inflamed once every couple of weeks, by December it was once a week and now it's several times a week. Normally they look like small flesh colored bumps but when they get inflamed they get much more pronounced and sometimes red. I used to apply rubbing alcohol and they would return to normal within a couple of days but for the past couple of weeks, I've been applying a cream called EpiCeram twice daily. This was prescribed to me by a dermatologist I saw in January. The EpiCeram makes the inflammation less severe (less pronounced, rarely red, returns to normal quicker) but since application, it has been occurring more frequently. I don't know if this is a coincidence but the incident rate has gone from once to several times a week and once it was even in two different placed on the shaft.My question is what can I do to stop this inflammation of my sweat glands? Can this really be the scabies still resolving itself 6 months down the line?Hoping to hear back.",
