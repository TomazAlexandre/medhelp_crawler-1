            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The swelling in both feet could be due to water retention as in low protein in blood (normal in your case), kidney problems, severe anemia etc. It could be due to hypothyroidism too. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms.Another cause can be due to venous pooling. Certain heart conditions can cause venous pooling in lower legs.The diagnosis and further tests will depend on whether the swelling is a pitting edema (causes a dent on pressure) or a non pitting edema.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Maybe you can seek another opinion. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I've been having problems with swelling for about a month, this last time.\u00a0\u00a0I am positive for HepC, but I've been told that my blood tests look fine, my albumin is fine.\u00a0\u00a0One doctor told me that it's because my veins are all used up.\u00a0\u00a0Honestly, I can't get a decent answer from a doctor because they just say oh you're HepC positive and that's the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I saw a doctor at the clinical trial site and she told me that it's not from the HepC and to try to find out what it's from.\u00a0\u00a0The only problem, is it's not that easy to get a doctor to look past the HepC diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?",
