    "question": "Hello ladies, I'm 11 weeks today, and I'm on pins and needles because two weeks ago, I had some heavy bleeding, but I was hospitalized due to diabetes. Fortunately, since my ultrasound a week ago, my cervix is closed, and everything looks good so far, every time I cramp, or see any discharge I freak out. Any first time mamas, feel free to give me suggestions or advice for this first time mama FEEL FREE! Happy Holidays!",
