            "answer": "Hi!Yes, this is a frustrating phase. To lose weight you need to burn more calories than you eat. So depending on your diet of say 1500 calories, you need to exercise such that you burn more than 1500 calories. Also, these calories should principally come from green vegetables, fruits, low fat cereals, lean meat cuts etc. I understand you are putting in a lot of aerobics etc., but you are varying your diet a lot.So, stabilize your diet for a month and see if you are losing weight or not. If you are not losing weight, then consult a doctor to rule out anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism and polycystic ovaries. If you have any of these problems, which can start at any age, then you will find it difficult to shed weight. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi I wonder if you can help me.\u00a0\u00a0I am 36 years of age 5ft 4 inches and currently weigh 11.6 stones.\u00a0\u00a0I used to weigh 16.10 stones approximately six years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I lost the weight through diet and exercise alone.The problem I have is, over Christmas I put on around 10 pounds, and am now absolutely unable to shift it at all.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had any problem losing the weight once I put my mind to it but it doesn\u2019t matter what I do I just can\u2019t seem to shift it at all.I am currently eating between 1500 to 2000 calories a day (maybe a little less) and I am doing around 90 minutes cardio six times a week (I sometimes do up to 2 hours per day), cross trainer, walking uphill on treadmill, spinning, circuit training or step aerobics.I have tried eating more, eating less, exercising more, exercising less but nothing I do seems to be working.\u00a0\u00a0I really don\u2019t know what else to try.I would be grateful of any suggestions.Thank you",
