            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The commonest cause is gangrene and Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. Buerger\u2019s disease (if he is a smoker), diabetes, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, connective tissue disorders etc also cause discoloration with fever. Black fungus Dopplar studies have ruled out a vascular phenomenon. So the other causes will have to be investigated.\u00a0\u00a0Do discuss this with your husband\u2019s doctor and get him examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My husband was in an automobile accident on April 7, 2009. He has several herniated disks and protrussions, along with encroachment upon the anterior cord. In July he started complaining of severe pain in his left leg and swelling. His toes and parts of the bottom of his foot is now starting to turn a coal color. He has also lost feeling in some parts of his foot, and has ran a low grade fever since the wreck. His doctor ordered a doppler test done. The doctor says that everything is normal. What would be causing his foot to change colors like this and for him to still be running a fever?",
