    "question": "I was diagnosed with diabetes 3 years ago. I was initially taking medication but I was doing well so the doctor cut it off few months ago. I have some symptoms such as difficulty controlling urine and kind of electrical waves shooting down my legs and sometimes arms.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I feel some muscles are shaking involuntary.\u00a0\u00a0When I looked online these were obvious MS symptoms for me. But last week I had my MRI for neck and lower back and the impressions were:Lower Back:1> Focal left paracentral disc herniation at the L4-5 level2> Mild central and mild bilateral foraminal stenosis from combination of disc herniation, hypertrophy of the bilateral facet joints and thickening of the ligamentum flavum3> Posterior bulges at L1-2, L2-3, and L3-4 with central bulge at the L5-S1 levelNeck:1>\tspondylosis and diffuse disc bulges at C2/3 through C5/6 levels2>\tLeft posterolateral/proximal foraminal disc osteophyte complex at C4/53>\tBilateral forminal stenosis at C3/4 and C4/5I am not sure if the symptoms I experience are related to possible MS or for my spine problems. I am afraid of having spine surgery and not sure if that\u2019s a must.Thanks",
