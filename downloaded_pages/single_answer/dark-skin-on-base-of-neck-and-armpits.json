            "answer": "Hello,This darkening of skin can be due to hyperpigmentation or acanthosis nigricans. Acanthosis nigricans presents as symmetrical, hyperpigmented, velvety plaques mostly in the folds of skin. It is not itchy and is characterized by hyperpigmentation. My sincere advice is to consult a dermatologist. The other possibility is of Addison\u2019s disease.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi, i'm a 15 year old girl and i have had this problem for quite a while. its really all in the title but i have dark skin that almost looks dirty on the base of my neck, at the front and on my armpits (i shave). it doesnt itch or anything, i just feel really insecure about it. i read somewhere that they are symptoms of type two diabetes and i should get my blood sugar levels checked, but when i had read the question i had already got them checked and the doctor said my blood was perfectly balanced. So, i really have no clue as to where to go next- any suggestions? thank you!",
