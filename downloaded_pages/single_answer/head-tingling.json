            "answer": "Hi Kimberly,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved appears to be originating from Cervical Vertebrae.Yes, it is your neck pain which is related to tingling sensations.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your case I feel it is compressive pathology which is causing symptoms.I think you should consult a physician to evaluate your case.If required you can get a MRI scan done.Hope this helps.Bye.",
