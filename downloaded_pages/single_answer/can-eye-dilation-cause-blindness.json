    "question": "Back in January 2016 my 25 year old brother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. We have a family history of this but no one expected him to get it since he leads a very healthy lifestyle. It was a major shock for all of us. He then was told that he need to have his eyes dilated for an exam. My brother has had 20/20 vision his whole life. Since the exam his eyes have not returned to normal. Its now been 7 months and no one can figure out why this is happening. He has extremely blurred vision now, 20/80 to be exact. He's had eye exams, MRI's, a spinal tap. No one seems to know what went wrong. I guess I'm just hoping to get some other answers. Any answers or recommendations would be helpful. I just want my brother to lead a normal life again :(",
