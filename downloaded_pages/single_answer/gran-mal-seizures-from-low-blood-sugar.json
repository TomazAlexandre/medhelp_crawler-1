            "answer": "Only a doctor can tell you that for sure and you most certainly should be talking to your doctor about this situation, not just posting on a website. But yes, seizures can result from extremely low blood sugars. You might consider getting a CGMS so that you can see if your blood sugar is trending down so it doesn't get low enough for seizures. Perhaps your epilepsy makes you more susceptable to them? That having been said, please talk with your doctor or endo.",

    "question": "I suffer from epilepsy and type 1 diabetes, i have recently gotten my seizures from epilepsy under control but I have had a few gran mals and the last thing I remember was trying to get my sugar back to a normal level. My father has witnessed them and said they were ful blown seizures. I am just wondering if my recent gran mals are from the extremely low blood sugars or just the epilepsy. Thank you",
