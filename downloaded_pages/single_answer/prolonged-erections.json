    "question": "Hi, my boyfriend stayed at mine the other night and he got an erection but it didn't go away... He had 'it' and after we woke up it was still there so he tried a cold shower, ice on it... we thought maybe if he came it would help but it didn't. We walked around for an hour or so which helped it some-what but he had an erection for around 11hours. That can't be right. What should he do next time?",
