            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Yes, if mono is persisting in the acute phase, this means that your immune system is not strong enough to combat the infection. Another possibility is that you are suffering from diabetes.So, you need to test for antibodies level, diabetes, and further tests for histiocytes to see if you are suffering from histiocytosis (a rare systemic disorder that can either go into remission on its own or can affect multiple organs and can be very debilitating).Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "In 2011 I got mono for the first time. It was awful and I was out of work for almost 3 months because I was so worn out (I work night shifts). In September I started feeling abnormally tired, but not as bad as when I had mono, so my doctor did blood test. I was surprised to see I tested positive for mono again. I took a week off work and went back. In October I started having issues with one breast so I've been seeing doctors for that. I went back to my family doctor and he did another blood test last week and I was told that I still have mono (he tested again because I've been tired but not abnormally tired). Now, he is sending my to an Infectious Disease doctor but I can't get in until January.My blood test indicate that I've never come out of the Acute Phase (1st phase) of mono. The doctor is concerned about why my body won't or hasn't been able to fight it in 3 months. During one of my breast test the lab report said 'rare histocytes detected.' All my other blood test have been generally normal (low Vitamin D and some WBC slightly higher than the normal range).I'm thinking something, perhaps a blood disease, is giving me a false-positive on the mono test. Seriously, who has Acute Mono for 3 months with no real symptoms? Does anyone have any experience with prolonged mono or blood diseases?",
