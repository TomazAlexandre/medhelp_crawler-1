            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Generalized body edema severe anemia, a failing heart, serious kidney disease, liver problems, electrolyte imbalance, polycystic ovary, low protein in the blood, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and disorders of adrenal gland. Collection of fluid or the non pitting edema of hypothyroidism can precipitate carpel tunnel syndrome too. Disorders of kidney, parathyroid gland, malabsorption syndromes and a diet poor in calcium can be the cause for low calcium in blood. Hence tests will have to be done to rule out all the abve mentioned problems.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm confused. I have been suffering many symptoms over the last 6-8 months, the main ones being; generalised odema/edema, headaches, and menstrual irregularities. I had a baby 8 months ago so at first it was not unusual that my menstrual cycles may be disturbed. But after the months passed and the swelling in particular didn't improve, I've had tests again.6 months ago, there was a low serum Phosphate level, the doctor wasn't to unnerved about it but wanted to keep an eye on it, then last week I had more blood tests and although the Phosphate was within normal range, the Calcium level is now low.I have also had a history of having low protein, albumin, and creatinine levels although I believe they are presently within normal range...My doctor has referred me to someone at the local hospital but I just wanted to be a little prepared for what they might be looking at, as I have also recently had many other physical issues including Carpal tunnel syndrome, and I am starting to feel like my body is falling to bits!",
