            "answer": "Pneumonia normally is only present with temp. Bronchitis on the other hand does not.\u00a0\u00a0You could be sore from coughing. I know this sounds too easy, but drinking plenty of water will thin the secretions so they can be coughed up out of the lungs. Smoking could be part of the problem.\u00a0\u00a0See MD for antibiotics and maybe you can clear the cough up. Hope this helps GOD BLESS",

    "question": "Having diabetes and a sore chest and back with a croupy sounding cough has me concerned about waling pneumonia or worse. Everything I read about pneumonia says there is a fever and chills but I don't have those symptoms. Could smoking be the culprit? I'm 56 and a female. Type 1 diabetes. Thank you, S",
