            "answer": "My name is Ardy Johnson and I am a volunteer with the JDRF, please understand I am not qualified to give you medical information, but my son was diagnosed with type 1 at the age of 11 and is now 38 years old.What I can give you are the classic symptoms of type 1 and they are:*excessive thirst* excessive urination* excessive hunger* weight loss* fatigue* blurred vision* sugar and ketones in the urineI can also tell you the \u201cnormal\u201d BG range is 80-120 (some might suggest 70-120) but you can see your son isn\u2019t too far out of the range, with the exception of the one at 158, however one blood sugar doesn\u2019t a diagnosis make\u2026unless it is extremely high.When my son was diagnosed we knew none of the symptoms, so we missed them all, although I was becoming concerned about all the water he was drinking and all the trips to the bathroom, plus signs of fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunate for us my brother was visiting for Christmas and he recognized all the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0So Jeff was diagnosed on Christmas Eve with blood sugars over 700.Having said all of that, if I were you, I would certainly keep my eye on this, and continue to check his blood sugars, and most importantly follow your gut.\u00a0\u00a0If you continue to have concerns I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to go back to the doctor because you are absolutely right in not wanting to let something bad happen regardless of what a potential diagnosis might be.I hope this has been helpful to you and I wish you good luck in bringing closure on your concerns.",
