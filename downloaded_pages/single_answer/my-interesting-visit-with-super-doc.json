    "question": "Well today was the day to see Super Doc again, for the first time after the gov. doctor told me I have MS. I told him what gov. doc said.He told me that originally... his thoughts also were that I have MS.He said they do three very large MS trials there, he sees and treats a great many MS patients, and he is usually very sure about a 'MS brain' when he sees it. He said with my first brain scan, he consulted with another person (didn't catch exactly who) and they jointly decided it was their opinion that I did not have MS. He wondered if gov. doc is a Neurologist, this I do not know.He did tell me there are a good deal of 'spots' on my brain. (He called them spots). He ordered another brain MRI, the evoked potential test, and a doppler of my brain and neck arteries (I believe).He said his conclusion is that my brain damage is from multiple mini strokes, orginally caused by the diabetes. He wanted to look at the arteries. He was very kind as he always is, and talked to me in depth. Tomorrow I am to have the evoked potential test.He said if both tests look as he suspects they will, he will stay with his diagnosis of stroke damage. The doppler test is to see if the arteries in the brain or neck could be causing mini strokes? (I think)So if this happens, I have two doctors telling me two different things. I know my neurologist is very capable and trust his judgement. But I am not sure what to think about it all.Jazzy",
