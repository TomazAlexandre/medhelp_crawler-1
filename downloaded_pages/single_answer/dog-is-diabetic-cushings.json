            "answer": "It makes me wonder if she doesn't actually HAVE Cushings, because uncontrolled diabetes can cause an overproduction of cortisol which produces signs that are IDENTICAL to Cushings.\u00a0\u00a0She is actually awfully young for Cushings, most of the dogs that get it are in their senior years, although it's not impossible for a younger dog to develop it.She is a poodle mix, and for some reason, Poodles are one of a handful of breeds that are more likely to develop Cushings.\u00a0\u00a0The others are dachshunds, German Shepherds, terriers, beagles and boxers, in no special order.Polydipsia (increased thirst) and polyuria (increased urination), while they ARE signs of Cushings Disease, are also the primary signs of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0From what you have said, it doesn't sound to me like they had totally gotten her diabetes under control before they decided that she had Cushings Disease, so that's why I kind of have a feeling that all of her symptoms MAY, indeed, be related to the diabetes and not Cushings.I would take her for a second opinion and to see if another vet can possibly get the diabetes under control, because I just have a gut feeling that if you can get the diabetes under control, the Cushings symptoms might just go away.\u00a0\u00a0That's not definite, mind you, but this just doesn't sound like a sure case of a young dog being diagnosed with BOTH of these diseases at the age of only 5.If there is a veterinary college near you, try to make an appointment with them to have her examined and worked on.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, please let us know what happens.\u00a0\u00a0This case is very interesting and I am anxious to know if she does, indeed, have both problems.Ghilly",

    "question": "Hello,I need justification and some positive feedback for my peace of mind. I have a bichonpoo who turned 5 in September. In October she was diagnosed with diabetes, and we could not get it under control. Then in December she would eat her food and then about 5 hours later she would throw it all up. We took her to the vet and they stated she had high liver levels. They had her hospitalized and stated they wanted to test her for cushings disease. I had the test done and it came back positive. We got 2 months of Trilostane 10mg and give it to her along with the insulin shot of 4mg. Basically, the vet said she had diabetes and cushings and told me to get the pills and that was it. She has been on her pills since Christmas Eve and I don't know what I should be looking for. She has increased appetite, but I feel she was always like that. She still urinates a lot as well, and is not very active but she never was active. I guess I just need some advice and if anyone has experienced this as well.",
