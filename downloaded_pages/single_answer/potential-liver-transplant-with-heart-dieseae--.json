    "question": "Hello,My father has had a long history of heart dieseae mostly based off of genetics with some occasional bad dietary choices here and there. He had his first heart attack back in 2010, and he recently had another much more minor one in the past month. Unfortunately, for now, the heart is not the prime concern.It turns out that the crestor that he has been on for many years to control his cholesterol has done a number on his liver. His liver is still functional, and to my knowledge would last him a while. However, it is now enlarged to the point where it is causing varasee (spelled wrong) vains on his stomach. These are apparently just time bombs waiting to burst. The problem is that many of the liver treatments including the potential for a transplant are all too risky for someone who has his heart conditions. We are seeking more medical advice from different hospitals, i fear that his case is too risky for most doctors to take on. So i wanted to see if anyone knows of someone who has gone through similar circumstances and found a viable option.Thank you,We live in Virginia USA",
