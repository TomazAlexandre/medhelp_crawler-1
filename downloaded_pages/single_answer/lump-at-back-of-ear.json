            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms blood from nose can be due to a foreign body, nasal polyps, bleeding hemangiomas (localized collection of blood vessels), habit of picking at the nose, a tumor or inflammation due to say a nose ring.If there is a cough also then there is a chance of infection and sinusitis too. Rarely only nasal bleed can be due to a brain problem like a tumor.Please consult an ENT specialist. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Take care!",
