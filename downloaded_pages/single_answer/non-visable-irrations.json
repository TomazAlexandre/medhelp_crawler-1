            "answer": "Get your sugar checked to be safe. Diabetes can cause weird things.I Have a similar problem. But the pain is always in the same place. I went to all kinds of doctors, even an allergist. No answers. The pain or feeling is deeper than the skin but not in the muscle. It kind of feels like burning.A couple dermatologists said eczema, but they say that to 9 out of 10 people that walk through the door. I finally ruled that out, after many visits to a University Dermatologist. But it's rare to find one that will listen and test. They want you out in less than a minute, they schedule fifty people an hour. Need to pay for the Beemer.",

    "question": "Typically have some random sensitive areas on my body that have no visual sign of irritation, just an area that is slightly painful to the touch. Normally I\u2019ll get this sensation somewhere in on my leg, my hand going to my wrist or on my face. Recently I have had this on my face and it doesn\u2019t seem to be going away. It is around my left ear to my left eye, to mid jaw and around the back of my neck. Again there, is no visual signs that there is irritation only that the skin is slightly sensitive to the touch.My father had a history of diabetes and heart disease. I don\u2019t believe it's related however these frequent symptoms are beginning to worry me.Thanks,O",
