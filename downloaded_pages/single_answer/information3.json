            "answer": "Hi thanks for writing.I am not sure what 355 is? AST, ALT? Doesn't matter really. If you have cirrhosis you have scaring of the liver and that is what you are concerned with. Blood values only tell a small part of the story.Do you have chronic hepatitis C or only fatty liver. Is your fatty liver disease due to alcohol abuse?If it is confirmed that you have cirrhosis. Then you need to be under the care of a hepatologist. You need a specialist not a general practioner. They are need qualified to help you manage all the particulars of cirrhosis. You need a doctor that specializes in liver disease. I am not sure how the British health system works, but you need a doctor to monitor you from now on and give you options for managing your illness. Since you don't mention any signs of decompensation, (vomiting blood, fluid retention in your abdomen, feet and lower legs, etc.) which is the the last stage of cirrhosis, commonly called End Stage Liver Disease you can still try to reverse or slow down further liver damage.For non alcoholic fatty liver disease here are standard recommendations...Lose weight. If you're overweight or obese, reduce the number of calories you eat each day and increase your physical activity in order to lose weight. Aim to lose 1 or 2 pounds a week. If you've tried to lose weight in the past and have been unsuccessful, ask your doctor for help.Choose a healthy diet. Eat a healthy diet that's rich in fruits and vegetables. Reduce the amount of saturated fat in your diet and instead select healthy unsaturated fats, such as those found in fish, olive oil and nuts. Include whole grains in your diet, such as whole-wheat breads and brown rice.Exercise and be more active. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. Incorporate more activity in your day. For instance, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk instead of taking short trips in your car. If you're trying to lose weight, you might find that more exercise is helpful. But if you don't already exercise regularly, get your doctor's OK first and start slowly.Control your diabetes. Follow your doctor's instructions to stay in control of your diabetes. Take your medications as directed and closely monitor your blood sugar.Lower your cholesterol. A healthy plant-based diet, exercise and medications can help keep your cholesterol and your triglycerides at healthy levels.Protect your liver. Avoid things that will put extra stress on your liver. For instance, don't drink alcohol. Follow the instructions on all medications and over-the-counter drugs.If you also have hepatitis C new treatments that have just become available here in the US. I don't know if they are in Great Britain as yet. Ask your doctor about them. They are called Incivek and Victrelis.As far a Liver Cancer is concerned...Once a person has advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis they are more prone to developing HCC, liver cancer then the average person without advanced liver disease. AFP and imaging is performed to look for any developing cancer of the liver. Your AFP is normal. But AFP doesn't tell the whole story, it must be combined with ultrasound, CT or MRI to be accurate. You will need to have an AFP blood test and a imaging scan from now on every 6 months. The specialist will order these for you.As far as mortality. If you can stop or slow down what is damaging your liver now you can still lead a full life!!! The hepatologist will tell you what you need to do. You can save your life and lots of suffering if you act to stop your liver disease now. If you don't manage your cirrhosis in time you will need a liver transplant to continue living. You should do everything possible not to let this happen to you. Livers are in short supply and waiting for one is a nightmare assuming you get one. There are too many that die while waiting for a transplant. You don't want to even be in the position. I have decompensated cirrhosis and was diagnosed with liver cancer on June 1st so I can tell you from personal experience, don't let what happened to me - happen to you please.Keep us informed of your progress and people here will help you through step by step. You are still young and have a lot of living to do. Take responsibility for managing your cirrhosis and you can lead a charmed life.Hector",
