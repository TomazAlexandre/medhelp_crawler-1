It su cks some times but I just remind myself its for my baby and my health. We are stronger then they are. I hate when he offeres me some, knowing I'm going to decline and he says oh good you passed th test.... Like really your testing me? Ugh! Men can be so unsupportive sometimes.",

    "question": "Not really a question more of a rant. I'm 32 weeks and about 5 weeks into a controlled diet with gestational diabetes....When i first found out my husband was instantly like \"oh I'll eat just what you eat we will do it together! \"Well that lasted..... a week? And now he could care less. And it seems even more extreme.... buying a chocolate bar for the 2 hour drive home..... a KING SIZE chocolate bar.... or an extra chocolate doughnut when we go pick up coffee.Maybe I'm completely over reacting. ... BUT if you knew me before I had a crazy sweet tooth so this has been really difficult for me but I'm doing it for OUR baby. Would just be nice to have a little back up.... or at least get a little educated so he quits offering me things I can't eat or questioning everything I am eating.....OK rant over. :)",
