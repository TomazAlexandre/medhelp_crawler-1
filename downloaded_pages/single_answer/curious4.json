            "answer": "Hi ron,First I want to welcome you to the Pain Management Forum. I need to let you know that there are NO Doctors on this Forum. We are ALL CP (Chronic Pain) Patients that help each other through the expertise that we have gained from our OWN Pain experiences.I'm TERRIBLY sorry to hear of the Neuropathy\u00a0\u00a0that you are having in your feet.\u00a0\u00a0My husband had SEVERE Neuropathy in his legs and feet as well as his arms.\u00a0\u00a0His was from Diabetes and so I KNOW how painful this if for you!!How sad that you had to have Chemo as I ALSO know how this can effect your body in so MANY different ways.UNFORTUNATELY, your Doctor might be correct about the Neuropathy being permanent. I HOPE that he/she is wrong but you need to be prepared for that fact that it MIGHT be permanent.\u00a0\u00a0:(I don't know how long he can continue prescribing the pain meds for you.\u00a0\u00a0He MIGHT e able to continue doing it forever OR he might want to switch you to a PM (Pain Management) Doctor.\u00a0\u00a0This is something that YOU need to have a frank discussion with him/her about.\u00a0\u00a0Together, you and he/she can come up with a plan that will be the MOST beneficial to you.\u00a0\u00a0:)PLEASE keep us updated on what you decide with your Doctor's help.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you the VERY best!!I'll be looking forward to your update.............Sherry\u00a0\u00a0:)",
