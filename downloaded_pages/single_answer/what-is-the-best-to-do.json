            "answer": "It is to my understanding that normal fasting glucose levels is <100 mg/dl (I've also read <99). Prediabetes is considered in the range of 101-125 mg/dl. At 126 mg/dl you become diabetic and there is no turning back and no cure. You should be scared since you're at the borderline of prediabetes. It doesn't take much to turn that nasty corner. Diabetes prevention, in your case, is rather easy and can be controlled by watching what you eat - saying no to sweets craving is a big step in the right direction - moderate exercise, and maintaining a healthy body weight.",

    "question": "im 22 yrs old, 134lbs, 5'4 in height. The other day i check my blood sugar after fasting for 10hrs and it is 100, i was worried so that day i did some exercise and did not eat any sweets and eat minimal rice. so i check my sugar the next day it just goes down to 99. im just worried because im still 22 yrs old, and im already having that sugar level, is it normal for my age? im scared because it might progress to type II diabetes. And what would be the best to do in my situation?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.......",
