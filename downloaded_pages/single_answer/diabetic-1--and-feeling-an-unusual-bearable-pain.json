            "answer": "Nobody on a website can diagnose you or tell you what to do. You should see your doctor about the pain and find out if it is something to worry about.That is also a fair amount of weight loss. It is normal to lose weight on diagnosis with Type 1 but this is a long time to still be losing weight. How are your blood sugars? Are they stable? I would suggest checking with your doctor also about the continued weight loss. If your blood sugars are stable than you should have your thyroid checked. Thyroid problems are common in people with Type 1 Diabetes.By the way this is a Type 2 forum.",

    "question": "Hi. I am a Diabetic Case 1. My Age is 34 Years and i was detected with this disease 3 years Ago. My weight at the time of detection was 72KGs and Currently is 56 KGS., I have been feeling a pain from the last three days under the naval ie the lower right side of the abdomen towards the Groin.The Pain isnt consistently there, it happens twice or thrice a day comes as a wave, goes and sometimes leaves a consistent feel without pain (some kind of heavyness) and the pain whenever arises is bearable. I have also analysed that it normally happens when i get up from the chair or bed. And i also feel a tightness(not very heavy but is there) on the left side of the Naval. And i feel some kind of air\u00a0\u00a0in my belly. Though i have consistently lost weight but i dont feel vomating, or any other uncomfort. Am regular on brisk walking and feel okay while working too.\u00a0\u00a0Kindly suggest.",
