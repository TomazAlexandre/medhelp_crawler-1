    "question": "HiI was wondering whether you could provide some advice on non alcoholic fatty liver disease. My mum has cirrohosis, fatty liver and inflammation. she has been mistaken by a nurse as pregnant she is so bloated in the abdomin ( it does not seem like fat, it is solid). the remainder of her body is quite slim. She keeps as fit as she is able following a leg injury, prior to this she was a keen tramper. She eats very little fatty foods, and dislikes sugar, she has always avoided both fats and sugars. she has been vegetarian for 30 years. her dietician said her diet could not be improved much based on a food diary. She has type II diabetes and although medicated and avoiding sugars and carbohydrates this seems to be progressing further. she has high cholesterol and blood pressure, and takes blood pressure pills.Her doctors seem to have written her off as \"cheating\" on her diet since she ha not been successful at loosing weight.Having kept an eye on her eating while living at home for a year, she eats as the rest of the family do, a healthy diet. she does not drink fizzy drinks or alcohol, and does not snack. our main meals are balanced healthy diets.\u00a0\u00a0No-one seems to be able to tell us what can be done to treat her liver problems, and i am concerned she will continue to decline to liver failure. If her liver problems are not alcohol, and not hepatitus (she was tested), and not a fatty diet, what can it be and how do we find out and treat it??? It seems like we have been put in the too hard basket by the medical profession.Thanks",
