            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms sound very much like diabetes. I would suggest you get tested again at a different time with whats known as a glucose tolerance test, as blood sugar levels change throughout the day and so your previous test maybe invalid. Chronic liver or kidney disease is very rare in someone of your age unless you are an alcoholic. Other then diabetes my thinking would involve an infection (easily treated with anti-biotics) or an inflammation reaction (eg. hepatitis or nephritis).Do you have any of the following symptoms, these would indicate a problem with the liver rather then the kidneys: bad breath, skin rashes, itchy skin, excessive sweating, offensive body odour, dark circles around the eyes. Any futher questions feel free to ask.RegardsDr Foot",

    "question": "I've just been to the doctors, due to feeling rundown and fainting last Tuesday (a week a go). I've also been feeling thirsty alot, and have been about 5-6 pints per day. He tested me for diabetes by doing a stick test, the test showed negative for excessive sugar, but positive for protein and blood. He seemed to think I have a bladder infection, but for me, that doesn't add up. I have ten days to wait for my tests to come through, and for me, it's going to be hell.I'm 26, fit and used to drink quite alot when i was 18(ish). I was just wondering what people think it could be? I know I can't be told like this what it is for sure, but i've been looking on google, and read it could be kidney disease. Quit grim really...If anyone could shine a light on what it 'might' be, I'd appreciate it.Also, I have some pain in my bladder area.",
