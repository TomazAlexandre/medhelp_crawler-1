    "question": "I have recently in the past few months been experiencing dry mouth and dry sinus when sleeping. I drink water and that helps temporarily. But every time I lay down and sleep for any amount of time it happens. I have Type 11 diabetes and the sugar levels are ok, besides I have not had this before. I woke up last night and whatever the part of the sinus that drains into your throat was so dry it was swollen and irritated. I spoke with my pharmacy about the meds I have been only recently prescribed (metformin,and simvastin) and they said that this was not their side effects.",
