            "answer": "Hi GApeach_27,Bacteria flowing in the bloodstream can multiply quickly and lead to a potentially life threatening condition called Sepsis. Ciprofloxacin is a pretty powerful antibiotic that is only used in a life threatening infection,so I would even wonder why they didn't admit you to the hospital. The level of bacteria in your blood was evidently still low enough that they decided they could have you stay at home and start antibiotics and come back in to have your blood retested. It is very important though that you take every dose as instructed and if you have any worsening of symptoms you should call 911 or go to the emergency room right away.When they did a blood culture the pathogen causing the infection would have been identified under a microscope,and between your clinical symptoms and it probably being a common pathogen found in UTI's that's probably how they came to the conclusion they did. Although I agree it's unusual that they didn't do a Urinalysis,to culture and look for blood and test kidney function. Blood tests can check the majority of renal(kidney)function but there are some things only a Urinalysis can find.I don't know your clinical history but have you suffered from chronic UTI's? If left untreated they can spread up into the kidneys and then into the blood. Do you have unmanaged Diabetes or are you immune compromised(cancer,chemo,HIV,antibody deficient)?Here's a couple links were you can read more about renal infection and sepsis:http://mayoclinic.com/health/kidney-infection/DS00593http://mayoclinic.com/health/sepsis/DS01004Let me know how you do or post more questions/info and take care.",

    "question": "\"I have been feeling awful lately! I had blood tests ran 2 days ago. My doctors office called yesterday and said they found bacteria in my blood from a uti. I have had kidney problems quite frequently lately. When the nurse called she said we needed to discuss my blood work and I would need strong antibiotic. That was it. No in-depth talk.l Since they didn't take a urine sample I had no idea they could detect a uti in your blood The Dr. is starting me on Cipro. Should I be concerned???\"",
