    "question": "I was just told that I have Retinal Vasculitis. The doctor did a lot of tests, but only found one test to support what he was seeing in my eyes. A blood test said I had inflammation. The doctor injected one eye with a steroid shot and wants to do the other in 3 weeks. He says I need to see a specialist about my inflammation, but I don't have any except in my eyes. I hear bad things about the shots and long term effects, so I'm not crazy about taking them. I also have been recently told that I have diabetes. According to the doctor this is why I am getting the shots. I would like to know more about this disease and treatment alternatives.Thanks,tjajranch",
