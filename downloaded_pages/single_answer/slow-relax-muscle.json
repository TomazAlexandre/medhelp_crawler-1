            "answer": "Hi!The symptoms you have been experiencing can be due to neurologic, inflammatory, infectious, metabolic or vascular causes. Conditions like chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy lead to nerve damage outside the brain and spinal cord. It may be seen in association with diabetes, SLE, thyrotoxicosis, chronic hepatitis, lymphomas etc.It causes weakness in arms and legs and may be associated with sensation changes like tingling, numbness etc.Other possibilities are dermatomyositis, hypothyroidism, and fibromyalgia etc.Seek medical help. A complete general and systemic examination for muscle weakness, sensation, reflexes will be helpful. Tests will depend on the suspected cause after clinical examination. I hope it helps.Best wishes!",
