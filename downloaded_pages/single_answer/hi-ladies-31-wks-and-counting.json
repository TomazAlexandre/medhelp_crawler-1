    "question": "Well it seems that when I carry a boy I have gestational diabetes, but I am able to just diet control it. I ended up finding out that I wasn't eatting enough anyway. We finally came up with a name. He will be called Jonathan Alexander Bodiford. All the boys have \"A\" middle names. Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers. My last baby tried to come at 30 wks and I ended up with a 2.5 day stay in the hospital and on bed rest for 6 wks. I have already been having real contractions and sometimes they come pretty regular for an hr or more. I go to the doctor today and she may decided to put me on the breathien to slow them down. I would much rather do that than go through what we did with my dd. I know he is head down because when I do have a contraction I am pretty sure I can feel his head, not to mention the fact that that the whole area near my pubic bone is tender. I hope all is going well with the rest of you and may we all have the patients to wait it out these last few weeks.Brandy",
