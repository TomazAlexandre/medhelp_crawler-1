            "answer": "You are describing hypoglycemia in a 2 year old rather than hyperglycemia(concerns about diabetes).So low sugar in a toddler can be simple due to poor stores on board to sustain prolonged overnight fast or illness, or something a little more complicated like inability to store glycogen or inability to breakdown glycogen or inability to mobilize fats from our adipose tissue. All very very important to look at. So you are definitely NOT bothering your pediatrician. You have classic symptoms of hypoglycemia in your child, shaky, improved with eating. I am more bothered by the fact that he is having this recur several hours later.Please call him and explain that you are worried. Then learn from him how to use a glucose meter that measures low sugars well-the one touch or freestyle are good for this. Then check him when he wakes and if you find any readings under 50 this is serious and needs a workup and immediate referral to a peds endo. Many many times we never find a cause and don't see recurrence but till that time please see your doc. Keep us informed.",

    "question": "I know I am genearally a little paranoid, but I am wondering if some symptoms my toddler has could indicate Type I Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He is 21 months old and has had this insatiable appetite for the past couple of months.\u00a0\u00a0His growth has been a little low on the growth charts despite his eating.\u00a0\u00a0We eat very healthy foods at our house, hardly any candy or junk foods, and lots of grains, fruits, and vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, for the past couple of weeks, he's been acting hypoglycemic, particularly when he wakes up.\u00a0\u00a0He wakes up asking for juice and saying he is hungry, but he gets so upset, he cries unconsolably.\u00a0\u00a0When we can finally calm him down enough to eat, he is SHAKING while he's shoveling food into his mouth.\u00a0\u00a0And then he's fine until the next time he realizes he's starving (may only be 2 hours later) and we start over with the crying.\u00a0\u00a0I think that he drinks a normal amount of liquid and has a normal amount of diapers.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I think his urine smells funny, but it's not a fruity smell.\u00a0\u00a0My Pediatrician is pretty laid back, so I want to have some good information before I approach him with this.",
