    "question": "I'm a 23yr.old, Type 1 diabetic female suffering from stomach problems. I have the following symptoms: bloating, burning feeling on upper stomach, nausea, urge to vomit (doesn't happen though) gas, growling stomach. My bowels are normal. I first had these symptoms 1mth after I was diagnosed with diabetes (Oct2001) and continued to have them for 6mths after until they suddenly went away for no apparent reason. I had done x-rays and bloodtests and results came back normal. I also took Prevacid and NExium and those didn't help much.The symptoms have come back after 5 years. They came back this past March. It's interfering with my life. I've seen my family doctor about it and she prescribed Pantoloc, which doesn't help much, and I've done a blood test to check for H.pylori but it's already been a week so I'm assuming the results came back normal.I don't wake up in the middle of the night with pain or gas. It only occurs during the day and seems that the pain gets worse around dinner time, esp. after dinner. Passing gas makes me feel better temporarily as well as drinking warm water. I eat pieces of bread because it seems to neutralize the acid in my stomach by reducing the growling and the burning feeling. I have no sharp pains and it's the burning and the urge to vomit that bother me. I have a feeling my diabetes may have contributed to these stomach problems because I didn't have any of these symptoms before diabetes. What do you think think this could be?",
