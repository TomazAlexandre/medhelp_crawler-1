            "answer": "Hi,I just have som questions:How old are you?How does your migraine present?How do you describe your aura?Is this associated with any visual symptoms, numbness, slurring of speech.weakness, difficulty walking?Regarding your MRI, white matter lesions ( both minimal and deep) are usually seen among patients with migraines. In some studies, subclinical white matter lesions present more among patients with migraines ( with or without aura) than among nonmigraineurs. Your ventricles are normal in size and shape.An increase in pressure due to an obstruction or hydrocephalus will show abnormalities in the ventricles( you do not have these).The question will be, have you had a complete work up done including coagulation tests, cardiovascular assessment, assessment of peripheral vessels?If you have a strong family history of heart disease and diabetes or if you have been smoking then a complete work up is necessary.",

    "question": "So I get migraines and dizzy spells on a daily basis.. they did a MRI but I kinda need help understanding what the results mean....so if anyone could translate, that'd be great.. here is what the results said....Minimal deep white matter areas of abnormal signal intensity. Etiologies include migraines, gliosis from prior trauma, vasculitis and microangiopathis ischemic changes. The ventricles have normal size, shape and position. There are a couple of punctate deep white matter foci of hyperintensity on the FLAIR sequences within the right subinsular region and left frontal deep white matter. If anyone could please help me id be forever grateful:) help....please:)",
