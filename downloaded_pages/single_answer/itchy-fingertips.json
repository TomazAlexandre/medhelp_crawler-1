            "answer": "this is called hand eczema. you can use a over the counter cortisone cream and lotion to help. avoid excessive water exposure and chemical exposure. also if you develop open wounds be very careful to watch for infection. diabetes does reduce your circulation making you more prone to infection.the bubbles are a part of the eczema. if it doesn't heal or is too worrisome go to the dermatologist, but be sure to let them know of your diabetes. :)",
