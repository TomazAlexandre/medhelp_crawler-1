            "answer": "Too bad you didn't do your research on the side effects of this medication. What you have reported are common although your physician will likely disagree. Physicians tend to agree with the pharmacy sales reps in promoting the product.I suggest you go see a psychologist and work with your physician to get yourself off meds altoghether.\u00a0\u00a0YOu can't quite anti-depressants like celexa cold turkey and you'll suffer even more/worse side effects as a result. The withdrawl side effects can be so bad that people would rather take the medication then go through the withdrawl.Oh, yeah, weight gain (and everything associated with it) and even diabetes have been reported by people taking anti-depressants.",

    "question": "I have been struggling with anxiety now for almost a year. It has taken over my life and I was very hesitant about taking an antidepressant but I decided to take one, I am on celexa and it's about my second week into it I just don't know what to expect and if feelings are normal. I have alot of symptoms however I believe I make them out to be more then they are. I currently have been having cronic headaches and facial numbness almost like a sinus headache Im not sure if that's normal. I also have alot of heart worries, I had an EKG and my doctor said everything was fine, Im still scarred.I guess I just want to know if there is anything to look out for with heart health and if an EKG would show anything or if I need more tests?",
