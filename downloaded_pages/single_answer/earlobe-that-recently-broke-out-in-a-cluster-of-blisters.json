            "answer": "Hi,Is your daughter's blood sugar well controlled?With a history of eczema, this blisters present in her ear lobe may actually be an eczematous flare.Do the blisters present with a wet weeping rash?Is the affected area itchy?I suggest that you have this assessed by the endocrinologist and a dermatologic consult may be necessary. Eczematous disease may recur given the right triggers. Identifying the triggers will be helpful but is not easily done. It is important that your daughter's blood sugar levels are well controlled as diabetes does delay the healing process. A prompt consult for appropriate management is necessary to avoid\u00a0\u00a0any infections.",
