            "answer": "Hi!Anxiety, stress, low blood sugar and low blood pressure could be the cause of increased sweating and your symptoms. Endocrine gland related conditions like hyperthyroidism, acromegaly and glucose control disorders (diabetes and hypoglycemia both) all result in increased sweating. Pheochromocytoma, cancers, carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections too can cause increased sweating. Get your thyroid and adrenal gland function tested.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "Hey there all.I've since January been having a MAJOR slip in my eating disorder, ESPECIALLY in the last 6 weeks! I have been losing 5 pounds a week for the past 6 weeks. Eating only breakfast and dinner most nights as I have to. And in the last two weeks an egg for breakfast and as little as possible for dinner.Now here's my question, today I was out volunteering at a town event handing out burgers, hotdogs and sausages and ect, though today started out cold when it did warm up I was still FREEZING! It was about 8 degrees today, I felt as if my jeans were stoked and my legs especially thighs and knees were damp, I was shaking/shivering uncontrolably, it was hard to breath felt like I was breathing cold compressed air and my lips were burning.Could this in anyway be cause by my eating? My Youth Pastor said today, \"Your attaching Body\" when it was almost at its worst.If it helps I am 5,10 or 5,11 and 128lbs.Also my heart rate today was 70, though that is a healthy heart rate my hear rate is ALWAYS 90 at the least when I am relaxed.Thank You, your input is Greatly Appreachiated!",
