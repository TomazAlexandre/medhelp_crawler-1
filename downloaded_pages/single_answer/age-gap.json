            "answer": "Hello and Welcome.Age gaps of ten years can make a difference as you reach your 50s - 60s and beyond. Much will depend on how well you are.Diabetes, hypertensive medications and other conditions can make a difference in a man's ability to obtain and maintain an erection - or even to ejaculate.Some men note a decline of their libido in the late 30s,\u00a0\u00a0early 40s - other men never seem to experience a lose libido to any great degree. Woman peak in their 30s.Life is a crap shoot. No one knows what the future holds.18 is very, very young. Your fiancee will change and grow in many aspects. It's normal and expected. Her opinions will change. Just as you are very different than you were at 18. Be ready for that. I wouldn't jump into marriage just yet. Give her time - if only a year or two.What I will tell you is - if this is true love - and you're both in it for the long haul - you'll work through any loss of libido and changes of opinions and growth. Don't go into a marriage thinking if it doesn't work out you can get a divorce. Think, if we are having problems how can we fix it. It's easier to walk away than it is to work through things. I know, I've been there. I've now been with the same man for 40 years. Lord where did those years go?But back to your question. If there's love between you both, you'll work out any satisfying issues - on both side. Though age does matter - it's what you do with that fact that truly matters in the end.Good Luck,~Tuck",
