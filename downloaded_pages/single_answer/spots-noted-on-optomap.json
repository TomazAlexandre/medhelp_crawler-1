    "question": "I recently had an optomap done and the doctor noticed two tiny dots (he said they were something blood clots, or vessels or something) and recommended that I get a blood glucose test to rule out diabetes. I am 27 and have no symptoms of diabetes. However I later remember that I had a slight injury to that same eye (I got elbowed and my glasses got pushed into eye resulting in a black eye). My eyes have also been itchy lately, and even thought I know I shouldn't, I have been rubbing them.\u00a0\u00a0Could the injury and/or the rubbing have caused these spots. I bruise very easily.",
