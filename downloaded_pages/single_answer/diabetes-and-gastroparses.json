            "answer": "It's possible it could be gastroparesis since that condition can be due to the presence of diabetes. But if it is what he has, eating a high fat diet is one of the worst things he could be doing because fat is retained longer in the stomach of even 'normal' individuals. Go to gicare.com and look up the gastroparesis diet. Take a look at step 2 and modify his diet to include their suggestions. The overall issue is to make the foods in a 'liquid enough' form for the stomach to more easily pass them through into the rest of his digestive tract.",

    "question": "My husband has been diabetic more than 20 years....about 5 years ago he began having pain in is stomach after a battery of tests he was told to have a \"slow\" stomach but they didn't even have him come back and no treatment. The pain didn't go away and steadily has increased...He was seen @ our ER about 3 weeks ago CT ws done came back ok as far as pancreas . They gave him prevecid and pain pills ( neither of which we brought home we already had those and neither helped) He hasn't slept but dozing since then from the pain. says it's worse when he lies down.\u00a0\u00a0he has no appendix or gall bladder. He eats almost nothing. He has lived on sugar free ice cream and oatmeal for the last 3 months. He buys it 6 and 7 1/2 gallon @ a time. therefore he isn't loosing the weight lots of calories and fat in this. just heard of gastroparses(sp?) from a friend. He has an appointment in March and that was really pushing it to get one then. I came in to where he was sitting last night around 3 am to find him crying....does this sound like it could be this and can you get better from it. I couldn't get him to go back to the dr. we were there last time about 7 hours and really learned nothing. He is getting so depressed...our life as we once knew it does no longer exist...He has became\u00a0\u00a0PAIN as his legs hurt continually from neuropathropy we assume...it is all consuming...We both are retired and thought we could enjoy life a little....it has been the exact opposite...Please HELP!!!",
