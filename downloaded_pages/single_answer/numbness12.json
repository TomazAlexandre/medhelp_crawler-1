            "answer": "Hi,How are you? It is good to know that the diagnostic tests done were fine. Numbness can be caused by a variety of conditions such as nerve injury, pressure on the nerves, lack of blood supply to the area, and medical conditions such as diabetes, underactive thyroid, electrolyte imbalance, medication side effect, TIA, and even migraines. If you experience headache, hemiplegic migraine should be ruled out. If it persists, check with a neurologist for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",
