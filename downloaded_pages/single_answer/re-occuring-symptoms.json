Sometimes tongue similar to a feeling of a burnt tongue. Also coincides with severe fatigue, joint pain and weakness (feel like I am 90) slight headaches and pain to upper left flank. I have also had multiple occurences of the sweats and shakes (blood tested during event nothing found) I have been diagnoised with Proctitus but no reason for having been inflicted with this to date.These symptoms have occured on 3 diffrent occasions in the past 7 years, and todate have been tested for Diabetes, Low blood sugar, Kidney stones, thyroid (ultrasound ruled out) and cat scans of abodominal region for other signs.
