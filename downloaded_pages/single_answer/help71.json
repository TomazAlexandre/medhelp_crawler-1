            "answer": "Hi,Miracles do happen but I do not want to give false hopes. Chronic kidney disease has several stages and kidney failure is the fifth stage which refers to end stage renal disease.\"Approximately 1 million nephrons are present in each kidney, each contributing to the total GFR. Regardless of the etiology of renal injury, with progressive destruction of nephrons, the kidney has an innate ability to maintain GFR by hyperfiltration and compensatory hypertrophy of the remaining healthy nephrons. This nephron adaptability allows for continued normal clearance of plasma solutes such that substances such as urea and creatinine start to show significant increases in plasma levels only after total GFR has decreased to 50%, when the renal reserve has been exhausted. \"Source: http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic374.htmThe above paragraph explains that kidney units called nephrons may actually compensate for damage in kidney tissues by doing much of the extra work .The nephrons may enlarge and increase filtration of urine. In this case, as one goes through the first 3 stages of kidney disease, symptoms may not be apparent as these kidney units try to compensate. However, as the damage increases then symptoms become more manifest. This is true in the case of end stage renal disease or renal failure.In the presence of renal failure, close supervision with a nephrologist is very necessary. Glomerular filtration rate need to be monitored and the underlying cause such as diabetes should be closely managed.In the presence of kidney disease, intake of medications or any supplements need to be closely assessed as most of these substances are being broken down and excreted by the kidneys. If the kidneys are damaged, poisoning or the side effects of these\u00a0\u00a0substances may be readily experienced.There are forms of alternative medical therapy such as acupuncture and reiki (japanese palm healing) that may help without being harmful to your kidneys. These forms of therapy may supplement medical therapy and help alleviate the psychological and physical aspects of the disease.",
