    "question": "Five months ago I woke up with double vision. I have bad eyesight with astigmatism\u00a0\u00a0since I was 5. Double vision lasted 5 months, always getting worse as the day went on. Then 4 weeks ago I woke up and double vision was gone but left eye was burly like I had wrong pair of glasses on. Right eye vision was good, just left was bad. Left eye continued to stay out of focus until yesterday. My vision with corrective lens on seems to be back where it was at 6 months ago. My eye doctor told me during an examination for new pair of glasses yesterday that now my left eye vision has got better than ever before.\u00a0\u00a0My left eye vision in 2010 was -8.50/-3.00/*175 to -6/-2.75/*175 two weeks ago to as of yesterday -7,25/-2.50/003(axis) , Neurology\u00a0\u00a0Dr. appointment today is sending me for MRI with contrast looking for MS, stroke and who knows what else. I have had trouble with my cholesterol and high blood pressure over the last 20 years but they\u00a0\u00a0seem to be normal except for pre-diabectic symptoms now. Blood work was also ordered and being sent to specialist\u00a0\u00a0that deals with eyes ans diabetes. Also have some tremors in hands dr. today spotted. It seems to this point I have no answers and seems strange to everybody that my vision went from good, to double vision, to just blurry vision in one eye to\u00a0\u00a0normal range with prescription glasses on.\u00a0\u00a0Have any ideas what might be going on?\u00a0\u00a0 I also suffer with DDD ,Spinal Stenosis and arthritis in knees. I am 54 years old. I have had migraine headaches for 20 years. I may have a migraine the days of my vision changes.",
