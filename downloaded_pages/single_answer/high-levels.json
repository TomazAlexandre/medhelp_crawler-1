            "answer": "Hi,The creatinine levels reflect filtering function of the kidneys.If there is a prostate cancer with significant obstruction - it is possible to have an increased creatinine. Any obstruction, whether due to stones or a severe infection would lead to a similar result. Hence, the values are not really specific for prostate cancer, not even for prostate disease.Most patients being evaluated for prostate cancer, are in an age group where hypertension and diabetes is fairly common. These 2 disease entities can damage the kidney directly, and hence the raised creatinine would be expected in this scenario.",
