            "answer": "josemanualcruz,It's been a while since your last posting; hope all is well.There are many risk factors for cardiovascular disease.\u00a0\u00a0The traditional risk factors are diabetes, smoking, hypertension, family history, and hypercholesterolemia.\u00a0\u00a0Other commonly recognized risk factors include kidney disease, homocysteinemia, increased Lp(a), apo-B mutations, post-menopausal status, among others.\u00a0\u00a0More controversial but possible associated factors leading to heart disease include autoimmune disease, chronic infections, obesity, and others.An annual physical for a 40 yo male that includes lipid profile, EKG, and basic chemistries are recommended.\u00a0\u00a0This exam will not \"rule out\" every disease, not should it.\u00a0\u00a0We all live with risks each day. As an example, do seat belts \"rule out\" the possibility of dying in your car tomorrow? Obviously, no -- but they do reduce the risk.If you have continues angst regarding your possibility of having cardiovascular disease, you have several options.\u00a0\u00a0The first and most sensible is to see a preventive cardiologist who can council you about further tests that might help better define your risk.\u00a0\u00a0The second thing to do is ensure that you have as healthy a lifestyle as possible. Do you exercise at least 30 minutes every day?\u00a0\u00a0Do you eat more fruits and vegetables than starch and fats? Have you given up tobacco?\u00a0\u00a0A third option is to ask yourself if your anxiety about your cardiovascular status is a healthy anxiety or an excessive anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0If its excessive, seek counseling.Hope that helps.",
