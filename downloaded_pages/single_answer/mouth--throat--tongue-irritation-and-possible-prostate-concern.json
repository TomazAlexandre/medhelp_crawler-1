    "question": "I've recently noticed some changes in my health which doctors have not been able to diagnose.I was Diagnosed with Chlamydia on 12/22/05, symptoms were mild and I was prescribed with Doxycycline. Everything seemed fine.Around 2/7/06 I had anonymous sexual encounter, protected sex with a condom however I did perform brief oral sex on a woman.Within 2 days I had a tingling sensation on my lower lip.Then my lower half of the lower lip turned dry and has been ever since.Within 2 weeks my throat seemed irritated with no pain,soreness,nothing swollen including glands and nodes.Within 4 weeks my tongue had some white stuff near the rear taste buds.3 doctors including Ear,Nose,Throat spec and my dentist did not see anything clinical (no thrush) for treatment.I was diagnosed with the start of minor gum disease but some of my symtoms don't match up.At 2 weeks I also tested Negative for STD's.Still need to wait 3-6 months for another HIV test.3-4 weeks of occurance I also had some experience of naseau,depression,mild anxiety attacks.For several weeks,urethra seems swollen off and on with no pain or discharge.Recently both testicles had an aching pain for 2 days that has now gone away.The latest symptom I noticed is poor ejaculation.Only 1/3 to 1/2 of the fluid,no liquid, seems like all sperm.I'm concerned if my sexual encounter is related or just coincidence with an underlying cause.I've read that STD cultures do not always have a high level of accuracy.\u00a0\u00a0Will follow up with STD testing again, along with other bloodwork for Diabetes, Hepatitis and such.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice/opinions appreciated",
