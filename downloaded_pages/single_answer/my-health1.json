            "answer": "Hi David,How are you? Encephalomalacia refers to a condition that causes the brain to become soft and may be caused by injury to the brain such as hemorrhage or bleed into the brain. Although rare, and may not be directly applicable in your case, extensive softening of the brain can also be caused by degeneration or deterioration of the brain and could be the result of a health condition or disease process. With regards to dementia, there are many factors\u00a0\u00a0to consider including age, family history,alcohol use, atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, smoking and even depression. You may need to discuss this with your doctor for proper evaluation.Take care and do keep us posted.",
