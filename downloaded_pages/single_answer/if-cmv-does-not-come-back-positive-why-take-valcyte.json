            "answer": "Hi!A positive IgG antibody titer just means that you had a CMV infection in past. Current infection would raise the IgM levels.\u00a0\u00a0Whether currently you have CMV infection or not can only be diagnosed by showing presence of CMV in blood, urine, saliva, bronchial secretions, etc. PCR tests are very useful in detecting current infection. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined before taking up any antiviral medication. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
