    "question": "I am in my mid-fifties. I have diabetes and I am taking a full dose of oral medications including Actos, Januvia (a new medication which supposedly slows down the production of glucose after a meal), Precose (which slows down carbohydrate absorption in the small intestine and, of course, Glucovance (combo of metformin and ?).For the last 2 years or so, I have had regular but relatively mild belching every 20 minutes or so. HOWEVER, when I do any kind of physical activity, which could be a leisurely walk down the block even, I immediately get hearburn in the back of my chest. It is bad enough that I have to slow down my walk and somehow either try to induce a belch or let it come naturally and then I can walk the normal paced walking again. Otherwise, the 20 minute belching does not bother me much and if I am at my desk working all day, I can time the belches, but as long as I am not active I do not get any heartburn. This activity induced hearburn is a severe damper in my life-style because I am not able to participate in any kind of physical activity including yoga (or sex!)What do I do? I have not yet seen any gastro-enterologist.",
