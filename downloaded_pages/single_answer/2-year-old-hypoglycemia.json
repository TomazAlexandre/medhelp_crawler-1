    "question": "five months ago my daughter was 1.5 and in the morning she was unresponsive and glazed over. My husband and I rushed her to the er and they said she had very low glucose levels and rushed us to a children's hospital. We spent 5 days hospitalized where we fasted her and ran labs to see her levels. They said it must have been an isolated event a d our endocrinologist agreed but said if it happened again we would develope further. Now, four days ago my daughter woke up in the same state and we now had a glucose monitor. We checked her and she was at a 25 so we rushed her in again and were hospitalized again. They did the same fasting and labs and said they had no answers for me that they were \"stumped\" she was a \"medical mystery\" and a \"conundrum\". Her labs came back with low glucose, low insulin and low thyroid hormone. I don't know what this can be and I feel its diabetes but why can't they find out and give me answers? Also, my daughter is very small for her age and is thristy frequently and eats frequently. I am reaching out hoping this sounds familiar to someone or someone has answers for me. Now that this has happened twice I m very persistent on getting answers for my tiny girl. Please help.",
