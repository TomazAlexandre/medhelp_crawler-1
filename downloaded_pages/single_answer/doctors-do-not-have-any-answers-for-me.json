That's how long it took for me to find a doctor who could tell me what was causing them.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't had one since that day in 2004.",

    "question": "A few months ago, I was hospitalized for loss of feeling in my left leg. I woke up, went to get out of bed and fell over, couldn't get up. I went to hospital treated as a stroke victim, tests showed negative for stroke. Since then I have had many other complications arise. I have had a period for 3 months, with only one or two weeks without my period at a time. I have had dizziness, weakness in my left side. Doctors have run mutiple tests, from shocks to test my nervous system, MRIs, MRA, CATscans, and numerous blood work. I am not anemic, my iron is fine. I am exhausted 24hrs a day. I get blurred vision without warning. I have been having bleeding gums for the past 2 months and my dentist sent me to my physician for answers, since she felt it had to do with more of my other problems, not just dental. My physcian did not have any answers for me and has told me I am the problem to be solved for my ob/gyn. That he has done all he can. My feet keep falling asleep. I do get discharge when I am not on my period. But, still no answers yet. Any ideas what other tests I should be having done? Any good doctors that you feel will provide me \"nice\" service that will help me find answers, I have been to the Cleveland Clinic in the past for my migraine headaches, but I don't know who to even see for these numerous problems. Any ideas what could be wrong? I just need a direction to head in. I am in so much pain and this is affecting my job and my daily life and I feel hopeless. No one has been able to figure out what is wrong with me.",
