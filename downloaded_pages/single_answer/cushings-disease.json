            "answer": "Well, I can understand you not be interested in any of the treatments but in reality, if you have a tumor, the first line is surgery, and then radiation. Chemo is not given for Cushing's syndrome or disease. There are a few medications being studied right now and a few\u00a0\u00a0you can take, but they cause adrenal insufficiency, so you then have to take replacement steroids. Taking replacement steroids can be tricky (I do it daily).I had a pituitary tumor.I also had PCOS. Also thyroid and oodles of other problems from the Cushing's.Cushing's is nothing to mess with so you need to find an expert neuro-endocrinologist. You cannot rule it in or out with one test or even two. The MRI may or may not tell you if you have a tumor (up to 40% of the tumors can hide, but it can still be there) and the size of the tumor is irrelevant to your symptoms or the damage being done.Get copies of everything - labs, reports, films and try to learn all you can (which you seem to be doing) which at first may freak you out, but soon hopefully you will come to terms with it and will not take any crud from a doc who will want to pull any fast ones on you. It is important to know what is going on.I had both pituitary and adrenal surgery (hah - you did not have that one!!!) and now have a wicked kewl tan for the first time in my life. There are very active boards just on Cushing's if you need more info.",

    "question": "I am only 24 just went to the gyno for the first time in 6 years. She did routine tests and found that not only am I a diabetic, and I have PCOS, but I also had some other things going on. She suggested that I see a primary are physician right away which I did, and her results reveiled the diabetes and metabolic syndrome along with cushings disease. I just went for more MRI'S and some other tests. Just curious to see if anyone else has heard of this or actually has the disease. I read up on it and the treatments are chemo, radiation, surgery. None of which I would personally be interested in.",
