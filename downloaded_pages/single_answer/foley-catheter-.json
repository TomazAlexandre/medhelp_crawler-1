            "answer": "Hi,Blood in urine is not a normal finding after a C-section.What was the cause of the blood in the urine?Were you evaluated for any ureteral injury following the appearance of the blood?It is possible that one of your ureters may have sustained some injury as this has been known to happen during abdominal and pelvic surgeries.An injury of that sort can resolve spontaneously or progress to develop complications such as a fistula or stricture.Nausea, frequency of urination, and pain during urination are signs of a UTI.Are you lactating?How much is your daily intake of fluids?It is necessary that you have imaging studies to rule out any structural abnormalities (stricture) that can predispose you to UTIs.It is also possible that you may have been infected by an bacteria, during your admission, that is causing the repeated infections.If you are breastfeeding keep your daily fluid intake in excess of 3000 ml.Increase the intake of citrus juices and other vitamin C rich foods.Pass urine before and after sex.Have your doctor do a urinalysis and a blood test to evaluate kidney function.Do keep us postedon your doubts and progress.Regards",
