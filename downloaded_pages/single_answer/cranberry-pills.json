            "answer": "Dear jcastro:Congratulation!If you like cranberries and cranberry juice, it is safe to consume during pregnancy. However, it is not recommended to be taking cranberry-containing supplement during pregnancy and breast-feeding due to lack of safety information.Cranberry juice may help prevent urinary tract infections or UTI, but it has not been proven to treat UTI. I am not sure why you are taking cranberry product on a regular basis.Cranberry is high in vitamin C but also contains a significant amount of salicylic acid (similar to aspirin). Salicylic acid helps reduce inflammation but also thins the blood. It needs to be avoided when taking with other blood-thinning medications, such as warfarin. Avoid taking aspirin when you are pregnant, it is in Pregnancy Category D during the third trimester.Note that cranberry juice may be high in sugar content. So, if you have gestational diabetes, it should not be consumed in large amount. In addition to regular check-ups with your OBGYN, you should consult your provider with any health concerns, especially during pregnancy.For more detailed information, please go to MedHelp's Pregnancy Community and:1.
