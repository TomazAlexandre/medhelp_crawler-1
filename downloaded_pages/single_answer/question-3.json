            "answer": "I didn't want you to feel, that your question was going to go left unanswered, but your question is not that easy to answer. The simple truth, is that all but the \"i cant urinate very good at times\" are sensory symptom's (sx) and wide spread sensory sx's are not usually found in conditions like MS.Wide spread sensory sx's can be caused by so many things, eg vit deficiency, hormonal, diabetes, cancer, thyroid, medications, infection etc etc. that with having wide spread sensory issues it's just less likely to be caused by MS, (which effects the central nervous system) and more likely one of its mimics. see link below.....Urination issues are so very common, your description is too vague to even guess if it could be related to nerve damage, or one of the more common causes, which most of the time it turns out to be.I went looking for something that might help and this one lists other causes for sensory nerve issues, which may be of some help in looking into alternative causes.http://www.webmd.com/brain/nerve-pain-and-nerve-damage-symptoms-and-causesCheers.......JJCheers............JJ",
