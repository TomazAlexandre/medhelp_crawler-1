    "question": "Don't know if I'm in the right place or not, but here goes...My brother is 56 years old. He was diagnosed with type 1 (juvenile) diabetes when he was about 12.His sugar levels have proved to be MOST complicated....very brittle and he was never able to get a good grip on it.His body has been thru so much!!! In 1996 he was ready for a kidney transplant; while testing for the transplant it was discovered that he needed a quadruple bypass, which he had done. Then proceeded to the transplant. After the transplant he got cancer (which he beat), he has had laser treatments on his eyes and is blind in one of them.Has congestive heart failure and retains major fluid. He has very poor circulation in his legs and can't feel his feet (but thank God they are both still there!) OKAY, I'm getting to the point...recently he had a stroke and was admitted to the hospital. His creatine was 1.9 when he was admitted and rose to 3 and continues to climb. They biopsied this kidney today and was told that it was diabetic decline and he is on the path to renal failure. Told that there is nothing more they can do. They are sending him home and now what happens???? Is there a time frame to all this???He is in a hospital about 3 hours away and I just don't know what to do. Thank God again, he has 2 daughters that live near the hospital so he can stay there as long as necessary.I guess what I'm asking is: Has anyone had any experience with situations like this? Does the renal failure come on fast??",
