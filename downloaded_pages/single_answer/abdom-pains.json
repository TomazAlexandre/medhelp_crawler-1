            "answer": "Hi!Once in a while it is ok to get a loose stool. However, if it persists beyond a week despite eating light, taking probiotics etc, then you need to get this investigated.Chronic loose stool or diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc. If celiac, Crohn\u2019s and other problems have been ruled out then lactose intolerance and IBS are the possibilities. Pancreatic enzyme disorders, liver dysfunction, HIV, cancer of the gut, and infections by parasites other than giardia can all cause persisting diarrhea. Lyme and lupus are other possibilities that present this way. Please discuss this with your doctor (GI doctor). Take care!",
