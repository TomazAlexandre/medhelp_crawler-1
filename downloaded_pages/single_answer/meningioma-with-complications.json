            "answer": "Hi Mike,It would be unlikely to have such changes in only 4 months.\u00a0\u00a0Or maybe they were there before but not reported.Was the MRI machine this time a much stronger one?Anyway, the approach now would be to agressively control the blood pressure to keep it normal and also to agressively control the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This should stop progression of the microvascular angiopathy.",

    "question": "My wife recently had a Meningioma removed. During the course of her treatments and various tests she was found to being suffering from type 2 diabetes and (inactive) sarcoids. She is also under treatment for long term hypertension. Those problems are under control. The problem is she had her first MRI 4 months after the surgery and though the MRI shows no recurrent tumor it does show \"extensive microvascular angiopathy\" and \"small vessal ischemic changes\". None of this was mentioned with the 4 previous MRI's performed during the last 8 months. The Dr said both are usual consequences of diabetes and hypertension but only 4 months have passed in between the last 2 MRI's. Diabetes and hypertension can and do cause blood vessel damage but, not to my knowledge, suddenly in a 4 month span. Any information would be appreciated. Personally i feel they missed the other problems while diagnosing the meningioma. ....Mike",
