    "question": "My mother is 67 yrs old and has Crohn's Disease (not to mention, Diabetes, Emphezyma, COPD, Thyroid Disease, & had a heart attack around 12 yrs. ago) and my question is about her severe abdominal bloating. She gets so bloated it looks like she's pregnant. It is extremely uncomfortable for her. The information I've discovered on Crohn's is not really matching up with her bloating and she doesn't have diarreha or many bowel movements. Right now its the opposite. I even wonder if shes been misdiagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0Any answer or suggestion would really help. Thank you.",
