What kind of pain is there?Has diabetes been ruled out?Nothing can be said with surety without having a look at the lesions.You could try some antihistamine medications and see if it helps with your symptoms.

    "question": "Last summer my right fore arm was burned in the sun even though I had sun block on. By taking\u00a0\u00a0Gabapentin 300 mg for over 2 mos mos it cleared up. It has returned, my right fore arm only is very sensitive n painful when it flares up. My latest bout is over 2 mos. Yesterday really set off the pain by wearing a long sleeve shirt: shirt was 40% polyester n 60% cotton. Problem; if look at my arm there is \"NO\" surface indicators to the severe sensitivity n pain.",
