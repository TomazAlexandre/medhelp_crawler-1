            "answer": "It is reported that Victoza side effects are usually dose related and gradually decrease over time. How long is \"over time\" or whether side effects diminish altogether has not been reported. Are you taking an oral diabetes medication along with Victoza? I suggest you let your prescribing doctor know of your ill feelings as dose adjustment could be in order.\"Is it usual for side effect to worsen?\"Yes. Inform your doctor right away if you experience any of these serious Victoza side effects:Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue; unusual hoarseness); increased or painful urination; severe stomach pain (with or without vomiting); symptoms of thyroid cancer (eg, lump or swelling in the neck, trouble swallowing, shortness of breath, persistent hoarseness).",
