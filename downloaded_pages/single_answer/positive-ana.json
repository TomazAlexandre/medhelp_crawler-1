            "answer": "Hi!Yes, a person with MS can have positive ANA, but its significance is uncertain. The levels can fluctuate without any known reason. Hence a recent increase in ANA should be predicted with caution. It may not mean anything or it may indicate the presence of autoimmune diseases such as SLE, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, scleroderma, polymyositis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, dermatomyositis, primary biliary cirrhosis, Addison disease, Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus.I am not sure if Gilenya\u00a0\u00a0can cause high ANA values. Please talk to your treating doctor about this. Take care!",
