            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Burning pain is a type of neuropathic pain (which means pain from nerves). There are numerous causes for these types of pains (including diabetes, vitamin deficiency, autoimmune disorders, genetics, etc) but the location of your pain is odd. You mention that you cannot tolerate a shirt touching your skin (aka allodynia). If you have had prior injury to your body, your nerves may have undergone a process called sensitization where the nerves have a lower pain threshold. The nerves thus relay pain when a nonpainful stimulus is applied (i.e., your shirt).Many times these types of pain syndromes respond to medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin. I recommend that you continue to discuss your pain with your primary care physician and perhaps these medical options. If the pain persists without improvement, you may benefit from a chronic pain consult.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
