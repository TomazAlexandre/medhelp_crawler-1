            "answer": "Based on your description, I would have thought it may be a problem with your retina, so that is interesting that the retina specialist was unable to find anything wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had an automated visual field test?\u00a0\u00a0The pattern of any detectable visual field loss would be useful to determine if the blind spot is from glaucoma, retinal detachment, or even a lesion behind the eye.\u00a0\u00a0If all else fails, I would seek a second opinion or perhaps a neuroophthalmologist if one is available in your area.",

    "question": "In my right eye..I have a blind spot...for example covers one of the letters in each word that I am typing.\u00a0\u00a0Outside...it will cover one of the numbers on a speed limit sign.\u00a0\u00a0It is annoying.\u00a0\u00a0One other weird symptom...when looking at say a telephone pole. I see it in sections not one continuous vertical item. Sometimes it appears wavy...sometimes segmented.I have been to a retina specialist and to ophthalmologists.\u00a0\u00a0They regard it as nothing.\u00a0\u00a0But they dont have to live with it.\u00a0\u00a0What causes this.\u00a0\u00a0 Yes I have had auras for years, but this is different. I have had detached retinas in both eyes, but this looks nothing like that either.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure is fine if and a bit on the low side. No to diabetes.",
