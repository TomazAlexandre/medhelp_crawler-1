            "answer": "Hi!Other than IBS or spastic colon you have probably been investigated for Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohn\u2019s disease. Discuss this with your treating doctor. Other causes which should be looked into as a cause of abdominal bloating and discomfort are H pylori infection, diabetes, food intolerance, malabsorption syndromes, constipation, gallbladder and liver problems (need to get specific enzymes done too), pancreatic dysfunction, or taking a diet rich in sulfites. Cancers of the gut and in female ovarian cancer too could be a cause. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "I've been suffering from feelings of fullness and stomach discomfort for several years. It gets worse as the years go by. I been treated by gastroenterologists for years. I've had endoscopies, upper abdominal ultra sound and a digestive study to see how long it takes for food to travel after I eat it. The only thing that was found was a hypatic cyst which I was told was common and nothing to worry about. I had an ERCP a year and a half ago. That provided some alleviation for several months but the discomfort returned. I take dexalent for acid reflux. m smith",
