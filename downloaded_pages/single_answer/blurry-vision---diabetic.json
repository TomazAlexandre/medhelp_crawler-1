It is important with diabetic eye disease to catch it early since that makes the prognosis so much better.\u00a0\u00a0Take my strong advise, make sure he is seen right away since there is a chance he could have a serious problem.Michael Kutryb, MD",

    "question": "My husband was outside over the weekend doing some yard work and it was quite windy, that evening he said that his eye was really blurry.. I told him he must have some dirt in it and to wash his eye out and we didn't talk about it again. That was just yesterday, today he woke up, still a little blurry, but when he went outside in the sunlight, its very blurry, he had to have someone drive him into work today because he did not feel capable of driving. He is diabetic, and his last checkup with an optomotrist was approximately 3 years ago, where we got nothing but excellent news, no damage at all. Could it be maybe that perhaps something did get into his eye and maybe scratch it? would that make it more sensitive and blurry out in the sunlight? or could this be related to his diabetes?",
