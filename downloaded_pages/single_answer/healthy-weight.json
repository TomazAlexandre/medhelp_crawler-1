            "answer": "His weight is just above the 95th percentile and his height is between the 90-75th percentile for his age. He is not extremely overweight for his age. It is recommend increasing children's physical activities (play, dance, sports) to lose weight, and not lower calorie intake due to the need of calories for growth which you are doing. Suggest increasing the physical activities such as catching ball outside, etc. For his age he needs approximately 1800-2000 calories a day to grow. Limit time in front of the TV or non-active-video games. There have been studies showing the longer the length of time a child sit in front of the TV, the greater the weight gain. Limit high sugar drinks/snacks, and try replacing with low fat milk/yogurt, fruit, air popped popcorn, or low-fat cheese. Additional suggestions: cook only low fat meats (chicken, fish, loin of pork) or non-meat sources (soy products, nuts), low fat vegetarian combinations (rice & beans, pasta & beans, low fat cheese & pasta), fat free or low fat dairy products (skim milk, 1% milk, low fat cheese, low fat yogurts, low fat soy milk/yogurt), use plant oils, non trans-fat margarines, and eat a lot of fruits, salads, and vegetables. Eat daily high fiber breads and cereals (oatmeal) and limit \u2018junk\u2019 foods. Hoped that helped you.",

    "question": "My son just turned nine he is about 95 pounds and around 4'6-4'7. Last summer this time he looked healthy and at a normal weight. In a short period of time like 2 months or so he started gaining weight. I thaught he would grow into his weight and it has been a year since the initial weight gain. He is semi active. He is in Tae Kwon Do twice a week. I will admit we are not the healthiest eaters and I myself am 50 pounds overweight and have been batteling with trying to lose it myself for several years. My eleven year old is around 93 pounds and 4'10\". We are member of the YMCA and visit 2-4 times a week. They both play in the xrcade room or swims while he is there. I know I need to set an example for him and am working on that. However, my concern is that his weight gain is tied to something medically wrong like diabetes or something.",
