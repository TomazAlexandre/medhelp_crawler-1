            "answer": "Hello,The urinary symptoms can be due to UTI or urethritis but for the GI (gastrointestinal symptoms), IBS (irritable bowel syndrome ) should be ruled out. The cause of most UTIs is bacteria that initially settle (colonise) around the urethra (urine tube), and then ascend into the rest of the urinary tract. Factors that can cause this to happen include incomplete urinary emptying, hygiene of the urethra, prostate inflammation, urethra narrowing, bladder reflux disease (usually due to leaky valves between the bladder and ureter tubes that connect to the kidneys and diabetes etc.It is better to get a urine examination and urine culture done.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello, I am currently 21 years old and consider myself to be healthy. About a month ago I began having symptoms of prostatitis. I felt a fullness between my scrotum and Anus. I started to drink Cranberry Juice and in a couple weeks i was better. However, following the problem i felt constipated so i took some Milk of Magnesia and it helped me, but then i started having diarrhea, but about a week later all symptoms went away. Shortly after i thought i was better i started having a burning feeling after urination. Now my urethra feels very tender or sore and after i urinate my urethra has a burning sensation and also my stool is mixed between solid and liquid. I know my symptoms are very spread out, but over the course of the past month thats what has occurred.",
