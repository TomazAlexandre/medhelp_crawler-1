    "question": "My husband just began the process to be listed for liver transplant and completed the Creatinine Clearance test.\u00a0\u00a0Our Hepatologist said it showed his kidneys weren't working great and he may need to see a kidney doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't have the actual results in front of him but says he saw them cross his desk the other day.\u00a0\u00a0I always ask for copies of all tests to be faxed directly to us so I do have them.\u00a0\u00a0His Creatinine Serum is 0.57 (low) it is always low when he has regular labs and I understand this to mean it is not an indicator of kidney problems as that would show a high level.\u00a0\u00a0I understand that with severe liver disease the Creatinine Serum is often low.\u00a0\u00a0The other test showing a flag is the Creatinine Clearance which is high. It is 171.\u00a0\u00a0It is my understanding that when the Creatinine Clearance is LOW that's when there is concern over the kidneys not working, not when it's high???\u00a0\u00a0He said his kidneys aren't clearing out the Creatinine the way it should.\u00a0\u00a0If that were the case, wouldn't his result be showing low, not high?\u00a0\u00a0I am hoping he made a mistake but wondered if you could tell me if I am correct in my understanding.Thank you!",
