            "answer": "Hi,Have you had folliculitis at the same location for 16 years?Have you been examined for diabetes meliitus?Do you have any other diseases? Are you taking any medication?When was the last time you took antibiotics?This may or may not be folliculitis. Instead this may be a condition called Warts which is caused by infection too and spreads if the warts are forcefully removed. Its better to get this treated from a dermatologist.This may or may not related to any food items and this will be apparent from your history.Hope this helped. Keep the area clean and do not try to remove any follicles yourself.Best regards. Keep us posted on your health and let us know if you have any other queries.",
