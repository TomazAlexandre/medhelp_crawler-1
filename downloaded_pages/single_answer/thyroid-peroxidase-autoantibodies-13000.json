            "answer": "Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOab) are one of the two antibody tests used to diagnose Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, not Graves Disease.\u00a0\u00a0The definitive test for Graves is Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI).\u00a0\u00a0Hashimoto's is often characterized by periods of hyperthyroidism in the beginning stages and some people have both, Hashimoto's and Graves.\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor didn't do a TSI test, you should have him order it.The actual number of 1300 doesn't mean that you have the disease any worse than someone with a lower antibody count... It's just like any other disease; if you have it, you have it.What were the results of your T3, T4 and TSH?\u00a0\u00a0Did you\u00a0\u00a0have Free T3 and Free T4 or were they Total T3 and Total T4?\u00a0\u00a0They aren't the same tests and provide the same information, so I hope your doctor ordered the Free tests, not the Total ones.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to include reference ranges with any results posted, since range vary lab to lab and have to come from your own reports.Antibody tests don't indicate cancer.\u00a0\u00a0You'd have to have an FNA for that.\u00a0\u00a0FNA is, typically, done on nodules 1.5-2 cm or larger.\u00a0\u00a0Nodules are very common with, both, Graves and Hashimoto's.Once we have an autoimmune disordhttp://www.medhelp.org/posts/Thyroid-Disorders/Thyroid-Peroxidase-Autoantibodies-13000/show/2595968#er, the chances of getting another are greater.",

    "question": "I have a few nodules on my thyroid, one measuring 1.5 cm, so I was sent to have my T3, T4, TSH, and thyroid anitiboldies. I received my Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies blood work back and it indicated greater than 1300.0 which according to everything I have read is extremely high. The doc said hyperthyroid and I am being sent for a Thyroid Uptake and Scan. I have Type 1 Diabetes, so I was thinking this could be another autoimmune diease called Grave's Diesease. Another question is, what number of antibodies usually indicates thyroid cancer if it does at all? I am concerned with this due to the size of the biggest nodule, and the fact that I have at least 4. I've been doing so much research. Thanks.",
