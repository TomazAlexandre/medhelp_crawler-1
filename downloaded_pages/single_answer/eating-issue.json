            "answer": "Hi!To increase your eating capacity, eat small meals frequently. Like after dinner, you could eat a dessert or cookies or something before bed time. Also during the day you could take 5-6 small meals\u2014a fruit now, a bowl of soup later, a sandwich, cereals, milk, juice etc now and then. Maintain a food log for a week and note as you eat. Probably by end of week you\u2019ll start eating as required.Apart from this you need to find out whether you have worms, diabetes or hyperthyroidism as all these conditions make it difficult for a person to gain weight. Take care!",
