    "question": "I had back surgery 16 months ago, a fusion of L4-S1 due to radial tears in some disks.\u00a0\u00a0When I awoke from surgery I had paralysis in my lower leg, drop foot and later with EMG it was determined it was due to nerve root injury at the levels of my surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I have continued to have severe back pain radiating down into my buttocks, along with hip pain and joint pain in my hips, knees and even wrists and fingers that may be due to using a walker to get around.\u00a0\u00a0 The EMG's have continued to show injury to those areas although I am getting some movement back it is mostly twitches, and no dorsiflexion at all.\u00a0\u00a0I do have severe muscle spasms that twist my foot into extreme flexion. Although I have an AFO I fall frequently and still use a walker or quad cane which help to decrease the falls and clumsiness. I have mild diabetes which is under great control.\u00a0\u00a0During some bloodwork for my diabetes it came back that I had a CPK level of 995.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing was said, no other test was done.\u00a0\u00a0 A few months later...the CPK was not repeated, but my urine microalbumin was 150 and my alb/creat ratio was 30-300.\u00a0\u00a0Could this have anything to do with the back and leg problems?\u00a0\u00a0Should these results be sent to my neurosurgeon or neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0The endocrinologist was just going to \"keep an eye on them\" down the road.",
