    "question": "Hi,I am from Pakistan and I am writing to you because this issue is stressing me out alot. My father has been recommended the cateract surgery by his eye doctor. He is 65years old, recently diagonosed with parkinsons for which he is taking azilect (0.5mg) and he also has diabetes and a mild prostrate condition for which he is taking tamsulosin (0.4mg).I told his doctor about tamsulosin, but i believe he has not taken it very seriously. In addition considering the medical care in my country, i dont think he will be taking any extra measures for my father. After reading the information online i am very worried and i would like to know if he should leave tamsulosin 2weeks prior to the surgery? But then what about after the surgery, how long should he stop taking it? Can you help me out here. Thankyou so much for your time.Faiza",
