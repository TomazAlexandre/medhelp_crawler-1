            "answer": "It sounds like your physician has reached his/her limitations, and it is time to seek additional input on your condition from someone who routinely treats these conditions.I can tell you that we have found that IBS is very often associated with infection(s), and chronic amoebiasis is one of the types of infections that has been found to be important in this condition.\u00a0\u00a0Such infections are often stubborn and quite difficult to completely eradicate.\u00a0\u00a0For example, a fairly common amoeba in N. America, Entamoeba histolytica, is very hard to find and completely eradicate and can persist in chronic form for years in your GI system.\u00a0\u00a0Other infections, such as Cryptospiridium, are often under-diagnosed\u00a0\u00a0because of the difficulties in finding good diagnostic labs that can reliably test for such infections.",

    "question": "Dear Dr,I am 39 yo woman. medicated hypothyroid, diabetes (still lifestyle controlled), pituitary adenoma, allergies. Intermittent ibs-type symptoms. All pretty much under control.\u00a0\u00a0So i still consider myself pretty healthy and am active & working.18 mo ago, when 3 month pregnant i had expl. lap surgery for what was found to be appendicitis. 2 days after the surgery, was found to have severe amoebiasis, this was treated.\u00a0\u00a0Went on to have healthy baby. Since then though have chronic abdominal pain (bearable but annoying).\u00a0\u00a0My obe says it's adhesions.\u00a0\u00a0No investigations have been done.Last few weeks have been having recurrent upper abdominal pain (both sides), in addition to the normal lower abd. pain. often but not always after eating, with worsening of ibs type symptoms. I wonder if this could be possibly related to recurrence of amoebiasis. Is there any way reasonable way to investigate further without going overboard?\u00a0\u00a0My endo/internal med (who is\u00a0\u00a0essentially my primary dr.) rolls his eyes and shrugs his shoulders and doesn't seem very concerned other than to say there is a lot going on.\u00a0\u00a0He suggested\u00a0\u00a0possibility that the amoebiasis hadn't completely resolved when I last saw him, but did not recommend anything.I can live with this, but would prefer not to. Any advice or recommendation on an appropriate next step would be greatly appreciated.Thank you.",
