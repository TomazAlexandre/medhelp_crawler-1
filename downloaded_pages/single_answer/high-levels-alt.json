    "question": "My 8 year old daughter recently went for blood work for her pediatrician to test her resistance to MMR (she had a reaction to the vaccine when she was an infant and never had the second vaccine; they are making sure she is resistant to MMR and if not will need another vaccine now); anyway I received a copy of the blood work for her school records and I noticed a very high ALT level -- normal for this age is 8-24 but her's is 43.\u00a0\u00a0her Creatinine is 0.49 (normal is 0.50-1.20); but her AST is 31 (normal is 12-32); her other results are fine; her WCB was a little low 4.4 (normal is 4.5-13.5); she had the test done about 2 weeks after having a case of strep throat.\u00a0\u00a0She now has strep again and the doctor prescribed a stronger antibiotic.\u00a0\u00a0The WCB level I am not concerned about and the creatinine level from what I can tell is maybe she wasn't drinking enough.\u00a0\u00a0The blood work was done on a fast.\u00a0\u00a0The pediatrician didn't say anything to me about the high ALT level and that he wants to recheck it.\u00a0\u00a0Shouldn't it be rechecked soon?\u00a0\u00a0My husband has type 2 diabetes (diagnosed about 4 years ago).\u00a0\u00a0No diabetes in my side of the family.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
