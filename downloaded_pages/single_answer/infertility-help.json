            "answer": "If you have PCOS, I imagine that you had all your hormones checked including a 2 hour glucose tolerance test with a 75 gram glucose load to check for prediabetes and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Recent studies have shown that if you do not have prediabetes or diabetes that Clomid, a fertility pill was better than Metformin alone which is a blood glucose controlling pill to get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0And so your doctor would probably put you on Clomid in addition to doing an IUI.\u00a0\u00a0If you do have prediabetes or diabetes then Metformin would help you in addition to Clomid and so you would be on both. Of course with PCOS, good diet, excercise and weight loss would help if you are overweight.",
