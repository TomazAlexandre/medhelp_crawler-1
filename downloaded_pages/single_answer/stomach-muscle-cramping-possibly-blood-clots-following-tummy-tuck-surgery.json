            "answer": "Hi,How is your wife? After tummy tuck procedure, pain, numbness, swelling and soreness may last for several weeks or months. Like any other surgery, complications such as infection, bleeding under the skin flap or blood clots may be present. Risk factors include poor circulation, diabetes or heart, lung or liver disease. It is best that she see her surgeon for proper evaluation and management. Direct clinical examination and additional diagnostic tests may be indicated. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "My wife had a complete tummy tuck operation 8 weeks ago. The surgery appeared to be a success and there were no issues initially. She has now been in almost constant discomfort, following the first two weeks after the surgery. The pain she encounters feels like muscle spasms or severe muscle contractions. She says the muscle cramping, or contractions sensation is worse in th eevening and at night during sleep. The surgeon now thinks it could be related to blood clots. Anyone ever hear of this condition or have any ideas?",
