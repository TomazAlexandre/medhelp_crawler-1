            "answer": "Hi!Well, if you are in a surrounding more hot than acceptable then it is normal to feel a prickly heat sensation in the body. This is also known as heat rash. It is more prominent in individuals who have a dry skin or who are dehydrated. Drink water, clear soups, lemonade, fresh juice etc and see if it helps. Underlying infection or inflammation (as in arthritis, IBS etc) in the body can result in the feeling of heat. Another possibility is hyperthyroidism or even diabetes. Antibiotic or other drug metabolism can also cause a feeling of heat in the body. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
