            "answer": "Hi.Have you seen an ENT specialist for your sinuses? they make me laugh how the doctors always try and pass the book, and try to move you on to someone else.I would first have some bloods done especially to check for inflammation, ESR.If this is above normal level , then this indicates inflammation in the body.I have found rheumatologists, are better than neurologists, but this is just my opinion.Then you have to say which problem do you want addressingHave you had a MRI of the head? to check the sinuses and brain?If so what were the findings?But then you have chrohns, thyroid, and diabetes, which are all auto-immune diseases.I think i would see a rheumy, as your sinuses, maybe connected to auto-immune issues.and your headaches might be linked also.Get some auto-immune bloods done, and inflammation markers.Then say you would rather be referred to a good rheumy, but remember the choice really should be in the patients best interest. This is Patients Choice.I hope you get what you want, and you get this issue sorted sooner rather than later, as living on and off antibiotics, drains the body.If you need anymore help, give us a shout.Nicola",

    "question": "I have had chronic sinusitis for several years and have undergone two surgeries to help resolve them.\u00a0\u00a0In the last 3 years or so, I have developed symptoms that feel like sinusitis, however they are at the base of my skull.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms can be relieved by being on antibiotics.I went to an University sinus surgeon and they determined that my symptoms would not be helped surgically.\u00a0\u00a0They hinted that the cause may be inflammatory in nature, as anti-biotics have an anti-inflammatory property (I did not know this.)\u00a0\u00a0After a trial of anti-biotics, the fluid in my sinus went away, and they stated that this is proof that surgery is not needed.\u00a0\u00a0However, my sinuses continue to be swollen, sore and appear to be infected.They recommended that I see a neurologist for my symptoms, however, I have been to several neurologists in the past and I just don't want to repeat that experience.\u00a0\u00a0They were down right rude at worst, and said there was nothing neurologically wrong with me at best.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors continue to want to send me to neurologists for various symptoms - but that is another story.Which specialist should I see for this problem?\u00a0\u00a0I was thinking that a Rheumatologist might be better ablet to help me, due to the fact that I have fibromyalgia and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, as well as Crohn's, hypothyroid and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know where to turn, but the constant sinus pressure and the horrible throbbing headaches at the base of my brain can be debilitating.\u00a0\u00a0I know that migraines are a possibility, but do I have to see a neurologist for that??Thanks for any advice you can give me.",
