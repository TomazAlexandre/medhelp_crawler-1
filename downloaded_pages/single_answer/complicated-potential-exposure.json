            "answer": "Welcome to our Forum.\u00a0\u00a0For starters, even before we get to the fact that HIV is not transmitted by touching a wound n the way you did, what do you think the probability is that this person has HIV.\u00a0\u00a0On average, the figure for non-drug using women in the U.S. is close to 1 in 10,000.Even if, by some quirk, she had HIV, her risk of transmitting it to you through the exposure you describe is still zero.\u00a0\u00a0HIV is not transmitted by touching, would stick to the gauze, not pass through, and would die on exposure to air temperature and drying.Long story short, there is simply no risk for HIV from the exposure you describe.\u00a0\u00a0It is not something to worry about and there is no medical reason for testing.\u00a0\u00a0EWH",

    "question": "I'm worried about a potential blood exposure and was hoping you could give me an opinion about whether it constitutes a risk. I can't stop thinking about it!I was working at a first aide booth at a charity run. A girl came up with very bloody knees from scraping them on the gravel. I put on gloves and helped clean her up. I washed most of the blood off and but betadine on her knees. I took one of my gloves of to reach for and open another gauze square, dampened it, then (without thinking) pressed it to her wound with my bare hand for an instant.I did have an \"open wound\" on one of these fingers, in the form of a finger-stick hole for blood sugar testing (type I diabetes). This prick was 3 hours prior or so, wasn't bleeding, and wasn't even visible. After squeezing incessantly at it I was able to get a tiny drop of blood out, though.Do you think this tiny fingerprick wound exposed to water that probably had some minute amount of blood, sucked up through gauze, constitutes an exposure?Thanks. Really worried.",
