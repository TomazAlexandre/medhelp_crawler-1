            "answer": "Hello,Causes of chest pain are many. It can be due to hypertension,Gastroesophageal reflux disease(do you have heart burn and difficulty in\u00a0\u00a0swallowing), disorders involving the lung;cardiac diseases, lung cancer, thoracic outlet syndrome,pancreatitis,gall bladder disease and muscle pain.In your case, it can be due to cigarette smoking also. it can produce heart disease and cancer is now common knowledge. Many are not aware that smoking also may produce chest pain. Moreover chest pain due to smoking increases with a predisposing heart disease.I feel that you need to have a cardiac work up with your cardiologist.Blue periphries mean insufficient blood supply to the peripheries by the heart because of some pathology of the heart.You need investigations like ECG,stress echo and color Doppler.Pls take an appointment from a cardiologist and get yourself thoroughly examined so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made. Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Please abstain from cigarette smoking as it is injurious to health.Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I'm 19 about to be twenty, and have had chest pains for about a year. they are localized to the left side of my chest and feel like a sharp pain from front to back. sometimes they seem to be random, but are definitely brought on by exercise. i walk quite a bit, and that usually does not bring the pains on, but running definitely does, even if only for less than thirty minutes, id say get chest pains every few days, sometimes a lot of days in a row, and some times i wont get any for a few weeks, but they are pretty regular. i also have recently noticed symptoms of what i think is poor circulation, like my fingernails are purpleish and my fingers and feet get cold. also the bottom of my feet have purple splotches and spots where the skin seems to be dying. not sure how to describe that, Ive been smoking for almost 4 years and smoking a pack a day for three, i have a bad family history of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes and am scared. any information would be helpful.thanks.",
