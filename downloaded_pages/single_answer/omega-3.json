            "answer": "Hi Kazie,The data is mixed on effects of Omega 3's on glucose levels. A large study was done in 2004 that looked at many smaller studies and there was a mixed bag in terms of effects on glucoses(some increased, some decreased, some were not affected). If your husband has high cholesterol and wishes to take Omega 3 fatty acids, they may do him more good than harm in the long run. If he decides to take them he should keep checking his blood sugars regularly, and if he has significant increases, then perhaps this isn't the right medication/supplement for him.Take care.",
