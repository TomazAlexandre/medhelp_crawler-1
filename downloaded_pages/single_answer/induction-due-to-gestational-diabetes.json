    "question": "I have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes. I have recently found out that my doctor wants to induce me at 37 weeks. I am 35 weeks currently. I was told this one week ago. I was devestated. I really want my baby to come naturally, whenever she is ready. My blood sugar is under control. I do take a 2.5 mg Glyburide pill once a day and receive fetal monitoring twice a week. My blood sugars and fetal monitoring have all came out fine. My doctor says that even if they continue to come out fine, I will still be induced due to the increase risk of stillbirth. I have no complications. I didn't even have morning sickness. I have gained 21 lbs. There isn't a concern for her to be a large baby from her measurements. Most people can't even tell that I am pregnant. I haven't recieved an ultrasound since 20 weeks. Would you recommend that I get another ultrasound? I would like some statistical data on the increase of stillbirth in women with controlled gestational diabetes, especially in the last weeks. I have read that placental deterioration may occur. What are the chances if it is under control? Would you recommend that a patient in my condition be induced at 37 weeks? I will have an amniocentesis done first to check the lung maturation. I denied the recommended 20 week amniocentesis that is usually done to check for birth defects in women of advanced maternal age. I am 36 and this is my first baby. I am very healthy and have a job that keeps me active. I love being pregnant and really would like to go into labor when she wants to enter this world, not when her lungs are just mature enough. I would appreciate all of the information that you can give me. I am in a big dilema.Thank You",
