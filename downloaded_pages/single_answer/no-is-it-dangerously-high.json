            "answer": "Hi there. According to the numbers you posted,\u00a0\u00a0The 150 number in lower than the diastolic? Its a bit strange?Systolic 150 would be moderately high. diastolic of 155 (If thats correct) would be quite high indeed and may need prompt evaluation to investigate and control it.(Its a little unclear in your post if its Systolic of 150/155??Anyway,In people with added complications like you describe, they like to go for closer to 120 over 80 as ideal.Of course your doc has all your info and is best placed to advise.However I have an interest in Adrenal issues and these can sometimes\u00a0\u00a0have a dramatic effect on BP levels.Certain conditions with adrenals like conns syndrome can cause big Bp spikes.Which steroid do you take? that may explain a bit.Is the Diabetes 2 under control by diet or are you taking meds like Metformin etc??",
