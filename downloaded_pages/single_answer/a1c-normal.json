    "question": "Hello,I've posted questions in the past. I am not diagnosed diabetic. But have had numerous tests done. I've had post meal number on a home meter go really high. Yet when I requested a OGTT, I passed. Fasting is usually in normal range. Only time its high is if I am sick, or been under a lot of stress. But since I normally get normal fasting, and passed the OGTT, I stopped worrying about this.However, this post and question is basically this. I have had two A1C tests in the past year, just so I can keep an eye on things since diabetes is in the family. The first one came after following a strict diet(lots of protein, complex carbs, veggies, small portions), and exercising. It was 4.6. My most recent one I got the results just today, was 5.1. This was after not exercising, and I had gone off the diet a bit, and been eating more carbs(due to a move and some stuff that had come up over the past months that made sticking to the diet hard.) I wasn't gorging and was still having much smaller portions than in my younger days. But still the quality of food wasn't great.My question is, is 5.1 still normal? Everything I read has a different upper limit to TRUELY NONDIABETIC NORMAL. I've seen that normal upper limits listed as 4.6%, 5%, 5.3%, 5.7%, and 6%. So seems 5.1 isn't bad, especially since I had quite a bit of McDonalds, Restaurant Burgers and fries, and other order in food over the previous 3 months. Just really curious if everyone feels 5.1 is still a nondiabetic number like my Dr thinks.P.S.I have gone back on my strict diet I was on when I got 4.6. Just curious if the 5.1 is concerning, or still a normal nondiabetic A1C. Thanks.",
