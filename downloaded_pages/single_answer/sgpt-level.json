            "answer": "Hi there!What are the other liver function tests reports like? Did you get your blood cholesterol done? If only your SGPT is elevated and other liver function tests are normal then the possible cause is fatty liver. Obesity, diabetes mellitus, alcohol ingestion are all risk factors for developing fatty liver. The liver is the primary site of manufacture of new glucose; triglycerides. Since the liver is fatty and enlarged the metabolism of triglycerides is impaired leading to high triglycerides. If you are overweight reduce your weight through a low calorie diet and exercise. Avoid hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils (Trans fats), vegetable oils such as corn, sunflower and safflower oil, processed foods, processed meats, added sugars, soft drinks, and drugs which can affect the liver. There are also some foods that may help to lower cholesterol levels, particularly garlic, soya, oats, corn and selenium-enriched cereals. The important supplements for liver support and regeneration are vitamin E and C since they are antioxidants and can reduce liver damage caused due to oxidants. Omega 3 has been found to be very effective in lowering triglycerides. Fatty liver is a reversible condition. Reduce your weight and adopt a healthy lifestyle.
