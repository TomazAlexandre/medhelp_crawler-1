            "answer": "Hi!Well, yes, three weeks of laxative use can start showing side effects like loose stools, electrolyte imbalance, dehydration etc. However, the changes should usually be reversible on stopping the laxative. Long-term use over months can cause serious side effects. You are young and hence will recover faster. Just make a conscious effort to increase fiber in your diet and eat healthy. Remember to drink plenty of fluids (water, lime juice, clear soups, fresh juice etc).If you again become constipated then consult your doctor to first find the cause and then start treatment. Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber, dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. A comprehensive investigation would then be taken keeping all the points in mind.I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health.Hope you get well soon! Good Luck and take care!",

    "question": "My doctor prescribed me oral sennosides for 2 weeks because I was having a mild-severe constipation, 2 tablets at night (like the box said), but then I had to see another doctor who prescribed me with oral sennosides again for a week but now 2 tablets in the morning and 2 at night!So that makes a total of 3 weeks of laxatives use, so I stopped taking them mostly because I noticed I was having some sort of dirrhea and my stools were pretty yellow-ish, I've heard that using them for more than a week is dangerous and chronic use leads towards colon motility problems like atrophy. Will I have those problems because of the 3 weeks of use? I'm very very scared I don't want my colon to become useless, I'm only 20 (male)",
