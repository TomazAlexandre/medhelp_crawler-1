    "question": "Hi not sure if this is an eye or ear thing. I had jerky vision the other day, where it felt like my eyes must be moving from side to side (not sure if my eyes were moving as I was not near a mirror). It was as if the room was shaking violently side to side. It made me feel a bit dizzy, like I needed to close my eyes. I have had ringing in ears past few months and it has felt almost as if I have had too much wax in ears, as if they have been stuffed up.Don't know if this is relevant but my mum has had ear problems, is deaf in one ear and it gave her balance problems, also diabetes runs in my family and due to stress lately I have been consuming too much sugar and coffee although my last glucose test was fine.Thanks for any advice you can give.",
