            "answer": "Number 1: Cut out the desserts! What is the point in taking medications and then eating sugar? Kind of counterproductive. I know it's hard to do but it will be worth it.Unfortunately, diabetes is a progressive disease. It's often necessary to change medications as one stops working. Also, over time it may be necessary to go on insulin as your body stops producing it. This happens an average of 10 years after diagnosis. But what you don't say is what you do about diet and exercise. You can do a lot to help whatever medications you take by getting regular exercise and by eating less carbs; that would include ctting out all desserts and reducing things such as bread, potatoes, pasts, etc.",
