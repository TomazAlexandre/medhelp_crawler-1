The pain seems to come after eating something sugary or fatty. I had my gallbladder removed\u00a0\u00a0almost 2 yrs ago.\u00a0\u00a0My cat scan just came back with everything being normal.\u00a0\u00a0My blood work has ALT 111 and AST 103. Both of these are really high. I'm on vicodin for pain and the doctor doesn't think there is anything wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0But I can't even lay down at night, I have to sleep propped up on four pillows otherwise the pain comes. I'm so tired and scared, can someone please help me! All I do is cry\u00a0\u00a0and I can't even function normally anymore.",
