Are there any other associated symptoms?This could be due to some bacterial infection, fungal infection, viral causes, diabetes or hypertension, etc.It would be advisable to consult a skin specialist and to rule out the cause of the skin lesions.Till then, she should keep the areas clean and not to scratch or pick at the lesions.Let us know about what the doctor advises and post us about how she is doing.Also, consult a pediatrician for your son and follow up with the doctor regularly.Regards.",

    "question": "My fiance develpoed what we thought was a open sore from a spider bite. The sore looks like what would happen if bitten by a brown recluse. The orignal spot has almost completly healed ( scabbed over and dried up) but he has gotten several more with in the last few weeks. Some of them have not gotten very big but two of them have opened up like the first one.I am wondering if this could be some type of skin infection ( as our 6 month old caught a contact staph infection at his daycare about a week before my fiance's symptoms started. ) Also these sores 9 or skin ulcers are located on his buttocks if that helps any.",
