            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. The PT INR needs to be maintained at adequate levels, for this constant monitoring will help. For basic \"blood-thinning\" needs an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 is recommended. For some who have a high risk of clot formation, the INR needs to be higher - about 2.5 to 3.5. Your father may need a sputum culture and sensitivity to determine what antibiotic the organism is susceptible to, then appropriate therapy can be instituted. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
