            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Consult a gastroenterologist. You could be suffering from an inflammatory bowel condition such as Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Crohn\u2019s disease. Other than that it could be due to H pylori infection. It can also be food intolerance. Diabetes can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence get your blood sugar tested. PCOD and hormone imbalance too could be a cause. So discuss this with your gynecologist. Take care!",

    "question": "I've had an unexplained, low grade fever for about 8 months now; no other symptoms at all except for feeling \"feverish\" on and off for months.\u00a0\u00a0In Dec I finally decided it wasn't going away and went to the Dr.\u00a0\u00a0She rattled off a handful of fatal diseases and ordered a bunch of tests.\u00a0\u00a0All of the blood tests came back completely normal; CT scan showed a 4cm ovarian cyst (I guess it's only concerning when they're 5 or more) and a tumor on my liver.\u00a0\u00a0Went through 5 days straight of nuclear imaging tests where they determined my liver is \"just enlarged\".\u00a0\u00a0Then my lower back started hurting- radiating through my buttocks and left thigh; sometimes down to my foot and sometimes in both legs- what I assumed was sciatica.\u00a0\u00a0It got worse over the next couple weeks; there's a swollen patch the size of a saucer over my tailbone and even my abdomen is very bloated.\u00a0\u00a0Everything hurts to the touch; can't stand up straight, can't walk right, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Last Fri I went back to the Dr (a new one) and she sent me to the ER for an MRI (lumbar and sacral), concerned that I had an abscess on my spine.\u00a0\u00a0Negative.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, nothing showed up; not even a disc or bone issue.\u00a0\u00a0So I started worrying about the cyst on my ovary (I had a ruptured ovarian cyst 18 years ago so this seemed to make sense; and I'd completely skipped my last period even though I'm on the pill).\u00a0\u00a0Went to an ob-gyn who gave me an ultrasound on the spot... nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Not even the cyst that was there before!\u00a0\u00a0And that's where I am now- still in pain, can't work, can't focus on anything else, and no answers.\u00a0\u00a0Unbelievably infuriating.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas or suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
