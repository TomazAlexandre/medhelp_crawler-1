            "answer": "i'm 47 yrs old . I have type 2 diabetes along with various other physical ailments. I had surgery on my spine 2 years ago which has failed and to maintain some quality of life, I take morphine on a daily basis to keep the majority of my pain at a minimal amount.I should mention I am in a wheelchair whenever I walk any distance longer than 5-10 minutes. I don't take care of my diabetes due to depression. As a result it seems that I am constantly fighting vaginal yeast infections. Or it could be a result of my pain medications. Itching is very troublesome with morphine.Recently, I.E. the last year or so, my itching has become so severe that I have scratched myself to the point of bleeding.I have taken 1 anti-fungal pill on several occasions only to provide\u00a0\u00a0short term relief. Then the curd-like discharge comes back and the only relief I get is a topical cream much like Vagasil, only generic.It will help for a half hour or so, then I am back to square one. I have recently looked at myself with a mirror after feeling some bumps and have only discovered bleeding sores. I'm blind without my glasses and blind with them-wow ! Has old age hit me! while the pill helped an anti-fungal cream only caused me to swell so much and be in so much pain I couldn't help being very vocal (as in screaming) in pain when I urinate. Then again, I have scratched myself to that point . I Will Not go to the doc about this. I am way too embarassed. I also might add I have a dog who also has a skin condition. he is itching, peeling,has blisters and hair loss.i took him to the vet who never said a word, even when asked, just gave my dog a shot of benedryl and charged out the wazoo for it. i have also been on doxycycline (a form of tetracycline) on and off for a year and a half fighting MRSA . Is there a doc in the house? I'm miserable!",

    "question": "Hi! I've always dealt w/ vaginal dryness. Before I got married I took oil baths and that helped enough (I was a virgin until then). But I stopped taking them because I started dealing with yeast infections after I got married and became sexually active.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that avoiding baths might help me avoid yeast infections. But I'm thinking that my dryness coupled with the extra friction,etc that comes with sex are the factors leading me to have these yeast infections. I've read elsewhere on the internet that vaginal eczema can contribute to yeast infections and I'm curious if I'm dealing with that. I've had eczema all over every other portion of my body at various points in my life. A few wks ago I had some eczema scaling, red bumps on my pubic mound that quickly responded to the Protopic I've used elsewhere when I've had flareups. But what do I do with internal dryness, itching? My gynocologist says that my symptoms are rare and to see a dermatologist, but I'm concerned that a dermatologist will only say that because my symptoms are located vaginally that I need to see a gynocologist.I know that for the rest of my body avoiding hot water and apply lots of non-scented creams daily has helped to keep my symptoms on the rest of my body to a minimum. I haven't had an outbreak in a few yrs. What can I do preventatively to help keep symptoms down vaginally?",
