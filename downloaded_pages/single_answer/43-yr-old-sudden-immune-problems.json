            "answer": "Hi!Low vitamin D itself can cause dry skin. Often this is combined with vitamin B deficiency which adds to dryness. Presence of autoimmune disorders such a Sjogren's can also be a contributing factor. Vitamin A deficiency, hypothyroidism, and diabetes too can cause dry skin.\u00a0\u00a0Hence it is important to rule out these causes one by one.Apart from this you may need to switch to injectable vitamin D for faster relief. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, fruit juices etc to keep body hydrated. Cod liver oil, fatty fish like tuna, salmon etc, egg, milk all contain good amounts of vit D. Of these cod liver oil is the richest source and can be taken daily. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,I am 43 years old and about ten years ago started breaking out and gradually became allergic to certain foods and ALL alcohol. The last three years I have been on low dose accutane, although my derm wanted me to do a much higher dose, my body just couldn't take it so I do my own dosage of 20 mgs per week. I try to prolong it as long as I can. Now, on top of this I also take antihistamines for my allergies. I am basically dried up. My skin, which was once VERY soft and pretty is now tight and itchy, obviously from all of the dehydrating drugs. I have a great relationship with clean food and only imbibe on the weekends, though nothing crazy (i.e fast food). I don't drink flavoured sodas, eat junk or over drink (yes, I still drink). I am currently taking liquid vitamin D3. About 5000 IUs a day hoping that maybe this is the reason for all the \"body wars\" inside. I was tested and had a low, but not detrimental, number count on my vitamin D score. Is there a supplement I can take that will help with all this dryness? I can't bathe in creams any longer. They don't work, most stink and I wanna to work from the inside. Any suggestions?",
