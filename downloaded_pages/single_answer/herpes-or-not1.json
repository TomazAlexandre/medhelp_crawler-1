            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!In all probability you have contacted genital herpes. It can also be syphilis. If you have diabetes or had an infection earlier like bacterial vaginosis then it can also be impetigo or staphylococcal infection.You will know for sure at your doctor\u2019s appointment. Check with your boyfriend to see if too has some lesion. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage without examination. Take care!",

    "question": "hi im a 23 year old female, who is sexually active, i had sex with my boyfriend, after that, the next day i had notice 2 bumps, they did have some clear liquid coming out, not bad but just a little. they did have a little pain with it, but it didnt itch, the location is right on the lining part were my pubs are at. then tonight i notice 4 more small bumps, they look like they have pus in it, but their not leaking anything, i have just a slight itchy feeling. i dont have any other symtoms. i did have a yeast infeaction before i got these bumps and i shaved down there. ( and all the bumps are located in the same area as the first bumps, but their spaced out.) so could this be herpes? please i really need your help, im going out of my mind. i have a doctors appointment coming up but i just really need that ease for when i go.",
