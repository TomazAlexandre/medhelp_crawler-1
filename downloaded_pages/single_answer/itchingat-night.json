            "answer": "Hi,Specific itchy areas may occur if a person comes in contact with soap, detergents, and wool or other rough-textured, scratchy material. Do you have history of allergies?\u00a0\u00a0Itching may also be caused by such a wide variety of triggers and may include dermatitis, eczema, fungal infection, psoriasis, insect bites or scabies.\u00a0\u00a0Scabies is a contagious skin condition that causes intense itching especially at night. It is caused by tiny mites which burrow into the skin. Diagnosis is most commonly made by looking at these burrows or rash. A skin scraping may also be taken for evaluation and presence of the mites, their eggs, or mite fecal matter\u00a0\u00a0to confirm the diagnosis.It would be best to have this evaluated further\u00a0\u00a0by your doctor. A complete physical examination and medical history will help diagnose the underlying problem. Medical conditions that may cause itching such as diabetes mellitus, liver disease, kidney failure, jaundice, thyroid disorders and blood disorders should also be ruled out.Take care and keep us posted.",
