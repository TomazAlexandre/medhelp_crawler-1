            "answer": "Whether or not your baby is OK depends on a lot of things, including the quality of your blood sugar control.\u00a0\u00a0Only your obstetrician can tell you how things are right now.Elevated blood sugar at the time of conception and for the first 6-8 weeks can cause problems with the way the baby's brain/nervous system and heart/lungs/circulation develop.\u00a0\u00a0We always encourage moms-to-be to keep their blood sugars in a decent range (A1c less than 7%) before trying to conceive.Your blood sugar control for the next 6+months will determine the baby's rate of growth/development, so work with your healthcare team to manage your diabetes as well as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Near-normal blood sugar is desirable from this point forward.",
