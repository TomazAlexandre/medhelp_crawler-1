            "answer": "Yes Clozaril can cause that but not usually long term. Is he still on an antipsychotic? Which one? The akathesia is from the current antipsychotic right? Or the side effect of another medication he is on? If he is not on a medication that can cause akathesia the fact that it continues long term is of concern and he should be evaluated for tardive dyskinesia. If he were ever diagnosed with that condition Clozaril is the only currently available antipsychotic he should be on as the rest can and will worsen it. If this is the case and he cannot tolerate Clozaril I was in the same position and there is a new option in clinical study.If he is diagnosed with anxiety disorder only there are many options. As for psychosis it usually doesn't go into remmission. However, as a person who has been documented as making a full recovery with glycine, a glutamate antagonist a new form of antipsychotic in Phase II FDA study that does not cause tardive dyskinesia, akathesia or diabetes I can say that this new treatment is highly effective. For more information on the official study google \"Dr. Javitt, glycine\". My psychopharmocologist has spoken to a provider agency about this treatment and there may be public statements about its usage as an adjunct (in addition) to a conventional antipsychotic (I am the first person to recover with it by itself, it is being clinically documented and will be published). If someone has been through the current generation of antipsychotics without success or has tardive dyskinesia and cannot take Clozaril I would provide them more information about its usage to give to their provider but can't print the specifics on a public thread. Pm me if you want more information.As for anti-anxiety agents there are many currently available. I take Klonopin for control of anxiety and as well for dystonic spasms for tardive dyskinesia (which I have in advanced forms, I am also under clinical study for the criteria \"tardive psychosis\"). I have had no problem with that for 10 years.",

    "question": "My son (44) has bladder problems (enuresis) since being hospitalised 6 months ago to withdraw from side effects of Clozapine.\u00a0\u00a0He has been on most drugs (old and new) with no relief for his anxiety. Could the Clozapine withdrawal cause sudden loss of bladder control? The doctors say they don't know what to do with him except wait.\u00a0\u00a0He also has akathisia. They agree he hasn't been psychotic for years.",
