            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis). Other conditions cause itchy skin as well. Skin conditions like dermatitis, scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch. Lastly, phototherapy can also be tried.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted in case you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",

    "question": "To start I have NO diseases or food allergies. For the past month I've had an insane itch, but no rash. At first it was my legs, then forearms, stomach, sides, back, breasts, and then hands. The itch is worst at night and in the morning, so it's keeping me up and my sleep is way off and I'm tired during the day. I've tried my moms perscription creams for her eczema and it didn't work. Over the counter anti-itch cream doesn't work. Benadryl worked for 2 days before my immune system blocked it. I've tried oatmeal lotion, unscented lotion, oatmeal bath, detox bath (epsom salt, ginger and baking soda), vinegar bath, goldseal, grapefruit extract (in case its an infection), changing all body stuff I use, including detergent and softener, even got plastic sheets for my bed. The only thing that works is ice water, but I can't walk around in a bath tub of cold water for the rest of my life. I don't have insurence so my mom absolutly refuses to take me to the doctors and thinks I'm going crazy. There are scratches and sores ALL over my arms from itching. I'm scared its a nerve problem (because theres no rash), and that I will wake up paralyzed one morning, which adds stress when I try to sleep and I know that makes it worse. Any idea of what this could possibly be?",
