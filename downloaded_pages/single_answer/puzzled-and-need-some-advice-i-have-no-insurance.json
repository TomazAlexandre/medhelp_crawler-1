            "answer": "First of all, keep in mind that I am unable to diagnose you because I am not a doctor nor are there doctors present, this forum is for educational purposes.From what I gather your foamy urine could be caused by diabetes. Foamy urine is called small fiber neuropathy (SFN). It is often difficult to treat and many patients require multiple medication trials before finding the drug that is best for them.In any case, you need to see a doctor and get tested for diabetes and thoroughly diagnosed b4 your medical issues escalate into a hospital stay. Without medical insurance your best bet is a free medical clinic. Google \"free medical clinics [your zip code]\".",

    "question": "I am a 36 yo male. Diabetes runs in the family and I have been tested once and it came up negative...it was a fasting glucose test and I think I was also tested for hypoglycemia. I have had symptoms when I missedmeals I got shaky and sweaty and instinctively started shoving food in my mouth LOL.. I'VE had depression andanxiety for quite a while the anxiety attacks always felt like an intense rush of adrenaline. MY urine is often foamy and I urinate quite a bit in the last 8 years.My wounds heal slowly and for about 9 years something weird started happening to me when I would lay down on a hard surface or if I sat on a park bench with a pattern on it I would have the imprint of the pattern on my back like a surface bruise it wouldn't get black and blue but it was definitely what I would call a bruise. Then about 5 years ago before I was tested for diabetes we were at my parents house my step father is diabetic and me and my girlfriend had eaten some ice cream and we decided it would be interesting to test our blood sugar so we tested it with the help of my stepfather on his little machine... my girlfriends was fine but mine was sky high.. my stepfather looked perplexed and that is when we decided I should be tested. Could I have gotten a false negative? I am 5' 10\" and about 185lbs I gained about 20 lbs in the last 3 years. I have been feeling fatigued alot, short of breath and I just want to find out what has happened to my body? THX ABE",
