Read about it here http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003640.htmFollow this link to an American Diabetes Assoc. web page to see an illustration of glucose ranges http://tinyurl.com/qt9c9 . Your current medication may be impacting your test results in a negative manner. With this in mind, Doctors do make exceptions to the rule so its best to discuss why she feels in your case up to 110 mg/dl is OK.",

    "question": "I have had a history of hypoglycemia and my fasting blood sugar has always been around 70-80. This year my blood pressure had gone too high (I am on meds now and is well controlled). I recently found out my iron was a little too low (saturation level of %14). I have reflux and had been on meds but am now going off them bacause I believe they caused digestion problems. Cholesterol was borderline high when last tested in April.I know my fasting blood sugar was 67 in April, I don't remember if I've tested it since, but now I have taken about 5 reading first thing in the morning and they have been between 97 and 105.\u00a0\u00a0I took it a few times during the day and it seemed to be good.I have many relatives, including my mom, who have type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My BMI is about 26%, I excercise regularly and eat all right (not perfect but have been eating more protein, not much simple carbs).I told my doctor and she said it is fine and doesn't want to do anything. They don't consider pre-diabetes until 110.Does this sound fine? Should I push for more tests or wait a while?Why would it go up that much in what seems like a short amount of time to me?",
