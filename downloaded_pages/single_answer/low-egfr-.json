    "question": "Hi I'm a 27 year old male. 200 pounds and 6' tall. Back in January I had to have pre bout blood work for boxing and my creatinine was high and my eGFR was at a 56.I did follow up blood work for the next 3 months every 30 days to monitor changes. It was all around 55-58. The last test I did this past Thursday I had dropped to a 45. So another blood test was done and 45 again. I had been sent in for ultrasound and nothin showed there.I am now on a waiting list to see a kidney specialist that is 8 weeks long. I will have follow up blood and urine tests every 7 days until I can get into the specialist.Some symptoms that I've been\u00a0\u00a0experiencing are almost total loss of energy, I sleep 10 hours a night and am still beat. Thru out the day I will have to stop what I'm doing, even pull over if I'm driving, because I can barley keep my eyes open. My joints ache. I've had a total loss of sex drive and am experiencing ED. My girl friend is not happy about the latter.I don't have\u00a0\u00a0 Diabetes\u00a0\u00a0Or high blood pressure, it also doesn't run in the family. I don't use drugs and only drink occasionally.What can be happening and should I be worried? I haven't had a chance to ask all the questions with the Doctor due to phone call having to be cut short. Should I be worried?",
