    "question": "I am a Hep C + Diabetes (recently diagnosed of type 2 DM) and consider to start Tx. My sugar contol is not quite well with fasting aroudn125-130 and 2hr PC around 160-180 under oral antidiabetic agents. As far as I know, hyperglycemia as well as hyperinsulinemia will decrease the interferion effect. So, it seemed that insulin treatment may not be good. Could anybody have similar situation share with me your experience and tell me what is the better way to control my sugar before and during the Tx?Thanks in advance.Tonywin2009",
