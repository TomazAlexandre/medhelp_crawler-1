Bleeding may happen once or it may be recurrent. Hematuria occurs in up to 10% of the general population. Many conditions are associated with hematuria. The most common causes include the following: kidney stones and bladder stones, kidney disease, medications (e.g., quinine, rifampin, phenytoin), trauma , tumors and/or cancer in the urinary system, urinary tract blockages or viral infections of the urinary tract and sexually transmitted diseases, particularly in women.
