    "question": "Hello doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I've been suffering from erectile dysfunction since my 20s (I'm now 36).\u00a0\u00a0In the last 6 to 9 months, even Levitra and Cialis have stopped being effective.\u00a0\u00a0I've seen a therapist who couldn't find any psychological reason for the problem.\u00a0\u00a0(It doesn't seem likely to be nerves, etc., since I have the same problem when I'm alone, I don't wake up with an erection, etc.) But my urologist did a test with an injection and ultrasound and said there was nothing physically wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0I'd love to have a better understanding of the problem, but most of all I just want to have some sort of solution.\u00a0\u00a0I'd appreciate your thoughts.I do have neurological problems due to congenital hydrocephalus, does that seem like something that could be a factor?\u00a0\u00a0I didn't have this problem as a teen.)",
