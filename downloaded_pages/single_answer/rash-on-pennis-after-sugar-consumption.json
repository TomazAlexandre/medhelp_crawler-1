    "question": "After eating consumption of sugar through any means, or even after sugar-free but sweetened soft drinks I develop a rash on the penis, either inside or outside on the foreskin. Not just here, but also on any softer parts of my body. No doctor has ever diagnised me with diabetes. I just found out my condition by merely observing and after some time I have made the conclusions. If I do not take any sweetened stuff the rash does not occur. What disease could this be? Can it be treated? Thanks.",
