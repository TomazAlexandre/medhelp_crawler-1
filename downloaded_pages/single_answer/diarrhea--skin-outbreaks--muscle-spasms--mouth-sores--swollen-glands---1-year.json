    "question": "I have been having a series of symptoms with no answers for over a year now. I've been getting various skin outbreaks in my genital area every other week or so (Herpes outbreaks occur every 2-3 weeks, but I'm also breaking out with folliculitis very often, and I don't know what else). My lymph glands in my genital area have been continuously swollen for over a year (not over 1cm in size) as well as glands in my neck and mouth. I also experience what feels like painless individual muscle spasms throughout my body every day, as well as frequent back pain. I get canker sores throughout my mouth constantly 2-5 at a time. In the last 5 months, I've also been getting diarrhea regularly (once every 2-3 weeks); I've been tested for various intestinal viruses and parasites and nothing was found.It's not HIV (tested 5 times in the last year for that). I've also done blood tests to rule out Diabetes and several other diseases. I live in Asia where the quality of medical care is hopelessly inept; treating the symptoms by throwing around bags of pills is their solution to everything, so I can only try to find the answer through the internet. I suspect some kind of serious immune system disease or disorder.I'm 29 years old and in pretty good shape. I exercise and eat fairly healthily and get regular sleep, so lifestyle doesn't seem to be a huge factor in why I keep experiencing these kinds of problems with my skin, digestive system and immune system.Please let me know what this could be if you can.",
