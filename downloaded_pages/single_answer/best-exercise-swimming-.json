            "answer": "I would not feel that one can make a blanket statement that swimming is best for all people with type 2 diabetes. Swimming certainly has many positive attributes, such as burning lots of calories, being aerobic, and being easy on many of the body's joints that bear weight. If a person is overweight, swimming may be a good way to exercise without stressing knee or hip joints. However, if a person has any shoulder problems, obviously swimming is not the best exercise for them. Furthermore, if a person lives so far away from a swimming pool that swims are only going to happen perhaps one day a week, then swimming may not be as good for them as if they take a brisk walk every evening after work. The important thing is that the exercise you choose fit your lifestyle and your current health conditions so that you can maintain a regular, daily or every-other-day schedule (depending on the exercise) without injuring your body.Certainly for most people with no other health issues, swimming is a fine choice of exercise. But so is walking or jogging or riding a bike. I doubt that many people would be comfortable proclaiming swimming the hands-down BEST.",
