    "question": "I'm a 30 yr old female with chronic heel pain. For the last 5+ years I have suffered with heel pain. I have seen over ten podiatrists, a rheumatologist, a neurologist and a physical therapist. I have tried it all heel cups, inserts, splints, physical therapy, injections, inflammation meds even shock wave surgery with no results. Initially it was just pain in the morning, then standing, walking, pain while sitting.My feet are swollen a lot and for the last couple of years I get redness and a lot of burning. This has hindered my life and I don't know what else I can do. Open to any suggestions!The Rheumatoloigst said all my blood came back ok, so no arthritis. (done in 07')The Neurologist did an MRI, so no nerve problems (done in 04')My regular doctor said all my blood came back ok, so no diabetes.The many Podiatrist said I have Plantar Faciaiitis (chronic heel pain)The pain is so severe at times its unbearable. I have to limit myself on every activites I used to enjoy and even simple things like standing in line for five minutes kills me.The medications did not help. I was put on Naproxen, Bextra, Ultracet, Mobic, Neurontin, Steroid injections, etc.I own every foot product known to man and go through shoes like water, since I can never find one that I can bear.Any help, suggestions, recommendations etc. are welcome, as I cannot deal with this pain anymore.Thanks!",
