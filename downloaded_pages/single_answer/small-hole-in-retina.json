    "question": "HiMy eye dr. said I had a pin size hole in the retina.\u00a0\u00a0He said it was probably due to uncontrolled diabetes (which I was recently diagnosed with a year ago) but I feel it was due to a accident where a peice of small microscopic metal blew into my eye.\u00a0\u00a0However further checkups he said the size has not changed.,\u00a0\u00a0However I have floaters quite oftent now. Some months worse than others.\u00a0\u00a0Also just told I have developing cataracts.\u00a0\u00a0Will the hole in the retina ever cause trouble?",
