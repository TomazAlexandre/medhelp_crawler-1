            "answer": "Hi!Cold peripheries or cold hands and feet can happen due to peripheral vascular disease or disorder of the circulatory system outside of the brain and heart (such as venous pooling or deep vein thrombosis). Other causes of cold extremities are hypothyroidism, eating disorders like anorexia, Vit B12 deficiency, Addison\u2019s disease, adrenal causes like pheochromocytoma, anemia, Buerger\u2019s disease, chronic fatigue syndrome and Raynaud\u2019s disease. You will need some tests like treadmill test, color Doppler, angiography, ultrasonography and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).Since you also have itch possibility of eating disorders, hypothyroidism, diabetes, and dry skin due to any other cause should be looked into first. Since your blood pressure is low, make a conscious effort to eat and drink fluids such as water, fresh juices, soups etc. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
