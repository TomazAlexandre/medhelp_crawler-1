    "question": "I was wondering about something that is happening to me.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes when I am really tired, and stressed out at the same time, I get this strange thing that happens.\u00a0\u00a0It's been happening for years, the first I can remember where someone pointed it out to me was when I was 17 years old.\u00a0\u00a0It feels as if there is a itching in my sinuses, and a pulling or tension in the muscles around my nose and eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I get a headache with it, and it pulls up to the top of my head.\u00a0\u00a0I press on my nose and forehead to relieve the extremely uncomfortable feeling.\u00a0\u00a0It is not painful, just really a very tight feeling that only relieves with pressure to my face. Usually when I put the pressure, my left arm jerks and my hand stiffens into an odd shape, (my husband says it is like a claw shape), sometimes when it jerks it hits my head.\u00a0\u00a0Also when I open my eyes after, I can't see for nearly 8-10 seconds.\u00a0\u00a0Recently during one of these blindness's, my husband said my eyes were facing opposite directions.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't concerned about what happens until he told me that.\u00a0\u00a0I really thought it was just some sinus problem, or a weird habit when I get tired.\u00a0\u00a0I can only recall a few times that this happened during the day, it usually is at night when I go to bed.\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever heard of such a strange thing?Other medical conditions: pcos, panic / anxiety disorder (following my father's death)",
