    "question": "Hi allI have been noticing some sort of allergy/infection for the past 3-4 times i was hurt. all the times i had some small scratches which would not generally need any special supervised medication. but what happens after a few days of the scratches and application of ointments like betadine, the region becomes gettting red, itches really bad and then develop some watery rashes. the original scratches heal but the itchy condition continues. The whole thing takes almost 25-30 days to get completely fine. can it be becuase of any ointments i use or...every time i had taken a Tetanus injection on time. Thanks in advance",
