            "answer": "Hi,It is difficult to give an opinion without knowing your complete medical history and clinical exam.It is important to rule out other causes of pain and numbness in the foot like neuropathies due to diabetes and B12 deficiency.You can try taking B12 supplements and see if they help with your numbness and pain. In the meantime schedule an appointment with your neurologist and get his opinion on this.Thanks",
