    "question": "I have a 6 mm adenoma with low side of normal TSH and a Free T4 .89, I am not on thyroid med.s and will be having a MRI with contrast dye done on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0My ACTH registers 0 when tested. Should my cortisol levels or adrenals be tested? Is there medication that will help? Will surgery take care of these problems? Will my diabetes that is in the upper 500's improve? Help! I am away from 1700 miles away from home and did guidance. I do have an endocrinologist at home but I will be away for another 2 months before I will see that Dr. again. Your advice is appreciated.",
