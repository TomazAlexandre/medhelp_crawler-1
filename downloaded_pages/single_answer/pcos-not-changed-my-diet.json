            "answer": "Well the point of taking metformin is to regulate the hormones that will make your period come. If you don't regulate these, chances are slim that the cycles will be on time and anovulation will usually occur. Also, if you eat a lot of sugar, carbs or fatty foods-the side effects of the metformin will hit SOON. I don't know if you've experienced them yet, but be close to a bathroom. Good luck!",
