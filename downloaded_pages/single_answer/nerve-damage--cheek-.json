            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The most probable cause for the burning sensation could be neuropathy, a disorder of the nerves. Its unlikely that people looking at you could have caused this effect. Most common cause for neuropathy is diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It can also be due to metabolic disorders, vitamin deficiencies, infections and traumatic injuries. The sensation may need proper evaluation by your GP, please consult him for a neurological assessment.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "HelloToday when\u00a0\u00a0I was walking through the train station I was walking past a group of girls, I was dressed very smartly and looked good, when I was walking past them I got a fantasy in my mind that they thought I was good looking and mysterious and also that they were staring at me because i am mixed race and unusual looking. When I was doing this I got a feeling of excitement, but it was also straining myself and making my heart beat stopWhen I sat on the train\u00a0\u00a0they had the heating on undernearth me and it was very hot. I suddenly felt my cheek go very hot, and it felt like someone was pushing my cheek in with their fist or a gust of wind was blowing directly on my cheek my cheek was also tingling afterwards, I cannot describe how it felt, I thought I was having a stroke.Could this have been nerve damage from me showing off\u00a0\u00a0or because of the intense heat from the heater on the train?",
