            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.There are 2 types of nerves in our body, large and small. The small nerve endings supply the skin and sweat glands. Regarding the small nerve fibers, symptoms of neuropathy include burning or buzzing or other vague symptoms starting in the feet and hands then in some cases spreading to other parts of the body. An EMG/nerve conduction studies (NCS) (tests done to check for neuropathy performed by many neurologists) will not show an abnormality, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a skin biopsy so that the number of nerve endings can literally be counted. There are other tests of the function of small nerves that can be ordered, such as QSART testing which looks at how much sweat the skin makes, since sweating is in a sense of function of these small nerves. There are several causes of small fiber neuropathy, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and autoimmune problems. Many times the source/cause of the neuropathy takes time to diagnose. It may require a step-wise approach. It is important to eliminate most common causes, such as diabetes with an oral glucose tolerance test, initially.You mentioned thickened gyri in the frontal lobe. This is likely not the source of sensory changes (depending on exact location), but it would be worthwhile to get an EEG to evaluate the electricity of the brain for any epileptiform abnormalities.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
