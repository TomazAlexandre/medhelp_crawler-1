Do moderate exercising and avoid heavy exercising till you can get back your energy levels. At your age you should not feel overly tired, unless you have a health problem. Hope your blood pressure is normal.Solace",

    "question": "For a lot of months now I've been feeling quite tired, and exhausted, to the point of dizziness and having a hard time concentrating. Sometimes I get really hot and have a little but of a phase that lasts about 30 min. Usually the other symptoms become a bit more noticeable. I used to get severe stomach pains, usually gassy but not always, but I got dewormed and that seems to have helped. I have been tested for diabetes, as well as my thyroid, and blood. I haven't been tested for gluten, but I tried a month without gluten, and I didn't notice much difference, besides my stomach not feeling heavy after eating the gluten.I have been somewhat sad sometimes, perhaps a bit more than other people, but I haven't been diagnosed with any mental problems.My town is notorious for the lack of doctors, so they don't get too Indepth with patients, and I guess I don't show much of a priority, and they usually place the blame for my tiredness on lack of exercise, because I was so skinny and lacked muscle, but now I exercise minimum an hour a day, and the exhaustion has been much stronger. THIs may just be because of my muscles being sore, but I know what that feels like and it doesn't feel like that.I also have some problems breathing sometimes. My lungs hurt sometimes when I'm breathing mostly when there's a pain it's near the middle of my chest towards the bottom of my ribs on the right.I'm a 19 year old male, who is skinny and tall. I eat quite a healthy diet, people often comment on my diet at how healthy it is.Thanks if you read it all, I just wanted to be thorough.",
