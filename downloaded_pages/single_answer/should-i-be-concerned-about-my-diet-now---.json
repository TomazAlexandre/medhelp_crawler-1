            "answer": "Type 2 diabetes can be kept under control by watching the diet (i.e., avoiding foods that are heavily laden with quickly-digested sugars that cause the blood sugar levels to spike upwards) and by keeping weight under control, for type 2 diabetes is usually characterized by insulin resistance rather than cessation of insulin production, which is the cause of type 1 diabetes. Many people who are type 2 diabetics are able to keep their glucose numbers very normal by losing weight (excess fat cells are a big factor in insulin resistance) and avoiding meals heavy in carbohydrates. Type 2 diabetes can be kept under control this way, and you may never be able to avoid having to go on medication by changing lifestyle. Yes, it is possible that your glucose numbers may never go up to true diabetic levels if you can follow your doctor's advice.On the other hand, type 1 diabetes has a totally different cause and nothing a patient does will affect whether that person becomes a diabetic or not. It is an autoimmune disorder and its cause is not related to diet at all.",
