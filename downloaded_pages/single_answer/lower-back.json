I don't know if it has anything to do with diabetes since I'm not diabetic, but I do have lower back pain. Mine, after an MRI, was diagnosed at first as buldging discs for which I took steroids, then a lumbar epidural. Next MRI showed ruptured discs w/bone fragments pressing nerves. This led to surgery. Still not pain free but better. Seriously consider seeing another doctor.",
