Use the tongue scarper gently for a few days or avoid if possible, Give the area time to heal for a week or so. If it persists consult a doctor. In all likelihood the sensation will return. If it does not you may have to test for diabetes.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
