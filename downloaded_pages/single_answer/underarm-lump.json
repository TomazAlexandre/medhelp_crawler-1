    "question": "I am twenty-four years of age, female, and roughly forty pounds over weight. I have come to notice that when my menstrual cycle comes around I develop boils or risens on my inner thighs. My guess is this is due to either hormones or sugar intake. More importantly, I have a very small, pea-sized, lump under my left arm. It does not hurt and it goes away and comes back. I can place the entire lump in my finger tips as it picks up with my extra skin. My family has a history of many medical problems that include leukemia, diabetes, and female cancers, NONE of which have been breast cancer. I am also a smoker and am very much overly dramatic about things that I think may be cancer as I have watched several loved ones fight it, suffer, and then die. None of them have succeeded with treatment. My question is this: If the lump is movable and does not seem to be deep within the armpit or a lympnode, and I can literally feel the entire lump all the way around, would this be a sebaceous cyst or should I schedule a biopsy and mammogram? I ask first for lack of insurance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
