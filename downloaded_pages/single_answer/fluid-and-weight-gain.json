            "answer": "I try to speak about general medical problems, because it really is not safe or wise to try to make medical diagnosis over the internet.Many things can cause swelling like you've mentioned annd it sounds that some of they already investigated some.Poor heart function (aka congestive heart failure) can cause similiar swelling but the ECHO should have determined how the heart was pumping blood.\u00a0\u00a0 Poor function the kidney or liver can cause some swelling, but those conditions are not the types of things that sneak up on people and usually have more serious symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 Nutritional problems can also cause the amount of protein in the blood (albumin) to become low and that too can contribute to swelling.I'm sure they've checked her thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Low thyroid can cause swelling, weight gain, and dcreased activity.I hope that helps . . .",

    "question": "My\u00a0\u00a0mother's feet, ankles, and legs have been swelling lately. She has also been extremely tired, and gained 15 pounds in three weeks. She takes 30mg of Celexa for depression. She just recently started feeling good, a little to good. SHe was unable to sleep, shopping like crazy, trying to do everything she could in a day. Recently the doctor told her, he thought she had a heart attack but the Echo showed that her heart was fine. Something is not fine. SHe has gone from Superman, to I can't keep my eyes open. But she still won't slow down. What could cause these symptoms. Diabetes, heart problems, and cancer run in our family. She had a problem with being allergic to some ear drops and they had to scrap her ear drum because it got scaley. Then she got a sinus infection or brochitis. The doctor changed his mind. So she thinks she was allergic to the antibiotic. But I am really sceptical about that. What should I ask the doctors to look for? She is going to turn 49 in January, Lord willing.",
