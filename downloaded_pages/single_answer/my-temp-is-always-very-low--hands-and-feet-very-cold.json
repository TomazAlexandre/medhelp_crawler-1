    "question": "My temperature stays at 95.3. I have taken it in the morning and at night. When my temp is more in the normal range I feel like I am running a fever. The nurse noticed that my temp was very low today and she said that I need to wear more clothes. I was wearing jeans, t-shirt, hoodie, shoes and socks and it was 60 outside. My hands and feet are always ice cold and that is no exaggeration. The get so cold and my feet always look like they are flexing and my hands sometimes feel very stiff.I know that my temp is not normal. The next time I go to the doctor I will bring this up, but what should I have the doctor look for?",
