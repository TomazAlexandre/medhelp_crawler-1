            "answer": "Metformin is used to treat diabetes and now you are pregnant. It is important to keep your sugar levels as normal as possible for the baby and your health. Stomach issues and nausea are some of the side effects of Metformin. If you do not like the side effects with the medication, suggest returning to your doctor and asking for another type of medication to control your sugar levels. Thank you for your question.",
