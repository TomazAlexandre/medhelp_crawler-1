Please cite this article as doi: 10.1111/liv.12480AbstractIntroductionFew data are available on the prevalence of renal abnormalities in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients. The multicentric cross-sectional HARPE study evaluated the prevalence of kidney disease indicators, in chronic HBV surface antigen carriers patients (HBsAg+) with active or inactive infection.Patients and methods268 HBsAg+ adult patients, na\u00efve of any oral anti-hepatitis B virus treatment were prospectively included over 2 years. Data for renal assessment were collected once from patient files. Univariate tests and multiple linear regressions were performed with the SAS software, version 8.02 (SAS, Inc., Cary, NC).ResultsAmong the 260 patients analyzed, 58% were men, the mean age was 42 \u00b1 14 years, 59.6% were inactive carriers whereas 47 patients, mostly active, were about to start an antiviral therapy. Prevalence of proteinuria, hematuria, glycosuria, uninfectious leukocyturia was 38.1%, 20.6%, 3.9% and 9%, respectively. According to the international definition, a total of 64.6% of patients were found to have kidney disease. Diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia were observed respectively in 4.6%, 9.2% and 38.8% patients. There were no significant differences for these results within the 3 subgroupsConclusionRenal abnormalities are highly prevalent in our population and pre-exists before the initiation of any anti-hepatitis B virus treatment. This emphasizes the need for: 1. a baseline renal evaluation in all HBs antigen-positive patients; 2. a regular renal monitoring before and during anti-hepatitis B virus treatment to diagnose and manage renal impairment and adjust anti-hepatitis B virus treatment doses to renal function when necessary.This article is protected by copyright.
