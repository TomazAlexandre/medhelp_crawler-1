            "answer": "Hi, the symptoms described by you may not be related to lipitor. The symptom described by you could be due to neuropathy. It is a disorder of the nerves which causes numbness, tingling, unusual sensations and sometimes pain. Diabetes Mellitus can cause neuropathy. Other causes like vitamin deficiencies, alcohol consumption and certain medications can cause neuropathy. You may need to consult your primary care physician to detect the cause. Regards.",
