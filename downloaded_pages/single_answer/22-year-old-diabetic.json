            "answer": "I'm sorry you are having problems. It's really hard when you don't have insurance! You don't say anything about your insulin regimen. Are you on a long-acting insulin such as Levemir or Lantus and a fast-acting insulin for your meals? Do you know your Insulin:Carb ratios to determine your mealtime dose? This is the best way to control blood sugar. If you don't know how to do this, you might look in the library for the book Using Insulin by John Walsh or Think Like a Pancrease (I forget the author). Also, send me a PM if you want a website with a lot of experienced diabetics who can help you understand how to control your blood sugar. Will you be able to get on your husband's insurance when he is past probation? You really need insurance for your diabetes. Meanwhile you might check for free or sliding scale clinics in your area.",
