            "answer": "Hello,There are a few possibilities which need to be ruled out.They are diabetes,carpal tunnel syndrome, Golfer\u2019s or tennis elbow, neurological disease like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorder,TIA, are vit B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism,peripheral nerve trauma or compression, peripheral vascular disease,spondolysis and thoracic outlet syndrome.I feel that an examination by a physician will be the best to rule them out one by one and reach a confirmatory diagnosis.Till that time,try taking vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoma persist.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
