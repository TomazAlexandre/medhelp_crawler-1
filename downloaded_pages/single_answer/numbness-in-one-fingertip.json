            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Numbness in the ring finger can occur due to nerve compression or due to peripheral neuropathy. The most common cause of numbness in the ring finger is carpal tunnel syndrome which occurs due to entrapment of ulnar nerve at the wrist joint. This is seen commonly in people who spend long hrs working on the computer.Other causes can be peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, B12 deficiency or thyroid dysfunction or it can even be due to spasm of the blood vessels known as Reynaud\u2019s phenomenon.Please get a clinical evaluation done. Meanwhile do some wrist exercises and take B complex supplements.",
