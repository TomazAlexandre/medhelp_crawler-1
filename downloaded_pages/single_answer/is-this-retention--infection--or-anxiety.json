            "answer": "Anxiety can make your want to pee more, even have the urge to pee when you have just been.A few days before a period begins you may notice that you will be going to empty your bladder more, this is normal and related to hormonal changes.Some foods like celery and cucumber are natural diuretics and dandelion coffee, green tea, will make you want to urinate more.Sometimes diabetes, urinary infections and other illnesses can make you pee more.\u00a0\u00a0Other times, like in your case some years ago, no cause can be found.When you are having these urges of constantly wanting to go, it may be worth getting your urine examined for any possible infections.The doctor may refer you to a urologist to see if there is anything going on inside the bladder if things do not settle.Do not stop drinking water.\u00a0\u00a02-3 litres per day is usually recommended, more if you are sweating or working out.Best wishes.",

    "question": "HelloI'm posting on here as a bit as an almost last resort.. I'm a female teen who has experienced on and off \"bouts\" of frequent urination all my life. I've been great for the past year or so,but now I'm starting to worry more. I feel like I have more bad days than not, bad in that I have\u00a0\u00a0a greater urge to pee during the day than normal (I can usually make it to two or three hours perfectly easy, and about 5 or 6 hours all together). It's really strange, and seems to happen completely randomly. I've been trying to look for patterns, but I cant seem to figure out and distinct reason as to what would cause these random frequency periods. I don't over drink water, I'm not usually constipated, I don't drink any caffeine. I' was checked out for this problem a few years ago and nothing.The thing is, I've been worrying about it A LOT, and while worrying doesnt always cause the problem, it definitely makes things worse. Can it all be in my head?\u00a0\u00a0A lot of the time I feel like I have to pee but can't, and I'm not sure as to whether thats due to anxiety or urinary retention. I'm really at a loss. I have no other symptoms, no pain, no problems other than random, out of nowhere urinary incontinence. I don't know what to do:(Any help?",
