            "answer": "It is good to hear you are eating healthy. Your albumin, total protein, sodium, chloride, and CO2 are all in normal levels. The lab values that indicate dehydration are BUN, and Creatinine which are for kidney function too. Did you have your iron levels tested and get a cardiac work-up? If you did not, suggest you have an Iron profile done (to rule-out any anemia) and get a cardiac work-up (different test for the Heart-stress, test, etc). As far as your protein, suggest an intake of 60-70grams of protein a day. Thank you for your question.",

    "question": "So far my doctors have been unable to diagnose me with anything, but because of many symptoms I've been experiencing over the last few years (most notably fatigue, muscle weakness, hair loss, brain fog) I have been vigilant about maintaining a healthy diet that includes lots of lean protein (eggs, chicken, fish), many fruits and veggies, low salt, low to no sugar, almost no white flour, and drinking plenty of water.\u00a0\u00a0I've been doing this for more than 3 years now.Despite this I remain extremely tired, and I often feel weak and dehydrated, slightly constipated, and I am constantly retaining water.\u00a0\u00a0At times I have severe edema in my ankles.I got the results of a metabolic panel recently, and although nothing was out of the normal range, I am perplexed by some of my levels.For instance, my total protein is on 6.4 g/dL, where the low end of the normal range is 6.0, and my albumin level is 3.5 g/dL out of a range of 3.5 - 5.1.\u00a0\u00a0Since I eat a lot of lean protein, I thought this would be higher.My sodium level was 142 mmol/L (range 134 - 146), chloride was 108 (range 98-110) and carbon dioxide was\u00a0\u00a029 (range 21-33).\u00a0\u00a0These seem to indicate I'm leaning towards dehydration.\u00a0\u00a0I drink 80 ounces of water a day, sometimes more, and still always feel dehydrated (blood sugar is fine and diabetes tests are always normal).How much more water do I have to drink to combat the fluid retention and dehydrated feeling (for which the doctors say there's no underlying cause that they can find), and how can I get my protein levels up?\u00a0\u00a0I can't imagine eating more protein than I already do, but it doesn't seem to be working.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",
