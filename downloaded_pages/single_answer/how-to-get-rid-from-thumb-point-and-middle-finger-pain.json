            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The neck pain and pain in thumb, pointing and middle finger is due to pinched cervical spinal nerve and median nerve compression. This can happen due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, herniated disc, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. A MRI of the cervical spine and nerve conduction studies may be required. Please consult a neurologist. The treatment is to remove the compression. You have to discuss the best treatment option with a neurologist, which can range from medication to physiotherapy to traction, cervical collars or even surgery.Prolonged use of computer with improper position of arm and wrist can result in mouse elbow. This occurs due to repetitive injury or stress and it is also known as carpel tunnel syndrome. The carpal tunnel (at your wrist through which the median nerve passes) changes its size depending on the position of the wrist.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s widest when wrist and hand are straight in line. When the hand is bent up or down, the tunnel becomes slightly smaller. This then presses on the nerve which then causes a pain right up to the elbow. Often proper working style, working without bending wrist, using smooth movements to operate the mouse and key pad, and relaxing the joints of finger, wrist and arm in between helps. A wrist support or arm support too helps and you have computer chairs with support for your spine and arm. In your case the problem may have been there for a long time, but repeated clicking of the mouse (thus injuring the tendon of index finger) could have triggered the pain now. Application of ice pack, anti-inflammatory drugs, wearing wrist braces, stretching and strengthening exercises when the pain subsides and modification of the way you click mouse goes a long way in avoiding further injury and treating the present symptoms. Try these tips. Maybe you should consult an occupational therapist and learn proper use of mouse, key pad and proper positioning of body while using computers. It is also possible that you have hypothyroidism, anemia, diabetes etc all of which can cause swelling at the carpel tunnel.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
