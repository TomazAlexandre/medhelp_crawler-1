            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis). Dry skin usually results from environmental factors that you can wholly or partially control. These include hot or cold weather with low humidity levels, long-term use of air conditioning or central heating, and washing or bathing too much.Other conditions cause itchy skin as well. Skin conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Application of calamine lotion and topical steroids are also helpful.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "The last few days I have a annoying itch all over my body...between fingers, arms, legs, lower back, scalp. Don't recall eating anything or using any different detergents/soaps.\u00a0\u00a0The itch looks a little like hives, I don't believe it is scabies as most places there are no visible rash/bumps. Some parts on my fingers feels like the sting or allergic reaction of an insect bite. I had the flu vaccination a couple days ago , could it be that? Most aggravated itching occurs at night. Any suggestions as to what else it could be? When should I see a Doctor to confirm? It's driving me crazy :(",
