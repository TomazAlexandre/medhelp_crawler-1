            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Needless to say, this is an uncommon problem in adults. I fully empathize with you and ask you to seek medical help immediately from your doctor.The reasons could be stress, functionally small bladder, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, urinary bladder wall instability, UTI, stones and neurological problems.Limit fluids in the evening. Set up an alarm your self and try and wake up 3-4 hours after sleep and use the washroom. This helps a number of times to break the sleep pattern and you will with time automatically start getting up. Consult an urologist and your gynecologist immediately. Take care!",
