            "answer": "Heh heh...well, I can give you my wife's perspective through me (after 15 years, we're sort of interchangeable).If your mum in law is worried about toxic shock and the like from being around the animals, tell her don't worry, as long as you take proper precautions it's not a danger(tell her your a big girl, you finish all your vegetables, and don't even have to be told to do your homework! :)\u00a0\u00a0)Otherwise, I'd point out to her that mental health is as important to your physical well being as well as to the development of your child. Heck, working at the shelter will on some small level HELP with your RLS (if it makes you genuinely happy).Or...you can just nod, smile, rub your tummy, and say;\"You're such a helpful mother in law!\"And then do exactly as you bloody well please. :)This is the treatment my wife gives me when I try to change her mind (minus the tummy part). The end result is I've learned to shut the heck up and stop complaining, as I realize now there's no point. It took MANY years, but I'm gradually getting it.",
