            "answer": "Hi med_87558148Welcome to the MedHelp forum!A chronic lingering infection can cause aches, pains, weakness etc. This can be due to diabetes which makes it difficult for the infection to go. Hence get fasting blood sugar, and two hours after blood sugar measured. Repeated bronchitis too can be due to diabetes making the infection persist, or it can be due to allergic reaction to dust/pollen/mold etc. The repeated stomach pains can be due to acidity from the medications you must be taking or it could be due to gas building up from slowing of gut due to diabetes.Other than this you need a culture and sensitivity urine, vaginal swab test, stool test, and other tests for anemia etc.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
