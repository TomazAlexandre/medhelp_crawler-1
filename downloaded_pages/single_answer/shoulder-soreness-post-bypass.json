    "question": "Is periodic shoulder soreness in the right shoulder something to be concerned about given the following?My mom is 60 weighs about 157lbs - has metabollic syndrome, diabetes type 2, high blood pressure, high trigylcerides, high cholesterol.When we found out she had all of this going on, we made sure she began turning this around by taking meds / going to the gym / losing weight, but it was not in enough time.She had a heart attack on 7/11.\u00a0\u00a0They tried angioplasty, but had to do quadruple bypass since her blocks were signficant.2 months later she had to have a lump removed from her breast (luckily benign).Thanks in advance",
