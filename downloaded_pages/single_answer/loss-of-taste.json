            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your wife\u2019s medical problems. Loss of taste is very common, especially after prolonged illness, viral fever, cough/cold, antibiotic (or antifungal) use etc. It also happens when you are depressed or tense. Damage to lingual nerve and the glossopharyngeal nerve, Bell's palsy etc are the neurological causes, which obviously she does not have based on symptoms alone. Deficiency of vitamin B3, zinc and iron are other causes and usually taking these supplements help.Diabetes and hypothyroidism are the other causes. Chronic tobacco use/smoking, liver and kidney disorders are other causes. She could try spicy/tangy/peppery dishes and aromatic food to tingle her taste buds and see if it helps. Change her toothpaste\u2014high fluoride in some toothpastes often change the taste. If the supplements and tips do not help, all these causes will have to be ruled out one by one. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
