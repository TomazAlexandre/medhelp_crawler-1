            "answer": "Hi!Burning sensation in the soles and feet can be due to plantar fasciitis, diabetes, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, peripheral neuropathies (Lyme\u2019s lupus, diabetes, hypothyroidism etc), hypothyroidism, SLE, alcoholism, peripheral artery disease, sciatica, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis and high blood pressure. You will need blood tests, nerve conduction studies and dopplar studies to reach a diagnosis. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
