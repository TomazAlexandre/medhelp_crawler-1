            "answer": "Hello,It is true that dry skin can be a result of anemia but various other differentials like thyroid disease,atopic dermatitis,diabetes and dermatological conditions also need evaluation. The mainstay of management is liberal use of moisturizers after washing with luke warm water. Soap should be used minimally. Moisturizers should be reapplied liberally during the day.You can also use a topical cortisone (steroid) cream or ointment like dermacort(hydrocortisone). Adding a humidifier to the central heating system of your home or using a humidifier also helps.If still the symptoms persist then pls consult a dermatologist for clinical examination.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing.",
