            "answer": "Hello,Part of the reason for the fatigue may be the continued high blood glucose levels, so our insulin regimen will need adjustment until your glucose levels improve. I am afraif that weight gain is a very common occurence with insulin, partially because you stop excreting glucose through the kidneys and instead it stays i your body. It is great that you eat healthy choics but you may also need to cut back on the actual amounts of food to keep your weight in check. You can also consider speaking with your doctor about using Levemir instead of Lantus --both are long acting insulins but Levemir is thought to cause less weight gain.Have your Vitamin D levels officially checked and formally replaced if you need it. And discuss with your doctor investigations to ensure no other reason for the low energy, such as other vitamin deficiencies, thyroid disorders, anemias etc. Also try to increase your physical activity everyday as this will in turn help your energy levels.Take care.",

    "question": "My question is, I have been diagnose with Type II diabetes. I take Humalog three times a day and Lantas at bedtime. I have been doing so for almost a year now. My sugar levels are still uncontrolled and instead of losing weight, I am gaining. I have always eaten healthy because thanks to my mother she trained us up to eat this way. I was very active until i was diagnosed and now I am always tired and can't seem to get enough sleep. I was told by a doctor friend to take Vitamin D-3 2000. I don't feel any change. Is there anything that will restore my energy level without causing my sugar levels to bottom out or reach high levels. I have a 3 yr old that I need energy to keep up with. I need some type of direction.",
