            "answer": "I'm sorry you're having such a hard time.\u00a0\u00a0We had huge problems with our daughter binge eating at night and not bolusing (she's on a pump).\u00a0\u00a0She decided to take all her problems and answer them with food and wanted to pretend she didn't have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This was when she was 15.\u00a0\u00a0I almost wanted to rip my hair out because I couldn't figure out why her #'s were so high! Finally, I compared her meter to her log.\u00a0\u00a0They didn't match at all.\u00a0\u00a0The diabetes educator had mentioned we should have done that before but I believed my daughter when she said her numbers were correct.\u00a0\u00a0Boy was I wrong... I'm not saying that this is what is going on with your daughter, but only to let you know that teenagers are just that... Teenagers.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter has had diabetes for 10 years and dealt with it better as a 7 year old than she does now.\u00a0\u00a0As for your Dr., I had to fight for a new one also.\u00a0\u00a0I know how you feel.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",
