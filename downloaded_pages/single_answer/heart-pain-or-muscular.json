    "question": "About 5 years ago when I was 37 (I am female), I started having pain in my upper back, left side only, which would radiate down my arm and into my hand - sometimes into my jaw as well. I would feel kind of dizzy at some points and \"not quite right\". No chest pain. This would come during stress or even at times of rest. I went to the ER on numerous occasions where they did the routine heart and blood tests. Said it wasnt heart related. Went to family doctor and insisted on seeing a cardiologist. He felt it wasnt heart related but sent me for a chest x-ray and echo which all came back normal. My family doctor felt it was muscle related and sent me to a physiatrist who said it was the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0Father has heart disease and diabetesMy job requires 8 hours computer work and then I go home and work a second job in the evening which can be another 2 hours or so on the computer.I've noticed this pain coming on more often and more severe. Now out of the blue I get these sharp jabs of pain in tmy chest, which is followed by the pain in my left shoulder blade, neck and jaw and then down my arm to my hands. It comes at times of rest and with stressful incidents. If I massage the shoulder blade area in my back deeply, it seems to relieve the pain. Stretches help as well. None of this pain comes on from exertion, just stress or \"out of the blue\". I woke up this morning after a bad dream with my heart pounding, then the pain started again in my shoulder blade and down my arm.\u00a0\u00a0I saw the doctor yesterday again said it looked muscular but has ordered the routine tests again.\u00a0\u00a0He",
