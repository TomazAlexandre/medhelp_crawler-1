            "answer": "Hi,You seem to suffer from urge incontinence. This could possibly be due to bladder inflammation secondary to the underlying bladder stone or a recent UTI. I\u2019ll suggest getting an ultrasound done and ruling out the possibility of a bladder stone and avoiding drinking a lot of fluids in one go and instead sipping fluids spread throughout the day. Doing some kegel exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles also helps in improving the symptoms of urge incontinence. Drugs like urispas does help in improving the symptoms. I\u2019ll suggest you to consult a urologist and seek treatment. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
