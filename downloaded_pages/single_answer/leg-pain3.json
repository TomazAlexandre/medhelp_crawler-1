            "answer": "Hi,The pain may be caused by peripheral neuropathy.There are many possible causes of peripheral neuropathy, including Diabetes Mellitus, Shingles (post herpetic neuralgia),Vitamin deficiency- particularly B12 and folate, Alcohol, Autoimmune diseases\u00a0\u00a0including lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or Guillain-Barre syndrome, AIDS, syphilis, and kidney failure, Inherited disorders, such as amyloid polyneuropathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Exposure to toxins, such as heavy metals, gold compounds, lead, arsenic, mercury, and organophosphate pesticides, Cancer therapy drugs such as vincristine (Oncovin, Vincasar), and other medications [for example antibiotics such as metronidazole (Flagyl), and isoniazid (Nydrazid, Laniazid)]. While diabetes and post herpetic neuralgia are the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy, often times no cause is found. In these situations, it is referred to as idiopathic peripheral neuropathy. Sometimes, peripheral nerve entrapments may cause symptoms of neuropathy . In these cases, pressure on the nerve rather than a disease state leads to nerve malfunction. Please go for MRI of the spine, pelvic region and leg to know the cause of the symptoms. Please consult a neurologist for treatment. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",
