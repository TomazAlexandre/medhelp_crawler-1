            "answer": "There is nothing to lower the LH level alone and that would not be the goal for fertility for you. The goal would be to have ovulation if you were not ovulating for fertility. Of course if the goal was not ovulation, there is a way to decrease LH/FH ratios but that would mean being placed on birth control pills or shut down your brain signals to your ovaries by other methods. If you have PCOS, you should also be evaluated for glucose intolerance or diabetes by a 2 hour glucose tolerance test with a 75 gram glucose challenge.",

    "question": "Hello!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I\u00a0\u00a0recieved bloodwork results today they confirmed the PCOS diagnosis, they said the LH:FSH ratio was consistent with PCOS, anyhow i got the testosterone level today and they said it was 68 (i guess it should be under 75 they said) but that anything over 30 its really too much... They said we won't do anything different this cycle, but we need to get the LH level down, is there a way to lower the LH or testosterone levels?? I'm already on femara and will be taking 10,000 of HCG as a trigger then progesterone after ovulation.. Thanks for any advice!",
