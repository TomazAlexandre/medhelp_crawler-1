            "answer": "Hello,Your doctor will likely need to do some further testing in future, including a glucose tolerance test, to see what glucose abnormalities you may have. I do not know if your symptoms are related to your blood sugars or not--possible yes, but there are many other possible causes for your symptoms. Low blood sugars certainly can contribute to fatigue but dangerous side effects like passing out or seizures usually happen only at extremely low levels (lower than 35m/dL). I suggest touching base with your doctor about those recent results, especially given your other symptoms.Take care",

    "question": "Hi.6 months ago i saw my doctor as i was feeling tired all the time and could not concentrate very well at work. I was given an MOT whre they took blood and tested for various things. It came back that my blood sugar levels were a little low at 2.9. I was retested and they came back at 4 and was told to come back in 6 months time as this waws normal, which i have and am just waiting for the results. If they are low again what will happen? I do feel quite thirsty at times but my stomach feels full and bloated. Is this connected? I sleep on average between 8.5 hours a night but am still tired!Please help.Thank you",
