    "question": "I have long term (23 years) Pituitary problems. Starting with a partial removal of my Pituitary Gland due to a Prolactinoma, that caused severe post op complications, including Diabetes Insipidus. I underwent a second Tansphynoidal op when an abscess formed on the Pituitary Cavity. This caused Hypothalamus damage and the continuation of DI symptoms for 9 months. I had no further problems until I was involved in a car crash 6 years later and the head truama caused me to lose the rest of Pituitary gland. Some years later I was diagnosed with Hypopiturism, needing varied medication to keep me alive. 4 years ago (I'm not very good at keeping out of accidents), I had two head trauma's when I fainted and a month later I started with DI symptoms again, but this time I did NOT have a thirst, in fact I only drink because I like having a cup of tea or coffee. Two years later I started having UTI's and now after seeing many consultants they cannot find out a reason why I am getting them, despite antibiotics on a daily basis for well over a year now. I also had two hospital emergencies last July when I had life threatening low sodium cirises; and again doctors cannot tell me why I had them. I am an intelligent 63 year old lady, who has done a lot of research into my illnesses and here is what I have come up with: My problems are due to a damaged Hypothalamus. To me it is logical conclusion, If one day I was well and with a normal thirst mechinism, then after two head trauma's, a month later I start with DI symptoms but not wanting to drink, depite losing so much fluid (in one go 1100ml), surely that means something, to someone. The doctor in the hospital I attend doesn't believe me; although my General Practitioner doctors are unbelievably supportive, but they are just GP's and readily admit I am so complicated they do not know how to help me. After over 2 years of UTI's, I am so poorly and just fed up that no one can come up with an answer to help. CAN ANYONE HELP ME?",
