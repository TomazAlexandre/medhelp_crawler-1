    "question": "Hi, I was in a really bad place in Feb. I stopped testing and my medications (metformin) and sank into a deep dark depression. Of course, had all the symptoms of high blood sugar but I was so confused and mentally not thinking clearly. I started vomiting and drinking gallons of water and gatorade because my thirst was uncontrollable. I should have seen the signs but when I did test; my meter just said high and I was barely in a conscious state most of the time! I had no idea how sick I was since it had been ongoing for several months. Finally, my son called 911 & I was in the hospital with a glucose number of 1911! I had no idea that it could go that high nor did any of my doctors, nurses or health care providers. I had to double check my blood tests to believe it. I should have either been in a coma or dead. I also have problems with gastraparisis and neuropathy in my feet and hands among other problems. I take Metfrormin 1000mg twice daily and insulin if my glucose numbers go over 200. I had visiting nurses for quite some time until I was well enough to take care of myself. My son and husband have been amazing for helping me get through this difficult time. My problem is this: Many of my friends and some family have stopped contacting me or returning e-mails or calls. I guess they gave me up for dead. At first, they all rallied around me but now they expect to me to be \"all better\" I am so sad and disappointed because I still have risidual effects from the damage of those incredibly high numbers and I am in chronic pain all the time. I rarely leave the house and I am trying to deal with all of this as best I can but my husband and son and other people think I am fine now because I am controlling my diabetes numbers but I am still very sick with fibromyalgia, arthritis, bipolar problems, and disk and arthritis in my neck and back and the list goes on. Everyone I do talk to say just work through it so I literally overdo everyday I can to take care of the house etc. I have no real quality of life anymore and I am desperate. Please if anyone has any suggestions...I would greatly appreciate them. I do hope those of you who post here are coping well and feeling better as well. By the way, I do some stretching exercises everyday even when I am in pain. My pain level gets to a ten at least 3 days a week. I am frightened that I can't keep up this facade. Thanks in advance if anyone relates to this and contacts me. Marlene",
