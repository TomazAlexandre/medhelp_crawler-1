            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I am sorry to hear about your condition and equally sorry to say that your symptoms are due to underlying infection or due to some cancer. Since you have WBC in urine, that could be the source of infection. Get a culture sensitivity of urine, and an abdominal CT. Tuberculosis and other chronic disease causing spleen enlargement should be looked into. Cancer is another possibility that cannot be ruled out. Diabetes and thyroid disorders too should be ruled out.I do not want to scare you for I have not examined you and can be miles away from diagnosis. However\u00a0\u00a0the first step should be to consult a hematologist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
