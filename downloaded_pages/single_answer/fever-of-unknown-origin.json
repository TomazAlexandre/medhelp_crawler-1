            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to hear about your daughter. Since extensive blood tests have been done, focus should be on parasitic diseases. Stool test and liver scans should be done. Hepatitis should be ruled out or else it could even be a STD (if she has a history of sexual contact before adoption or after it). Since kidney is involved, possibility of hear involvement by pericarditis, endocarditis etc should be looked into.Recurrent or chronic fever is seen in tuberculosis, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and other auto immune disorders, UTI, drug fever, sinusitis, glandular fever, otitis media, IBS, HIV, STDs, endocarditis, parasitic infestations, fungal infections, lymphomas and other cancers etc. It can even be diabetes and hyperthyroidism.In women, even polycystic ovary, menopause, PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) should be investigated for.Hope this helps. Take care!",
