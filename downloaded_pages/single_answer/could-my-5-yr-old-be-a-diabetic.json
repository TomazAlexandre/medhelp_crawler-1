            "answer": "Please go look at my blog www.IDkidsshow.com to see a list of the symptoms of type one as I saw them surface in my son when he was 21 months old.\u00a0\u00a0Type one has a rapid onset but I was able to get him diagnosed the week it started before he developed DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) which is life threatining.\u00a0\u00a0Young children can give symptoms that\u00a0\u00a0some of the websites and things just don't describe very well.\u00a0\u00a0You can get a disposable blood sugar meter from walgreens for like twenty or thirty dollars with fifty strips in it, Look and see however because I don't think it comes with a finger lance you may have to buy one with it but they are cheap.\u00a0\u00a0You just poke the end of the finger with the lance after inserting the strip in the meter and put the blood sugar strip up to the blood until the meter beeps and it will give you the result normal is between 70-140 pre meal and no more than 180 after a meal, Diabetes being considered after 200. If he is under 70 he is having low blood sugar which can also make you very hungry.\u00a0\u00a0If you get a result thats questionably recheck him because the readings can vary greatly if you do something wrong or sometimes it is just the meter, its better in your case to average it from two or three meter readings.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure his hands are washed good and rinsed good before you check him, sugar and even sweetly scented soap on the hands can give a higher result that is not accurate.\u00a0\u00a0I understand your concern but I am glad you are being vigilant a lot of people are not, but try not to be to scared or worried about it.\u00a0\u00a0If your gut feeling tells you there is something wrong take him to the doctor, even if they end up thinking your crazy your will have done the best thing to protect your son and if he is fine then you will feel better knowing it.\u00a0\u00a0Disposable blood sugar meters are cheap and over the counter and if it gives your peace of mind or saves a life it it worth it to have one.\u00a0\u00a0I believe the one at Walgreens is called Tru Track.Good luck and God bless,Son diagnosed at 21 months",
