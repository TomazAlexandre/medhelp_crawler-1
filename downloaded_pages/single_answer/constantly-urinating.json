            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Commonest cause of increased frequency of urination is UTI, both due to a STD and non STD infection. However increased frequency of urine is also seen in diabetis mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Small for size bladder is another cause and so also neurogenic bladder. Another possibility is a polyp or a growth inside the urethra. At times a hair too grows inwards and keeps tickling the urethra causing a need to urinate. A frenulum tag too can cause this type of sensation.You must talk to your physician regarding all these possibilities. You would need some more tests beside urine analysis to reach a confirmed diagnosis. Take care!",
