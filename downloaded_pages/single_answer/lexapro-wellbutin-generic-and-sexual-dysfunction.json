            "answer": "First, have you had a full check up to ensure it's not one of the myriad of causes of ED? LIke diabetes, blood pressure issues as examples.\u00a0\u00a0High blood pressure pills can cause ED.\u00a0\u00a0Are you seeing a psychiatrist or just a family doctor?\u00a0\u00a0The reason for asking is, a GP isn't trained in psychopharmaceuticals, so for more complex treatment it's better to see a pdoc.\u00a0\u00a0There are a ton of meds out there that can help, especially in the mood stabilizer category. I had no sex drive for years taking meds in the ssri/snri - even cymbalta killed it. Wellbutrin isn 't supposed to affect you, I haven't seen a difference, I'm on 150mgs/day and it hasn't killed my libido.\u00a0\u00a0So make an app't with a pdoc, hopefully you'll be able to get a good med mix.",

    "question": "Good Morning,I am a 28yo male that has been on these meds for about 8 months. I started on these meds due to a feeling of disconnection/anxiety and my general negative thoughts for about\u00a0\u00a0a year. My finally convinced me to go see a doctor and was put on Lex and Wellbutrin as well as talk therapy. Wellbutrin was added a few weeks later. I can say that on these meds I feel like I am functioning on a normal level w/ a bit of an increase of libido from the Wellbutrin. Actually, I feel great.My main concern is what I would say is ED. This MUST be from the Lexapro. W/ that said, I feel like I avoid sex w the fear of my performance. It has happened before and do not want to go through it again. I talked to my doc and she perscribed Cialis to combat my problem. Problem solved right?? Well, I am not fully into using the viagras of the world to help because I never experienced anything like this before being perscribed the antid's. Is this my only option while on these meds??I tried switching to Remeron but that made me very sleepy. Lexepro is working great other than this BIG problem in my mind. I would like to feel as if my body is functioning on a normal level both sexually and mentally.Thanks for your help.",
