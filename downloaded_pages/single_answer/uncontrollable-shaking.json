            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Shaking or twitches on a stretched arm could be due to hyperthyroid states.I would suggest your friend gets the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get the kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, and fatigue all cause similar symptoms.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My friend has a \"twitch\" any time she raises her arms straight out her hands shake and twitch. It's really weird and neither of us know whats wrong. She has tennis elbow but I don't know if that has anything to do with it. I said she may have parkinsons but I don't think that's it. She also has a family history of diabetes, soo. Anyone know what might be wrong?",
