            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. The symptoms could be due to low vitamin D and hypothyroidism and this needs to be treated. Fasting blood sugar is borderline high and thus you need more detailed tests to rule out diabetes. Other than this, polycystic ovary should be looked into. If you are diagnosed with it then hormonal imbalance should be looked into. Please discuss all this with your treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi...I'm a 30 year old female from Indian origin.It all started three weeks back. I woke up with a stiff neck (muscle ache) and a muscle cramp in the back. Next day,the pain was radiating into my head,back,arms and chest. Couple of days later I felt random stabbing kind of pain all over my body (more like a nerve pain). This randomized pain has been intermittent and lately I have tingling all over my body and numbness (mostly legs and hands). I also feel slight off balance. I have done a lot of heavy lifting couple of months back.I good my blood work done last weekMy Tsh level is high at 4.62 (0.400-4.500)My Vitamin D is low at 20.8 ng/ml (30.0-100.0)My B12 levels are normal at 367 pg/ml (211-946)My fasting Glucose is 105 (70-100)I also have irregular periods and lot of visceral fat. I have not been to a doctor in the last 10 years until last week. Could this be happening because of hormones?I would really appreciate if you can help me with this.",
