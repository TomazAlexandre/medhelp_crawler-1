            "answer": "This could be a kidney problem, or it could be diabetes. In fact, these symptoms sound very much like diabetes. He does need to see a vet. This doesn't sound like an ER situation, but obviously, the sooner he gets veterinary care, the better. When you take him, do take a fresh urine sample with you. Diabetes can be managed, and he could still have some good years left in him. You will have to see what his diagnosis is, and what can be done for him.",
