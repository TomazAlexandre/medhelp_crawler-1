            "answer": "I would really like to know the answer to your questions myself, as I too have had these symptoms ever since I was cured of H. pylori infection back in early 2011 by multiple antibiotics at the same time. Ever since, I am always hungry, and if I don't eat I get so light-headed, then nauseous and weak, yet my A1 C tests have never been above 5.7.\u00a0\u00a0I do have multiple medical conditions, one of which was just recently diagnosed, which is secondary adrenal insufficiency. I also was shown to have by a positive tilt-table test in December 2013: Neuro-Cardiogenic Syncope. Whether either of these conditions are causing the constant hungar and subsequent lightheadedness, nausea, and weakness if I don't give into my hunger, I really don't know. I pray that you find the answers that you are seeking!",
