            "answer": "Hello,One possibility that may present this way is sclerederma. It presents as hardening and thickening of the dermal or middle layer of the skin and presents as hard patches on the back. It has been associated with many causes like diabetes, hyperparathyroidism and Sjogren\u2019s syndrome.The other possibility is of lichen sclerosus. I would suggest you to get it examined from a dermatologist. Also get your blood sugar levels estimated.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have several patches of very hard, rough skin. I first noticed one on my back about a year ago, and it's still there. I now have one about the size of a quarter on my hip. No amount of exfoliation can remove this hard skin. There is no pain, but there is some pink discolouration (spider-like in appearance). The texture is almost like when you accidentally spill crazy glue on your skin.Thanks!",
