            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Eye strain, squint, poor eye sight and astigmatism (where a cylindrical lens in needed as alignment is defective) can all be the cause. In all probability treating this will help cure the twitch.Also get hormonal status checked for estrogen and progesterone as you have PCOS, and check for your diabetes control, and for your recent hemoglobin and iron levels as all these conditions can also make you feel the way you are, and cause localized twitches. It can also be electrolyte imbalance pertaining to sodium, calcium, magnesium or potassium.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
