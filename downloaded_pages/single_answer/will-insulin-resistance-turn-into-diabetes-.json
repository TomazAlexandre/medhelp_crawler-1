            "answer": "Hi!Insulin resistance increases the risk of pre diabetes and type 2 diabetes by increasing the demand on insulin producing cells in the pancreas. If you have insulin resistance, you must take care of what you eat, exercise regularly and check your blood sugar as often as specified by your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
