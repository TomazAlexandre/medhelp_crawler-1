    "question": "Let's see.. where to begin.First of all, something that my mom and i noticed is that my blood circulation is a little off. Such as whenever i lie or get embarrassed i get extremely red and very hot. I literally have a physical response to that sort of stuff and I realize that this might seem really normal, but this happens more than it should. Also, whenever I stand up after sitting down for just a little bit I get very light headed to the point where I get really annoyed by it. One little event I had about two years ago was that I was looking through some vitamins that we had and I saw some niacin pills. They were really small so I took one thinking it was just a normal vitamin, it ended up that it was my grandfather's pills that he takes for his diabetes. About 5 minutes after taking the pill my stomach starting hurting really really bad and I got very light headed and almost passed out. I told my mom and she told me to lie down and she called poison control. During the time I turned very red and got really hot. I had the sensation like I was being sun burnt within seconds. Poison control told me to just wait it off. I looked at the bottle and I took 500% more than my recommended DV. Another event was when my dog accidentally bit me on my forearm and when my mom was cleaning it I got really light headed and practically passed out. But it wasn't because of the blood or anything (I think blood is pretty neat) but it was just automatic.

But it wasn't because of the blood or anything (I think blood is pretty neat) but it was just automatic. Another incedent was when i went to the doctor to get a blood capillary removed that was on top of my collar bone (the one that I broke when I was in a bad car wreck last year) so he gave me some general numbing medicine ( Zylacaine or Novacaine or something like that) so when he gave me the shot i could feel my blood pressure drop and I felt very light headed, turned white, and almost passed out from that.. and by the way I don't have a fear of needles at all. he then explained to me that I probably have a fluctuating blood pressure which would explain why I always get instantly flushed or very light headed. Then when he was cutting off the capillary I felt a sharp stinging through my shoulder. It turned out that I have a resistance to numbing medicines like zylacaine (sp?)...convenient I know. So then when he was about to cauterize the spot, I felt the full force of the burning which caused me to jump. Then I could feel my heart rate rapidly increase and I got very hot and flushed. So he had to give me 3x the amount of medicine as a normal person. Sorry for all the story telling... but I was just wondering if anyone can explain why I can so easily become very flushed to very light headed.",
