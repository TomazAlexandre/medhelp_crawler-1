            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. I can understand your anxieties. Do you suffer from anemia, diabetes or hypothyroidism? Is there any other cause for possible fatigue, related to your profession, sleep habits, or posture? Are you a known smoker or alcoholic? Consult a neurologist for a complete evaluation, an MRRI spine would be required to check for any cervical spine involvement like degenerative disc disease, prolapsed or spondylosis. I may not be able to comment further without examining you personally. Hope this helps you. You are welcome to discuss any concerns again. Take care.",

Does it just get overworked and it goes through our bodies and\u00a0\u00a0the other thing i believe is that it ismuscular and to do with the body being out of alignment and pulling muscles and tendons out of sync.\u00a0\u00a0Yoga wouldhelp us all get healthier, so i shall be starting by doing some simple stretches.\u00a0\u00a0The third thing is arthritis which willaffect our joints and would that cause our muscles to be pulled and stretched. do you think that this problem is have more causes and effects and is just not 1 problem. i would be grateful of any medical imput and appropriatetests that could be carred out and any exercises/stretches that would help muscles, tendons and ligaments.thank yousupergalafragalisticThis discussion is related to Pain on right side - head to toe.",
