            "answer": "What you don't say is if you are a Type 2 diabetic and what your blood sugar numbers are! I'll assume you are and that you test regularly and know how to eat a diet low in carbs to keep your numbers in target range. This same low carb diet combined with exercise should help you keep your weight down. If you are overweight and want to lose, not just maintain talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to a nutritionist who can help you design a weight loss diet that is also diabetes friendly. Or just look online, there's lots of information. Also, some oral meds are better for weight and controlling hunger so talk to your doctor about that too.",
