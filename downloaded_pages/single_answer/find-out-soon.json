            "answer": "Glad to hear you and your family remained safe through the fires.\u00a0\u00a0One thing to keep in mind is many of us have one autoimmune disease or another.\u00a0\u00a0I truly believe it is related.I hope to have the research paper out soon...., it is really being rewritten by someone that will help us get it published and out there where we need too.\u00a0\u00a0So the delay is well worth it in the long run.However,one of the points I make in there it the connection between biofilm infections and autoimmune diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in mind many of us have infection even when it doesn't show, on the urine test.\u00a0\u00a0The infection is often with in the stones.\u00a0\u00a0In the article Medical Biofilms by James Beyer, he explains the host response is increase of histamine and mast cells.\u00a0\u00a0Both of these have been directly connected to auto immune diseases!\u00a0\u00a0One article explained that when your body's immune system tries to attack the infection and it can not get to it, or penetrate the stones then it can actually turn and attack tissues etc.This helps us all understand why we see so many of us with MSK &whatever, IC, Fibro, RA, Diabetes, thyroid problems etc.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure why unless it comes out in the area you are the weakest.... that is why we need more research studies!Shelly",

    "question": "Thank you all for your replies and advice. I haven't been on for awhile because one son started high school and another started primary school so that kept me busy. Then our grandfather passed away on the 2nd at the age of 95 and to top it all off my mother had heart surgery which was a success.I think you may be right about the simmering infection because I had another blood and urine test on Friday and my urine was very cloudy indeed and my left kidney has been niggly. I see my specialist this Friday so I will let you all know how I go. At the same time I am being investigated for an autoimmune disorder due to other symptoms I have!! Oh well, there are always others worse off, what can I say? Especially right now with our bushfires still burning. Our skies have been filled with smoke for a week so everytime I go outside I think of everyone who has lost everything plus loved ones as well. We have raised over $60 million for the survivors from all over Australia and thanks to everyone in the United States for their prayers and good wishes. Everything helps at times like these. I had family evacuated but thank goodness they survived with everything still standing.",
