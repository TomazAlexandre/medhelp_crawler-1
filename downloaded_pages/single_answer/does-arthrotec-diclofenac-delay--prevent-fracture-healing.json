            "answer": "Hi,How are you? There are some risk factors for the non union of humerus shaft fracture. They are open fracture, highly comminuted fracture pattern, significant displacement of the fracture fragments, smoking, diabetes, NSAID\u2019s, infection and hypothyroidism.In your case, NSAID use could have aided in non union of the fracture, but there is a need to rule out other causes as well.The treatment for non union, usually involves plate fixation as exchange IM nailing gives poor results. I would suggest that you visit a orthopaedician and discuss the possible chances for non union and treatment for the same.Best.",

    "question": "Does use of an anti-inflammatory med specifically Diclofenac Arthrotec-75 (twice daily) contribute to delayed union or non-union of fractures? I broke my humerus (upper arm) 2 1/2 months ago and it's not healing.\u00a0\u00a0I've been taking Arthrotec for back-pain for a couple of years and now starting to get paranoid if it's causing my non-union of bone.\u00a0\u00a0Can someone advise? Thanks in advance.",
