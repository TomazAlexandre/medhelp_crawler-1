    "question": "My 3 year old daughter who was potty trained at 2 1/2 has recently started wetting her pants at various intervals.\u00a0\u00a0She was diagnosed with two different bacterial infections and their has been blood and inflammatory tissue in her urine.\u00a0\u00a0This past time she did not have an infection but finished out her medicine anyway.\u00a0\u00a0It suddenly hit me that last week was Easter and she's been eating an extra amount of sugar in her daily diet. She also has been drinking a lot more.\u00a0\u00a0She wakes up at night to drink. She literally will go to the bathroom before dinner and then wet her pants during dinner (and three year olds don't stay at the table long).\u00a0\u00a0She seems to be producing excess urine and goes through 5-6 outfits a day and sometimes wetting her pants 5 minutes after using the bathroom. It seems out of her control.\u00a0\u00a0She is cranky and irritable too.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a possibility that she could have diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I know of no family history but we do have a history of auto-immune, thyroid and pernicious anemia from both sides.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any suggestions.",
