    "question": "Hi, its my first post in medhelp, i hope its the right section.My father has recently been diagnosed with severe fatty liver yesterday, after he went for a check up.He previously had heart rhythm issues and 80% chance of a heart attack.he took meds like aspirin, and had to go for a follow up check to see if the meds were damaging his liver, when his doc confirmed this fatty liver problem. If im not wrong, there is no cirrhosis of the liver yet.May i ask if there is any way to treat FL at this stage? He has started to cut down on foods like internal organs and the sort, but im afraid that the problem will worsen.Also, he told me that FLD is heredity, so will i get it too? ( im 15) . If so, what can i do?",
