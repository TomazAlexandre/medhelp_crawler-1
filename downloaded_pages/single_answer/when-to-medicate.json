            "answer": "I agree with your endo and in some cases have used methimazole to see if normalizing the TSH consistently makes a difference in your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0This situation does not require methimazole, but in select cases (ie, symptoms) we sometimes try it.You seem to have autoimmune issues - would not be surprised if the diabetes is late-onset Type I and not Type II -- consider GAD and islet cell antibody testing - particularly w/ your low weigh (not typical for type II).",

    "question": "Dear Dr. Lupo,I have had borderline TSH levels for the past year, however, I am totally symptomatic for an over active thyroid problem.\u00a0\u00a0My levels have vacillated between .25 and .37.\u00a0\u00a0My lab's normal range for TSH is .40-4.00.\u00a0\u00a0I have had all the other thyroid tests done, Free T, T3 and T4 tests, the iodine scans, the antidody tests etc.\u00a0\u00a0Those were all within normal range.\u00a0\u00a0I suffer from increased anxiety symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia by a Rheumatologist and I have all the typical symptoms of it.\u00a0\u00a0I am a thin type 2 diabetic at 39 years old (diagnosed at 37 after 3xs insulin dependent gestational diabeties).\u00a0\u00a0I have positive ANA tests, homogeneous in pattern , with a titer of 1:160, and a positive raji cell assay test but all other antibody type tests are all nonspecific so there is nothing to treat but the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I have recently been struggling with severe hot flashes and night sweats.\u00a0\u00a0I wake up several times a night in a hot flash with a rapid heart rate.\u00a0\u00a0My endo wants me to try methimizole, however, I am reluctant due to long history of sensitivity to most meds.\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms are terrible but my fear of side effects is worse.\u00a0\u00a0Would you prescribe a trial of meds based upon my test results?\u00a0\u00a0My endo stated that some people hover in the borderline range and some are symptomatic and others are not.\u00a0\u00a0She believes the only way to confirm if it's my thyroid is a trial of meds.Thank you in advance for your answer.",
