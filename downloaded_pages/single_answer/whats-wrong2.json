            "answer": "HiThanks for writing.Your condition looks like Alopecia Areata. I understand it came back again three years after your son was born. As you are also gaining weight you should rule out diabetes and hypothyroidism. These two disorders can cause hair loss. A very simple reason is anemia and Vitamin B-5 deficiency which can be overcome by over the counter supplements.Have faith! Get insured, if possible. Otherwise take tests to rule out diabetes and thyroid problem. Dandruff in hair too can cause hair fall.It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining and a detailed medical history. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted.",
