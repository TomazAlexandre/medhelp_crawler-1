    "question": "I had a brain MRI that showed many mm sized lesions in the white matter of my brain.\u00a0\u00a0The suggested diagnoses were MS, and microvascular disease.I have excellent blood pressure, cholesterol, no diabetes, homosysteine level excellent, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I am 46 years old, and somewhat overweight, due to reduced activity because of tremors, fatigue, dizziness, lack of balance, and pain from a herniated lumbar disc.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sedentary, just not up to my usual level of activity since February when neurological symptoms developed.I have been to three neurologist's, and all seem to lean toward small vessel ischemic disease, as my lesions do not fit the textbook distribution of MS lesions.\u00a0\u00a0The last, an MS Specialist, suggested that my heart arrhythmias could be throwing small clots, basically that I have been having small strokes.\u00a0\u00a0When asked if my symptoms could be attributed to that, she decided to send me for more tests, including a MRA of my neck and brain.I had PSVT, which an ablation in 2003 pretty much took care of.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I have felt some flutters, and wore a heart monitor.\u00a0\u00a0It showed a few PACs, a few PVCs, and a mild sinus tachycardia.My question is:\u00a0\u00a0Can these relatively benign arrhythmias cause \"mini strokes\", leaving many, many small lesions in the white matter of my brain?\u00a0\u00a0Could tremors and an intense occipital headache have been caused by an ischemic event that didn't show up on an MRI two weeks later, unless you count one of a number of\u00a0\u00a0small lesion in the white matter?I have so many more questions, but I'm not even sure if I chose the correct forum to be asking the questions that I have.\u00a0\u00a0OK, one more, if I do have this, how is it treated, since I already have all the lifestyle changes down, except for losing a few pounds?Thanks for listening,Kathy",
