            "answer": "Welcome to the medhelp forum. Well you could be having cervical spondylosis causing the neck and the arm sensation. Intervertebral disc degeneration could cause nerve irritation, entrapment leading to tingling and numbness of the affected side arm.Post low back surgery ( laminectomy/ discectomy) there could be some damage to the left\u00a0\u00a0lumbar nerve roots during removal of screws. Rule out diabetes mellitus, vitamin deficiencies B12 and folate.Certain autoimmune diseases need to be considered like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis or Guillain barre syndrome as these can involve peripheral nerves leading to these symptoms.Consult your neurosurgeon for a re check MRI back if need be after a clinical examination.Take care and keep me posted.",
