Nerve compression in the lower and upper back can also result in pain in the hips and buttocks and lower abdomen.This requires further evaluation. Please get yourself checked for diabetes, B12 deficiency, and nerve injury.Take care!",

    "question": "Doctors. I wanted your opinion about a theory I have regarding several possible mis-diagnoses. I have had intermittent lower right quadrant pain for many years (at least 15) and have had four admissions for ?appendicitis, which resulted in three laporoscopies (NAD). The fourth admission (2 wks ago) resulted in an appendicectomy, which was mostly at my request, but was found to be normal. I was exhibiting all the physical signs of appendicitis but no clinical signs with blood tests, x rays, USS.3 yrs ago, I started to have acute abdominal pain in line with ovulation and menstruation (kept a pain diary) to the extent that I was admitted for laporoscopy. This was normal, but as micro-endometriosis could not be ruled out, I was treated with hormone suppression therapy for three months. This caused the pain to stop completely. I went on to have a bilateral salphingo-oophrectomy and uterectomy. I have not had pain since.However, since my recent appendicetomy, I have had residual pain in the region of my right hip/buttock and my whole lower right quadrant is too sore and tender to touch.My theory is that I have some neuralgia or neuropathy which is causing this pain, and as all my findings have been fairly normal, this may have mimicked the other diagnoses.I wanted to know if you thought this a possibility, and what I need to ask for to try and get a correct diagnosis.I have hypothyroidism treated with liothyronine (40mcg daily) and controlled mild asthma (ventolin/becotide PRN) and I take HRT (hormonin).Can you help?Thanking you in advance,Elsie",
