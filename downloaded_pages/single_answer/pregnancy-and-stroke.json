            "answer": "Hi, stroke may not cause problems with conception, so please don\u2019t worry. If there is residual paralysis, it may cause problems with labor. And about PCOD, don\u2019t worry as the commonest cause for irregular menstruation and anovulatory (eggless) cycles is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, where in due to hormonal irregularities the person has symptoms of irregular menstruation, weight gain, insulin resistance (diabetes) and excess androgenic activity causing facial hair. But the good news is that with medication the anovulatory cycles can be made ovulatory (with eggs) and the periods will also be regularized. And have your husband\u2019s semen analyzed. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helped and Do Take Care.",
