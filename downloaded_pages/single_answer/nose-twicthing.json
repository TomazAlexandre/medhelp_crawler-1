            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are wearing a nose ring, then it can be an allergic reaction to that. Low calcium and hypoparathyroidism could be the other causes. Vit B and iron deficiency too should be looked into. Undiagnosed diabetes could be another possibility. Alternatively hypoglycemia too can cause tingling and twitching. Dehydration and electrolyte (sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium) imbalance too could be a cause. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss this with your doctor. A few blood tests to rule out the above mentioned conditions may be needed. At times kidney and liver function tests are required if direct tests for the above do not yield any results. You may also need to take an allergy test.Hope this helps. Take care!",
