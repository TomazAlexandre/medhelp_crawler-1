            "answer": "Hi,If the case is a typical pneumonia, there should be some improvement noted within the first 3 to 4 days. If there are significant co-morbid diseases such as an uncontrolled diabetes, the recovery may be longer, or may not happen at all. If it is more than a week now, then the diagnosis was incorrect or the antibiotics may have been delivered intravenously. It would be best to consult a doctor and consider hospitalization if it is really pneumonia. Stay positive.",
