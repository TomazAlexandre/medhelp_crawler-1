            "answer": "This is a complicated problem since it involves both the urinary and digestive tract.The increased defecation may be solved by placing your dog on a low residue diet available from your veterinarian.\u00a0\u00a0Since he is a growing puppy you should not limit his food too much.\u00a0\u00a0If he has been neutered he could eat once or twice daily.\u00a0\u00a0No additional snacks should be given until the bowel stabilizes.\u00a0\u00a0A probiotic and digestive enzymes may also help.As far as the urinary problem is concerned I recommended that you have a urinalysis performed to check for a urinary tract infection, diabetes, or, other abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0At least start there.\u00a0\u00a0Additional tests may be necessary to check for kidney function abnormalities,\u00a0\u00a0hormonal problems such as Addison's disease, and others problems.",

    "question": "My jack russell, is about 10 months old, and he drinks alot of water, he pees alot, and he poops alot, i have tried only feeding him in the evening, but we leave water out for him? we have tried potty training but are not home alot, we both work so its hard to do. we have taken him to the vet regulary, but I just wonder should i pick up the water in the day time when we are not home to see if that helps so he doesnt pee so much, we only feed him once a day but he poops like 3 or 4 times a day, it seems like the less we feed him the more he poops, i dont know what else to do should do the kennel training, and see if that works and not put food or water in it in the daytime>?? and should i keep feeding him in the evening or morning??",
