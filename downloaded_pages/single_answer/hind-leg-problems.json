    "question": "My 10 year old Schnauzer has diabetes and cushings.\u00a0\u00a0Her diabetes is fairly regulated and\u00a0\u00a0is on 60 mg of trilostane which the vet is shortly going to change to 30 mg twice a day instead of the 60 once a day.\u00a0\u00a0In the last week she has displayed symtoms of weakness/slight loss of control of hind legs. It is not constant but happens off and on during the day.\u00a0\u00a0She started this last weekend and we didn't see it for a week and it started\u00a0\u00a0again this weekend.\u00a0\u00a0 It is not due to high or low blood sugar. We had that checked.Do you have any advise as to what this could possibly be?\u00a0\u00a0She doesn't seem to be in pain and otherwise is able to go up and down the stairs and jump on furniture.Thanks",
