            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The symptom described by you could be due to neuropathy. It is a disorder of the nerves which causes numbness, tingling, unusual sensations and sometimes pain. Small fiber sensory neuropathy (SFSN) is a disorder in which only the small sensory cutaneous nerves are affected and is often due to diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism (i.e. early or pre-diabetic state) and may progress to typical diabetic polyneuropathy. Other causes like vitamin deficiencies, alcohol consumption and certain medications can cause neuropathy. You may need to consult your primary care physician to detect the cause.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "So I wasn't exactly sure where to post this but basically I've been getting stabbing pains in my left wrist -9 out of 10 on pain, It doesn't appear to happen at any certain time, I sometimes just get it when I'm lying down in bed. I've also been getting these pulsating headaches generally once a week on the right hand side of my forehead, shakey legs, and my feet and hands are noticeably colder than the rest of my body-nearly a gradual drop in temperature from my knees down and the only thing that heats them is a hot water bottle, it seems that any movement just takes the heat gained by this out of them. My hands just\u00a0\u00a0can't be kept warm either. I also have tmj, neck and back pain which I'm pretty sure is because of the tmj and chest pain likely to be from surgery for a heart arrhythmia. Any ideas or experiences welcome!",
