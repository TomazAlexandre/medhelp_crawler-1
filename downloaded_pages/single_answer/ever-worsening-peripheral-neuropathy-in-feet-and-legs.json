            "answer": "Nutritional deficiencies\u00a0\u00a0can cause neuropathy.Are you taking a good B complex?My feet were numb for six weeks, and when I took B vitamins they improved the next day!My doc refused to prescribe B12 injections, so I tried several sublingual B12 supplements.The one that helped only took a couple hours to work, and relieved the aching pain in my lower legs.I was shocked at this, as I was trying B12 for fatigue and did not realize that the leg pain was neuropathy.If you do a search at iHerb.com for sublingual B12, you can read reviews and see what results people are getting.Methylcobalamine is the one you should look for.If that doesn't help, read \"Pain Free 1-2-3\" by Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum.He has book notes on his website.http://www.endfatigue.com/book_notes/Pf123_book_notes_overview.htmlRead the reviews for this book:Could It Be B12?: An Epidemic of Misdiagnoseshttp://www.amazon.com/Could-It-Be-B12-Misdiagnoses/dp/1884995691/There are also a number of ointments and creams that can numb the pain.Carol",

    "question": "Seven years ago I was diagnosed with non diabetes, peripheral neuropathy in my feet. I was told there was no cure and it would only get worse in time. The tingling and cramping now extend up to my knees. Is there any medical breakthough on the horizon? Is there anything I can do?Regards.",
