            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum! I am sorry to hear about your son.I think your son could be suffering either from diabetes insipidus (DI) or diabetes mellitus (DM) or other endocrine problems. Both DI and DM cause increased drinking due to increased thirst. In DM the nerve endings are sensitive. Many a times other problems like a tumor in brain causes walking problems and severe headaches. Eczema too is common in DM.I know and understand, what I am saying is frightening. Also since I have not examined hime, I am not sure that I am on the right track. However there is no harm in discussing this with his pediatrician and get him investigated.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My 2 1/2 yr. old son has been complaining of pain when I touch him. He cries when I brush his teeth, and tells me it hurts when I rub lotion on him after his bath. He is frequently comming to me complaining of something hurting, and has had a couple of very short 1-2 min episodes where he had trouble walking. The only thing I could think of that would hurt his skin is eczema, which is why I have to put the lotion on after bath time. When he was 1 1/2 we were worried about him drinking all the time. He still drinks a lot, but not excessive like he used to. These are all very vauge symptoms, but I'm really concerned with the fact that it seems like every time I touch him it hurts, and I don't like how he cries when I brush his teeth. I'm just trying to see if anyone else has experienced this, or knows what may be wrong.",
