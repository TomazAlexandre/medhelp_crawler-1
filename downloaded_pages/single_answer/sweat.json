            "answer": "Hello,What you seem to be having is facial anhidrosis(lack of sweating). It can be due to dehydration, sweat glands injury of the area, underactivity of the parasympathetic system and various other causes like diabetes, autonomic neuropathy, ectodermal dysplasia(rare inherited condition which affect the ectodermal skin layer which includes the skin, hair, teeth and nails), or supranuclear palsy.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. Treatment can be started only when the diagnosis is confirmed. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "My face does not sweat.I work out on a daily basis and everytime my face does not sweat, i get very hot and my face turns bright bright red and i feel really hot in the face. My legs and arms and basically the rest of my body does sweat i dont get it. when people ask me why my favce is so red i always make a joke and tell them that i lack sweat glans so my face just turns red to compensat. I never worried to much about it untill someone told me that that my lack of sweat was probably not a healthy thing. I notice that when im done working out that i do feel dizzy i always figured it was because my face was just so hot.Anyways if anyone has any advice to why i dont sweat and maybe some solutions i would be thankful",
