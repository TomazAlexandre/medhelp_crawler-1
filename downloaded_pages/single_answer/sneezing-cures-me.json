            "answer": "People who are over weight are more likely to have health problems. It could be that when you sneeze it's hitting a pressure point that makes you feel better (like what accupuncturista nd chiropractor do). Or it could be coincidence. If your dr is telling you that overweight people have less health problems I would suggest finding a new dr because people who are overweight are at risk for a LOT more health problems including heart problems, diabetes, thyroid issues, stomach and bowel obstrucion, breathing problems, sleep apnea, high cholesterol and many more.",
