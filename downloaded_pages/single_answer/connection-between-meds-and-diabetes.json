    "question": "Help!\u00a0\u00a0I am 46 years old and had a stroke two months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I've given up smoking and my blood pressure is under control with verapamil (not enough by itself but given as an antispasmotic for my pfo and aneurysm -birth defect- and to control previously diagnosed blood pressure) and lisinopril hctz (the new one).\u00a0\u00a0I've also been put on aggrenox twice a day as a blood thinner and simvastin as a cholesterol lowing drug although my cholesterol was not alarming.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that just having a fasting-blood test, my cholesterol is low normal (all numbers) and my sugar is over 125.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to this my sugar readings have never been over 75 even after eating (being tested 6 times a day in the hospital following my stroke convinces me that these numbers are accurate ... my readings since forever have been extremely low).\u00a0\u00a0Is there a connection between my medications and possible pancreas (or other related) disorders that would cause the raised sugar levels?\u00a0\u00a0I hate to think that one (or more) of my meds is causing me to get diabetes, and if so, then I need to change meds now.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for all imput!",
