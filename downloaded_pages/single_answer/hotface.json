            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!First get your blood pressure checked. This could be due to high blood pressure. The other possibility is clot in some blood vessel. This can also give out heat sensation without there being any temperature. Hyperthyroidism, diabetes, temporal arteritis are the other possibilities. It can also be an allergic reaction to some soap or oil etc. Hormone imbalance as seen in PCOD can also be the cause.The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Take care!",
