            "answer": "Hello,Hope you are doing well. You should aim to lose your weight slowly and steadily. Firstly rule out conditions like hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus which can lead to excessive weight gain. A person wanting to lose weight should do so in a scientific way for long term benefits. A healthy diet and regular exercise or incorporating yoga into your daily regime can help to lose weight. I suggest you to eat frequent small meals and eat more of green leafy vegetables, fruits and protein and less of fats, butter and potato etc. Drink lots of water and consume fruits rich in vitamin C as it is a fat burner. Losing 5 pounds in month is a realistic and healthy way of losing weight. Avoid eating salty fast foods, candies and cut down on at least 500 calories per day. Avoid intake of hidden calories in salad dressings, cheese, butter etc.Include fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean meats and fish. Get a diet chart made from a nutritionist. Indulge in aerobic exercises, dancing, brisk walking or jogging. This will help in burning calories faster. Avoid lift and prefer walking the stairs whenever possible. All these will definitely help you. Do keep me posted. A calculative and disciplined approach will be helpful. Hope this helps.Take care and regards!",
