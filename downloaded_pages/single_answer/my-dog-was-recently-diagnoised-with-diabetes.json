    "question": "I have a 5 year old Aussie cattle mixed with a husky.. he was just recently DX with diabetes 2/09/2013. as of right now he is UTD on shots. I am wondering if I should not give him any more shots. Brochure read do not give to unhealthy pets. What are your thoughts. I would love to seek other opinions as well as options. He is eating Evo weight managment control and is going in for his first glucosamine curve 2/18/2013. He at first also had ketones in his urine, but since he was on insulin and retested him 2 days later there were no ketones in his urine.",
