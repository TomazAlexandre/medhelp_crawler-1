            "answer": "Glad the extensive testing has not shown anything serious, but I can see how it may be frustrating not to have an answer. The C3 lesion is (I'm assuming) in the spinal cord and not a slipped disk. Its location should not be causing the hand pain, but possibly could have contributed to the burning pain in the neck. Unable to say what that could be without personally reviewing the film and examining you.The paresthesias in hands and feet could represent a peripheral neuropathy that is best evaluated by an EMG. Depending on when the last one was done, consider having a repeat EMG at a major academic or clinical center. Blood work to look for B12 deficiency, thyroid, protein abnormalities, diabetes, nutritional deficiencies, and autoimmune diseases may also be considered if not already done. Sounds like you've seen a lot of doctors, but if the problem is continuing to bother you, consider a neuromuscular specialist at an academic center for another opinion.\u00a0\u00a0As for treatment, finding and treating the underlying problem is the primary goal. Elavil and neurontin are very good medications for nerve type pain. Topamax, tegretol, tripleptal, Lamictal have also been helpful for some patients. Try splints for the hand symptoms if it's bothering you at night. Otherwise, the important thing is to try and find the cause and treat that directly. GOod luck.",

    "question": "Over two and a half years ago I began experiecing a burning sensation at the juncture of my neck & shoulder which later evolved in some numbness in my left hand.\u00a0\u00a0At that time I went to a neurologist who, upon examination thought it was a C5 or C6 issue and ordered a MRI of my neck.\u00a0\u00a0The cervical MRI showed a lesion at C3.\u00a0\u00a0A MRI of my brain came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0The spinal tap showed slightly elevated WBC.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on prednisone and was told it was either a post viral phenomena or MS.\u00a0\u00a0I got a second opinion who said that MS was a extremely remote possibility - there were no changes to the follow-up MRI scans but the C3 lesion continued to appear w/o enahancement.\u00a0\u00a0He also sent me to rheumatologist who ruled out lupus etc.My question is what should I do now?\u00a0\u00a0I continue to have a great deal of pain in my upper back/neck w/ activity (golf or lifting)and have an increased feeling of numbness in my left hand w/ activity (like typing).\u00a0\u00a0My right hand will also go numb w/ repetitive activities such as rowing.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had intermittent parsthesias in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know whether I should go see yet another doctor (I've been to orthos & thoracic surgeons as well) or if I should insist on more testing (I've had 5 cervical & thoracic MRIs in the past 2 1/2 years, complete bloodwork, EMG).\u00a0\u00a0Finally, is there anything else I should be trying in terms of therapy or anything that can help or is this something I should just deal w/?\u00a0\u00a0I'm taking Neurontin, Elavil and muscle relaxants when I golf.\u00a0\u00a0I've had trigger point injections, PT and epidural steriod injections.",
