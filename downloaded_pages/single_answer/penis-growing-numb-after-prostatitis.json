    "question": "helloover a year ago i had some kind of prostatitis or proktitis (nobody knows exactly) with some fewer, burning feeling in my penis and severe problems with defacating on the toilet...after that, numbness came up in my penis (shaft)...after some month, i developed a hernia left side, probably because of pressing on the toilet. (my rektum is quite \"lame\" since the initial infection, but no incontinence).i thought that's the reason for the lack of nerve recovery, but after the surgery, it became even worse (not immediatly, after 3 weeks):now my penis head is nearly completely numb too.last saturday i suddenly had the feeling that some nerve in my hip went over some obstacle and i felt immediate numbness on the right side of my penis too...it's still there, and more disturbing than ever.status: lame rektum, numbness in penis head and right side, orgasm nearly impossible, erection is no problem at all, but it's not worth it...please help, i'm going mad whith that!i'm taking wellbutrin (bupropion hydro chloride), euthyrox (thymus overfunction), now i got buscopan (hyoscin n butylbromid, from my urologist,who thinks i have tensions...nothing better).ruled out: prostata, infections (herpes, hiv, chlamydia), diabetes, back (mrt)what could it be? does it have a chance to recover after that long time?thank you very much!!",
