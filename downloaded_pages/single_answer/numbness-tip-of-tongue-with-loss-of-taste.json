            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since you have numbness lower lip and tip of tongue and extreme thirst, the first possibility to be ruled out is diabetes. Secondly stop the protein drink for sometime and see if it helps. At times this is due to vitamin or iron deficiency, hence take a supplement and see. The other possibility is contact dermatitis, which is basically an allergy to something that cones in contact with your lips and tongue. Hope this helps. Take care!",
