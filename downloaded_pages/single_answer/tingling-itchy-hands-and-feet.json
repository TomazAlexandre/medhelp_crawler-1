            "answer": "sounds to me like neuropathy and blood sugar may not be out of sorts and still could be neuropathy since neuropathy is caused by other diseases too, you should type in the word and see if something else could be your problem by symptoms as well and see your doctor about other possabilities. I have heard sciatica, lime disease, aids and many other events like long exposure to aluminum and other things like chemicals can cause it too, a doctor needs to ask you more questions perhaps to see if there is something else that could be causing it that you might not even be aware of. I have it supposedly because of diabetes since it was really bad at the time of diagnosis of diabetes but then again I have had very sensitive feet and legs since I was a kid so not really sure what is causing it, I am sure the diabetes is making it worse now but they are finding out more and more causes of nerve diseases. Sad thing for me is I handled aluminum trays for many years at a place I worked at too so there are many counts against me for this silent but painful problem.",
