Insulin test - To diagnose or evaluate low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).2. C-Peptide - C-peptide can be used to help determine how much insulin the patient\u2019s pancreas is still producing.3. Anti-insulin antibodies (GAD-65) - This test may be performed if you have, or are at risk for type 1 diabetes. It also may be done if you appear to have an allergic response to insulin, or if insulin no longer seems to control your type 2 diabetes.Never heard of an ultrasound being used to test for diabetes.",

    "question": "Good Day Doctor ,The question I have for you is this ,should all newly diagnosed Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetics have a consult for an Sonogram on the pancreas to ensure its truly a pancreas problem versus a pancreatic type disease causing the insulin issues. This i\u00a0\u00a0think would be critical in those patients who have an immidiate family history of Pancreatic Cancer or other Pancreatic diseases.Thanks Doc.....This discussion is related to/posts/show/705564.",
