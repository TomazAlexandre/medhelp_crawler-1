            "answer": "Hi there!Though motility issues may develop with long term diabetes, these may be manageable on medications and tube feeding may not be required. Also other possibilities such as GI infections/ inflammations etc may also need to be considered before deciding on a management plan. It is best advised to consult a gastroenterologist at this time for a detailed evaluation and suggestion of an appropriate management plan.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
