            "answer": "Dogs do not tolerate steroids nearly as well as cats do, and they come with quite a list of possible side effects.\u00a0\u00a0One that show up fairly frequently in dogs is diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Normally a short course of steroids will not cause any problems, but every dog's system is different and they all react differently to meds.\u00a0\u00a0Just like with people, what doesn't seem to affect one dog in the least can throw another dog into a complete tailspin.A large increase in water intake, especially when coupled with weight loss, is one of the main red flags for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A simple blood test can tell your vet whether or not your dog is diabetic, and it can then go on to lead a normal life with medication and/or a carefully controlled diet.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, there is always also a chance that it isn't diabetes and it is merely something that just happened.I would give the vet a call back and tell them that you would like to bring him in to have them give him the once-over to make sure he is OK because of the symptoms he is now having.\u00a0\u00a0Please post back and let us know how he makes out and what the vet says.Ghilly",

    "question": "My dog was just recently ill, had a sinus problem. took him to the vet, she gave me Clavamox(antibiotic) and Temaril (steroid) to give him. After a few days noticed he was throwing up. Called vet and she said to stop thedrugs and see how he is. His sisuses seemed to clear up. But since then he is drinking much more urinating alot and always tired and has lost about 5 lbs. And he's a Lasa Apsa (don't know how to spell that) and that's a small dog so thats a lot of wieght to loose. Still seems to be eating ok maybe not quit as much. Please help if you can.Thank you.",
