            "answer": "How are you? How is your husband? It is good that the ultrasound of his kidneys is fine. Does he have diabetes or hypertension? Creatinine is a waste product that the kidneys normally remove from the blood. If the kidneys are not working properly, these substances may build up in the blood. Elevated creatinine may indicate decreased kidney function. Additional tests to evaluate the kidney function better may include glomerular filtration rate as well as urine tests to check for protein or red blood cells.\u00a0\u00a0Healthy kidneys measure potassium in your blood and remove excess amounts. Diseased kidneys may fail to remove excess potassium. With very poor kidney function, high potassium levels can affect the heart rhythm. Another problem that may be associated with kidney failure is too much cholesterol in the blood which may be due to a high-fat diet.This link may be of help: http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/yourkidneys/#6Take care and keep us posted.",
