            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I would suggest you get your creatine kinase level checked. You could be having some kind of a muscle problem that is resulting in cramps and cysts. Compression of cervical spinal nerves can be another cause. Please consult a neurologist regarding that. Metabolic disorders affecting mineral metabolism such as diabetes can also be a cause. If serum electrolytes have not been checked then get those done too. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
