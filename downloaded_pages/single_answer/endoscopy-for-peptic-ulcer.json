            "answer": "Hello,There is definitely significant loss of weight in a very short span of time. Diabetes mellitus can lead to weight loss very quickly. Inadequate food intake, malabsorption, increased metabolism, or a combination of factors can lead to unexplained weight loss. Losing blood can make you loose weight but not so significantly.Hyperthroidism, leukaemia, lymphomas, Addison\u2019s disease, gut hormone tumors, gastrointestinal fistulas all can lead to weight loss. Why had you undergone endoscopy? What are the other symptoms you have been suffering from? It is very important that you get evaluated for above mentioned possibilities. A clinical examination is very important.Do keep us posted.Best of luck and regards!",
