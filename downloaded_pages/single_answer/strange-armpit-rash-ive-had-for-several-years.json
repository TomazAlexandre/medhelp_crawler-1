            "answer": "Hello,Erythrasma is one possibility which needs to be ruled out in your case. The typical appearance is well-demarcated, brown-red macular patches. The skin has a wrinkled appearance with fine scales.It has to be differentiated from contact dermatitis,psoriasis,sweat dermatitis and fungal infections which may mimic it.Wood lamp examination and gram staining are the tests for its diagnosis.So nothing can be confirmed without examination. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "For the past several months I've had this rash in my armpit. It started as just a couple of tiny brown spots and now it's taken over the entire armpit. It's only in one armpit and the spots appear to be centered around hair follicles. I thought it was fungus, so I treated it with clotrimazole for a month, but it had no effect. Then I tried to use aloe vera as I thought it was a skin yeast infection, but still no effect. I've tried scrubbing it with antibacterial soap for several days, but still no effect. I just want it to go away. Can anyone offer any suggestions? My general practitioner didn't know what it was, either, and I don't have the money to see a dermatologist.I'm a 31-year-old Latino and my weight is 269 (down from 317 and still dropping) and I have type 2 diabetes. I exercise every single day for an hour and a half and I eat sensibly. I just want it to go away. :( Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",
