It just is.If you get diabetes then you are probably overweight drinking sugar and eating processed foods. Veggies and no soda and walk an hour a day.That is the prescription for diabetes. Get skinny.Sorry to be blunt, but that is the truth. If you are thin, sorry to give you the advice but still thin people get diabetes although less likely.If you wonder why your heart and blood pressure gets up and goes. It's tied to the fight or flight response of the brain. Meaning your very thoughts can cause high blood pressure and increased heart rate trhough a mechanism of adrenaline. Adrenaline is a beta andrenergic antagonist. It turns the key in the body. Over time, with stress, it can cause a host of problems.THrow ina\u00a0\u00a0North American diet of flour, pasta and all the processed stuff.. Disease hapens",

    "question": "I am at a high risk for thrombosis with the \"V\" factor if any one knows what that means. Im learning. Mine is a hereditary factor. I am always cautious with my health because I have a lot of cronic illnesses and disabilities. I've been trying to stay off of the heavy duty narcotics, and trust me I've tried many. Heres some of the prescriptions I'm on...AMBIEN CR, CLARITIN, GLUCOPHAGE, SINGULAR, NASACORT, NEXIUM, WELCOL, ZETIA, ELMIRON,VOLTAREN, BACLOFEN, SUCRALFATE, DETROL LA,\u00a0\u00a0okay thats enough. I'm only 44 yrs old and I have neuropathy, osteoarthritis, stenosis, 2 herniated discs in the lumbar area, 2 herniated discs in the cervical spine with a pinched nerve with neuropathy. I also have carpal tunnel in both wrists, sleep apnea, high cholesterol, diabetes, sinus, allergies, acid reflux disease, hyper active reflexes, interstitial cystitus (IC) or painful bladder syndrome, and least, and so far the last, depression, right?! I know I'm not the only one who's thinking could it be one or some of my med's causing my heart rate to escallate even sometimes causing my blood pressures to go up with it, but not everytime. I suggested to one of my doctors to examine the Adrenal Cortex. I'm still waiting on the results. If this test comes up negative, I don't know what else my doctor may want to do from here. There could be so many things causing my problem, and I like my doctor, but I dont believe that he and I are on the same page. I'm really concerned as you can imagine. I is it the diabetes, could it be thrombosis (blood clot disease), more importatnly is it my heart?\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has any thoughts, any simularities, I'm open to any suggestions at this point in my life. And if you have read all of this, thank you. I feel if I dont mention my history that you cant get a good picture of what I'm dealing with, or the desperation I feel. Again, thanks, and I hope to here from someone soon.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/253343\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/253343</a>.",
