            "answer": "When you work out you build lean muscle and that weights more than fat, so if you has high amount of lean muscle it will weigh heavier than a body with less muscle and more fat. Suggest just using a tape measure and get rid of your weight scale. From your question it seems that you have issues with carbohydrates. Some people do well with a higher protein intake to a lower carbohydrate ratio then the normal 60% carbs, 30% protein, 10% fat. Suggest eating more low fat protein sources with lower carbohydrates amounts. Hope that helped you.",
