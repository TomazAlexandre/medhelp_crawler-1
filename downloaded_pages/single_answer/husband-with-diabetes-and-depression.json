            "answer": "Hi,This is quite complicated and I think it best that you and your husband speak to his primary care physician as well as his mental health counsellor. Diabetes can be managed but does take work, and a great deal of work for some. Your husband may feel that he cannot take care of his own health as well as that of little ones. He may have concerns about his longevity, about his mood stablity etc. There are\u00a0\u00a0likely many things on his mind, none of which I can truly help with adequately on this forum. So please continue speaking with him and suggest a family meeting of sorts with his physicians/cousellors to help sort everything out.take care.",
