            "answer": "Hi Tim,1) I have read a lot of the stats regarding the increased risk of stroke with afib.\u00a0\u00a0Does this only apply to the people with symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0In other words, if my meds are eliminating the symptoms, are my risks of a stroke eliminated?Not true.\u00a0\u00a0Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of stroke regardless of symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The absolute risk increases depending on the number of risk factors you have: hypertension, heart failure, age >75, diabetes and history of stroke or TIA (mini stroke with symptoms lasting <24 hours).\u00a0\u00a0Other things may affect the risk like valvular heart disease if it is significant and associated with enlarging atrial chambers.Even with no risk factors, you risk is low.\u00a0\u00a0If you have none or one of the listed risk factors, aspirin is appropriate for blood thinning.\u00a0\u00a0History of stroke means that you should be on coumadin.2) Are there any detrimental effects of taking a beta blocker long term (since I am only 30)?There is a slight increased risk of developing diabetes.3) I am used to exercising at a pretty high intensity (HR up to 170 when pushing, resintg HR around 65).\u00a0\u00a0I am obviously feeling fatigued from the beta blocker, so I probably will be limited with the exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I also don't want to cause any problems by exercising too hard (I haven't exercised since having the symptoms).\u00a0\u00a0Should I avoid \"pushing it\"?\u00a0\u00a0Are there any risks involved with pushing it really hard?If you have no other medical conditions, there shouldn't be an significant increased risk other than the possibility of going into afib, if this proves to provoke it for you.there are other medications that possibly eliminate your atrial fibrillation.\u00a0\u00a0an electrophysiogist will be able to help you with this if you have significant symptoms from your atrial fibrillation.I hope this helps. thanks for posting.",

    "question": "I am a 30 year old male who was recently diagnosed with afib.\u00a0\u00a0I had been having SVT with palpitations about 30 times a day (each lasting about 10 seconds) for about 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0The doc didn't intially see the fibrillation in my EKG (monitored with electrodes that I activate when I have a bout), but eventually saw it a couple of times.\u00a0\u00a0I am now on a beta blocker (Metoprolol 25mg a day) and asprin.\u00a0\u00a0I have only had two of these bouts of palpitations over the past 48 hours (big improvement).I have a few questions for which I can't seem to find answers:1) I have read a lot of the stats regarding the increased risk of stroke with afib.\u00a0\u00a0Does this only apply to the people with symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0In other words, if my meds are eliminating the symptoms, are my risks of a stroke eliminated?2) Are there any detrimental effects of taking a beta blocker long term (since I am only 30)?3) I am used to exercising at a pretty high intensity (HR up to 170 when pushing, resintg HR around 65).\u00a0\u00a0I am obviously feeling fatigued from the beta blocker, so I probably will be limited with the exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I also don't want to cause any problems by exercising too hard (I haven't exercised since having the symptoms).\u00a0\u00a0Should I avoid \"pushing it\"?\u00a0\u00a0Are there any risks involved with pushing it really hard?Thanks!",
