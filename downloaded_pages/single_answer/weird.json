    "question": "My husband was diagnosed with a 2cm thyroid nodule on the right side. He had an ultra sound, a blood test, a thyroid scan and today he was scheduled for a needle biopsy. However when he went to do the test in the hospital as scheduled by his doctor, the radiologist said that he is not going to do the biopsy because he can't find any nodule! how can this happen, and what was the 2cm thing they saw and then disappeared. One more detail i am not sure if it is relevant. At one time at the doctor's office his diabetes came up high but we monitored his diabetes later and it came out normal. Can you please help me out and tell me what do you think is going on?thank you",
