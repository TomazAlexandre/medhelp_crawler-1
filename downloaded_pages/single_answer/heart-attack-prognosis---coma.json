    "question": "My 82 year old mother in law has had a few minor heart attacks and strokes the past year gradually leaving her unable to feed or dress herself without aide due to difficulty moving her hands. She was recently confined to a wheel chair due to frequent falls using a walker. Two days ago, she had another heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0This one is different.\u00a0\u00a0She can open her eyes to voices but doesn't appear to focus. My husband describes it as if it is blank behind her eyes. She has no speech and only generalized withdrawal to pain.\u00a0\u00a0Her entire right side is paralyzed. She keeps going back and forth between breathing ok to taking shallow breaths and is experiencing frequent arythmias. She has a living will and is DNR.\u00a0\u00a0In her living will, she was not sure about feeding so for the time being, my husband and sister in law have allowed a\u00a0\u00a0 nasal tube but no permanent feeding tube.\u00a0\u00a0Could she remain like this for an extended period of time?\u00a0\u00a0How do you really know if she is aware of how badly off she is. Even before this latest event, she felt that she had outlived her body when she couldn't even dress herself and was confined to a wheel chair.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist is not holding out hope when it comes to recovering any quality of life.\u00a0\u00a0Knowing how she felt about quality of life, it is horrible to think that she may go on like this for any period of time, especially if she does have any awareness of her condition.\u00a0\u00a0Any information would be appreciated.",
