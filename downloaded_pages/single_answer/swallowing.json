            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The common causes for problems in swallowing are enlarged tonsils and GERD. Gastro esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is caused due to reflux of acid from the stomach into the esophagus. It could also be due to neuropathy. Diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy and affect the digestive system. It could sometimes be due to disorders of the esophagus. You will need to consult your primary care physician who will examine your throat and may ask for some tests like barium swallow or endoscopy to determine the cause for your symptoms.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
