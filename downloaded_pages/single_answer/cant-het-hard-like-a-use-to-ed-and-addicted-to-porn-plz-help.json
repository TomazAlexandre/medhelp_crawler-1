            "answer": "Hi, hormonal studies for testosterone and neurological assessments, which are done by nerve conduction studies help detect causes for erectile dysfunction. Certain medications for high blood pressure and antidepressants can cause erectile dysfunction. Long term use of alcohol and illicit drugs can cause erectile dysfunction. Diabetes Mellitus is known to cause erectile dysfunction. Trauma, surgery and radiation is known to affect erectile function. Anxiety, stress, guilt and worry can further aggravate this problem. Please discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time. If no cause is detected professional counseling may help. Regards.",

    "question": "I did make a post on here before But I will post a new one on here. Ok I'm 25 years old and I have been looking at porn and MB since I was 13 if I remember right and I never had any problems. I have had a one night stand, no problems at all. Even talking with my late Girlfriend who would have been my wife would get me hard, even just looking at her would. (and after what happened I have been on some depression meds, still am kind of, not strong ones.) And it had side affects.When I was with my ex girlfriend kissing her, holding her hand, her leaning on me as we watched tv would get me hard.But putting a condom on it would go soft, and I would *** fast. (before I would mb all of the time I would stay hard and would be able to keep going.) I would also get hard and it would just go soft, which made her and me feel like crap.I want to know is this happening to me because of the meds? Or is it because I'm addicted to porn and mb all of the time?, I would do that 5 or so times a day.Is this just in my head? Is it because of the meds and the over use of porn and MB? And its hard not wanting to MB anytime you see a beautiful women ect.I just need help and I just hope I'm not the only going through this. It just makes me scared to ask a women out that I like because this might happen.",
