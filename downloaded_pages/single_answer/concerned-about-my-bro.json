            "answer": "Hi,I understand that you said that your brother is overweight. what is his current weight? You may probably know that being overweight is a significant risk factor for many disorders such as Diabetes and Coronary artery disease.The 'memory foam' that you describe is called as Pitting edema and is caused by either systemic or local causes. The most common systemic diseases associated with edema involve the heart, liver, and kidneys. In these diseases, edema occurs primarily because of the body's retention of too much salt (sodium chloride). The excess salt causes the body to retain water. This water then leaks into the interstitial tissue spaces, where it appears as edema.The most common local conditions that cause edema are varicose veins and thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the veins) of the deep veins of the legs. These conditions can cause inadequate pumping of the blood by the veins (venous insufficiency). The resulting increased back-pressure in the veins forces fluid stay in the extremities (especially the ankles and feet). The excess fluid then leaks into the interstitial tissue spaces, causing edema.This therefore needs examination by a physician and perhaps some tests too. let me know if you need any more help.",
