            "answer": "The problems don't sound like typical issues connected to diabetes. If I were you, I would talk to my endocrinologist about testing all hormone levels, for the endocrine system is very complex. You may want to ask him or her to have all endocrine glands function checked, pituitary, adrenal, thyroid, etc. Rather than just asking to have testosterone, you would be better off finding out the root cause of any low hormones. Autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes can cause the body to attack other endocrine glands in addition to the pancreas. Tumors can also cause glands to malfunction. All should be checked out, in my opinion. I have read that low body hair can be a symptom of pituitary tumor, so you really should be checked to see if all endocrine glands are working properly.",
