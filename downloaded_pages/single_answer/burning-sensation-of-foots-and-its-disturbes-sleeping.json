            "answer": "Hi,Your symptoms are\u00a0\u00a0likely related to your diabetes, as you know. Even though you have not been diagnosed very long, there seems to have been some damage done in those years and possibly preceeding your diagnosis. Both the sensations on your feet and the erectile dysfunction are from diabetic neuropathy, as well as some function of vascular impairment. The best thing for both issues is to get your blood sugars controlled as soon as possible. If your blood sugars are still not at goal, I suggest speaking with your physician soon to make changes in your regimen. Do not allow months to pass in between changes because then you allow high sugars to do damage .There are also several medications on the market that can help both issues. Painful neuropathy is often treated with Neurontin, Lyrica or Cymbalta, as well as some over the counter creams like Capsaicin. There are other medications used, like Elavil, that have been shown to be helpful as well. Speak to your doc about those to start.The erectile dysfunction can be helped by better glucose control as well. In addition, medications like Viagra are also helpful. If the main problem however is premature ejaculation, it may not be from the diabetes(diabetes mainly causes erection problems), and perhaps a urologist may be of better assistance in this regard.Take care of yourself.",
