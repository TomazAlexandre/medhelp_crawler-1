            "answer": "Hi there!Well, ED may occur both due to low testosterone levels and uncontrolled diabetes. This is likely to improve after the two medical conditions stabilize. Other possible causes of ED include psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors along with the prescribed medications. Hopefully the situation should improve with appropriate treatment.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
