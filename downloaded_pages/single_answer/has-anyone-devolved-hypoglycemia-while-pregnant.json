            "answer": "I have always had hypoglycemia. It's not hard to deal with but once your sugar drops it feels awful. It's just like diabetes kinda. Don't eat a lot of junk food. I know a lot of people say stay away from carbs but I have never had an issues with the carbs like pasta and breads. Don't over do it but normally I can eat a meal of that and be ok. It's the sugar and soda that gets me. The best way if your blood sugar bottoms to get it back up is orange juice.I always sit down and slowly drink a big glass of it. Once I start to feel better I go and fix me something to eat. Just snack and try to eat healthy and you will be fine. It can be scarey when it drops but it is very manageable. I habe had several cases this pregnancy with it dropping but it's because I didn't eat for several hours in between meals. Snack or eat every 3 hours. My family makes fun of me for eating all the time but it's what has helped me this long :)",
