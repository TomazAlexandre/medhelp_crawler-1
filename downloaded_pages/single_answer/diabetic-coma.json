    "question": "How high does blood glucose need to be to cause diabetic coma?\u00a0\u00a0If someone goes on vacation and eats and drinks whatever they like and come back to have glucose reading at over 700, just how bad is that.\u00a0\u00a0Three days later it slowly returned to 130.\u00a0\u00a0I think this may finally shock him into the reality and acceptance of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He has been doing real good to keep from using insulin, he is only on metformin twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0What is the highest blood sugar reading you can get? Thank you for any response.",
