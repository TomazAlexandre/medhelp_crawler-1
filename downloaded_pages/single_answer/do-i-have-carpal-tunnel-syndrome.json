            "answer": "Hello,There are many conditions which can lead to your symptoms like a neurological or circulatory problem. Your symptoms could be suggestive of ulnar nerve entrapment or Carpal tunnel syndrome. In this condition the median nerve, which runs from the forearm into the palm of the hand becomes compressed. The underlying causes could be diabetes or arthritis .Avoid\u00a0\u00a0activities that may worsen symptoms. Immobilize the\u00a0\u00a0wrist in a splint to avoid further damage from twisting or bending. The cause of ulnar nerve entrapment is\u00a0\u00a0 swelling of the elbow, which may be due to arthritis or other medical conditions, cysts, prior fractures in the arm or bone spurs. A clinical examination and MRI findings may help. See a neurologist. Do keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",

    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0About two weeks ago my left arm started to feel sore like a pulled muscle.\u00a0\u00a0I work 8 hours a day at a desk for work and do a lot of typing and sitting in front of a keyboard.\u00a0\u00a0I also noticed that I had fallen asleep on the couch a couple of times in odd positions which probably made my arm sore.\u00a0\u00a0Well, yesterday I felt my left hand tingling like it is asleep except that I can feel something touching it.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried using IcyHot roll-on and the pain would subside, but come back again in my arm.\u00a0\u00a0I then switched to Stopain which has been much better and started taking Ibuprofen today which also has helped the pain, but it is still sore off and on throughout the day.Is it possible that I have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?",
