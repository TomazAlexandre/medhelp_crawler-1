    "question": "I am 22 years old. I have never had intercourse but 3 months ago I was with someone and he put his fingers inside of me. There was some bleeding from this. A few days later I started feeling sick, nauseous and a headache. Since then my period has been coming a few weeks late and is lighter than usual. I am still experiencing what feels like a bad sinus infection. I have some pain in my pelvic area which feels like a throbbing pain. I also have noticed abnormal hair growth on my face and breasts. A few days ago I started experiencing tingling feelings in my legs and arms. I have been to many doctors. They have done blood work to test my liver, pancreas, thyroid, and tests for diabetes. I have had CT of my abdomen and they found a small cyst on my ovary. I am very confused and can't help to think that this was caused by this occurence which happened 3 months ago because I have never been sexually active and once this happened I started experiencing all of these symptoms. I don't think I am pregnant or have an STD considering there was no penetration and I have never had sex before. Could this be a vaginal infection? Some symptoms also match with those of PCO.",
