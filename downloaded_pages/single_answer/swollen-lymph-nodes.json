            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!\u201cLymph nodes can become swollen from infection, inflammatory conditions, an abscess, or cancer. Other causes of enlarged lymph nodes are rare. By far, the most common cause of swollen lymph nodes is infection.When swelling appears suddenly and is painful, it is usually caused by injury or an infection. Enlargement that comes on gradually and painlessly may, in some cases, result from cancer or a tumor.\u201dIn your case it could be due to seborrhagic dermatitis. There is no cure as such, but it can be controlled by medicated shampoos and lotions. Lemon water rise, crusher garlic and peppercorns heated with oil and applied overnight and washed next day with mild shampoo should be tried.You say that you itch a lot. Seborrhagic dermatitis causes itch in the head area. However if you itch all over then you must look at other causes like dry skin, hypothyroidism, diabetes and allergy to soaps, shampoos etc.A tissue biopsy of the scab and underlying tissue may be required to reach a diagnosis.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!Refer: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003097.htm",
