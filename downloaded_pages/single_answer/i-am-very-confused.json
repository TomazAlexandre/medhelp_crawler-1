            "answer": "Pink,We are volunteers here and not physicians, so we can't give you a diagnosis.The symptoms you describe can be associated with uncontrolled diabetes, but only a doctor working with you & assessing complete blood work can tell you what's going on.\u00a0\u00a0Since you're aware of troublesome symptoms, I encourage you to see your doctor soon.\u00a0\u00a0If you can keep a 'log' of significant activities and how you're feeling, that can help the doctor also.It can be exhausting and emotionally draining to worry about what 'might be' going on, so please do check in with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0With an accurate diagnosis and then good training on how to care for yourself, you will likely begin to feel much better -- both physically & emotionally.If you are diagnosed with diabetes, please know you're welcome to come back here and we can also refer you to more individualized 1:1 support.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck - and do get in touch with your doc soon.",
