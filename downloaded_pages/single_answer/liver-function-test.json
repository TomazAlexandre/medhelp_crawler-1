    "question": "I recently went to the Dr.'s office for blood test. I didn't know they would be LFT's. But that was ok. They told me for my age my LFT is high. I scored 49 when I should have scored between 0 nad 33. I am worried what could this mean for me. I have had Cist on my Thyroids and in my left breast. Diabetes runs in my family so now I am really worried about what this could mean for me.",
