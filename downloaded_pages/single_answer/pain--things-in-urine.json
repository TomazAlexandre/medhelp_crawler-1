            "answer": "How are you? How long have you been diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0There might be just a urinary tract infection with your symptoms of painful urination and pain in your flank area. If your urine test and urine culture may yield positive result, your doctor will give you antibiotic for this.Another thing to consider is diabetic nephropathy. People with diabetes are at high risk for developing diabetic nephropathy. The risk increases when blood sugar levels are not controlled, blood pressure or blood cholesterol levels are high, or if the diabetic patient smokes. The only sign of kidney damage may be small amounts of protein leaking into the urine. Your doctor may perform a complete physical examination and order urine and blood tests.I hope this helps. Take care and keep us posted with the results.",

    "question": "I recently have had bouts of painful (but not burning) urination only in the morning...felt like the urine was the consistency of syrup instead of water. I collected a sample in a clean container provided by the doctor and put it in the frig until I saw him later in the day. I wanted the lab to have the first morning sample since that is when it is most painful and slow to pass. When I took it out of the frig, there was \"white-ish stuff\" stuff on the bottom of the container. The doctor didn't like the looks of it. I have some pain the in right back area--sometimes below my ribs on the side of my body, other times it is lower. I am diabetic but have lost the added weight I need to do plus I walk and my A1C is 5.6. I am also hypoglycemic. Diabetes runs in our family but I don't know of any kidney problems. What might be going on and what tests should be done? It's been almost 48 hours for the urine culture. My urine is not cloudy nor is there any odd smell.Thank you!tealady49",
