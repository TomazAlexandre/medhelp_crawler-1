            "answer": "Hey Hun,I'm sorry to hear about your troubles. Have you had a blood test done for diabetes? One of the symptoms is the frequent urgency to urinate. Also, if you are having irregular periods that could be due to PCOS (possibly) if you do or find out you have diabetes. I hope that helps, I wouldn't worry yourself to much until you know for sure what is going on. I'm sure it is frusturating for you but hang in there. =)",
