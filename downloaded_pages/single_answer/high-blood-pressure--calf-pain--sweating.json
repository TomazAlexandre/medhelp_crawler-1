            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Since you are sweating a lot, calf pain could be due to low electrolytes lie sodium, potassium, magnesium or maybe even calcium. Excessive sweating could be due to low blood sugar, anemia, diabetes, thyroid problems, hot and humid weather or some endocrine problems. Since you have high blood pressure too, please do not start electrolytes without consulting a doctor first. Also in presence of a high BP, calf pain could be due to a deep vein thrombus or clot. Please keep a record of the blood pressure until you can consult your PCP. If your blood pressure is fine you can increase water and electrolyte intake and see if the calf pain decreases.The BP is only marginally high hence may be an isolated finding.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
