            "answer": "here I am again, try whole cream in your coffee. And I think maybe you are having to much tuna, Mercury counts have been a warning in the USA. Do u like Chicken and other kins of fish? U could get them in also. Lean beef is good to, it has irom and other needed vitamins. Your salads sound great and the choice of Olive oil and Vinagar is a great choice. Your evening snack might need a bit of a change, The popcorn isn't to bad but the M&Ms :( how about celery with veggie cream cheese or some high grain fiber rich crackers with the cream cheese on them. You are doing a great job, how are ur BS's doing that is the biggest question? if it is good then don't change anything...But for weight loss I would say, change the evening snack..",

    "question": "Greetings,I already posted an initial question, and got kind advice from Strawberri. I am currently out of the USA, and won't be back home until next June. Before leaving the USA in August, I had a blood sugar reading (fasting) of 125. My PCP simply told me to get on a diet (I was sedentary and mildly overweight). I do not have access to a doctor where I am now; therefore I'm asking those of you who are experts in diabetic dietary matters to tell me if I'm doing the right thing by eating as described below:I have two cups of coffee with a small amount of 2% milk in the mornings, a lunch of nothing but shredded raw vegetables such as tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, cucumbers (when they can be found), green peppers, lettuce, etc. On that I put some olive oil, a capfull of apple cider vinegar, and a pinch of salt. That's it. At around four PM I have a pear or some other piece of fruit and a yogurt. Then in the evening a big plate full of different boiled vegetables -- turnips, carrots, cabbage, cauliflower, etc. Also I have either two hard boiled eggs or 1/2 can of tuna per day. It is true that I also have a bowl of popcorn in the evening (popped in a small amount of olive oil -- I don't have access to an air popper or microwave here), and maybe a small handful of M&Ms. As far as exercise is concerned, I try to walk ca. 1 mile a day, sometimes a bit more if I have the time.Am I doing the right thing or is there something else I can do? Or something I should change entirely?Thanks for any feedback or advice anyone can give me.",
