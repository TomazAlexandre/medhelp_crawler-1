            "answer": "Hi,All your problems could possibly be stress related and that can result in frequent micturition. I think initially you need to focus on this and I seriously doubt a pathological problem at your age. However, will suggest you to get your blood sugar checked to rule out diabetes. The stress can be decreased by first looking at the root cause. You may need some counseling sessions from a clinical psychologist to reduce the stress. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "Hi, im 16 and i have problems with frequent urination. Ive been looking on the web for many diagnosis but i cant seem to find any that match my problem. I constantly need the toilet every 30 mins or so but i usually have to wait an hour if i dont get the opitunity to go. When i go i pass very little urine and its usually hard to pass it all. I have to 'push' it out sometimes and i always feel like ive still got more to come after i go, but it wont come until i make another visit within an hour. I dont usually feel pain. Sometimes a little sensativity and pressure in my penis (probably due to being unable to finish my buisness).And the strange part is it only occurs in school, outside the house and sometimes at night. At this point i think it sound like something phsycological, perhaps anxiety. I feel a little bit stressed at the moment, and the frequent urination makes me feel more stressed. I cant concentrate in lessons. Is there such an infection that's only active in certain situations? What would i do if it were phsycological? I would feel very embaressed if i went to the doctors and turne out to be 'all in my head'. Is it wrong to bother your doctor if you think its only pshycological? What will the doctor do to diagnose me? Could they refer me to a urologist or a phsycologist?Thanks for listening",
