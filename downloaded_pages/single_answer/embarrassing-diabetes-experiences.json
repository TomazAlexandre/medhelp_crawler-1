And my teacher was asking me whats wrong and I was just stood there crying and making noises like a elephant or something. Proper wining noises.Another time was I had low blood sugars in my history lesson, and my teacher asked me when the battle of hasting took place and were. And I turned around and said ''No I'm going out this weekend'' :')",

    "question": "Ok so I just thought it would be interesting to hear other peoples experiences with their diabetes. Embarrassing funny or otherwise. I am 21 years old and have had diabetes sense I was 7 years old so to say the least I have had a lot of embarrassing moments. Just last week I walked the 2 miles down hill to campus for class. I had taken 2 cheese sticks with me as well as 45 carbs worth of bread. I have a insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitoring device. Anyways in the middle of class my pump started beeping at me that my blood sugar was trending down. So I ate all of my carbs. By the end of class I had gotten lower and all my food was gone. I was really starting to get low and I was stuck sense there was no way I was going to make it the two miles home uphill no less. I had my cell phone but I had just moved here so I really did not know anyone. I was getting lower and there was no way around it I had to beg for food. Lets just say I was humiliated. I was getting pretty low so I could not communicate very well and I had to go up to complete strangers to ask for help. The first guy I walked up to I asked if he had any food and he looked at me like I was crazy. But the second person gave me some food and I was able to get my blood sugar up. I was really embarrassed. I defiantly go to school extra prepared from now on.",
