            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry, but no diet pills and B12 shots can help maintain reduced weight unless you exercise and watch what you eat. Also, if you have any medical problems that can cause weight gain such as polycystic ovary, diabetes or thyroid issue then this will need to be corrected and treated. Please consult a doctor to help you lose weight properly. You will then be able to maintain the new weight as the process through which weight loss will be carried out will be scientific and inculcated and imbibed in your daily routine. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
