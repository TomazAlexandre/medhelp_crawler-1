    "question": "Here's a little info about me. I'm a 24 year old female with a 2 year old son. I am currently taking Lamotrigine and Sertraline for Bipolar disorder. I have been experiencing terrible symptoms for a couple of months or so.Here they are:Frequent UrinationHeart palpitationsNumbness and tingling in lips, face, fingers and toesDizziness/lightheadnessRacing heartVivid dreams accompanied with or without night sweatsExtreme thirst at nightDry skinPurplish cold feet occasionallySometimes if I take a nap I wake up EXTREMELY hungry and eat a lot, such as a huge bowl of cereal, chocolate cupcakes, and hot pockets all in one sitting.Some of you may instantly think I have anxiety or panic attacks. I have had A LOT of experience in those areas so I know the difference. I am concerned that I may have hypoglycemia or pre diabetes from what I've read about this. I get my health insurance back next month and will be going to the dr but I just wanted to know if anyone has any experience in this area. PLEASE help! :)",
