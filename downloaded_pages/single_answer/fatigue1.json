            "answer": "Hi, you have not mentioned why you are experiencing fatigue? The symptoms you experienced could be due to a prodromal phase of an infection, before the actual signs are evident. They could also be due some metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus or thyroid disorders. Sometimes anxiety or stress can cause similar effects. Only a consultation with your primary care physician can help diagnose. Take care. Regards.",
