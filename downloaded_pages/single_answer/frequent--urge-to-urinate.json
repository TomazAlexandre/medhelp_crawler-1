            "answer": "Hi!If you have been sexually active, then increased frequency of urination and constipation could be due to pregnancy. If you have missed your periods then please take a pregnancy test and see. If your due date is only a few days away, then wait until then and if you miss your menses, take a pregnancy test and see.Other possibilities are diabetes, urinary tract infection, anxiety and kidney stone. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
