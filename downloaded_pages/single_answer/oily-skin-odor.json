    "question": "For the past several months I have had a pungent odor from skin areas that are exposed to sunlight.Things are fine and then the sunlight will hit the oil on my skin and a pungent odor leaps to life. It isnot sweat because it happens even if I am not hot. It is resident in the oil secreted by my skin. I thoughtit was Vitamin D and milk products but I haven't been eating any milk products and it still happens.I also noticed it starting when I started eating Amish cheese and lots of it. Any doctor I talk to says, \"Ihave no idea, it is the weirdest thing I have ever heard of.\" They think it is bacterial based and suggestdeodorants but that is not the problem.Anyone have any ideas",
