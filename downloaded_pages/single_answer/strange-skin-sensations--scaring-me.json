    "question": "Hi Doc, you are a great help to many.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your support.\u00a0\u00a0For about 8 weeks I have been experiencing a sensation on my arms (mainly left elbow area), shoulders, and occassionally my right arm.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like mild sunburn.\u00a0\u00a0There is no rash or discoloration.\u00a0\u00a0Occassionally, it itches, but not acutely.\u00a0\u00a0I have been treated for anxiety with lexapro and lorazepam for this period, and am taking meds for diabetes type 2 (metformin, lisinopril, tricor).\u00a0\u00a0I had a possible HIV exposure about one year ago, tested negative in May (well outside of window period)...so I don't think that is an issue.\u00a0\u00a0But, I am concerned, because I have never experienced this before.In addition, yesterday I discovered a small circular purplish spot (about .10 of an inch) on my penis shaft, topside, near the base.\u00a0\u00a0It is flat, not painful (unless I rub it hard, and then it is like raw skin), and a surprise.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor has no clue.\u00a0\u00a0He feels sure it is not a lesion that is due to STD, but cannot say what it is.\u00a0\u00a0I have an appointment with a dermatologist, but it is a few weeks away, so I needed some insight now.Thanks for any help you can give.Any ideas about my skin and that spot.",
