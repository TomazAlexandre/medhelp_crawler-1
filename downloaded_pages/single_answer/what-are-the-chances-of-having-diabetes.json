    "question": "I am 21 years old and lately I have had some symptoms which doctors associate with diabetes. I have moments when I am feeling dizzy and tired and sometimes even a bit sick. Without realizing, I started drinking a lot of liquids, and I have an increased appetite which made me gain some weight I am not happy with. I have recently quit smoking after 5 years and I had been tempted to attach these symptoms to this fact, but as the dizziness crisis are getting worse. I have a history of diabetes in my family as well, which makes things even worse. What are the chances of me having this condition? I am afraid to go to the doctors yet, I am not ready for some bad news. Are there any other lighter conditions that manifest through the same symptoms? Please help me, I feel desperate and I could really need some advise. Thanks.",
