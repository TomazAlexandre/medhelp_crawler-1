            "answer": "Hello Mag, I'm 49 years old and also a overweight woman who has Juvenenile diabetes was dx at the age of 7. The first thing I pray you do is go see a cardiologist A.S.A.P.In 2007 I also was starting to have chest pains, shortness of breath (laying down was horrible) the sweating got so bad that after a few minutes after I got dressed it looked like I had worn my clothing in the shower. I finally ended up going by ambulance to the ER (I was so bad I only know this because people told me) To make the story short I had almost a gallon of blood between my heart and the heart sac, it was removed and I was in a coma for over 2 months.Just a month ago I had heart surgery for a flutter in my heart, I hope I am not scaring you hun I just want you to know for one your not alone and to not treat this like it will go away.One thing I learned is how to tell the differents between a heart problem and heart burn, my heart doc told me with your heart the pain somewhat goes away yet with heart burn it stays sometimes for weeks.Please Mag I pray that you make that very important with the Cardiologist.Oh yeah I almost forgot to ask you , do you have a blood pressure machine?Keep in touch.GBU 777",
