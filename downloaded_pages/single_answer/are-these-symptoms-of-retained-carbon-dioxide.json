            "answer": "It sounds like sleep apnea to me. You need to see a lung specialist and have a sleep study done. Your oxy levels could be a sign of copd, asthma etc. Sleep apnea and diabetes can be a killer combination. On the med help publications there is some information on this. You should have received it if you signed on to receive them. A hospital will not send you home with oxygen if your levels are 87 and above, but anything below 87 is considered a major problem. It can cause brain and heart problems and it is most definitely a sign of lung problem. The heart and lungs work together, but you can have a problem with just one. I am concerned with your oxy levels because you are depriving your body of the thing it needs the most Oxygen. A lack of oxygen can cause all the things you talk about. I hope this helps. Please have it checked out. It is very important. Let me know and God Bless",

    "question": "I just had a pulmonary function test and was relating a frequent problem I have begun having when awakening from sleep. I am always trying very hard to come out of the dream, and as I do I have a rapid heartbeat, extreme headache, and feel as if I am swimming out of a thick fog. It usually takes an hour or so before I begin to feel \"normal\". My oxygen level was 92 today (finger clamp) but my hands were very cold. A week ago I had it checked at another office and it was 85-87. I am diabetic, so when I have rapid heartbeat, headaches,and tiredness like this, I always attribute them to high blood sugars. But now I am not so sure. I do have blood work to be done tomorrow.",
