    "question": "Anyone with type 2 diabetes? Any suggestions on how to manage this and pregnancy? I am a wee bit depressed about this because my blood sugar is way out of control and i feel like its my fault, even though my primary doctor knew, she told me i didnt need to check anything and our OB tells me its very unhealthy. And even though baby is growing healthy and strong, this being so out of control could kill our baby. I feel at fault. I mean i eat healthy. I am just upset and could use ome encouragement and maybe some pointers. Please and thank you.",
