            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Studies on being done, to study the effects of titanium implants on the kidneys. Other effects like tinnitus and anxiety may not be related to the implants. The most probable cause for tingling hands and feet is neuropathy, a disorder of the nerves. Most common cause is diabetes. This happens with metabolic disorders, vitamin deficiencies, infections and traumatic injuries. The tingling and palpitations need proper evaluation by your GP, please consult him for a neurological assessment.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
