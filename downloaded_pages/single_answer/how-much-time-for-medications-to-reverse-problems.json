            "answer": "Hi,This is a tough question because the answer has a few \"maybe's\" in it:Definitely continue to try changing your lifestyle and diet to manage your diabetes, it is always best.BUT if your sugars are not controlled right now you should start on a medication to stop ongoing damage that can be done with consistently elevated blood sugars. Different medications act in different ways, and thus can take varied lengths of time to see an effect in the first place, and also the maximum effect as well. In general, most diabetes medications will show their effect within 1-2 weeks, some sooner.Many people are able to come off medications after a\u00a0\u00a0while but some are not, despite making changes in their diet etc. The natural course of diabetes is one that requires more medication over time, so this would not be a surprise. BUT this is not definite, so I certainly encourage all attempts at lifestyle change.Hope this helps,Take care.",
