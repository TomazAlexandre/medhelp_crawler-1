    "question": "My child is now 3 years old. Some four months earlier, one evening we tested him for blood glucose using One touch Ultra glucometer, since we had some doubts. He was showing high values (400+). However the next morning, it came down to (140). Ever since, this trend has been noted. Mostly the values in the evenings are in the 150+ or 250+, sometimes 350+ range. But the morning values are in the 75 - 130 range. The question is whether this is a diabetic case. Last evening , the value was 413. Today morning fasting value was 88. Also , he is not showing much external symptoms recently. He also suffers from some kind of prolonged dyspepsia.",
