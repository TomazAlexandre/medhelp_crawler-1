    "question": "HiI was diagnosed with optic neurotits and had a MRI to rule out multiple scleuorosis, The MRI was good-(No abnormalitys). But I still have foggy vision in one eye-I have been tested for all other possible causes of Optic neurotitis,like auto immune disorders,HIV, Diabetes,etc.\u00a0\u00a0and all came back negative.Now in my good eye I am seeing a tiny black dot that moves with movement, is it possible I have retnal detachment, could that have caused the foggy vision in my right eye?Thank you",
