            "answer": "Hello~You may have a yeast infection in the gut called \"Candida\" this will cause lots of the symptoms you are mentioning. I would ask your GP about it, have a stool test taken as that is the best way to diagnose it. In the meantime, avoid all sugars, glutens, wheat, yeast and high carbs, all these are growing grounds for Candida.",
