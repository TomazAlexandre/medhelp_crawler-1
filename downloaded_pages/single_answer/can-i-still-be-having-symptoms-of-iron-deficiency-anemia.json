    "question": "Hello! I am a 23 year old woman who around two weeks ago was told that my hemoglobin level was normal and that I no longer have anemia. My hemoglobin level is now at a 13.6..it might be lesser now however. I've gotten at least 4 vials of blood since then to test for thyroid. I also haven't been taking any more iron supplements. I have been having so many symptoms and I feel as if I'm the same as I was when I was anemic. I have depression, panic attacks, severe anxiety, heart palpitations, hot and cold, random pains, dry skin, eye problems, fatigue, sensitivity to sugar and caffeine, etc. so is it possible to have the anemia symptoms for a long while even after your hemoglobin levels are good??? I reallyneed to know before I get tested for diabetes or any other health related issue.",
