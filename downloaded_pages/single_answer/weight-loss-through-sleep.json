    "question": "My sister is very overweight.\u00a0\u00a0She is 5'5\" and weighs 322 lbs. She has battled with this for the past 10-12 years.\u00a0\u00a0Diets, Psychologists, Prescriptions, and Over-The-Counter (alli), to no avail. She is pretty obsessed by this now, and she has come up with her own little scheme to try and lose weight, and I think it is dangerous. I am not a medical doctor or even in the medical field. It just doesn't sound right. I would like to know what you think?She wants to do this every other week. Sleep 10 hours, wake for 2, to eat light, drink water, bio break (go to the bathroom, wash up, brush teeth etc...) Take sleep aids (sominex, nytol etc...) Go back to sleep for 10 hours, wake up for 2 hours...rinse and repeat. Do this for 7 days......then none (no medicines) at all for a week, then do it again. She cannot control her food addiction, and she has this big idea, if she slept thru it a week at a time, she could \"wean\" herself off food.I have looked all over the internet, and I haven't found anyone who has tried this, or any information on how she even came up with this idea. But I know it cannot be healthy. I tried talking to her, and she says staying this over-weight is not healthy for her either, heart troubles, diabetes etc.... (she doesn't have these at the moment, but fears getting them). She says people in hospitals are put into comas and such with medicines for extended periods of time and they are just fine.Is there anything that shows this could even be possible for her and she could be successful at this, or am I right, and she is going down a dangerous road here? Any help or facts about something like this would be helpful, if I had something to go on to explain to her, the consequences of her actions, if she was to do something like this.I can't keep saying, it's not healthy, it doesn't work.",
