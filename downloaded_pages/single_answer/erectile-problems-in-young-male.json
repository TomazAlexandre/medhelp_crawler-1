            "answer": "Hi there!Erectile dysfunction or problem maintaining an erection can develop in young adults due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors first. You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. In case this doesn\u2019t work, I would suggest seeing your primary care physician for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, I'll do my best to make this all sensible.\u00a0\u00a0First, I'm a 20 year old male, and I'm having problems with what I estimate to be a weak erection, premature ejaculation, and weak semen flow (it dribbles out.).\u00a0\u00a0I've done a lot of googling and whatnot, and the problem sounds a little like prostatitis, or maybe low testosterone levels.\u00a0\u00a0The thing is that I think this has been going on for a lot of years.\u00a0\u00a0Due to religious reasons and upbringing, I didn't really start masturbating until just this year when I got sick of nocturnal emissions and whatnot, but since I only had a handful of orgasms before this year, It's difficult to know just how new my problems are.\u00a0\u00a0Besides being young, I'm also very fit, fairly muscular, and a non-smoker and non-drinker so I'm not sure what could be causing the low testosterone levels if that's the problem.\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway, all that to say I'm a little concerned and confused and any help at all would be appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
