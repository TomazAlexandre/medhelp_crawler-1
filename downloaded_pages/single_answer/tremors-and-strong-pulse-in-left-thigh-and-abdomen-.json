            "answer": "Hi!If the tremors and strong pulse in left thigh come while sleeping and wake up your mother, then this can be due to \u2018restless leg syndrome\u2019(RLS). The discomfort of RLS typically eases with movement of the legs (resulting in shaking of legs) and becomes more evident at rest or while you are asleep. Usually cause of RLS is not known but few medications such as lithium, antidepressants and beta-blockers (such as bisoprolol) can trigger the symptoms. Other reasons of RLS could be rheumatoid arthritis, kidney failure, diabetes or any underlying heart disorder. In addition restless syndrome has been found to be associated with stress, fatigue, magnesium deficiency, vitamin B-12 deficiency, anemia and other systemic diseases. Though there is no permanent cure of RLS, regular & sound sleep helps get relief from symptoms. Supplements of iron/vitamin also help some. Sometimes medications such as levodopa, bromocriptine, oxycodone may be tried to provide some relief from the symptoms. Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine may partly relieve your symptoms. Other useful measures are stretching, alternate hot and cold packs or baths, massage and applying vibrators on the feet and legs before bedtime. Relaxation and meditation can also help. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral to a sleep specialist. Take care!",
