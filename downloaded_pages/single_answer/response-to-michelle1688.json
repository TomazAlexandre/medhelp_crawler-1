    "question": "I have hypothyroidism and diabetes. Some things that help me are eating small meals throughout the day (about 250 calories each meal). I avoid simple sugars. I eat mostly complex carbs (Look at the Nutrition Label and subtract fiber and sugar from total carbohydrates, which equals complex carbs, and I eat lots of veggies).I am a full time student and am working on my senior tutorial. I understand that you don't have time to be exhausted. I exercise often, too. Your blood sugar probably drops after working out so make sure you eat before you work out. Have some nuts or even peanut butter on whole grain breads. And then you may even need to follow your workout with some veggies to help your body.Complex carbs are harder to digest and because your insulin isn't turning your glucose into glycogen, those complex carbs stick around in your body longer helping your blood sugar levels and energy. I'm a little fuzzy on these details, but I just want to emphasize the importance of complex carbs!Good luck:)This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/263851\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/263851</a>.",
