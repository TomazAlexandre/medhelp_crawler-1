            "answer": "Hi, like you mentioned IBS can produce a feeling of incomplete defecation and a feeling of fullness. But IBS is diagnosed when a person has abdominal pain or discomfort at least three times per month for the last 3 months without other disease or injury that could explain the pain.Please check for Diabetes as this can affect the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves leading to bowel symptoms. This can be detected by a simple blood test. The pain described by you could also be due to gastroenteritis, which is infection of the intestines. Amoebiasis is another infection, which can cause similar symptoms. Amoebiasis is an infection of the intestines and it is treated with metronidazole. So, have blood and stool tests done to rule out diabetes and amoebiasis. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance. Regards.",

    "question": "Here's the deal, for about a month or so I had a slight constipation, nothing to worry about I guess I was having like one bowel movement everyday or sometimes 2 maybe because a lack of fiber. Then I went on a vacation trip to the beach for 4 days, and I kind of overeat the whole vacation (lots of pizza and non healthy food at the buffet) ,everything was \"ok\", 'till the very last day I was having the most terrible pain I've ever felted in my abdomen and back , It was so bad we had to call the hotel's doctor, he injected me an antiespasmodic and gave me some colon motility meds, But the constipation that wasn't worrying me first, began to became a mayor issue, I was having like 1 or 2 super small bowel movements a day, I just couldn't take them out!! Also I was a feeling so bloated in my upper/middle abdomen and also mild pain in the same area at all times. I went to another doctor who prescribed me laxatives, antiespasmodics and antiflatulents for 2 weeks, Also a med for parasites, but the end of the 2 weeks I wasn't feeling any better so this week I visited my psychiatrist who believes my problem is rather anxiety, so he gave me ranitidine and told me to increase my fiber, I feel less swollen but everytime I finish to eat I feel so full! but this is subjective cause my parents tell me I look as normal as always and my abdomen doesn't look bloated it feels and looks normal, but I feel full almost all day long (So I guess is just me), also the pain is not that bad, but the constipation is still there (1 or 2 supersmall bowel movements everyday!) , even though I increased my water and fiber intake!! Is so frustrating! I don't have any blood or mucus in my stool. Could this be IBS? I know IBS is hard to diagnose and all that but please help me I don't know what to do, I have abdominal discomfort at all times, I just can't live like this. I'm so desperate and worried!!!I excercise everyday (I'm fit), I'm not allergic to anything,\u00a0\u00a0I've just turned 20! (male)",
