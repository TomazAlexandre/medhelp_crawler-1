    "question": "Posted By mike on August 07, 1999 at 10:54:49I am a diabetic. I have known for about ayear. I am having a great deal of pain in my right eye lately. It hurts to blink, and the pain is pretty bad if I touch it. I see or feel nothing in it. It is just very sensitive. My sugar level has been higher than normal but I don't know if I should blame the diabetes on all my ills. Is this another of the curses of diabetes? Any help will be greatly appreciated.Thanks,MikeFollow Ups:Re: Diabetic with eye pain HFHS MD-JL 8/07/1999(0)",
