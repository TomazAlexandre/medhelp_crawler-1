            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Feeling cold, loss of sensation, and numbness of legs could be due to spinal nerve compression, transverse myelitis, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes and hypothyroidism and peripheral vascular disease.If there was a fall while skating or jerky bike rides, then it is possible that you have lower disc problems. This is not something that you should ignore. Please consult your doctor ASAP and get a neurological consultation as soon as possible.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
