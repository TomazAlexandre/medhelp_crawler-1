            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. It is unlikely to be related to masturbation. In all probability you have a slipped disc in lower back. The other possibility is peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes, lupus, thyroid disorders etc. Please discuss with your doctor. Apart from clinical examination you may need MRI of lower spine and blood tests. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
