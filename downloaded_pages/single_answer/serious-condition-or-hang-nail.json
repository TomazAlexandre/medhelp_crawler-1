    "question": "My hubby, (56 y/o road construction worker for 35 yrs), has had lower back pain 5-6 years accompanied the last 6-8 months by numbness and weakness in legs and stumbling-tripping. Conservative treatment by family MD for over 2 years. May 8th MRI findings: Diminished hydration signal of disc material at all levels indicates disc desiccation and degeneration. T12-L1: Broad based posterior protrusion of disc material centrally; L1-L2 and L5-S1: Posterior bulging annulus fibrosis; L2-L3: Disc degenerative change; L3-L4 and L4-L5: Same as T12-L1 only mild plus L4-L5: Moderate facet arthritis and thickening of ligamentum flavum and narrowing mild narrowing of lateral recess bilaterally and neural foramen on right side related to posterior lateral protrusion of disc material; L5-S1: Posterior bulging annulus fibrosis. Neurosurgeon's interpretation: Mild to moderate spinal stenosis, discs probably not cause of neuropathy. June 24th Peri-vascular study normal. July 26th Nerve conduction study findings: (as explained by neurologist) Probes indicate overall mild to moderate neuropathy, suspected cause diabetes. Needle probes indicate significant spine generated neuropathy (left leg minimal reaction to either probes with increased voltage). Referred back to neurosurgeon with L5-S1 surgery recommended. QUESTIONS: 1. Why the lack of urgency - appts/studies a month apart plus have called surgeon twice only to be told he will review nerve study report and call us to schedule consultation, (we hand-delivered report to his office the day of study a week ago). Are we too impatient? 2. Are there other causes for neuropathy? Neurologist says no, but hubby's diabetes diagnosis within 1 yr and his 3/6 month average tests on high end of normal range. He has been told by family Dr. that the back pain could result in false readings for his daily results. 3. What about the other bulging discs? 4. What kind of surgery will likely be recommended? 5. What is prognosis? 6. Recovery? 7. I'm fairly confident he also suffers from undiagnosed sleep apnea as he is a heavy snorer and stops breathing for 30-45 seconds (if not more) numerous times every night. How will this effect his recovery/surgery? 8. What about the spinal stenosis? Footnote: Family history-Mother diabetes and neuropathy resulting in foot amputation. Father incapacitated by degenerative arthritis resulting in nursing home care at age 50. Any insight you can share would be greatly appreciated! Both hubby and I feel that his physicians' casual attitude seems to indicate his condition is not that big of a deal, but I'm WORRIED SICK!",
