            "answer": "Hi there. These could be many issues like scabies, related to arthritis if associated swelling. You need to be checked for diabetes where skin is usually dry and itchy and can lead to breaking and at times fungus. Your median nerve on the left hand needs to be evaluated along with an MRI cervical spine to check for any disc prolapsed or degenerative disc disease causing nerve compression and consequent itching. Since you are on monthly anti allergy shots, for seasonal allergies, you need to consider these. Consult a physician for the same. Take care.",

    "question": "There is a spot on the side of the tip of my left index finger that has been itching more or less constantly for about 2 weeks now.\u00a0\u00a0There is no visible rash, skin discoloration, bumps, etc.\u00a0\u00a0It is not exceedingly dry, and lotion does not seem to make a significant difference.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a dermatologist who said that it looked fine, and that I probably had a \"nerve that is misfiring\".\u00a0\u00a0Is that a likely cause?\u00a0\u00a0If so, is there anything to do to relieve the itching?\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure if any of this matters, but I am 35, healthy but I do get allergy shots once a month for seasonal allergies, and I went off of the birth control pill 3 months ago but there is no chance I am pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been getting very mild dizzy spells recently which never happened before but I have been chalking that up to my hormones adjusting to the lack of pills.\u00a0\u00a0Any direction you could give me would be greatly appreciated!",
