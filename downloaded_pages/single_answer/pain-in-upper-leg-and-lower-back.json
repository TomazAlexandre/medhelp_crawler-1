            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.If your symptoms start in your back and radiate down your leg, one possibility is a radiculopathy, or pinched nerve. This can be due to a herniated disc or arthritis that pushes on the nerve root as it exits the spine. This is best diagnosed with MRI of the spine.The other possibility, based on your exact symptoms, is what is generically termed nocturnal leg cramps. A specific cause can not always be identified but sometimes this is due to excessive muscle exertion, prolonged standing, or sitting, and also commonly dehydration. Other causes include diabetes or other sugar abnormalities, thyroid disorders, and some medications. Some peripheral nervous system disorders like neuropathy or ALS can also be associated with muscle cramping but these would be associated with other symptoms.Discussion of your symptoms with your primary doctor (internist, family physician) is recmomended. After he/she examines you and obtains a history he can determine what further testing and/or referral to a specialist is indicated.Thank you for using the forum I hope you find this information useful good luck.",
