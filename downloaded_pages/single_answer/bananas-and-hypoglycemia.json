            "answer": "Hello and welcome!Banana is a very nutritious fruit. It is rich in fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin C and potassium. Vitamin C boosts our immune system, potassium controls our blood pressure. High fiber gives a feeling of satisfaction and fullness. Are you diabetic? People with diabetes mellitus should eat foods and fruits based on their glycaemic index. Those with high glycemic index should be avoided as they cause faster rise in blood glucose levels and insulin levels. It has been observed that a ripe banana causes higher higher blood sugar rise compared to an under ripe banana. In an under ripe banana mostly 90% carbohydrates are in the form of starch while in ripe banana most of the carbohydrates are converted into sugars. Eat everything in moderate amounts. Do not eat anything in excess. Hope it helps.Take care and good luck!",
