I know that may sound silly, but you never know.\u00a0\u00a0You could also have a pinched nerve.

    "question": "HI there I am new to this and have one simple question. I am 24 years old, and was diagnosed with hypoglacemia when I was about 16. well for the past month now I have been having severe numbness in my legs in the lower area. I have always had cold feet but now they are turning purple. If I sit or stand for more than 5 mins they turn this color. I am having the legs asleep feeling kind of numbness. they actually hurt a bit on the top of the shin. I have had no injury of any kind. This numbness comes and goes but happens every day and lasts for hours at a time moving does not help at all. I also have no increased thirst nor weight issues, or frequent urination, however my urine is very strong to where I have to spray a deodorizer after I go to the bathroom. Is this diabetes or something else. I checked numerous symptom checkers and they all go to diabetes or multiple scelorosis.",
