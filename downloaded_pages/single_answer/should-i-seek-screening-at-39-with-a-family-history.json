    "question": "My uncle apparently died of an aneurism- I believe because he died in Cambodia that he might not have had a proper post-mortem. I am 39 and just had a physical which only tested EKG, Barium, Chest X-ray, Creatine- slightly elevated\u00a0\u00a0(not by Western Standards) and a few other common diabetes checks- no blood ionic balance and the doctor didn't check me over by hand. The EKG gave a worry-some initial result but they redid it to give it B rating- A is best. Other than being a little overweight- currently 83 kg with 179cm- nothing was overly concerning. I have had undiagnose-able\u00a0\u00a0heart irregularities- used a portable EKG but no result. I put it down to chronic night time gas which I have mostly controlled myself. I live in Japan. I exercise quite a bit- weights and interval running for most days of the week and don't smoke or drink. So should the doctors have spotted some tell-tale signs or do I have to still be concerned at my age- I will definitely reconsider at say 60?",
