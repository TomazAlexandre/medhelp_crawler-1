            "answer": "The amount of myopia should not vary for your distance vision. If it does then you likely are over corrected. You should see a ophthalmologist and have a Post Cycloplegic Refraction to determine you exact degree of myopia.Another cause of fluctuating vision is diabetes. If you have a family history or any symptoms of diabetes see your personal physician to rule that disease out.If you've seen many ODs and MDs and they haven't found any serious illness in the eye, its not likely serious.My experience would suggest over-correction of myopia.\u00a0\u00a0If you want to see one more physician I would make it a Pediatric Ophthalmologist that does adult strabismus. You can find one with the Find An Eye MD feature at www.aao.orgJCH III MD Eye Physician and Surgeon",

    "question": "Hi, im 17 years old. Ive had a problem with my eyes for over a year now. It has got in the way of my life and im really getting borred of it. Ive had many different symptons, seen many opticians/ opthamologists etc.. To start with i got glasses for distance and was diagnosed being shortsighted. My eyes then went from -0.75 prescription to -1, then to -1.25. I used to get very strong anxiety type feelings (tension/difficulty concentrating/tiredness/ general discomfort etc) This feelings increased when i wore glasses/contacts for close work. Other symptons included pulsating eyes (could see my eyes pulsating especially after close work/ headaches/ red eyes/ tired eyes/ sunken eyes/ a wierd clicking sound when move eyes from left to right.. etc. I was then diagnosed having a high AC/A ratio and given bifocals to help. They helped alot to start with. Before i got them i couldnt take my glases off without feeling so tired that i couldnt do anything. After wearing the bifocals for close work alot of my symptons improved or dissapeared, my vision also went back to normal (didnt need to wear glasses for distance). However, after a couple of weeks symptons started to return despite wearing my bifocals. Since then i havnt been wearing glasses for close work or distance. My symptons arent as strong as when i wore my glasses all the time for distance however i still feel tired, have diffuculty concentrating/ thinking, feel generally tired, have blurred vision etc. When i wear my glasses for distance i dont feel as tired as when i dont wear any glasses but feel alot more tense/anxious and the strong symptons (pulsating eyes/ tension/ headaches etc) return quickly. I dont know what to do or what the problem is. I was diagnosed having a high AC/A ratio and the bifocals would sort out the problem, which they did but no longer work. I cant do any school work etc and cant do much at the moment (have little energy and have trouble thinking/concentrating). Sometimes i can use my bifocals or other techniques to try and relax my eye muscles and am able to do so a small amount. Also, in the evening when its darker i can usually feel my eyes relax a bit and am ablr to think clearer/ have more energy etc but not as much as i could do initially when i got the bifocals. Anyone have any information or advice? really apreciate it :) Thanks alot",
