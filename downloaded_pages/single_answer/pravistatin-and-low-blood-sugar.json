            "answer": "I wouldn't cut your pills in half without talking to the doctor. What is the point of taking something if you are not taking the correct dose? Talk to the doctor about the side effects you are experiencing; he might tell you they will go away after a week or two or he might try a different medication. I'm not aware of any common result of statins lowering blood sugar. But getting your cholesterol as well as your diabetes under control will help prevent serious complications. As long as it isn't too low (under 60) it's all good.",
