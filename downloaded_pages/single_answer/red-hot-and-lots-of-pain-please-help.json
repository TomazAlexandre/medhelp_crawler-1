            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The burning sensation could be due to an entity called Small fiber sensory neuropathy (SFSN). It is a disorder in which only the small sensory cutaneous nerves are affected. This is more common in diabetics. But sometimes no etiology is detected for this disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes like vitamin deficiencies, alcohol consumption and certain medications can cause neuropathy. Sometimes anxiety can also cause these sensations. The sensations may need proper evaluation by your GP, please consult him for a neurological assessment. He may ask for blood tests to rule out diabetes and vitamin deficiencies.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
