            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Dizziness could be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position), internal ear problems and cervical spondylitis. All these cause dizziness when you get up from lying down position. Cervical spondylitis and ear problems also cause dizziness on changing the position of the neck.Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause postural hypotension. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required for confirmed diagnosis.Please consult your PCP to start with. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

This lasts for 5-10 seconds then returns to normal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I have to hold onto something because I feel like I'm going to fall over or pass out.\u00a0\u00a0The frequency varies.\u00a0\u00a0Some days it doesn't happen, and some days it happens fairly frequently.Is this anything to be concerned with?Thanks in advance.",
