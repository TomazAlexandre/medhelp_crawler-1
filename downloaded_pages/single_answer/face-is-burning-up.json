            "answer": "Hello,The first possibility for these burning sensations can be contact dermatitis. Avoid using any lotions and creams over the face for the meantime. Wash your face with a mild cleanser with moisturizing properties like Cetaphil. Pat your face dry. Then apply a good hypoallergenic moisturizer over the area and see if this improves. If the symptoms still persist then you can apply mild steroid like dermacort.If the irritation persists then please get it evaluated from a dermatologist. These can be due to heat burns, metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
