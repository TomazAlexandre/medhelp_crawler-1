            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.I will assume that you mean by PNES psychogenic nonepileptic seizures.Hippocampal asymmetry does occur in patients with epilepsy, often of the temporal lobe type, it can also can occur in patients without seizures, it can occur in patients without any neurologic signs of symptoms.Regarding your white matter changes, one possibility is microvascular ischemic white matter changes, often also referred to as small vessel disease, or small vessel disease, literally meaning diseased small vessels that supply blood flow to the brain. This is not an uncommon process in the brain and increases with age. This is not a disease in and of itself but rather is a reflection of unhealthy blood vessels, damaged by years of plaque build-up. This is most often due to a combination of several factors including the following: high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and high cholesterol, but can occur in people without identifiable risk factors, such as in yourself. Conditions that can mimic these findings on MRI include migraine which often causes non-specific and usually inconsequential MRI changes, and multiple sclerosis. Vasculitis is another condition. However these can be distinguished based on specific MRI findings, the patient history, physical examination, and other factors.I can not tell you based on the above description whether or not you have epileptic seizures or PNES. The way to definitively answer that question is an EEG DURING an actual episode. A normal EEG does not exclude epilepsy, and does not diagnose PNES. However, if EEG is done during an episode it will provide the answer in the majority of cases. This often requires prolonged video-EEG monitoring in which admission into an epilepsy monitoring unit for a few days occurs, and EEG is recorded over days to capture an episode while the EEG leads are on.Follow-up with your neurologist is recommended; evaluation by an epilepsy specialist (a neurologist specialized in epilepsy) may be of benefit to you.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "Briefly: Had car wreck in 2007 & suffered closed head injury.\u00a0\u00a0In late 2007 started developing spells where I would sit and stare for a few seconds and then be okay.\u00a0\u00a0Had some co-workers catch these, don't remember.\u00a0\u00a0In early 2008, I also started having an odd high chemical type smell, then loss of consciousness or altered consciousness, then muscles hurt and ached for hours to days, confusion/disorientation upon consciousness, and extreme fatigue/sleep for several hours afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0Went to Neuro - ran MRI in June 08, showed Aysmmetrical inbalance of Hippocampi.\u00a0\u00a0In July 08 Neuro diagnosed me with Partial Complex and said due to symptomatology and MRI.\u00a0\u00a0All scalp applied EEGs are fine.\u00a0\u00a0However, in September 08 she began insisting PNES because I couldn't tolerate a high dose of Topamax for which I currently am taking a low dose of with control and help of seizure symptoms (she doesn't believe me).In January 09 had weird thing happen, reported to Neuro in February, in February upon neuro exam Neuro found a difference compared to exam in July 08 & ordered MRI to rule out stroke.\u00a0\u00a0Report came back with T2 & FLAIR signal intensity with periventricular and subcortical area white matter changes.\u00a0\u00a0This MRI had no contrast and was compared to MRI in June 08 that did have contrast.I understand you can not diagnose or give medical advice but you can give an overall perspective and I ask respectively of such.\u00a0\u00a0I'm concerned that I am having Partial Complex Seizures and Neuro is ignoring them as PNES and that something has changed in my brain functioning in that I am having symptoms with cognition, memory, etc..\u00a0\u00a0I'm 42 with NO history of Hypertension, High Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, or Diabetes - all physicals & bloodwork for these have been clean.",
