    "question": "Hi, my Uncle that I take care of has diabetes and has an infected toe which the Dr. say he has staf infection and gangrene has set in. It has went into the bone. My Uncle refuses to have an amputation done. I have set home care for him and have round the clock help. We soak his feet in peroxide and put badadine and wrap it 2 times a day. He is on cipro antibiodics. Is there anything else we can do to help get rid of this. Is he going to die quickly with this? What are some other symtoms that will happen? Will it start taking over other parts of his body?Katykel",
