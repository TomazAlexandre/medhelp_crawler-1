            "answer": "How are you? What other symptoms are present? Burning or tingling of the hands is more likely caused by poor circulation in your hands. It can be carpal tunnel syndrome which presents as numbness, tingling or burning pain, and weakness in the thumb, index and middle fingers. This results from irritation of the median nerve at the wrist.Common conditions that can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome include obesity, pregnancy,\u00a0\u00a0hypothyroidism, arthritis, diabetes, and trauma. Tendon inflammation resulting from repetitive work can also cause carpal tunnel symptoms.This can be a temporary condition that completely resolves or it can persist and progress. If it persists, it would be good to see a neurologist for proper evaluation and order tests to measure circulation and nerve conduction.
