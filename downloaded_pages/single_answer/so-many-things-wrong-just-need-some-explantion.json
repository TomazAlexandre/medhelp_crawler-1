            "answer": "Hello,These abnormal sensations in the skin are parsthesias.Important causes of parasthesias include alcohol intake,cigarette smoking,Vit b 12 deficiency,abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body,diabetes and stroke.Multiple sclerosis,underactive thyroid and neurological illnesses are other important causes.Smoking causes blockage of carotid artery to the brain which may cut off the blood supply to the brain cells, which results in stroke (cerebral thrombosis). Blood thickening and clotting are also serious smoking effects.The yellow phlegm that you are having is also related to smoking.It can cause lung cancer, feeling out of breath, colds and flu, pneumonia, asthma, cough and sputum, tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis and emphysema.I feel that you should abstain from smoking for some days and see if your symptoms improve or not. You can take multivitamins and multiminerals for some time. Also get your blood sugar tested.If the symptoms persist then pls consult a physician and get yourself evaluated.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
