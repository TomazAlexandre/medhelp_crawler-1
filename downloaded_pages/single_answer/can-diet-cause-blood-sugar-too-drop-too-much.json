            "answer": "HI,A blood sugar of 65 can be quite normal and will definitely not lead to serious consequences like passing out, seizures or mental status changes. So do not let that worry you. What is reflects is that you have ample insulin production of your own(assuming you are off all medication right now). Do not eat to bring your blood sugars up when you see values in the 60's unless you feel ill and about to faint(and I doubt you will). This habit will only put weight back on, that you worked so hard to lose!Take care.",

    "question": "I was told that I was borderline diabetic and my doctor said that if I lost weight, it might take care of it. So I've lost nearly 20 lbs. - about 14% if my body weight and have reduced carbs. I've always eaten healthy. My home monitor has shown blood glucose of mostly 80 - 99 depending on whether I've eaten or not. Occasional 107. One 114 after large meal. Today, before dinner, the count was 65. Scared me. I ate something and it went up to 100. Is this normal? Does such a fluctuation indicate diabetes? Or could it just be a reaction to the diet change?",
