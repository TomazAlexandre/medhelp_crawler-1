            "answer": "Hi,I can understand your concern.From her symptoms, it is highly possible that she is suffernign from food intollerances.However, first you need to take her to the doctor and let them check that there is nothing else going on.\u00a0\u00a0I am also assuming that she doesn't have worms or parasites.Most common food intollerance cause would be coeliac.\u00a0\u00a0This needs to be tested for.\u00a0\u00a0However, even if this testing is negative, a food elimination diet would be useful to try to work out what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the foods which a person craves the most are the ones which are a problem for them.You can search food intollerance on the internet and you are sure to come up with a lot of good information.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0It is worthwhile.\u00a0\u00a0I was a kid with a fat tummy too and I know how hard that can be when other kids pick on her.",

    "question": "I have a 10 year old daughter who is always having stomach aches. She is average to thin in size everywhere except for she has this a protruding abdomen. She is otherwise a healthy kid. as she gets older her belly gets bigger and she is made fun of in school. Diabetes is in my family... my father and grandfather developed it later in life.Tonight my daughter is in some pain and has diarrhea. Her stool is a bright orange red and almost jelly like. She has no fever and no other symptoms. After having a BM she is back to playing with her puppy and enjoying life. She is a good eater but enjoys spicy foods sometimes to the extreme. If you look at my picture it is of my two daughters the one in blue is 12 and the one in red is the 10yr old with the problems. Please help if you can..~~ 1 Worried Mom ~~",
