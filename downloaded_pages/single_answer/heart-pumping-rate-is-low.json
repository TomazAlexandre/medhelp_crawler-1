            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.You must be referring to the ejection fraction. What is his value? The ejection fraction is a useful measure of left ventricular performance. The normal range is 63-77% for males and 55-75% for females. It reflects the pumping capacity of the heart. Values below 35% are indicative of heart failure.Treatment to improve the ejection fraction is focused on treating the underlying cause like myocardial infarction, which has caused the low values. So, ask him to take the medications regularly and follow up with his doctor. Also, he should aim to keep the diabetes under check.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
