            "answer": "You are probably deficient in the mineral called \"zinc\" If you are low in Zinc, you will NOT have any taste and sometimes not be able to smell things either.I would take a zinc supplement along with a good, multi-mineral that has zinc in it as well. Don't take more than 50 mg however, and make sure the multi-mineral has a small amount of copper in it, this helps to assimilate the zinc.",
