            "answer": "I cannot for the life of me, figure out WHY when a doctor suspects MS and does an MRI to check for this, that they do NOT order an MRI of the brain AND spinal cord, with and without gadolinium.\u00a0\u00a0(contrast dye)\u00a0\u00a0It makes NO sense to me.Highlighted lesions with contrast dye tells them so much more about what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a doctor, so I do not understand their reasoning on this.I would definitely ask for a repeat MRI with contrast, if your insurance will allow it and hopefuly including the spinal cord.\u00a0\u00a0Since the radiologist suggested further examination with contrast dye, stating that it would be useful to look for enhancement and/or further characterization, I believe your Neuro AND your insurance company would agree to another, more complete MRI.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe giving you some better answers about what is going on in your central nervous system.Best Wishes, Heather",

    "question": "Hello, I've been reading some of the posts in this forum and I am hoping some of you can help me out.\u00a0\u00a0I am terrified that I have MS and can't figure out how to get through this limbo phase.\u00a0\u00a0I know that a lot of you have been in limbo and frustrated for a lot longer than I have been, but if you could give me any insight I would be really grateful.I am a 35-year-old female and started getting dizzy spells about six weeks ago (more like vertigo than lightheadedness).\u00a0\u00a0I have MS in my family (a great aunt on my dad's side and a male cousin on my mom's side).\u00a0\u00a0When I went to the PCP for the dizziness and mentioned the family history of MS, she whisked me off to an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0(She ruled out diabetes, anemia, and thyroid problems with blood work, and some heart rhythm tests are still in the works.)\u00a0\u00a0I was desperately hoping the MRI would come back normal (even though I know that doesn't rule out MS for sure or forever), since for some reason I have always felt destined to get it... but I got the results as copied below.\u00a0\u00a0What confuses me is that the PCP told me over the phone that there were \u201cincreased signals\u201d on the MRI but that they could turn out to be nothing.\u00a0\u00a0The report of the results that I just got in the mail had the word \"Normal\" written in marker at the top.\u00a0\u00a0BUT, the PCP is sending me on to a neurologist, and I have a hard time seeing how \u201cmultiple foci of prolongation\u201d in the white matter can be nothing\u2026.???\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything reassuring anyone can tell me about these results?\u00a0\u00a0I don't have what seem to be the \"classic\" symptoms of MS, but maybe we are just catching the MS really early in my case?\u00a0\u00a0Or is it years of fear of inheriting this disease (however the genetics turn out to work here) that is making me overrreact??TECHNIQUE: Brain MRI was acquired utilizing the following sequence: Sagittal T1, dual echo axial T2, coronal FLAIR.FINDINGS: Ventricles and sulci are within normal limits.\u00a0\u00a0The midline structures are unremarkable.\u00a0\u00a0Multiple scattered foci of T2 prolongation predominately located in the supratentorial white matter.\u00a0\u00a0No definite abnormalities are identified in the brainstem or cerebellum.\u00a0\u00a0No mass effect or midline shift.\u00a0\u00a0No abnormal extra axial fluid connection.IMPRESSION:1.\tMultiple foci of T2 prolongation (greater than 10), predominately located in the supratentorial white matter.\u00a0\u00a0No definite involvement in the brainstem or the cerebellum.\u00a0\u00a0No associated volume loss.\u00a0\u00a0This is a nonspecific finding.\u00a0\u00a0Given the family history of multiple sclerosis, demyelinating disease could give this appearance.\u00a0\u00a0However, the differential diagnosis includes other entities such as vasculitis, premature small vessel ischemic disease, Lyme disease, and others.2.\tExamination acquired with gadolinium may be useful to look for enhancement and/or further characterization.",
