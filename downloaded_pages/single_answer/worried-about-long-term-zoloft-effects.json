            "answer": "I've been on these types of medications for 20+ years and my memory is just fine.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't worry about the \"what ifs\" all they do is scare you.\u00a0\u00a0But if you haven't given therapy a chance I definietely would do that.\u00a0\u00a0Often our anxiety/depression can have a root cause...normally something traumatic from our past which we may have never truly dealt with and even forgotten about.\u00a0\u00a0It comes back demanding to be dealt with in the form of anxiety and/or depression.\u00a0\u00a0If yours has a root cause, by getting into therapy you can learn what this is, deal with it and maybe not need the medications.\u00a0\u00a0It's always wise to at least try therapy, we can learn a lot about ourselves and how to cope better.... at the very least.\u00a0\u00a0Often anxiety is like any other medical condition....like diabetes which requires daily medications to control the symptoms...and that's okay.\u00a0\u00a0You've been on your medications just long enough to really benefit from them, and I'm happy to hear that they are working so well.\u00a0\u00a0Know that our bodies do build up a tolerance to these types of medications and eventually you will need to switch to a new one, this is normal and you will know when the time has come if you start to feel bad again. I hope this helps and take care!",

    "question": "hey i am a 21 yr old male (about 125lbs) taking 50mg zoloft a day for anxiety/depression. I like the way it makes me feel alot (although i had horrible insomnia starting out but now i sleep great). its been about 2 months.. just wondering is it safe to stay on the drug long term? Will my brain ever be happy or calm with out it after getting used to it? I've read people saying its hurt their memory... is that really true cuz my memory is great at the moment i dont wanna risk it either.. or anything else. obviously part of my anxiety will never go away hahaso just wondering/ thinking ahead. thanks!",
