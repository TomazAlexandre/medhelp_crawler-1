            "answer": "Has she gained a lot of weight recently? I think this can happen with birth-control pills. Hence stretch marks. Because she has complicated health issues it is difficult for anyone on the forum to offer advice. I do feel sorry for her. Just being in puberty is enough of a problem. Why not talk with her doctor and find out if she can safely be taken off the pills. Getting fat will add to her lack of self esteem.",
