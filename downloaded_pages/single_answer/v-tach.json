            "answer": "I'll say you shouldn't be worried, if there is an immediate concern the nurse surely would have taken action.You didn't say what the rate was, if averaged to a full minute all V tach means is the count would produce over 100 bpm.\u00a0\u00a0At your young age I'd estimate (this is not a diagnosis) a short run that was at a rate below 160 would not be \"scarey\".The other good news is the nurse should report that to your doctor, in fact I am surprised that wasn't the first step and then let the doctor tell you if there was any action indicated.In my case, and now 73 yo, my cardiologist was not concerned about a v tach of 130, full-time.\u00a0\u00a0He did put me on beta blockers to bring the count down.\u00a0\u00a0My situation is different, my v tach is due to atrial fibrillation.",
