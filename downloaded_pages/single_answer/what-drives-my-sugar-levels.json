            "answer": "Hi,I do not know of data showing saccharine based\u00a0\u00a0beverages CAUSING Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This does not account for individuals ofcourse, just overall. Keep a close log of your diet as you are doing to see if there are other dietary variables(or daily schedule changes e.g exercise. work etc) that may account for higher glucoses on those days. If indeed in your case it seems to be the diet drinks, then you may have to let those go for now.take care.",

    "question": "I have recently been diagnosed as suffering from diabetes type 2. I have actualy been a margin case for three years before being diagnosed as needing treatment.I have no familly history of Diabetes at all and although overweight by about 10 kgs I am fairly active and quite fit.I am on Glcomin 850 mg once a day after the evening meal and my blood sugar count in the morning (before breakfast) is between 100 and 120. I have been trying to figure out what makes the levels swing and am fairly sure that there is a strong correlation to the intake of diet coke or other diet drinks - after a high intake of these drinks, and even after a 6-8 hour fast, my blood sugar levels are higher. Could the high intake of sacchrine base beverages cause type 2 ??",
