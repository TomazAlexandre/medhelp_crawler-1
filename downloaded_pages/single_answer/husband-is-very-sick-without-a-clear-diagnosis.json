            "answer": "Well, there are a variety of findings here that point to several diseases.Shortness of breath on exertion can be indicative of heart or lung disease.\u00a0\u00a0Although he is already on blood thinners for a clot, I would re-check for a pulmonary embolus.\u00a0\u00a0This can be done with a CT scan, and if present despite the blood thinners, an IVC filter may need to be considered.If the lungs are clear, I would evaluate the heart with a stress test.Can't comment on the rash without seeing it, but a dermatology evaluation may be prudent, and discussion of whether a skin biopsy would be helpful.The nerve damage can further evaluated with nerve conduction studies, and blood tests to evaluate for diabetes, vitamin B12, and thyroid disorders.\u00a0\u00a0A referral to a neurologist can be considered to further evaluate this finding.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin Pho, M.D.www.kevinmd.comwww.twitter.com/kevinmd",
