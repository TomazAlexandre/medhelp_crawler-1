    "question": "I have recently had a NCV done on my right foot and leg which was abnormal.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t have the final report yet but I was told that there is slowing of velocity throughout the lower leg as well as conduction block in several nerves.\u00a0\u00a0They tested my right arm and noted similar results and polyneuropathy was mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0The left leg was not tested due to peroneal nerve damage and drop foot due to MVA 20 years ago.The following are new sx over the last week:On my right foot I can move my big toe up but not down.\u00a0\u00a0This is the one that is still numb underneath.\u00a0\u00a0 I can move the little toe just fine.\u00a0\u00a0The banding feeling around the 2nd and 3rd toe has increased to include the 4th toe.\u00a0\u00a0I can't move toes 2,3 & 4 up at all.\u00a0\u00a0This morning approx 6 inches of both forearms feel tight on top. Feels kind of like very light tingling.Short History:I had an onset of sensory symptoms and severe episodic vertigo 15 months ago that lasted about 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0Some of my symptoms never went away just became mild.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 2 more episodes with the last episode I have numbness and loss of vibration sensation in my right foot for a couple of months.\u00a0\u00a0The numbness is subsiding and the vibration sensation is coming back. Other symptoms: muscle twitching and spasms mostly from my mid body down however recently they have started in my arms and neck.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 1 MRI w/o contrast(over a year ago).\u00a0\u00a03 very small non specific \"white spots\" were found between the grey and white matter. All blood tests are normal, diabetes, thyroid, vit. & mineral deficiencies have been ruled out.I am trying to get an idea of what could be the cause of these sx and would appreciate any advice as to what other testing should be performed.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently without a PCP due to his illness and do not have a neurologist at this time.Thank you for taking the time to read this!",
