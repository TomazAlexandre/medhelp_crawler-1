    "question": "I am close to the end of my rope. I'm 24/ white male. I have GERD and suffer from anxiety. But the past year something has been attacking my body and I can't take it. I have a deviated septum and terrible post-nasal drip and I'm scheduled for a surgery soon, but I can't believe that is what is causing all of these problems. I have been having terrible sinus problems and breathing problems, but on top of that I have extremely intense pins and needles sensations throughought my body. I am extremely fatigued and feel terribly malaise. I have an extremely terrible back pain underneath my right shoulder blade. It is very intense and at times its shooting and others it is a stabbing pain.\u00a0\u00a0It is worse if I stretch my back or pull my shoulder blades togehter.\u00a0\u00a0I have a very dense tight feeling in my rib cage and underneath my breast bone near my arm pit when I have the breathing problems. All of this also feels like it is on my right side. The tightness, back pain, actual bronchial problems feel like its all on my right side. I am very shaky. I get easily winded, light lifting causes me to lose my breath. Before all of this I was in good shape, worked out and played tennis twice a day. I don't really sleep anymore b/c of this. I lay down and fall asleep, wake up 30 minutes later b/c of the extreme discomfort in my breathing. I suffer from close to 12 panic attacks a day b/c of how I feel. I've had numerous blood work done, tons of chest x-rays, Chest and back CT scan, scope of my sinus', urin analysis, D-Dimer test...everything comes back fine. I had low potassium levels once during the blood tests and low liver enzymes (i don't know if that is correct) but something with my liver. I've seen 4 specialists along with my primary physician and have been to the ER close to a dozen times. I don't do drugs, don't smoke and I gave up drinking. Before that I drank very seldomly, around once a month. Diabetes and high blood pressure run in my family.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone could shed light please help me",
