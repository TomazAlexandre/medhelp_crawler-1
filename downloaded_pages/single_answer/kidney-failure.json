            "answer": "Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to lots of problems, including kidney problems. What is keeping your numbers out of range? Do you use a basal/bolus regimen of insulin? Do you count carbs? These are the standards of care, not the older types of insulin or sliding scales or set doses. if your endo can't help you with this, you need to change endos (regular doctors do NOT have the knowledge to manage type 1 diabetes correctly). Also try reading the book Using Insulin by John Walsh. Depression and anxiety, unfortunately, are all too common with diabetes and especially with uncontrolled diabetes. it is also a vicious cycle: if you are depressed you \"give up\" on managing your diabetes. Seeing a therapist is an excellent idea because you need support with what you are going through emotionally and with managing your diabetes to halt the progress of complications. Work with your endo, see a therapist and get your numbers under control. You will be surprised how much better you'll feel!",

    "question": "Just a little curious, I am a 40 year old male with type 1 diabetes. Have been type 1 since 1995 and really not well controlled. This year seems to be my year they found bleeding in my right eye and did laser surgery to try and slow the bleeding. Now the nurse called and said on my last blood test that my potassium level was elevated. What does that mean exactly? Everything I read seems to lead to kidney problems. Should I worry about it? or, will it just go away? mentally seems im getting worse too they want me to see some shrink and i keep fighting them on that issue. i had read something about mental problems is a sign of kidney problems? is this true?",
