            "answer": "Hi,How is your ex-husband? While tracheostomy would definitely help with his\u00a0\u00a0breathing, there are many factors to consider in determining if he will get better, such as the presence of the co-morbid conditions ( diabetes, hep c and cirrhosis), results of diagnostic tests, how well he responds to treatment and clinical evaluation. The best person to evaluate this and to correlate it with the symptoms present\u00a0\u00a0is his attending physician. It is best that you talk to him or her about this for proper evaluation and to ease any worries. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "On the 7th of February I got a call from my ex husband who is an alcoholic. He was acting strange. I felt I needed to check on him. He is 62 years old, has hep c, cirrosis of the liver, diabetes. I got there and he was talking weird throwing up blood and finally fell and just stared right through me. I called the ambulance and the hospital did a cat scan and found the hemorage and anurisym had burst. They ambulanced him to another hospital and did the coil procedure that was successful. all this time he was responsive to commands etc. adrainage tube from the brain, breathing machine and a lot of other things. were done. A few days later He was placed in a special bed that turned him back and forth because of a lung not working correctly and pneumonia developing in the other, so they medically paralized him and put him in a coma. It has been 5 days since they took him off the meds to let him wake up and he still not. tomorrow they will be doing a trachiostomy so they can take the\u00a0\u00a0breathing tube out of his mouth. Is this going to get better? So worried!Thank You!",
