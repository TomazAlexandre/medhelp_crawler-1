            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you, I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.In carpal tunnel syndrome, median nerve is impinged leading to numbness, tingling sensation or pain. However, diabetes may lead to neuropathy that may cause similar symptoms. I would advise an orthopedic consultation who may investigate the problem with help of X-ray or MRI of the hand to reach to a probable diagnosis and further treatment required as per the diagnosis achieved. The first line of treatment mostly involves a splint to stabilize the wrist and needs to be worn at night or during the day for several weeks. Surgery may be successful in your case but suggested on severity and duration of nerve compression. Hot and cold compresses may also be helpful. In addition, avoid/reduce the number of repetitive wrist movements whenever possible. Hope this helps.",
