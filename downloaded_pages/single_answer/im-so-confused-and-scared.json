            "answer": "I understand you're scared and really want an answer. But I don't think anyone on a message board is going to be able to diagnose you. I would suggest seeing your doctor and having a complete work-up to try and figure out what is going on. If diabetes seems like a possibility, just a random blood sugar is pretty meaningless. They need to do an A1C test (average for the last couple months). If your doctor can't figure out what is wrong ask him for a referral to the appropriate specialist. As far as the panic attacks I would definitely get a referral to a therapist for medication and possibly therapy that can relieve that, because panic attacks are awful.I am sorry you are having these problems and hope you have some relief soon.",

    "question": "Okay, so I am an overweight teen (19) I am 230 pounds and 5'7\". I have been diagnosed with Insulan Resistance and PCOS. However, about 6-8 months ago I got several blood tests done and it did not say I had Diabetes. Last night I rushed to the emergency room with my mom because I had this EXTREME thirst...I've been really thirsty lately for a month or so, but I didn't pay a lot of attention to it. Then it just got reeeeally bad yesterday. Also my hair started falling out! The ER had me give a urine sample and blood test. They said everything looked normal. They tested my blood sugar and it was 127 which they said wasn't too bad since I had just had a Gatorade. I am sort of worried about Kidney Failure because I heard if you have an Electrolyte imablance that water makes your thirst worse (Which it does) and sports drinks are the only things that help (Which is true for me as well). However, the ER doctors said they didn't think it was my kidneys because I would show swelling and I'd be extremely sick in a lot of other areas. I'm just so confused...Why am I so thirsty if they say it's not Diabetes? And don't you think that would be the most reasonable solution since I'm insulin resistant and diagnosed w/ PCOS? I'm so confused and scared. My father is very thin but has Hypoglycemia and my grandfather and aunt have type 2 diabetes but it was not developed until they were much older. Could it be hypoglycemia instead or would they have seen it in the tests??? I also have panic attacks frequently and awful migraines if that makes a difference .Thank you to anyone who helps",
