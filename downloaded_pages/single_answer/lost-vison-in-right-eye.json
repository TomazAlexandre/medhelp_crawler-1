            "answer": "The most likely answer is no however you should see an ophthalmologist (and at least yearly the rest of your life) to see if glasses might help and to be sure you don't have intrinsic eye disease. Most cases the problem is damage to the nerve tracts to the brain behind the eye. Brain tissue does not regenerate like peripheral nerve tissue does. Protect your good eye from injury and lead a healthy lifestyle as diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes and tobacco use can damage your good eye.",
