    "question": "I am a 57 year old woman. I have Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. My diabetic dr. did blood work on me and my tests showed that I had red and white blood in my urine and my GFR was 54. I asked him about these results and he didn't seem concerned about them. He said he doesn't worry about the GFR readings unless they fluctuate and women get different little infections. This is the first time I had a GFR test done.\u00a0\u00a0My father had bladder cancer and my mother had kidney disease, so I am wondering, should I be concerned at this point and be seen by a kidney specialist or should I wait until my next blood work is done which will be in 3 months. There was no protein in my urine and I do not have any symptoms. Please give me some advice. I see my medical dr. in two weeks.",
