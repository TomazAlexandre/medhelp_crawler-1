            "answer": "Hi!The treatment of a bloated hard abdomen will depend on its cause. You could be suffering from an inflammatory bowel condition such as Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Crohn\u2019s disease. Most of these conditions are diagnosed through endoscopies. Other than that it could be due to H pylori infection. This can be diagnosed by a carbon urea breath test. At times endoscopy is also done. It can also be food intolerance. Diabetes can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence get your blood sugar tested. It can also be due to excess consumption of food rich in sulfites like juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough. Constipation can also cause bloating. Very sedentary lifestyle is another cause. You can take probiotics, antacid gels and see if this helps. Also, since you have fatty liver, you need to restrict your fat and calorie intake. So, yes, you may need an endoscopy. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!",
