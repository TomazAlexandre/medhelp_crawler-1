            "answer": "I have had to retain a new Dr. for my Diabetes and Hypothyroidism because my long time Dr. of 33 years passed away.My new Dr. said my Tsh is very high and she wants me to up my thyroid med every week say from 114 to 125 in one week and next week to 137. I have a history of Supra ventricular tachyacardia and my heart started to beat very fast again tonight but went back in sink when I did some breathing exercizes.I have always been told that I needed to be on one thyroid med for at least 3 weeks before uping the strength.What is your opinion? Thanks,oscar99",

    "question": "(This is an excellent forum.\u00a0\u00a0THANK YOU Dr. Lupo!!)My husband & I have unexplained infertility, both of us in excellent health except for my hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's (TSH was at 6.0 two years ago, now down to 2.47, working on getting it a little lower).\u00a0\u00a0I ovulate just fine every month, his sperm count/motility are good.\u00a0\u00a0But my thyroid Antibodies are through the roof - 1000.I know western medicine says there's little we can do about Hashimoto's (other than keep the TSH in the right range and keep an eye on things, and maybe try some baby aspirin), but is there any evidence of any success with \"alternative/complimentary\" treatments, such as acupuncture??Also, does Dr. Lupo have any strong opinions on Synthroid versus Armour (bioidentical from pig thyroids)??\u00a0\u00a0I know Dr. Steven Hotze in Houston (who's well known for thyroid work) believes strongly in Armour.Thanks! - Jessica sqrrrlgrrrl",
