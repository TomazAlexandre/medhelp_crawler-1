            "answer": "No its highly unlikely that the IOL is being rejected. the drops are used to reduce inflammation in the eye not rejection. The IOL are made of very inert material and \"rejection\" almost never occurs. You pain does\u00a0\u00a0not at all like its from the eye. I suggest you have your family MD refer you to a neurologist or your ophthalmologist to a neuroophthalmologist.JCH MD",

    "question": ". Since my cataract surgery two weeks from today i have had a headache every day. .\u00a0\u00a0 I called doctor four days after surgery to let him know and he said if it was still bothering me when i came in for my first office check up he'd look and see what s going on. I also seen him on my second check up as well and told nurse about the headache but no one seemed a bit concerned.. My pain is only on the right side of the back part of my head and neck... I've taken vicodin for two days which didn't help at all.\u00a0\u00a0I then started taken ibuprofen every day which helped take pain away but as soon as medicine would wear off the pain is right back worse than ever.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to the emergency room two times and the last time \"we\" thought it might be a ear infection or a blocked drain tube that runs from my ear to my throat.. That suggestion\u00a0\u00a0was based on my findings from the first time i visited the emergency room . I have been on Amoxicillian for a week now hoping this will unblock any blockage there might be but yet nothing is working.\u00a0\u00a0I wake up each morning from the pain throbing in my head and down my neck.. the pain is like deep inside and if i hold pressure to the top of my neck in one place it seems to help with the pain somewhat.... i recently read about the eye drops that the doctor gives you to take after surgery and found out its to help the implant not reject the lens .\u00a0\u00a0 It didn't discribe the affects associated with lens rejection though.;\u00a0\u00a0Could this be my eye rejecting the lens .??? I am trying to figure what could be causing my headaches each day... I don't know if it has anything to do with the surgery at all for that matter...\u00a0\u00a0It could be anything from a tumor or diabetes ,,, etc....\u00a0\u00a0please let me know what i would be felling if my eye was rejecting this lens please... so i can elimate certain reasons and narrow down what it could be .. thank you .... asap please.... marlene sumandal",
