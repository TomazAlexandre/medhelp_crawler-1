            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!In all probability the heat sensation is due to peripheral vascular disease as you have both diabetes and high blood pressure. It can also be due to peripheral neuropathy of diabetes. Hence get glycosylated hemoglobin to know the overall diabetes control. Nerve conduction test and color dopplar or duplex ultrasound may be required. Vit B12 deficiency can also be a cause.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been having heat radiate up my back for a couple of months.In the beginning,\u00a0\u00a0it was a few times a week and would pass.\u00a0\u00a0Now this heat sensation that feels like a heating pad that has started on warm and reached medium hot is happening every day usually in the morning when I get up.\u00a0\u00a0I also get a little bit of heart palpitations along with the heat.It is very scary and I don't like it one bit.\u00a0\u00a0I can speculate it may be anxiety related, or I always have lower back pain and with the change of season I noticed my lower back hurts more.Also, I am having what feels like pins and needles randomly all over.I also am a diabetic and take a pill a day for diabetes and a pill a day for high blood pressure.I called my primary care doctor and have an appointment on Monday and I will let everyone know what he says.",
