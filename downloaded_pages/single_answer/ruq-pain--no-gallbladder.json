    "question": "I have been having intermittent right upper quadrant pain that was radiating to my right shoulder blade. At first, it was just hurting when I stood and moved. Now it is starting to hurt with no provoking factors. The shoulder blade pain is nearly constant. My lab tests were normal except a slightly elevated WBC count (recent URI). I have no gallbladder or appendix. CT scan was normal. Had an EGD done today but he said he could not find a reason for the pain. A couple areas were biopsied in my esophagus. I am frustrated and just looking for some kind of direction or answer. Any insight is appreciated.Normal stool, no urinary problems, some nausea, no vomiting, some fatigue, no weight loss.PMHx: Hypertension, Diabetes, Borderline Personality Disorder, Depression, Arthritis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Asthma (no problems with it in YEARS).",
