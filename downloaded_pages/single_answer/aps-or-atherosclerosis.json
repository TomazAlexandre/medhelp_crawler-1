            "answer": "No they are not mutually exclusive. You can have both APS and ASO (atherosclerosis). APS is an autoimmune problem that leads to an abnormality in clotting whereas ASO is caused by risk factors such as age, hypertension, cholesterol problems, smoking, and diabetes. The treatment is not necessarily the same. In some patients who have APS and a history of stroke, we recommend coumadin for adequate control of their tendency to clot whereas in some patients with ASO we recommend risk factor management and an antiplatelet drug such as aspirin. As for the doppler results, I'm not quite sure what you're trying to convey - but ultrasounds differ from hospital to hospital and the quality is very tech dependent.Your case sounds complex and it sounds like you're getting a lot of conflicting information. I strongly recommend you see a stroke neurologist at a major academic or clinical center to tie everything together as this does have an impact on your care. The treatments do differ and may even different if you have both diseases. Good luck.",

    "question": "I have had multiple strokes and TIAs, lowered circulation in my extremities and clots in my Rt arm & leg.\u00a0\u00a0I have been dxd with premature pervasive atherosclerosis by a peripheral vascular doctor I respect and trust.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been diagnosed with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) by a different doctor whom I respect and trust.\u00a0\u00a0The APS finding was based on a low titer IgM.\u00a0\u00a0Outside of chronic isolated systolic high blood pressure, I don't have the traditional reasons for TIA/Stroke/clots.Question:\u00a0\u00a0Are APS and Atherosclerosis mutually exclusive?\u00a0\u00a0I know the treatment is the same.\u00a0\u00a0How do I deal with the differing opinions?An MRA last year showed an occluded left common and internal carotid.\u00a0\u00a0Dopplar at one hospital = retrograde flow in ECA into a branch.\u00a0\u00a0Dopplar at the other = retrograde flow from ECA into ICA.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday, a repeat dopplar at the first hospital again showed the occlusion and \"missing\" ICA.\u00a0\u00a0She showed me what flow looked like on an occluded vessel vs non-occluded. Both hospitals showed me the same frame and explained the vessels.\u00a0\u00a0They have two different explanations of the same flow patterns of the same vessels.\u00a0\u00a0I trusted the technician, yesterday, because her explanation was reasonable and backed by the MRA.\u00a0\u00a0However, the other hospital technicians are very trusted and they have been following me since the left common went out of commission years ago.Question:\u00a0\u00a0Again, how do I deal with the differing opinions?It wouldn't be so important except that I continually get misdiagnosed/non-diagnosed re: my strokes due to lack of etiology.",
