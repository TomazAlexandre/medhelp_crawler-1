    "question": "Are tortuous blood vessels in the eye common?\u00a0\u00a0I have been identified with Erythermalgia, and do have episodes of red, swollen feet/legs/hands.\u00a0\u00a0However, I have other symptoms (e.g., longstanding GI difficulties, hypertension) that are not consistent with this.\u00a0\u00a0I have looked at differentials for Erythermalgia, and one -- Fabry Disease -- seems consistent with many of my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I do realize that it is a rare disorder, however, and as such unlikely.\u00a0\u00a0One of the symptoms listed for Fabry is tortuous blood vessels -- which I have in both eyes (look like tight waves).\u00a0\u00a0Is this a common finding, however, or typical of this (or other) disorders?Thank you",
