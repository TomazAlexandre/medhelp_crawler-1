            "answer": "Hi,The causes of\u00a0\u00a0abnormal taste sensations could be side effects of all the medications that you are taking and a hormonal imbalance that may have been caused by the pituitary tumour or sudden stopping of synthroid. Please do not worry. It is a common symptom after using so many medications. Please consult your doctor and discuss the symptom.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",
