    "question": "My lab is about a year old. He is and has been house broken for awhile! He has recently started urinating all over my carpets. In addition to doing it on the carpet, he doesn't stand still to do it he walks around. It's almost as if he doesn't know he is doing it. The vet says he doesn't have a bladder or kidney infection. Is there something else that could be wrong, or is back to not being house broken?",
