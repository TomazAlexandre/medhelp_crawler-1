            "answer": "Thyroid symptoms are so non-specific.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, a lot of other health conditions have the same symptoms as thyroid, it is very difficult to distinguish where the symptoms are coming from or which health conditions are the cause.\u00a0\u00a0So thyroid conditions are based on TSH level the cascading to other test when warranted. If your TSH level was above 10 or below 0.01 with symptoms, then it would suggest thyroid.Nodules normally are not presented with abnormal thyroid levels, unless nodule is hyper-functioning as in Graves' disease.However, I personal believe your description deserves attention with the proper test. Have you been to an endo. who treats many thyroid patients\u00a0\u00a0per year. Most deal in diabetes and not too much in thyroid, so you need to find one who does.You need your nodules checked out!\u00a0\u00a0Demand your rights!\u00a0\u00a0and good luck.",

    "question": "I am still very unclear about the test results for thyroid tests. It seems that the tests are not at all reliable. Why can the thyroid hormone tests be in the acceptable range but a person have the symptoms of hyper/hypo thyroid? Is it possible to swing between the hyper/hypo states? I also\u00a0\u00a0do not understand why my thyroid has multiple noduals and is so enlarged it is pushing on my esophagus making swollowing, eating and even breathing difficult and causing numbness in my face and hands but my hormone levels are acceptable. Why is it so hard to get help and get better?",
