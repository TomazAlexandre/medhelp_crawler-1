            "answer": "Yes, the fevers can be caused by your autoimmune problems. This is fairly common. It is even listed as a symptom of Lupus. I have had frequent fevers for years. The main problem they cause for me is tiredness. You should be able to combat them somewhat with Tylenol, or Ibuprophen. Check with your Dr. to see what's best for you. I recently began taking a new immunosuppressant, and the frequency of my fevers has diminished greatly. It also helps my immune system to quit trying to destroy the rest of my body. Good luck with your new job.",
