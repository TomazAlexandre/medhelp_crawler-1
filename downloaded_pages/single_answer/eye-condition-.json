    "question": "Hi,I noticed that one of my eyes is bigger than the other. It looks like my right eye is further back in my head that the left eye.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed this about 8 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0My eyes are naturally \"full\"/big.\u00a0\u00a0So it's hard for me to determine which is the normal eye.\u00a0\u00a0I went to an Optomologist (sp), who sent me for Thyroid testing and referred me to a neurologist.The Thyroid tests came back \"normal\".\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist did not notice the difference and said that it may be Myasthenia.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't want to send me for testing because he said that the test could come back \"normal\" even if I do have this condition.\u00a0\u00a0I talked him into sending me for testing and he told me to return to him in 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0That was about 2 and a half months ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have not heard anything on the results, but I'm assuming that they are normal, or I would have gotten a call.\u00a0\u00a0I'll find out for sure in my follow up visit next month.My questions are:1.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any other tests that I can ask the doctor to order, so that I can find out if I indeed have Myasthenia?2.\u00a0\u00a0Can Thyroid disease also return \"normal\" results?\u00a0\u00a0Should I ask for other tests for this?3.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything else that this can be?History:\u00a0\u00a0I'm a healthy 27 year old female; never had any serious medical conditions etc.\u00a0\u00a0The only medical condition that runs in my family is diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a long time contact lens wearer.",
