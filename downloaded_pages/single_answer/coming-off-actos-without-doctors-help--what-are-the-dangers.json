            "answer": "This web forum is set up for discussions on issues of type 1 diabetes, and the medication you describe is one used for type 2 diabetes. So we really cannot give you any helpful information about type 2 medications. The two diseases are very different in their cause and treatment, for type 1 diabetes is caused when the body's immune systemt is triggered to attack and destroy the insulin-producing cells in the body while type 2 diabetes is more of a problem with insulin resistance rather than the loss of the ability to make insulin.That being said, let me give you a website set up by the makers of Actos, which may give you some information:http://www.actos.com/sub_sec1_what_actos.aspIt gives information about type 2 diabetes as well as information about this drug and what it does.Also, the website for the American Diabetes Association has lots of helpful information on type 2 diabetes, for type 2 diabetics make up 90 percent of the diabetics in America. It's website is:www.diabetes.org/Your father should call his doctor before his medications run out and ask him how to go off of these medications. I do know that some blood pressure medications in particular are taken with warnings not to completely stop all at once. His doctor will know what his blood pressure levels are and whether he should phase off of these medications slowly rather than all at once.Your father should check into what health benefits are available for him through the state Medicare plan. Check out their website at:www.medicare.gov/Getting the paperwork done to apply for Medicare benefits can take some time, so he needs to get the process going quickly.I wish your father the very best. He needs to take the diet and exercise advice very seriously, and there is lots of information on type 2 diabetes on the top 2 websites that I gave you. I would be just as concerned about the loss of coverage for his glucometer test strips as I would about the medications, for no diabetic can properly manage his disease without knowing what his glucose levels are. There should be some help for him through Medicare.",

    "question": "My father has lost his job and because of this his medical insurance. He can no longer afford the doctor's visits or medication. His doctor told him he could control his diabetes with diet and exercise. He has been taking ACTOS, blood pressure, and chlorestoral medicines for the last year. His ACTOS will run out this month. Are there any precautions he needs to know about? Are there any dangers in coming off this medication without a doctors care.",
