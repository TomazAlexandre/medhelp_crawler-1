            "answer": "Just to note...boils are a type of abscess.Applying a hot cloth may help.Antibiotics may be needed to rid you of the problem.Are you on any medications? Such as prednisone?Do you have diabetes?You should consult a doctor because it is obvious that it isn't healing properly. This could suggest other problems that are causing this..such as immune deficiency.The doctor may be able to prescribe something that may help.Alternatively you could ask a pharmacist about creams or lotions that may help.I would highly recommend not using any makeup in that general area...this only makes it worse.Hydrogen peroxide may help to cleanse the area...I suggest diluting it in a small amount of water...say half and half or less water.",

    "question": "Ok so about 3 years ago i developed a boil on my right cheek about the size of a quarter. I'm pretty sure it was a boil and not an abscess because it was completely soft and not hard and red like an abscess. I applied a topical product that i recieved from a dermatologist called \"Tazorac\" which applied ample amounts on for a few days. The boil when completely down but left an indentation or a dent in my skin about the same size as the boil. It's just looks like a large size \"Dimple\" and seems to still every once and awhile collect small amounts of pus inside. If i squeeze that spot on my face tiny amounts of pus come out. It's been there ever since and is cosmetic problem for me and would love if anyone could help me find a solution to this. Thanks in advance",
