            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Your problem looks more like Pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE). PNE \u201c is a source of chronic pain, in which the pudendal nerve (located in the pelvis) is entrapped or compressed. Pain is worsened by sitting, and can include prickling, stabbing, burning, numbness, and the sense of a foreign object in the urethra, ----- or rectum. In addition to pain, symptoms can include sexual dysfunction, impotence, anal and urinary incontinence.\u201d You can refer to this link for further information and treatment options: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pudendal_nerve_entrapment\u201cProstatitis-like urogenital pain and voiding and sexual dysfunction are the hallmark of pudendal neuropathy. Symptoms of prostatitis-like pain occur in 11% of American men, and approximately 95% of the men whose conditions are diagnosed as chronic prostatitis have no evidence of bacterial infection or inflammatory cells in the prostatic fluid.\u201d Finding of skin bacteria in your case merely indicates a contamination from the skin. This is the reason you are not responding to antibiotics. Refer: http://www.chronicprostatitis.com/pne.htmlMaybe you can discuss this with your urologist or even a neurologist can help you out with this.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 56 year old. For the last 18 months I am experiencing burning irritation of pelvic region at the time of urination and 5-7 min. afterwards. It is up and down. Some days I feel there is nothing wrong while on some others it is very evident. The pain starts after I come to office and sit down to work. Very little or no pain when I relax on bed or standing up! Tests performed as per Urologist advice showed the flg:\u00a0\u00a0Ultrasonogram- Prostate- 25.5 c.c. (mildly enlarged), no other abnormality in the abdomen, Kidney/Liver function normal, PSA- 0.06, No diabetes, cholesterol problem, Blood spectrum normal, no infections detected on urine culture, B.P. since 7 years- on Amlodipine (5mg.) and Losartan (50mg.) daily regimen. Uro advised to wait and watch and only in case of severe pain to take Roliflo (1 tab daily). Can somebody advise me what is happening to me and what is the possible way forward? Do I have to live with this for the rest of my life?",
