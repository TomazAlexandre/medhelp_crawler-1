            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The pain could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar nerve at the elbow level. Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause pain in little finger. Please consult a neurologist.It can also be trigger finger. This is associated with catching, snapping or locking of the involved finger flexor tendon, resulting in inability to move the finger and pain. The diagnostic thing is that you can unlock the lock and start the finger functioning again. Treatment is by injecting steroid into the tendon. If that fails, this can be surgically corrected. Please consult an orthopedic specialist if this is the case.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
