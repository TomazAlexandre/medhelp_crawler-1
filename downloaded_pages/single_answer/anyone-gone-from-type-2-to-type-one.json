    "question": "I am type 2 diabetic diagnosed last summer. I also have Hashimoto's Disease. Since i still\u00a0\u00a0have high thyroglobulin antibodies i was wondering if the same thing could happen to my pancreas. I know type 2 isn't autoimmune (type 1 is) but i find it strange that i didn't get diabetes until AFTER i got Hashimoto's.Just curious.....",
