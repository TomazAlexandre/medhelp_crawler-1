            "answer": "Hi, inadequate oxygenation can produce symptoms of breathlessness, as the body tries in an effort to compensate for the decreased oxygen supply. Long term sleep deprivation can lead to impairment of cognitive functions (higher functions) in the brain.The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Breathlessness on exertion could be due to the decreased lung function. He has been evaluated for the same. Again in cardiac disorders the heart is unable to pump the blood adequately, more so when subjected to stress like exercise. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. Please discuss this with your doctor who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test to rule out a cardiac cause for his symptoms. He may even ask for blood tests. Regards.",

    "question": "Hi, my fiance is extremely concerned about some recent health issues he has been experiencing. He feels lethargic most days but he will them have the odd day where he feels OK. He is usually very athletic and would normally partake in fitness activities such as running 3-4 x a week but has been unable to run as he keeps complaining that he feels like he has restricted breathing and is unable to take a full big deep breath.He feels as if there is some blockage in his throat that is restricting his breathing but yet there is no lump that we can feel. He has been to his GP who checked bloods for laryngitis and\u00a0\u00a0done a full blood count all appear normal. He also had a chest xray again normal, he is now awaiting an appointment with an ENT specialist.He is worrying himself sick this is cancer and I wonder if some of this is psychological although he has gone from being super sporty to hardly able to partake in any fitness. He also had to blow into some machine to check his breaths and that was also fine, no sign of any wheeze.He does snore extremely bad but I presume that wouldn't make you feel as though you have an obstruction in your throat, he kees rubbing his neck and taking extra strong mints as he feels this helps a little!Sorry of this sounds mad symptoms, I just wondered if anyone help or suggest any further tests he should consider?Thank you",
