            "answer": "Hi!If your son had a dizzy spell during an aerobic exercise/sport such as football, there are a few possibilities you should look at. First is a heart issue that can be taken care of by an EKG, treadmill test and echo. The next is anemia. The third cause could be low blood sugar or even a case of high sugar as in diabetes. Another cause is poor sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Exercise induced low blood pressure too could be a cause. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!",
