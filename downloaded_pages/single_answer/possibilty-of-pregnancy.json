            "answer": "Hi!Well, if you had a much lighter or shorter bleed this time, then maybe this was implantation bleed. Please wait for 7-10 days and if you do not get periods, then take a pregnancy test and see. If the test is negative, please consult a doctor to treat irregular periods which are often due to polycystic ovaries, hypothyroidism or diabetes. Also, buy an ovulation prediction kit and try close to ovulation.Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
