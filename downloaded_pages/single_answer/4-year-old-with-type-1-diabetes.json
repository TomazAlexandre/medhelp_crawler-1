All i can suggest, is getting 2nd and 3rd opinions elsewhere! It never hurts to get information from various medical professionals, especially when you are getting no answers from the ones you normally use.",

    "question": "My daughter got diagnosed with type 1 in June 2010 (3 months ago). Her BS are all over the place, which I know is to be expected. She never feels good though. She ALWAYS has a headache (not matter what her sugar is) and a stomach ache. I've taken her to my ped and endo doctor and neither of them can seem to find out whats wrong. We check her BS breakfast, lunch, dinner and bedtime. She also get insulin at these times, Humalog at break, lunch, dinner and Lantas and bed. It all goes on carbs EXCEPT for bed with is 4 units. I have notice that when her sugars are high she's a completely different person, its almost like she's not even here. she doesn't listin, she lashes around, pulls out her hair, screams just completely goes crazy. when her sugar is low she sick. i just don't know what to do? any suggestions or comment would help!!",
