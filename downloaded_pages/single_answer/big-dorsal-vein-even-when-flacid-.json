            "answer": "Hello,Thanks for posting your query again.As I had replied to your question earlier also, vascular problems are often the cause of erectile dysfunction. However having a big dorsal vein on the penis even when you are not erect is not always the cause of venous leak. Sometimes veins may swell up and appear bigger after an act of vigorous intercourse or rubbing.Venous leak occurs when veins in the penis can not keep blood in the penis. Men with a venous leak will typically have trouble maintaining an erection, or they will only get a soft erection. One of the most common causes is damage to the penis. This damage can be due to trauma, such as a penile break or penile fracture and it does not occur after masturbation. Venous leakage is also associated with diabetes, Peyronie's disease (buildup of scar tissue in the penis that leads to curved, painful erections), certain nerve conditions, and even severe anxiety. Diagnosis can only be confirmed after investigations like cavernosometry and a cavernosography. During cavernosography, a doctor injects dye into the penis. X-rays are then taken.Mondor\u2019s disease appears as a sudden appearance of a linear, cordlike, thrombosed vein. At first, this vein is red and tender, and then, it subsequently changes into a painless, tough, fibrous band. Since you are not having any pain chances of Mondor\u2019s disease is less likely. However you can get a Doppler ultrasonography done to completely rule it out.I suggest you consult a urologist and get these investigations done if the swelling persists, increases or becomes painful.Hope that this information helps and hope that you get better soon.Wishing you good health.",
