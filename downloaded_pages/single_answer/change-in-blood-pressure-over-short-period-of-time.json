    "question": "Hi, I am 23 years-old and have recently been concerned with my health, specifically my heart. You see my Dad passed away suddenly at the age of 49 due to a heart attack 3 months ago. The autopsy came back to us that he had to prior heart attacks we didn\u2019t even know about. Due to the fact my Grandpa just recently died from a heart related illness also about 2 years ago I wanted to take preventative measures to ensure that I do not end up the same way. Back to the question, I have recently found out I have high blood pressure an average 145/90 over the past week, for the past four years I have been a smoker, but I recently just quit (this week). I also work out about three days a week and cardio for 30 min two times weekly since 15 years old. What is odd to me is that I have a low heart rate sometimes as low as 46 beat per minute resting which is a new development (previously 60 Beats per minute at best). I work in an office building where I am sitting down all day and for the past two months I have started getting a lot of head rushes when standing up. I had a physical right after my dad passed away and I got a EKG and cholesterol check done both of which came back great! At the time my blood pressure was normal 120/80. I am curious if you would have an explanation for why my blood pressure would have went up so high in a short period of time and my heart rate to drop lower than it has been in the past?",
