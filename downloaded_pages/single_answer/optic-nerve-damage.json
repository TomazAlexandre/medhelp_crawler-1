            "answer": "Thee is no treatment for vision loss due to complete damage (usually transection or complete cut) to the optic nerve two years out and recovery is unlikely.the \"treatment\" is to work hard as possible to preserve the vision in the fellow eye by regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist and to protect the good eye from injury and disease by healthy lifestyle and avoiding eye injury situations and wearing protective eye wear.There is promising research but nothing that would warrant a trip anywhere in the world.JCH MD",
