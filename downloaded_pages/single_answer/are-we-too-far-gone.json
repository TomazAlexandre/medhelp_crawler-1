    "question": "I have been married for over twenty years to a man with increasing alcohol abuse tendencies. In the early years, it was more about partying together, but as we built a life and family, everything got worse.The stakes were raised once our eldest daughter (we have three) was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome. She has been a constant stress on our marriage since we had no clue what this was or how to help her. At that point in time, he began drinking heavily, I started being bullied by an aggressive co-worker (supervisor), and she withdrew and became very depressed. All of this ended in a DUI for him, and me taking a leave of absence in order to get away from THAT abuse.Even worse, he was diagnosed with Zyype 1 diabetes (both his dad and sister are also insulin dependent diabetics, and he carries a gene marker for the disease). This led to other irrational behavior (denial, 500+ blood sugars). He also seemed to take out a lot of his issues on our daughter.Then I got cancer. Good Lord, when I write it down, it seems even worse! During my treatment, we both withdrew. It affected our sex life, and my mastectomy and hysterectomy coupled with his out of control diabetes\u00a0\u00a0killed it.Four years later, I am stronger, his blood sugar is better, but his drinking is bad and I feel trapped. My financial situation isn't great, I have no family and am isolated in Alaska, he is emotionally unsupportive in regards to our daughter and she is severely depressed and unable to function (she is 20). My 18 yr old daughter is angry at him and they bicker (she moves out for college soon, thank God!), and my 16 yr old daughter is struggling to understand our relationship.It's a mess. I want to leave because I know he'll never take responsibility, but I'm so tired. I'm also weirdly worried about him - I am afraid he'll drink himself into financial and physical doom if I leave. He has huge self-esteem issues as it is and is most likely an Aspie himself which presents as a display of limited social skills.Feedback? Help.",
