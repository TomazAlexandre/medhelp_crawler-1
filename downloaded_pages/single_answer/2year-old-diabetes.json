            "answer": "Hello,if your daughter has low thyroid then she definitely needs that treated.\u00a0\u00a0Has she seen a pediatric endocrinologist yet.\u00a0\u00a0She may have a complicated endocrine disorder (some of these present with quite a few different systems affected - thyroid, diabetes, pituitary), and does need to be seen by a specialist.Such low blood sugar is not normal, but does not make her diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0However, it needs to be monitored closely.Make sure your daughter is eating plenty of meats, veges, healthy fats... minimize sugars and processed foods....Can you also monitor her blood sugar about 1.5 - 2 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0See if her blood sugars are also going high (not just low fasting)... normal blood sugar after eating should be < 120.",

    "question": "five months ago my daughter was 1.5 and in the morning she was unresponsive and glazed over. My husband and I rushed her to the er and they said she had very low glucose levels and rushed us to a children's hospital. We spent 5 days hospitalized where we fasted her and ran labs to see her levels. They said it must have been an isolated event a d our endocrinologist agreed but said if it happened again we would develope further. Now, four days ago my daughter woke up in the same state and we now had a glucose monitor. We checked her and she was at a 25 so we rushed her in again and were hospitalized again. They did the same fasting and labs and said they had no answers for me that they were \"stumped\" she was a \"medical mystery\" and a \"conundrum\". Her labs came back with low glucose, low insulin and low thyroid hormone. I don't know what this can be and I feel its diabetes but why can't they find out and give me answers? Also, my daughter is very small for her age and is thristy frequently and eats frequently. I am reaching out hoping this sounds familiar to someone or someone has answers for me. Now that this has happened twice I m very persistent on getting answers for my tiny girl. Please help.",
