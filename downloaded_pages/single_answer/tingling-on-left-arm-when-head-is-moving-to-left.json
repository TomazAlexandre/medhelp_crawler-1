    "question": "Hi.For more than 6 months, I've been experiencing some tingling on my left arm. Been to neuro, chiro and orthopedic doctors and still the same problem. Had PT for 12 weeks but same problem. But good thing is the tingling now only happens when I move my head a few degrees to the left for more than 10 seconds. Had MRI with c5-c6, c6-c7 discs bulge and protrusion that's why my ortho requested me to do the PT. Now, after finishing 4 weeks of Chiro, I don't know where to go. I went to my primary to get a CBC and the results are normal except for cholesterol. I thought I have diabetes. I also get a few pins needles on my knees and shoulders, elbows. Any ideas?Thanks muchJun",
