    "question": "Hi, I have diabetes type 1 and have irregular periods but this time it hasn't come for a month and it's worrying me even more then the other times when my period was late. I am not sexually active and I keep having thoughts that my irregular periods might mean I can't have a baby when I get married. I'm really freaking out and it's putting even more stress into me and my day. Can anyone tell me what is possibly happening to me and help me calm down?",
