            "answer": "phimosis is not contagious. It's something that can happen in males who aren't circumsized.\u00a0\u00a0It can happen for many reasons - you can google it for more info.\u00a0\u00a0in the future if it reoccurs I don't recommend using any otc antibiotic ointments on your penis. Many folks can have reactions to them when used on our sensitive genital areas.\u00a0\u00a0I also do not recommend using lemon juice either.\u00a0\u00a0The skin in the genital area is too sensitive for something that acidic.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend you see a dermatologist or an urologist if it reoccurs to find out what the underlying cause of it is and get properly treated since your regular doctor doesn't seem to be very concerned about making sure you get proper treatment.\u00a0\u00a0diabetes can put you at risk for fungal infections too which is worth following up on if this reoccurs.also this is not the doctor's forum so if you want their advice - you have to post it over there and pay for their opinion.grace",

    "question": "Dear Doctor,I am 47 years old male and thru all these years, I never experienced something like that: in about the midst of July I noticed some small cuts in my penis foreskin, which I tried to heal it using triple ointment. I treated it for an entire week and no cure achieved, I changed medication unsuccessfully and the condition got worse, the cuts increased in number and size. moreover, the foreskin shrunk preventing me to pull back the skin for proper cleaning, sometime was not pleasant to urinate (made the foreskin seems like a balloon full of urine), and hurt a lot due to the stretch of the skin causing the cuts to bleed.I went to my doctor who insisted to say that I got phimosis, which I do not have, anyway he gave told to buy a medicine, as per him, from the shelves and for not been able to find I asked the Pharmacist for help and he told that the specific medication was not over the counter. I went back to my doctor and blah, blah, blah\u2026..The thing is, I managed to minimize the cuts using believe or not, lemon juice, but I went to hell and heaven at the same time!Can you tell what this thing is?Is there in the market a medication to cure it?PS. I do not have other than my wife as a sexual partner.I have diabetes.I have used Neosporin, Bacitracin, Triple Ointment\u2026.Yours,Eliezer Araujo",
