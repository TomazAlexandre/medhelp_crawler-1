            "answer": "Firstly, did you breast feed and if so are you still doing so? Breast feeding usually speeds up weight loss and requires a good balanced diet with carbs as well.Maybe try reducing the fruit intake and increase servings of protein..eg fish, tuna, lean steak. Are you skipping breakfast? If so, don't.\u00a0\u00a0Drink plenty of water.Increase the number of times you eat to 6x per day to increase your metabolism and if necessary reduce the amount, though I doubt this is necessary.If you are up half the night with baby this can also reduce metabolism. If so, rest more during the day to counteract that. Overdoing the exercise and not resting can have the opposite effect.It is important that you have rest periods as well as exercising and dont try to lose too much weight too quickly if breast feeding..Perhaps have a blood test. Did you suffer from pregnancy induced diabetes at all?It sounds like you have a very healthy lifestyle and attitude...Well done. Try out the above suggestions. Good luck.",

I gained 40 lbs during pregnancy and went down to 155 by the time I went back to work (about 5wks pp).\u00a0\u00a0I am a bartender at a pretty busy place, so I thought that would be enough exercise to start with after having a c section.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I would lose at least a few lbs doing the bartending thing and I completely changed my diet.\u00a0\u00a0I eat nothing but fruits and veggies, whole wheat breads, beans, occassionaly nuts, sour cream is my weakness, and i'll occassionally have chicken.\u00a0\u00a0I don't count calories but I've always been good at knowing when to stop and don't overeat.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is 7 months now, and after 5 months of no weight loss, I decided to join a gym, and work out at least 5 days a week.\u00a0\u00a0I play raquetball for 30-45 min, do elliptical for 30 min, and weight train with light weights for 20-30 min.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I'll go to the pool and do laps and they have pool weights there that I usually use too.\u00a0\u00a0I've been doing this for a month and a half and the scale hasn't changed.\u00a0\u00a0Why can't I lose the weight?",
