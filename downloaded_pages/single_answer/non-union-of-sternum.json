I recommend you go to the web site rapidsternalclosure.com and you can see an animation of the type of repair I do. Also, Dr. Scott Levin of Duke University and DR. James Spann\u00a0\u00a0of Tulsa do these complex repairs. This problem is actually quite common, and it is just now being addressed. Please contact one of us and we can help .

    "question": "My husband had open heart surgery in 2004.\u00a0\u00a0The pain in his chest never went away and one year later, the doctor finally tested him and said he had a broken wire.\u00a0\u00a0In 2005 he was opened up again and the wire removed.\u00a0\u00a0That was all that was done becaust the doctor said his heart muscle had attached to his sternum.\u00a0\u00a0Now he has to live with the pain which is getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0he can not life anything more than 10 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0When the pain comes, if it is in the left side, we have no way of knowing whether it is a heart attack or not.\u00a0\u00a0Now the pain is starting to move all over and around his rib cage.\u00a0\u00a0The pain comes on so severly.\u00a0\u00a0Last night he lifted a 5 gallon bottle of water, which he knows he shouldn't), but hates to feel helpless as he says.\u00a0\u00a0This did quite a number on him, worse yet.\u00a0\u00a0Today he is on the sofe in one spot, took a pain pill and is trying to stay still until the pain goes away.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't know where we can go from here.\u00a0\u00a0He is overweight, has diabetes and his doctor said he would not reopen him unless his back was against the wall.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone out there had/have a problem like this.Thanks,Mary Anne",
