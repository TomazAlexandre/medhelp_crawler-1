            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Numbness in the extremities usually suggests neurological or vascular causes. You can opt to for the symptoms to settle spontaneously, as they often will. However if they do persist, have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Unfortunately, X-rays are frequently unhelpful because they only show bony changes while an MRI scan is much more useful in identifying causes of pressure on the nerve. Take care and do keep us posted.",
