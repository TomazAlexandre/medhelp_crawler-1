            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!PCOS increases insulin resistance. This can in itself increase blood glucose level. Generally drugs like metformin are prescribed for it. However, it is also possible that you actually have diabetes.If you have not had periods at all you have primary amenorrhea. The cause needs to be diagnosed and treated if you want to conceive. You could be having a multiple endocrine disorder affecting thyroid, adrenal, pancreas (diabetes), and ovaries. You need to consult an endocrine specialist and get this sorted out. Take care!",

    "question": "I am new here and have a question. I am 22 and have never had a period. I was diagnosed with PCOS three or four years ago. I never really thought anything of it. I was never sure if I wanted children and I had no problems with not having to deal with a period. I have moderate hirituism but I could deal with it. Recently I was in the hospital for another condition I have had since birth, everyday when they did the normal labs my blood glucose came back high. Doctors never mentioned it then and I had no clue that was the case until my sports medicine doctor at the university I attend mentioned it during my yearly sports physical. She tested my blood sugar that day and it was high again, yesterday I did the glucose tolerance test and I am waiting for the results. I am not sure if I am over reacting or if it is valid to be worried. Has anyone here been diagnosed with diabetes with PCOS? Did you know you had it/did you have symptoms or was it found with normal testing? What were the symptoms if you had them?",
