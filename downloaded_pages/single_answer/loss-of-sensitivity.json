    "question": "I'm hoping a doctor could respond to my question. 4 days ago i drank beer throughout the day and then fell asleep alittle drunk. I woke up in the morning with some pins and needles on my feet,arms, and legs, also my penis felt very less sensitive especially on the bottom near the head. The pins and needles have some what gone away. But i'm still experiencing decreased feeling in my penis. I'm not able to feel much on a sexual level,plus i cant get really hard. Could you tell me what this could be, and do you think it could temporary? As far as i know i dont have diabetes, or hypothyroidism. I have been drinking alittle heavy the past 2 weeks.",
