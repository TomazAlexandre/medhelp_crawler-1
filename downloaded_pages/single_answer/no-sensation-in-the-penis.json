            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include psychological factors such as stress/ anxiety/ depression, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in sexual dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors with your partner. You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, ; I would suggest seeing an internist or a urologist for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 45 year old man with very little to no sensation in the penis as far back as I can remember.\u00a0\u00a0Sexual Intercourse or oral sex really don't do anything for me.\u00a0\u00a0While I can ejaculate, it takes a while and I really don't feel anything and at the end there are no \"fireworks\" as some people describe.\u00a0\u00a0My Urologist told me there's nothing that can be done.\u00a0\u00a0However, researching online, I have come across taking Zinc Supplements (mega doses) can help and even low DHT levels can cause this.\u00a0\u00a0I am looking for what can cause this.Also, I have been tested for Diabetes and I am fine.\u00a0\u00a0I do have low Testosterone and am taking a Testosterone Replacement, but no difference. Even in my teens and early twenties when Testosterone is at its peak, there was very little to no sensation.\u00a0\u00a0Any assistance or direction would be helpful.",
