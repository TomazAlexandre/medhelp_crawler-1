            "answer": "If the calcium is high or high normal and the PTH is high and Vit D low -- you have primary hyperparathyroidism.You did not mention any specific thyroid labs and ultrasound blood flow is very subjective, so I would not read much into \"no blood flow\" with an otherwise normal appearing US.If the MRI does not show a pituitary mass, that is reassuring.\u00a0\u00a0Most empty sella syndromes actually have normal pituitary function in my experience and with the repeat MRI being normal, this is even questionable.Addison's would usually have adrenal antibodies -- might be nice to document this.\u00a0\u00a0With the Ehlers Danlos and chronic pain -- endocrine labs may look abnormal at times, which may further complictate the picture.Starting with the high PTH level makes the most sense at this point.",

    "question": "My endo. did an ultrasound of my thyroid in her office. Except of \"no blood flow\" she said it looked normal so the \"problems\" must be coming from the pituitary\". I tried asking questions about what could be wrong, etc. however, she said \"we would probably never know\" &that it would probably \"never change or improve\". I also have problems with Addisons, repeatedly high PTH labs, Diabetes now, low VitD, 1MRI\u00a0\u00a0saying I had Empty Sella but have had normal MRIs since&also a few other abnormal ENDO. labs. Should I be satisfied with this answer regarding the pituitary and thyroid? Are all these problems related? They have all come up within the last 3 years or so.\u00a0\u00a0My PCP has sent me to three different ENDOs and recently even to the Mayo Clinic where the ENDO felt I had too many \"rare things wrong for them to all be true\" so he \"didn't believe any of them\". I also have Ehlers Danlos.Help plz. Have no $ for more docs as my health is going downhill and the costs are rising! Thank you so much for any health or direction. I am so exhausted all the time now and am in chronic pain from the Ehlers Danlos.",
