            "answer": "Hello,There can be many causes of itchy skin. It can be due to dermatitis and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0. Since you are having easy bruisability also, so your liver needs to be evaluated and for this liver function tests need to be done.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch. Lastly, Phototherapy can also be tried. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "My itching started about 2 years ago. First on my arms. Now it's gotten alot worse and it's all over my body. Some days my legs and arms, some days my torso. Other days everything I touch starts itching, even my scalp. I've been to the dermatologist 3 times about this. They've prescribed creams, pills and even twice I received injections.Don't remember what the injections were.Nothing helped. Usually, I don't have ahy trouble when I go to bed. This made me think it was nerves, but last night I had a miserable time. Legs and arms mostly. I try not to scratch, just rub, but sometimes that's just not enough. I'm 71 years old and my skin can't handle alot. I bruise easily and leave ugly marks wherever I scratch. Any advice would be welcome.",
