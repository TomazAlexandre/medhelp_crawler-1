            "answer": "The inhaled forms of cortisone are effective for the optimum management of asthma and, for the most part are safe, not associated with the side effects that are commonly seen with the sustained use of oral steroids.\u00a0\u00a0However, side effects (puffy face, skin fragility, diabetes, suppression of normal adrenal gland function and osteoporosis) to name a few have been reported, especially with the higher doses of inhaled steroids.You would do well to speak to your doctor about these complications so that he/she may give consideration to the possibility of side effects.Also, you can continue to use the Ventolin occasionally, as a rescue medication, without fear of overdosing when used along with the long-acting form of beta-agonist tied to the steroid in Symbicort.Good luck",

    "question": "Hello,I suffer from asthma roughly 40 years now and since about 5 years I'm inhaling the Symbicort 160 almost one time a day. My doctors say because it's inhaled, the cortisone has virtually no side effects. Since I'm taking this medicine I stopped taking Ventilan (aerosol) and it really works very well. Anyway, after so much tame taking it, I decided once again to ask if it's really so safe as I was told or if there are some complication I should expect in the future due to side effects?Thank you very muchN.",
