            "answer": "What are the reference ranges for the labs?\u00a0\u00a0Ranges vary lab to lab and have to come from your husband's own report.Instead of testing T3, your doctor needs to be ordering Free T3, which is not the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0T3 is total T3 and much of that is bound to protein and is unavailable.\u00a0\u00a0Free T3 shows how much is actually free to used by the individual cells.Why does the doctor want to wait 3 months to begin testosterone?\u00a0\u00a0Did they start him on insulin, as well, since they diagnosed Type I diabetes?If he thinks your husband has Hashimoto's/Graves, all he has to do is order some simple antibody tests to confirm/rule them out.\u00a0\u00a0Antibody tests to confirm/rule out Hashimoto's are Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOab) and Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TGab).\u00a0\u00a0The only definitive test for Graves Disease is Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin.While Hashimoto's is, typically, associated with hypothyroidism, it can be characterized by periods of hyper, in the beginning stages. Hyper phases of Hashimoto's are often mistaken for Graves Disease.\u00a0\u00a0Ask for the antibody tests, so you can find out what's going on.The pancreas, thyroid and growth hormones are all part of the endocrine system, and your husband is low in multiple hormones, the chance is pretty great that he actually has a pituitary issue, or possibly hypothalamus problem.Your husband has actual medical issues and until he gets proper treatment, there isn't anything he can do about his low libido.The best way for you support him, is to stay strong, be understanding and don't make him feel guilty about his libido; I'm sure he loves you and would love to have a \"normal\" relationship with you.\u00a0\u00a0Be patient, but keep researching and insisting that the doctors do what they need to, without wasting time.The first thing I'd insist on knowing is why the doctor wants to wait 3 months to start treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure it will take a while for him to get well, but if he started treatment now, he could be well into into it, by the end of 3 months.",
