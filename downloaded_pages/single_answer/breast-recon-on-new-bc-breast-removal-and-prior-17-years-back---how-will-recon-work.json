            "answer": "There are many happy stories out there. The drains staying in for a month is not a complication, but should be an expectation. Many of my patients do go back to work within 4 weeks of surgery, but usually 1/2 day at first. The capsular scarring can occur, but usually less than 5% of the time. Infections can occur in anyone any time they have surgery. There are many things to consider, but the good things generally far outweigh the bad, and you sound healthy, and would have lower risk factors. Good luck.arch s miller ms md facs",
