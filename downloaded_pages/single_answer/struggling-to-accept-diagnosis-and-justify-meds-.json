            "answer": "I think that feeling the way you do is natural for many people when they are diagnosed. Working with diabetes patients I see the same thing. I see people all the time who call newly diagnosed saying that they weren't fasting, so the blood test is wrong. But when I look at the their labs their tests are like in the 200s, 300s, 400s.... normal is around 85, after you eat normal is rarely higher than 120. So it doesn't matter that they were not fasting.But they are afraid of the same things. They are angry and grieving and not wanting to take medicine for the rest of their lives. Some of them need to be on insulin for type 2, often their pancreas is just broken down too much. Those people feel like failures, but they're not. Diabetes is a progressive disease.People try to pretend they have nothing wrong, don't take their meds, don't diet, don't try. They don't want to be different than Diabetes and mental illness are similar in that you can put it in the back of your mind and decide when you want to deal with it. The only problem is that both diabetes and mental illness are still there. And there can be complications.So, take care and be careful. Maybe you are okay now, but maybe in the future you could have a relapse. One of the best times in my life when I thought I was fine and healed, I was actually having crazy delusions and thought they were 100% real. Now when I look back I realize I was not fine, just because I wasn't depressed.",

    "question": "How can I learn to accept my diagnosis, I have had 4 doctors tell me I am definatley Bipolar but still I have this nagging feeling that I am not and that I shouldnt be taking all these meds, I am better now, I think when I was sick I had just had a nervous breakdown, I cant seem to accept that I had a \"episode\" I know logically what they say makes sence and that yes I can look back and relate bipolar to my life but something in me wont just accept the diagnosis, im not worried about being labled \"mentally ill\" or anything I have no problem with that, I just cant seem to accept the maintenance regime of taking meds all my life, I feel as ok as I think I can, all I have now is some risidual depression now and again with side effects from the meds being my main problem. how did you accept finally your illness, my main problem is that I didnt think I had a problem, I thought I was just a little quirky at times and was an up and down type of girl, I miss who I was before the meds. please any comments would be appreciated I am seeing my doc in two weeks and at this stage I just want to tell him I want off the meds.",
