            "answer": "Tammy the main thing w. the docs is that they are trying i believe to decide what is the most acute issue that is going on w. your dad.\u00a0\u00a0They have to weigh out the options of which issue is the most life threatening for him and to act on it.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds to me like your dad is probably at a teaching hospital and that is why you have so many docs in and out of his room.\u00a0\u00a0This can obviously be very disconcerting to people.\u00a0\u00a0You do have the right to ask for a single doc to handle his case because you can't handle all fo this confusion.\u00a0\u00a0In this case you are actually looking at two docs....one for the heart and one for the kidney issues.\u00a0\u00a0If it were my dad i would put a stop to this circus because it sounds like it is just making it worse on you and your family.\u00a0\u00a0To me the heart would be the big issue now because he just suffered a heart attack and that is life threatening at the moment.\u00a0\u00a0The one thing you do not want to have happen is for him to suffer another one so soon after because of the end results.\u00a0\u00a0I would put my foot down and tell the chief of staff at the hospital that you would like to meet with him/her and tell them what you are going thru.\u00a0\u00a0You can bet they will put an end to this...a hospitals job is not meant to make things harder physically or emotionally on pts. and their families.\u00a0\u00a0Call the chief of staff and go to the top dog instead of climbing the ladder w. the case manager which still keeps you at the bottom rung and may just add more aggravation to you and your family.\u00a0\u00a0Godspeed to you all and i hope it works out for you Tammy",

    "question": "My father has been diagnosed with 90% blockage in three valves, has diabetes, pneumonia and Chronic Kidney Disease - (creatinine levels between 2.1 and 2.8).\u00a0\u00a0He experienced a heart attack 9 days ago and has been hospitalized since.\u00a0\u00a0 There are 5 groups of doctors and the plan of action has changed daily and each is giving a varied opinion on whether or not he is ready for a triple by-pass.\u00a0\u00a0 Mostly they say he HAS\u00a0\u00a0to have the surgery, but the surgeon is not confident about the outcome with current conditions and a cardiologist told us today that he can opt out.\u00a0\u00a0We are so confused.\u00a0\u00a0 Where can we look for answers and is it appropriate to ask for a case manager to put this all together.\u00a0\u00a0 Five different doctors come in daily with different opinions.\u00a0\u00a0It is a roller coaster.\u00a0\u00a0 My father is 72 - this is the first heart issue but has had diabetes for\u00a0\u00a017 years and elevated kidney proteins for 5 years.THANKS!",
