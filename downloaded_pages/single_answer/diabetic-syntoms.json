            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You could be having urinary tract infection. Yes, diabetes too is a possibility. So get blood sugar tested and also get urine examined. If you have been sexually active and had unprotected sex, then get a STD panel too. Chronic fatigue syndrome, emotional stress, panic disorder are the other possibilities.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
