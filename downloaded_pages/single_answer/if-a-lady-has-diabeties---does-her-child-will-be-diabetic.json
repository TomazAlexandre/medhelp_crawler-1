            "answer": "The genetics of Type 1 diabetes is complex; just in general there needs to be an environmental stimulus as well as a genetic predisposition. The percentages aren't high but the possibility exists. If you google Type 1 diabetes and genetics or pregnancy I'm sure you'll find a lot of information. Others who have given birth can respond but I do know that in order to have a healthy diabetic her blood sugar needs to be tightly controlled (more so than usual). I would talk more with her endocrinologist.",
