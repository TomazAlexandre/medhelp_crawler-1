    "question": "I looked and apparently people are pretty similar to me but never got any answers. For the past two days I've been seeing these purple or white specks appear that mostly appear at night. I also have floaters visual snow and mild after images. Just wondering because my dad has diabetes so retinopathy could be possible and I have PVD so retinal tears are possible as well. Going to see an ophthalmologist soon but is it worth the money from my parents or not. Also I'm 13 if that helps :)",
