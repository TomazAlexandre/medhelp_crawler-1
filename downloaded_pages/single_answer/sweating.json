            "answer": "Your husband needs to see a doctor ASAP for a complete health examination. Here's why; uncontrolled and unmanaged diabetes is one factor [obesity and poor nutrition are others] that can lead to restriction of blood flow [poor circulation].Heat transfer is done in two parts; conduction rate [inside the body [core] towards the skin surface] and transfer rate [skin surface to atmosphere].The body can increase the rate of heat transfer by either increasing its conduction rate or transfer rate. Conduction rate is greatly effected by the dilation and constriction of blood vessels, while transfer rate is a function of air temperature, perspiration, clothing, food and body position among other factors. If the core is restricted [poor circulation] transfer rate diminishes. This sounds like why your husband experiences \"constantly hot and sweating\" feelings.",
