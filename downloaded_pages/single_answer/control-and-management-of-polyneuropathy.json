    "question": "In 5 /2006 i was admitted with a bad alcohol problem. By the time i was discharged 8 /2007 i had developed diabetes II, and a poor liver.As time pasted i developed problems with my feet, calf, knees and all 10 fingers at the joints. I was diagnosed as having Axonal polyneruropathy in 6/2008.Since this problem was self induced by my own personal habits and not genetic is there a chance in hell i can salvage the parts that are still not damaged or revers the current situation. My liver has made a dramatic recovery since i dont drink at all now and i was hoping the pancrese would do the same to improve the diabetesPlease enlighten me with your medical expertise as i feel some of the Doctors work hard in my case are holding back something. I respect their medical ethics and their skills since they did bring me back to \"life\" but it makes me feel helplessly lost being kept in the dark about my future.Bond",
