            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. The symptoms are unlikely to be due to SVT. Since most of the symptoms involve the right side of your body you could having some neurological problem involving one half of your body. There is a chance that you have compression of the spinal nerves in the upper cervical spine region. This can happen due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, herniated disc, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. A MRI of the cervical spine (wonder what MRI you had) and nerve conduction studies may be required (these are often positive when MRI does not show any radiculopathy).The symptoms can also be due to transient ischemic attacks, so a MRI of the brain should also be done.Definitely the possibility of hypothyroidism, low vitamin B12 and diabetes should be looked at. Both can cause peripheral neuropathies. SLE can also cause peripheral neuropathy along with autoimmune mypopathy or pain in muscles and hence all diagnostic criteria for SLE should be worked up. Electrolyte imbalance should be checked.Multiple sclerosis is also a possibility. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
