If it goes to three months, call your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0They may want to do something to kick start it again.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",

    "question": "Hello ladies, I am a 30 year old female, 300+lbs @ 6'1 I am diagnosed with DI (Diabetes Insipidus). I found out I was pregnant May 2015 but unfortantly it was ectopic and I had to have my entire right tube removed. My husband and I found out again I was pregnant Feb 4th 2017. unfortantly due to my diabetes insipidus and obesity my doctor suggested it wasn't a good time to be pregnant until I lost the weight, and I did not go thru with the pregnancy. A D&C was preformed Feb 12th 2017 I was only 3-4weeks pregnant. I didn't have much bleeding or cramping after the surgery, but a few days later (Feb 15th 11pm to be exact) I was laying down and a gush of blood and cramps just creeped up on me (sorry for graphicity) I bled for 5 days HEAVY...but then stopped. I followed up with my gyno 2 days after the bleeding stopped and he did a pregnancy test and of course it was still positive, but the ultra sound was clear. The beginning of march (approx 2 weeks after my first gyno visit) I visited my gyno again and he did a preg test which was negative at this point.. no ultra sound, but said my normal period should arrive in a month or so. I continued my normal routine everyday and sometime that week my husband and I had sex and the condom broke! Well, as a responsible adult I went and bought plan b (approx 7 hrs after sex) and went on my merry way. Well 2 weeks went by in march and my husband and I had had sex again and the condom decided to stay inside in. I am having no luck with these condoms and due to my obesity the gyno does not want me on the pill and I can't start the mirena until my period starts! Ok, so we panicked again and took a emergency contraceptive called ella one. (It was free at planned parenthood) I had no symptoms with it, but 3 weeks later I took a pregnancy test and it was negative (but still no period) now, my husband and I aren't even having sex because we are scared of the condom issue and its ruining our marriage. So to take a longer story short, I have not had a period since 2/12/17. Besides the heavy bleeding 2/15-2/20. Which the gyno said it was only discharge from the D&C. My last preganancy test was 4/17/17. Negative. My last blood test was 4/3/17 and an ultra sound was 4/7/17. All were clear and negative.As of today 4/24 I am approx 10 weeks no period. The last time I had intercourse (and the condom broke) was 3/23 that is 33 days ago and I've taken ella the same day, all my tests, blood tests and ultrasound were negative and clear. I am having slight cramps here and there, loose bowel movements as well. And bloatedness. My question is ...is this normal? 10 weeks after a D&C no period? No spotting? But crampy. The gyno prescribed me provera last week....I took 4 pills (I was supposed to take the whole 10 for 10 days) but I had breathing issues and he told me to stop. I really want my period to start so I could go on mirena. Has anyone experienced this. I have looked up issues such as ammenorra...ashmens syndrome...etc. This isn't my first D&C. I had one at 17 years old as well. Maybe I have excess scar tissue? I am lost. Help please!!!",
