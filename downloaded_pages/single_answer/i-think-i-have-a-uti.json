            "answer": "Hello,First of all urinary tract infection should be ruled out. UTI is urinary tract infection and no gender is spared. The cause of most UTIs is bacteria that initially settle (colonise) around the urethra (urine tube), and then ascend into the rest of the urinary tract. Factors that can cause this to happen include incomplete urinary emptying, hygiene of the urethra, prostate inflammation, urethra narrowing, bladder reflux disease (usually due to leaky valves between the bladder and ureter tubes that connect to the kidneys and diabetes etc.Get complete urine examination and a urine culture done to confirm the diagnosis.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "For the past week, I have woken up in the morning with the intense urge to pee. After I do, the rest of the day I have a burning and itching sensation in my urethra. I also feel like I have to urinate all of the time. When I do urinate the feeling goes away for a minute, then comes back, sometimes more intense. I also have been having bad stomach pains and nausea. Does it sound to you guys like I have a urinary tract infection?",
