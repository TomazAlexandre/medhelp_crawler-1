    "question": "Posted By Jen Schiller on March 09, 1998 at 21:54:35:I posted a question about GBS, Vitamin B12 deficiency and Peripheral Neuropathy two weeks ago. On a form to my disability insurance company that my neurologist just completed he listed the primary diagnosis as \"melopathy\" and \"radiculo neuropathy (radiculopathy??)!\u00a0\u00a0His previous diagnosis was \"GBS variant\", or acute demylinating polyneuropathy. I looked up \"mylopathy\" - referred to degenerative changes in spinal cord ocurring as a complication of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I DON'T have diabetes!\u00a0\u00a0I could find no definition of \"radiculo neuropathy\", only \"radiculopathy\" - again referring to a herniated or prolapsed disc which compresses the radicular nerve. Is his \"new\" diagnosis consistent with GBS?\u00a0\u00a0Did I get the right definitions (it was from this site)? NOW I really am confused!! If my neurologist erred in confusing me with someone else, I need to get him to correct that diagnosis to my disability insurer!",
