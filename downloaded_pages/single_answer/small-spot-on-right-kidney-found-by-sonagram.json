            "answer": "Hi there,I may be able to confirm the exact cause of your symptoms only after a complete history, clinical examination and work up. The common possibilities are it could be a stone or a cyst. Most kidney cysts are simple and do not need any treatment. The symptoms of belching, nausea, left shoulder pain can indicate a gallbladder disease. An abdominal CT will help in detecting the exact cause. Treatment will depend on the cause. Do keep me posted.Best wishes and take care!",
