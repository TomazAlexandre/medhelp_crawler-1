            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your grand mother. Demyelinating neuropathies are conditions in which the myelin layer covering the nerve gets destroyed and is caused by many types of toxins, nerve disorders, autoimmune disorders etc. The most commonly known condition of this type is Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Other than this, if she has diabetes or thyroid problems or atherosclerosis or clotting disorders, then it can cause brain bleeds and hyperintense areas in brain on MRI\u2014all these can also case many neurological symptoms. All these findings means she must be having nerve and muscle weakness, which could be progressive in nature. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
