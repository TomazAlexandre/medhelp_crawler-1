            "answer": "Hi!I know I'm fumbling in the dark, but yes I have a neat sort of tremble on my hands occassionally. It happens most when I've run a lack of sleep, if I've eaten regulary a day before and happen to skip the 4-th hour meals - basically when my bloodsugar tells me it needs refill. Oh, and it happens that I drink too much coffee and get an overdose of caffeine ;-)I know this can happen of numerous causes but it really is hard to pinpoint any specifics...My husband has trembling too. His family runs diabetes-2, but he hasn't got it. His history includes drug-abuse though, even if it is many years ago that's a latter effect he'll have to struggle with.I hope you get control of it.Florena",
