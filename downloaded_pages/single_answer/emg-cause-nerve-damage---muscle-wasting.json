            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Since the feeling is in arm and now you feel it in leg as well, it can be due to pinched nerves, low vitamin B12,\u00a0\u00a0or peripheral neuropathies including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Please consult your doctor regarding this before opting or deciding in favor of surgery. Also along with physiotherapy, acupressure, spinal manipulation, traction, swimming etc may also help.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "A yr ago I had an emg study done on my left arm. (Having tingling sensation from my thumb up mid arm that's why for emg) After the test I felt fine till later that evening. Everywhere the dr stuck that needle in my arm, neck, shoulder blade started to burn. Never had that pain before, called my pcp and he consulted neuro. The next day my muscle in my arm started twitching then muscle wasting. My arm is always in pain, no muscle mass from my hand through my left side of back, and weak. Finally seen neuro said it was muscle not nerves. Had 3 MRI's said I had spinal stenosis. Seen orthopedic wants to do c spine surgery. My gut is telling me not to do surgery. I have done physical therapy and they never seen anything like it. It's now running down my left hip and leg. I don't want to do surgery if it won't benefit me. I felt ok till I had emg done. Had this happened to anyone and what did you do?",
