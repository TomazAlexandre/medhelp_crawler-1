    "question": "Hi everyone,I don't have a question.Allow me to introduce myself. I'm a 33 year old female and have been diabetic for 15 years now. I also have been on the pump for almost 5 years. I wouldn't say my diabetes is under good control, although it's much better than my pre-pump days. I have decided to blog about my day-to-day struggles with Juvenile Diabetes for a year (I started on February 1st), recording every sugar reading and trying to ultimately bring down my A1c to under 7 (I just had my blood test done and it's 7.6). I struggle to keep my sugar within the normal range, although I technically know what to do - it's just so hard to be on top of it 24/7 and to get it right every time. I'm not shooting for perfection, but I am trying to come as close as possible. I have also started to write an e-book about my experiences as a Type 1, but that's a separate project.Thanks everyone and wishing you all the best of health!",
