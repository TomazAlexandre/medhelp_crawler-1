            "answer": "Hi!While the symptoms can be due to gut cancer (exact location is difficult to tell), they can also be due to irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn\u2019s, diabetes (if uncontrolled) and even due to ovarian cancer. Hence, along with tests to rule out these possibilities, it is important to test for ovarian cancer markers. Also, ask your doctors whether your medications for bipolar are causing these symptoms. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
