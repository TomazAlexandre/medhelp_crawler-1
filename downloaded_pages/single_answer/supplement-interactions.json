            "answer": "Hi \"HandyHusband\"... boy we could all use a handy husband!! :o)Welcome to our Senior Health Community. I did a bit of research on your question and here's what I found. Remember I am not a physician or an expert.Antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs (blood-thinners). Adding a supplement such as Tumeric may interfere with any blood-thinning drugs. Some of these meds are: Warfarin (Coumadin), Clopidogrel (Plavix) and Aspirin.It may also interfere with the action of drugs that reduce stomach acid. Some of these drugs are : Cimetidine (Tagamet), Famotidine (Pepcid), Ranitidine (Zantac), Esomeprazole (Nexium), Omeprazole Lansoprazole (Prevacid),Drugs that lower blood sugar (for diabetes) can also be effected by the addition of\u00a0\u00a0Turmeric.PLEASE do not take this or ANY supplement without first consulting your PCP (Primary Care Physician) and I would include my Pharmacist.I am not an expert and this information may not be complete and is never a substitute for talking and consulting with your physician.My Best to You,~Tuck",
