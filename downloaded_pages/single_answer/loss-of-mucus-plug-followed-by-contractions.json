    "question": "Today I lost a huge chunk of my mucus plug. And now I have had lower back pains on and off and quite a few contractions. Anyone else have that? And how long was it before you went into labor? I will be 36 weeks Saturday. But I have gestational diabetes and he's huge already. Weighing in at 7lbs 8 ounces. And my doc said he has a lot of amniotic fluid and he's measuring two weeks ahead which can cause early labor.",
