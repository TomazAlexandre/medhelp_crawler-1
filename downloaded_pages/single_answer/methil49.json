            "answer": "Hi,Some people do nto respond as well(or at all) to the pills we have available to treat diabetes, and so they need to go on to insulin. I am sure this seems like a big, somewhat concerning step to you, but take heart. The main goal here is to get you healthy and to do that means getting your sugars controlled. Insulin administration is quite different from taking your pills, but millions of people around the world do this everyday and do just fine. So will you, if it comes to that. Keep your mind on the goal--staying healthy.You can, and should, continue to try to watch your diet and exercise. This will help as well.Take care and feel free to write in with any questions that you may have.",

    "question": "I am at present a type 2 diabetic but although I take loads of pills my blood sugar level is not coming down, so I have to attend the clinic with a view to using insulin instead of pills. This is very worrying to me and I wondered if there was anything else I can do to lower my blood sugar?",
