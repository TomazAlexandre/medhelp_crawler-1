    "question": "I do not have MS, no Dx anyway. 2 docs i the past 2 years have suspected possable MS or similar. I have a form of double vision for decades, since HS era and wear prisms (4 bases), more common to MS than diabetes.I had an eye apt last week, another doc that wil NOT deal with prisms. Since its more common with MS than diabetes I tried docs names I got from NMS?, Took a few calls to find one, a neuro-opty that would but my ins will NOT cover it with them. MY ins co gave me a couple choices, but NONE of them will deal with nero-optical issues.......IF? I understood the ins lady right, I could be covered if a neuro in system requested (and got approval) to send me to the out-of-system clinic. I am getting a bit frustrated, jsut trying to get in to what I NEED!I already have a fairly full plate with diabetes (5 shots/day), stage-3 CKD (now holding), 2 leaky heart valves, Mr Mitral being the worse, vestibular problems and more. I am afraid if I complain about anything more my PCP will express me to the rubber-room, so I have not said a word about my hand putting on a silent song and dance show while I watch in amsuement in my lazyboy. Then he would KNOW I ahve gone crazy!(*&*( GOMER",
