            "answer": "Hi there!Early morning nausea/ vomiting could be related to GI infections, inflammations, GERD, hormonal/ endocrine issues, growths/ masses, autoimmune conditions, neurological causes, drug/ medication side effect etc. While a few of these have been ruled out in your case, others would need to be evaluated for as well. Nose bleeds could be related to trauma or vascular causes such as hypertension etc. Headaches could be primary such as migraines, secondary such as due to sinusitis or related to cranial neuralgias. Mouth ulcers again could be related to infections, micronutrient deficiencies, primary skin conditions etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary care physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
