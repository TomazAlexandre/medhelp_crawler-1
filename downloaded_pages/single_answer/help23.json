            "answer": "If you are awakening at night\u00a0\u00a0to void large amounts of urine and go frequently during the daytime, then I would consider several possibilities. Large fluid intake is probably the most common cause as is your choice of fluids: coffee and alcohol will cause increased urine output as will \u201cwater\u00a0\u00a0 pills\u201d (diuretics). Diabetes mellitus can also be a cause but the urine would not appear dilute. Diabetes\u00a0\u00a0insipidus, a failure of the kidneys to keep water in the body, can be caused by the kidneys themselves or a failure of hormone production (vasopressin, or ADH\u2014antidiuretic hormone).All of these problems are correctable, but you will have to go to physician\u00a0\u00a0t get evaluated..Good luck!,S.A.
