Could you monitor your glucose with the home monitor daily instead? I believe they are covered by most insurance companies.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you could mention your insurance is wondering why all the testing is being done and that your concerned they will stop paying for it. I hope you find a solution.",

    "question": "I'm 31 weeks pregnant with my first baby. I started my pregnancy overweight, and my doctor has had me tested MULTIPLE times for gestational diabetes. I was tested approximately 8 weeks earlier than the average, probably because of my size. I was told after my 1 hour test that my results were within the normal range, but slightly elevated. To my dismay, my doctor ordered a 3 hour glucose tolerance test. When I was given those results, I was told that all of my blood draw results were within the normal range, but that ONE (out of the 4) was slightly elevated...and my doctor asked me to get the 1 hour test re-done. After that test, I was told that my result was, again, slightly elevated...and my doctor is, again, telling me to get the 3 hour test. I'm worried that my dr is ordering unnecessary testing based solely on my size, because that is my ONLY risk factor for gestational diabetes. I've done a lot of reading about gestational diabetes and it looks like overweight women are often misdiagnosed because many healthcare providers assume that they will develop gd at some point in their pregnancy. This can lead to stress about monitoring their blood sugar levels, early and unnecessary induction, and emergency (or unnecessary)\u00a0\u00a0c-sections. I already suffer from anxiety issues and am very easily stressed out. I was sent to a nutritional specialist at 9 weeks who gave me a gestational diabetic meal plan and sample menu immediately, which is only adding to my suspicions that I'm being treated and diagnosed based off of my weight and not my actual test results.I've been so terrified of gaining too much weight that I haven't given in to a single pregnancy craving. I've stopped baking, which is one of my favorite hobbies, because I'm worried that I'll eat too much dessert and gain too much weight. Over Thanksgiving week, approximately 6 days at mymother-in-law's house, I lost almost 2lbs because I was worried about eating too much. My husband is worried I'm not eating enough, and my dr is doing nothing to help me feel better, instead giving me the \"bad mom stare\" every time I question his reasoning. My husband is military, so I don't have the option to just find a new provider. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",
