    "question": "Changed Docs see new doc on monday. 26weeks now. I need all blood work still and diabetes test. The doc i was seeing since 7 weeks did nit do crap and jyst found out she is gone from that clinic!! too late already found a new doc!!! Anyways my previous pregnancy almost 11 yrs ago was an emergwncy c section. I was cut low. How dangerous is a VBAC? currently this pregnancy I already had marginal placenta previa but my last appointment the fraternal fetal medicine doctor that does the ultrasounds didn't mention that it was still hanging low. I will see him on the 27th and my new doctor I just picked I will see you on the 24th & meet him for the first time. he will be the one that does the delivery. What questions should I ask the Dr about a VBAC? Has anybody ever had a problem when they went to have a VBAC? I read about it and it seems dangerous! How is it safer than another c section? Im nervous. I do want to deliver vaginally. I want t. Heal faster then a c section!",
