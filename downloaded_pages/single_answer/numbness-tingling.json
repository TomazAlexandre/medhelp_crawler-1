            "answer": "Hi Rosie,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved appears to be originating from Cervical and Lower Lumbar Vertebrae. Arm sensation from shoulder suggests disruption of nerve supply from group of nerves called Brachial Plexus and leg sensation appears to originate from Sciatic nerve.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your case I feel it is compressive pathology which is causing symptoms.I think you should consult a physician to evaluate your case.If required MRI scan.Alternatively you can start taking Multivitamin supplements.Bye.",
