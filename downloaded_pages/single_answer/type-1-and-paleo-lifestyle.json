            "answer": "Hi there!Well; weight control, rather than weight loss/ gain should be the goal of diabetic control. While some may have a tendency of losing/ gaining weight faster than others, the aim of a healthy diet and exercise should be to maintain a healthy BMI. If you have taken to a healthy dies and regular exercise, it is always advised to stick with it, even though the results may be slower than others. In case you still have trouble maintaining a healthy BMI, it might be suitable to consider an evaluation for other hormonal issues that could affect the BMI and for appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "After 2 years of not so great control (I was always around 5.6% and have spent the last two between and 8 and 11%), I decided to begin the pale lifestyle as a challenge with some friends.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugars are near perfect - a few highs due to pump site issues, but nothing compared to what I have been dealing with the last two years.\u00a0\u00a0I am extremely happy about the control and will continue this way of eating.\u00a0\u00a0I have not wavered at all on the diet; however, my friends are losing tons of weight and I have haven't moved the scale one bit.\u00a0\u00a0More than 10 people on our challenge have lost more than 10 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I workout at least 4-5 days per week (30 min stair mill high intensity and weightlifting). I have always been able to put on muscle quickly; however, it is very discouraging when so many around me are losing so much weight and I'm not budging. I understand that once you get your diabetes under control there is often a period of weight gain which I did not have.\u00a0\u00a0This is my 38th day on the paleo plan.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts or guidance? - I'm not giving up, but just frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0I have always been an intense athlete and after a harsh domestic violence related divorce and serious surgery - I am trying to get back on the bandwagon.",
