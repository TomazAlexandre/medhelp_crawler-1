    "question": "I am the primary caretaker of my mother. She has severe COPD and we are now seeing an Internal Medicine Dr. The Dr did some test and we are now anemic and a Diabetic on top of the COPD, She has been on steroids for 8 years and can not come off them. We tried to slowly take the steroids away but she has a very difficult time breathing without them and losses all energy. Can the anemia and diabetes be a contributing factor from the steroid use over the years?\u00a0\u00a0And what am I looking at in the future with her from the steroid use?",
