            "answer": "In southern california I would try the Didi Hirsch mental health service in Los Angeles. If you are not in Los Angeles, they can make an appropriate referral.If you don't think the medication is working, you should go back to your doctor for a dose change or a medication change.\u00a0\u00a0I would not try herbals. They have not been studied. This is a serious problem that requires the best medical care.\u00a0\u00a0There are doctors who specialize in this problem so be sure and go to a well qualified expert.",

    "question": "My son has recently been told that he has schizophrenia. He's 21 years old and a very mellow fellow.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors perscribed Zyprexa, which he has been taking for 2 mos.\u00a0\u00a0We have noticed a more withdrawn behavior ( not much social inter-action ) and my question is:\u00a0\u00a0Is there a more \"Natural - herbal\" form of medicine out there that will do the same thing as the Zyprexa.\u00a0\u00a0I did start him on a sublinial vitimin B-12 called \"Trivita\", which he's been on for 1 year and it seemed to motivate him. We do have a history of diabetes so the blood sugar level is a concern, also, if anyone know's of a support group (Southern California area) for my son to join and talk to others with this disorder that would be helpful.thanks,csd",
