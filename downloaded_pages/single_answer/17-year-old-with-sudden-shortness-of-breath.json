            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The simplest reason for you daughter\u2019s symptoms could be anemia. This can cause shortness of breath and rapid pulse, more pronounced at certain times than others.The other possibility is hypoglycemia, due to irregular and inadequate meals.The third possibility is gastric reflux or GERD. Again this can be due to to irregular and inadequate meals.Endocrine problems like hyperthyroid states, diabetes and hormonal imbalance can be the other causes.You can discuss this with the doctor when you meet him. It is difficult to comment beyond this on net.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My 17 year old daughter who has been extremely healthy all her life, very athletic, and full of energy recently started complaining of episodes of shortness of breath and rapid pulse.\u00a0\u00a0Her symptoms seem to be unrelated to physical activity although she plays soccer and tennis.\u00a0\u00a0I thought maybe it was an allergic reaction to something at first but we can't find any common links between the onset of her symptoms and any specific trigger. This morning she sent me a text message from school saying she was just sitting in class and started having difficulty getting a full breath, her pulse was racing and her hands were shaking.\u00a0\u00a0It lasted 45 minutes or so and went away on it's on.\u00a0\u00a0She doesn't have any chest pain and says her symptoms are fairly mild (although she describes the whole thing as \"very uncomfortable\") .\u00a0\u00a0She can't get a good, deep breath, but it's not so bad that she feels faint or light-headed.She doesn't smoke (that I know of!!) doesn't drink caffinated beverages, never had a history of any type of social anxiety or anxiety of any kind.\u00a0\u00a0She's athletic, makes good grades, and has always been an all around happy, healthy kid.We have a doctor's appointment set up next week but I was just curious what in the world this could be and whether or not I should restrict her from participating in sports until we find out what's going on. This all started a couple of weeks ago and seems to be happening with increased frequency.\u00a0\u00a0I am not prone to running to a doctor over every little bump, bruise, or symptom.\u00a0\u00a0I usually just take a \"wait and see\" approach to most things but I have to be honest, this one has me a little worried.",
