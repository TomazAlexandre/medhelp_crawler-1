            "answer": "Hi! I am really sorry to hear about your miscarriages and can empathize with the psychological trauma and grief.Well, women are known to conceive immediately after a miscarriage. However, since you are having repeated abortions, please try and find the cause first to have a safe full term pregnancy.Generally first trimester abortions or abortions occurring in first three months are due to fetal abnormality, genetic causes, Rh blood group incompatibility and low progesterone hormone. Infection of the uterus, endometriosis, fibroids, etc\u00a0\u00a0are some other causes for early abortion.You must also investigate the causes of abortion in second trimester like chromosomal abnormalities (you are having genetic testing); infections like listeria, rickettsia, toxoplasma, mycoplasma, viral infections (herpes, rubella, CMV, HbAv), local infections (cervicitis, endometritis) and malaria; cervical dilatation; multiple pregnancies; leiomyomas, fibroids and anomalies of uterus; diabetes; hypertension; smoking; renal diseases; polycystic ovary; hormonal disturbances; and in some cases the cause is not known.You need to consult your gynecologist and run some tests to rule out these causes. Take care!",
