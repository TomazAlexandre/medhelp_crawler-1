            "answer": "Hello.The weakness in your left arm and left leg could be due to the viral fever you had. You probably have not recovered completely from the illness. Many viral fever leave behind malaise and weakness after the acute stage has passed.Also during active fever, a lot of muscle mass is lost. This could show up as thinning of the limbs.Twitches in the muscles are mostly reactions to stress. Your muscles were used to perform much more before the illness. After you have recovered completely from the illness, the twitches will disappear.Things will be clearer after the investigations. Get back on the forum after you have the results.Regards",

    "question": "I am 29 years old. Over the last month I have developed twitches all over my body. It started with back of the leg/calves spasms that feel like worms moving around. Two weeks later I started twitching all over my body. It is very annoying!!!! I can still run about a mile but I do tire easily now. I must note that two weeks prior to the \"worms\" in my legs I had a fever for two days and felt sick for 1 1/2 weeks. I seem to have weakness in my left arm and leg, my left hand seems to have gotten smaller along with my left forearm. I am terrified that I have ALS! Do you think this could be post Viral? Could it be MS? I have an MRI tomorrow and an EMG on Friday. I passed all the office exams given by the neuro, and my blood work is fine. Checked for thyroid, diabetes, etc. Any insight would be appreciated.",
