    "question": "Hey all,I've had Type 1 Diabetes since I was 9 months old; I'm not eighteen, almost nineteen. Earlier this year, I had thought about using marijuana at a party but decided against it because I wasn't with friends I trusted and overall didn't trust myself. Now, I've been thinking about it lately. It would be with one of my friends who I've known for years and really trust him, he also knows about my diabetes and what needs to be done in an emergency. Now, before you say something, my friends are not pressuring me to do it. It's all my decision whether to do it or not.I haven't done it yet, I'm just trying to get information before I make the decision. I've read up on the effects, and found different opinions on it all. What I've found is that it doesn't necessarily effect Diabetes in a negative way, but it's the munchies you need to watch out for. Now I'm responsible with my Diabetes, I've had ups and downs but that's a part of having it. I've thought that it would be a good idea to eat some protein so I have that in my system before I try it, and since it affects your blood sugar by making it \"low\", I also thought I'd have a bottle of juice with me to drink every now and then.Please don't judge me on wanting to try it. It's part of being a young adult. I don't plan on trying drinking EVER because of all the negative effects it has and hardcore drugs are just stupid. Just tell me whether what I have planned is good or not, if you have experience that would also be helpful. This is all for recreation, like maybe once or twice a month. If that.Thanks for your responses.",
