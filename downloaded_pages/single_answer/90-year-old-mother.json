            "answer": "Hi,Thank you for writing in on your Mom's behalf.Has your Mom's blood sugar been checked while she is having these symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0It may be too high, or even too low for her. At her age, even though she is quite active, we usually loosen\u00a0\u00a0diabetes control a little so that we can avoid low blood sugars, whch can be very dangerous especially in this age group(causing falls etc). If your Mom is still driving, I would suggest suspending this for a while until you figure out what is going on.If her sugars are fine, other things to review would include her blood pressure and medication side effects. Definitely speak with her doctor about this again before you leave town to see if there something else he/she would suggest doing.Take care.",
