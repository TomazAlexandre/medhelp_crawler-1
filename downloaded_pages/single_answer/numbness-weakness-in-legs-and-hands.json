            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!This could be due to a pathology either in the lumbar spine area or in sacral spine area. Problems like degenerative disc disease, herniated discs and spinal stenosis should be looked into. Maybe you should seek another opinion. Two other conditions, piriformis syndrome and sacroiliac joint dysfunction, can also cause leg pain and numbness.The clue to right treatment is right diagnosis of the cause of pain. You should discuss these possibilities with your doctor (PCP) and get a referral for a sports clinic and consult a sports medicine specialist.",

    "question": "My mom is 63 and has been suffering with numbness and weakness in her left leg, with pain in her left upper thigh, for the past ten years. It has gotten worst with time that she is unable to walk some days. She took an MRI scan recently but nothing was detected. She has gone to several doctors seeking medical attention but no one has been able to say what is wrong with her. She does not suffer with diabetes, heart problems, hypertension or any other medical problems besides the one I mentioned.Can you say what is wrong with her and what procedure if any can be taken for her to walk properly again?",
