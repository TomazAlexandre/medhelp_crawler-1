    "question": "In the 80's I have Epstein Barr Virus which left me fatigued for years, after about 7 years I improved. I was drinking several Diet Dr. Pepper per day and believe the Aspertame sweetner in the drinks kicked in the Multiple Sclerosis, I have had Psoriasis for years and now I have Type two diabetes...needless to say, I am not pleased with the situation but I have to believe that all these autoimmune manifestations are due to a single problem. I had a weird joint thing with my knee and was prescribed Celebrex. I am also convinced that this medication did me no favors. I know that the Epstein Barr Virus attaches itself to the B cells and the immune system does not recognize itself as a problem which allows the virus to go unchecked. Is it possible that the B-cells are somehow damaged and allowed the Epsein Bar Virus to take hold and the B-cell problem is responsible for the other manifestations? Considering all the autoimmune convergences that I am experiencing I am doing pretty well. But I am really tired of all the complications nd would love to discover that all I have to do is add \"nutmeg\" or something like that to my iet nd I would be cured!!! I have chronic sinusitis and have been 30 - 50 lbs overweight since I was 9 years old. I gained 30 lbs in three months at 9 years old which was unexplained at the time.",
