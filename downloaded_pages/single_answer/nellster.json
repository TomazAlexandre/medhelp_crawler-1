            "answer": "There is no research that I am aware of regarding safety.\u00a0\u00a0Chromium has recently been shown to decrease the absorption of thyroid hormone medication, so anyone taking chromium should do so at a different time (usual recommend 4 hours apart) from thyroid med.\u00a0\u00a0 Selenium may decrease antibodies against the thyroid but a recent small study suggested it may increase the risk of diabetes....Would ask the pediatrician about selenium and chromium safety for breast feeding - there is probably no data for or against it.No specific diets -- I tend to like diets that minimize simple starches and emphasize complex carbs, lean meats and low fat approach -- portion control/calories remain the key to \"diet\" (I prefer \"habbits\" rather than \"diets\").",
