            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Stiffening of the ventricles and the resulting abnormal ventricular filling during diastole are referred to as diastolic dysfunction. This occurs due to hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, aortic stenosis and restrictive/hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So, therapy is aimed at investigating the cause for the dysfunction and treating it. So, discuss with your doctor about ruling out the other causes for this dysfunction.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
