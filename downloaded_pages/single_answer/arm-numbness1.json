            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The numbness could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar/median nerve at the elbow level. Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of nerves and rheumatism can all cause numbness. Reverse numbness (compression is at wrist but numbness is felt higher up) is also seen if there is carpal tunnel syndrome. Please consult a neurologist. Take care!",
