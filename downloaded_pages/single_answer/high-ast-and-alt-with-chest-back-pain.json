    "question": "I am 27 weeks pregnant and have been suffering from an unusual pain waking me up in the middle of the night going from my chest (almost center, just a little to the right under the breast) thru to my back. I tried antacids, gas-x, and tylenol, being the only things i'm allowed to take. When I told my doctor she mentioned the possibility of gallstones and performed a liver function test. Last night I recieved a call from my doctor personally at 9:30pm, she said if I was still in pain to go to the hospital otherwise come in this morn for more blood work, I wasn't in pain so I went in and had blood drawn this morning. While she was on the phone she said my\u00a0\u00a0AST level was 163 and ALT level was 188, my pancreas test came back good as well as my diabetes test.Today they did a hepatitis panel, but I'm almost certain I do not have hepatitis, I do not drink and have never used needles nor had a blood transfusion. I have 2 tattoos but I got the first 9 yrs ago, and the 2nd 3 yrs ago. The 2nd one I got from my husband with a brand new needle that I took out of the package myself. I really don't think I have hepatitis, I've always thought I was a fairly healthy person, before my pregnancy 5'6\" 120lbs, ate the average diet, lots of veggies. What could cause the AST and ALT to be so elevated other than hepatitis? Could gallstones cause the elevated levels? Any input greatly appreciated, thank you very much!",
