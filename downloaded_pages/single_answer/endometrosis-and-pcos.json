            "answer": "There are newer types of birth control pills like Yaz or Yasmin that can help with PCOS. There is also the Nuvaring. There is also a Mirena IUD (intrauterine device). These can all be tried instead of Lupron.But if you are interested in getting pregnant, there is a fertility pill called Letrozole which is good for people who have PCOS and endometriosis.Of course IVF will give you the highest success rates for pregnancy for a history of PCOS and endometriosis.Metformin alone has not been shown to be superior to ovulation induction with clomiphene in women in PCOS. So if you do not have diabetes or prediabetes, ovulation induction with Clomiphene would be superior to Metformin alone.",
