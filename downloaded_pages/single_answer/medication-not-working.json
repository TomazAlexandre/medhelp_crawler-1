            "answer": "Hello ggray,So sorry you're having such troubles this week.\u00a0\u00a0We're all volunteers here with lots of diabetes experience, but none of us is a physician.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to check in with your endocrinologist (or get one, if your doctor is not) to help you figure out if the general comments you read here might apply.So, here's my first line of thinking ... What's different this past week?\u00a0\u00a0Health? Food? Stress? Activity? Weight? Weather?Especially in the summer time, a vial of insulin left out can become overheated - and depending on the conditions, that can happen very quickly.\u00a0\u00a0The action of insulin may be partly or completely destroyed because of it.\u00a0\u00a0If you have a fresh vial in the fridge, try that one instead and see how it goes for a day or so.If you are insulin dependent then oral meds alone are unlikely to keep you in good control, but a fresh vial of insulin can help you feel terrific pretty soon.\u00a0\u00a0If it turns out that \"overheated insulin\" is the culprit, then be extra diligent with your insulin vials/pens and be sure to have unopened vials in the fridge jsut in case.It also happens that over time, our metabolism changes and our needs change.\u00a0\u00a0That is usually a more gradual process than what you describe here.I would call your doctor on Monday morning and allow her/him to begin trouble-shooting with you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you'll have the time to let us know what helps you.",

    "question": "I have been diabetic for 4 years - only in the past year have been on shots. Insulin regimen did't work - doctor prescribed byetta. Have been taking 10mcg for about six months with great results. The past week has been a nightmare! Glucose levels keep increasing dramatically even after medication. Dr. prescribed actos as a helper but sugar levels are still unstable. I'm scared - what should I do and when should I call the dr.?",
