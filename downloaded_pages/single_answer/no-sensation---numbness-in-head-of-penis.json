    "question": "I am 18, and ever since I've been able to masturbate I've never been able to feel much of anything in the head of my penis. To be specific, I can kind of feel pain if I pinch it real hard, and I can almost feel some pleasure near the tip of the penis. The underside of my penis is sensitive, however. I did have a varacocele surgery done 2 years ago, but the numbness was present before that. Is this some kind of birth defect? Thanks for any help or advice.",
