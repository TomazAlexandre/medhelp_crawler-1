            "answer": "Apple cider vinegar is one of those old school remedies that has come back into vogue recently. People claim it fixes everything from lice to diabetes. There is no evidence to back many of the claims, but in the case of diabetes there is some evidence of a benefit. There was as small human study done where diabetics took a dose of apple cider vinegar before bed and saw a small percentage decrease in their morning blood sugar. Many of the other studies involving apple cider vinegar used rats, but these studies show some improvement in blood pressure, and cholesterol. All of these studies are very small and preliminary. I can't say for sure that it will help, but I have not seen evidence of harm.Cathy",
