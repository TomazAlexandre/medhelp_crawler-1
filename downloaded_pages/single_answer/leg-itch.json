    "question": "My legs began itching like crazy about a month ago.\u00a0\u00a0It's especially bad at night.\u00a0\u00a0Not every night but probably 3 to 4 times per week.\u00a0\u00a0Throughout the day the itch is not as bad but occurs occassionally.\u00a0\u00a0Earlier discussions had mainly women who had the symptoms but I'm a 55 year old healthy male.\u00a0\u00a0I use Gold Bond Body Lotion in the green bottle with \"anti-itch/skin protection\".\u00a0\u00a0Apply it in the morning and evening and always after a shower.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to help but doesn't guarantee the itch won't be there.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it gets worse immediately after applying the lotion but usually subsides 20 to 30 minutes after applications.\u00a0\u00a0Wearing pants or long pajama's also helps.\u00a0\u00a0The lotion has a cooling quality which definitely helps.\u00a0\u00a0I have some stress (doesn't everybody) but it's difficult to believe that is the source of the itch..\u00a0\u00a0Like I say, it suddenly started a month to six weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0If it wasn't for the lotion I'd either ithch my skin raw or go nuts.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/241193\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/241193</a>.",
