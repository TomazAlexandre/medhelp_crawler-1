            "answer": "Excessive thirst and frequent urination are two signs of diabetes. This doesn't necessarily mean YOU have diabetes, but you really should talk to a doctor if you feel something is not right. It doesn't have to be a scary thing. You don't want to be in the habit of avoiding doctors for the time when you may really need one, do you?Short of actually going to the doctor, you can post a question on one of the other forums here where a physician will respond(for a fee). I'm sure they'll advise you to go get a check-up.Good luck.",

    "question": "You see I'm only an adolecent and I have diarrhea daily and sometimes three times daily, at the most. I'm also always thirsty. Also I have (at least I think) and overactive blatter. I'll go pee before I go somewhere but when I laugh I go pee in my panties. And it even happens sometimes when I cough, sneeze, yawn, or just doing some athletic activity. For instance cheerleading. I have no idea what's wrong with me? I HATE going to the doctor and I'm actually kind of scared to. If its totally necissarly let me know. I really want to know what's wrong. When I do have diarrhea I have this moment where my stomache aches horribly and a cold chill comes over me and my gives this little shaking jolting kinda thing. Please tell me what's wrong!!! I've had blatter infections when I was little and even in elementary but nothing so far in Middle School. I've had this problem for at least two years and maybe even three. The only problems I've had that were serious, are when I had bad breathing problems when I was only a couple of months old. The other time is where I was about ten months old and fell off a two story building but, the doctors said the only thing that we should watch for as I get older is a possible brain tumor. But that's it! I don't know anyting else I can say. Please help me!",
