            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Well, ALS is a slow progressive disease. Symptoms develop over a period of few weeks, persist and then worsen over a period of years. In some cases it may have a faster progression.It is very difficult to comment whether your have ALS or not. To confirm that a doctor has to find signs of both upper (muscle weakness, decreased motor control, inability to perform fine movements, increased spinal reflexes, and positive Babinski sign\u2014great toe going up) and lower motor (muscle weakness, abnormal EMG etc) neuron weakness in at least one limb.ALS like symptoms can be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, spinal nerve compression high up in the cervical spine, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, electrolyte disturbance, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or due to bad posture. Lyme and lupus are the other possibilities. Electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction velocity (NCV), muscle biopsy, etc are done to confirm diagnosis or rule out ALS.Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "So I'm a 19 year old male pretty healthy before I started having these weird symptoms.One day I remember being in the kitchen trying to stir some pancake mix and my arms were so tired and fatigued.Anytime I would try to hold my phone I felt like i couldn't. These symptoms started about 15 months ago.I went to a neurologist but nothing was thought of it.I pretty much had a blood test for every panel. Everything checked out okay.About a little over a week ago I went into the er for this.They did a standard neurological test.Everything checked out okay.Now for the best 3 days I have been feeling really shaky and weak.I feel it mainly in my arms but a little in my legs.I dont know what this is or the cause but I'm a little afraid for my life right now.Even a week ago I wasn't feeling this bad.Could this be ALS ? Why or why not ?Could ALS progess from moderate to severe symptoms in less then a week ?I can barley function at work and I feel really shaky.Things are slipping out of my hands.",
