            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear that you are still suffering. Numbness in leg and feet can be due to pinched nerve in the lower back (sciatica or lumbar spinal nerve getting pinched\u2014possible after lower back surgery), Vit B12 deficiency, peripheral neuropathy of diabetes, hypothyroidism, lupus or Lymes, poor circulation, rheumatoid arthritis or Raynaud\u2019s disease.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
