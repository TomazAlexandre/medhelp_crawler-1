            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The symptom described by you could be due to neuropathy. It is a disorder of the nerves which causes numbness, tingling, unusual sensations and sometimes pain. Diabetes Mellitus can cause neuropathy. Other causes like vitamin deficiencies, alcohol consumption and certain medications can cause neuropathy. The shaking could also be seizure activity, only an EEG (electroencephalogram) can help confirm this. This is done under the guidance of a neurologist. You may need to consult your primary care physician to detect the cause.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hi i know this is irrelevant but i was hoping someone might be able to help me with a problem i have , maybe one of you have experienced this before and know what it is?The problem i have is on going and has been happening occasionally since i was about 14. Rarely i will be in the stage where your asleep but aware and all of a sudden i'll start shaking violently and get pins and needles everywhere then everything goes white and i have too fight it off which takes a couple of minutes usually! At first i thought it was just my imagination but it has been witnessed by my friends and sister now who have tried and failed to pull me out of this state when it occurs. Im only inquiring about it now because it has increased in frequency, particularly last night when it occured 3 times in the space of an hour, a note too add is that i suffer from Migraines every other month or so and that the symptoms of these migraines recently increased too now include partial numbness on one side of my body. Any help you could give me would be much appreciated as i feel that this problem is not the kind of thing you can tell your GP about and is quite pathetic but there getting terrifying now!",
