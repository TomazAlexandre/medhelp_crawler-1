            "answer": "Hi, if food is not passing through or if there are problems with swallowing it can result in regurgitation of food. Are you a diabetic? Diabetes mellitus can cause autonomic neuropathy and consequent slower motility of the intestinal tract. Medications to promote motility may help in emptying the intestines by promoting motility. The other causes for problems with swallowing are enlarged tonsils and GERD. Gastro esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) is caused due to reflux of acid from the stomach into the esophagus. It could also be due to disorders of the esophagus. You will need to consult your primary care physician who will examine your throat and may ask for some tests like barium swallow or endoscopy to determine the cause for your symptoms. Regards.",
