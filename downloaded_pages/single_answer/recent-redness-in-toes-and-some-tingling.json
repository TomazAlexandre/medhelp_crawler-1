            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.There is a physiological phenomenon called reactive hyperemia. This occurs if the arterial inflow is temporarily occluded. When the occlusion is released, the flow that then occurs is greater than that before the occlusion. Thus, it gives the area a \u201credder\u201d appearance.The tingling in the feet can be from nerve compression as you squeeze down on your feet.I would discuss your symptoms with your family physician. You can always have basic blood work to ensure your counts are normal. You may benefit from a Hgba1c (to rule out diabetes) and B12 (to rule out a vitamin deficiency). Additionally, tests to assess arterial flow in the leg are available. Your physician can decide if they would be appropriate.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
