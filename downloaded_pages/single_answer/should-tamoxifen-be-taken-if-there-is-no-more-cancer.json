            "answer": "Dear jensuem, In the treatment of DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) use of tamoxifen after primary treatment, the studies done regarding use of tamoxifen were with women who had been treated with lumpectomy and radiation.\u00a0\u00a0In women who undergo mastectomy the benefits of tamoxifen are unknown, but are probably limited to a decrease of cancer in the other breast.\u00a0\u00a0So in a woman who chooses bilateral mastectomy there would be little to no benefit to use of tamoxifen.",

    "question": "I am a 52 yr. old female.\u00a0\u00a0I had DCIS\u00a0\u00a0stage 0 non-invasive cancer in my left breast and refused to have mastecomy in Aug.2003. I chose lumpectomy in Sept. but did not get clear margins. I had quadrantectomy in Oct. but did not get clear margins. I had another quadrantectomy in Nov. but still - no clear margins.\u00a0\u00a0On Nov. 27th my incision opened up and all the seroma came gushing out.\u00a0\u00a0I had an open wound and received daily care for over 1 mo. I was informed that I needed a mastectomy and I decided to have prophylactic mastectomies. The surgery was Jan. 5, 2004 and was succesfull.\u00a0\u00a0The pathology report said that there was NO CANCER anywhere!!!My question is this:\u00a0\u00a0Do I really need to take Tamoxifen for 5 yrs?\u00a0\u00a0The side effects are scarry to me because I have had back surgeries and as a result I get extreme leg cramps.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a very high blood HCT level of 48 - 57. (worried about liver problems)I had a histerectomy when I was 25. I got hot flashes @50 yrs(not bad).\u00a0\u00a0I have hardening of the arteries per Dr. who found calcifications on my mammograms.(I take lipitor and zetia)I had double pneumonia last year and had it prior to that 20 yrs.ago.\u00a0\u00a0I developed asthma last year from pneumonia and I have hay fever (I take clarinex and singulair).I also have been a glaucoma suspect(my mother has it). My brother & mother have Diabetes, my father died of heart disease and my brother has had 2 heart attacks.\u00a0\u00a0The side effect that scares me the most is memory loss.\u00a0\u00a0My mother and her 2 brothers have Alzheimers.I never had cancer anywhere else to include nodes.",
