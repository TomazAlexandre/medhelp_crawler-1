            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis). Other conditions cause itchy skin as well. Skin conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "Dear Doc,About 6 months ago I started developing a severe itch. It started mostly at night, on my calfs/ below the knee. Then over time it started affecting thighs as well. After a few months it had spread to my entire body.\u00a0\u00a0Now I find myself scratching throughout the day, with the itching when I prepare for bed still being the worst of it. I have no active signs of any rash, spots or breakouts; However when I do scratch the area becomes extremely red, welps up badly and becomes hot (even from the slightest scratch). After about 10 minutes the welps/swelling dies down and the redness fades.I have switched body washes/ soaps, cleared all bed spreads and clothes, tried different lotions and have taken anti-allergy medication... all to no effect.Any information or suggestions would be helpful. Thank you",
