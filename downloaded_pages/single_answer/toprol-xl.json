    "question": "I'm 49 years old (Male) I had stent put in about a year ago and was put on Toprol XL (50mg) once a day within a few weeks I as well as my wife noted a change in my upbeat personality and my near total loss of Toprol-XL. I had become short tempered and outwardly mean at times. After about 7 months of this I told my doctor and he switched me to propranolol (60mg). Much improvement in the temper dept but still no return of the libedo. (Sorry about spelling). The question is... have you heard of other cases of people being on toprol or other heart meds that who have had this problem with being short tempered. I already know about the other (libido) problem. I'm also a diabetic taking Glynase (6 mg) twice a day and Glucophage (500mg) twice a day.",
