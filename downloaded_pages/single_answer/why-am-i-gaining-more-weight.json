            "answer": "Depression is a symptom of hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0You are gaining weight most likely because you aren't on enough medication, are on the wrong thyroid medication, or as a side effect of one of the other medications.Thyroid medication does not cause weight to drop off if you are hypothyroid. Someone that isn't hypo might lose from the medication. What the thyroid med does for someone who is hypo is it allows you to stop gaining weight and any weight gain can be lost with diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0It can take months to years to lose the weight gained by the condition.\u00a0\u00a0I gained over 50 pounds with the condition and have only managed to lose about 25 pounds so far and this has taken me 8 years to do so.What thyroid medication are you on?\u00a0\u00a0Most are put on a T4 medication. The goal on this medication is to have a morning TSH around 1.0.If depression and fatigue continue after having a TSH around 1.0, then its time to look into adding some T3.",

Well I gained 40 pounds, My doctor was upset and I told her I eat normal, but was tired all the time,\u00a0\u00a0The antidepressants were prescribed by another doctor btw.
