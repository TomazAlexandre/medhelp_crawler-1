            "answer": "Hey Ava!Well, I would suggest visiting the ER, since the pain related to heart issues could radiate to the neck and jaw as well, in addition to the classically described left shoulder. Once heart issues have been ruled out, one may proceed to look at other possibilities such as respiratory tract infections, TMJ issues etc. You may like to consult a primary care physician for the same. After a cause id diagnosed, it can be managed accordingly.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
