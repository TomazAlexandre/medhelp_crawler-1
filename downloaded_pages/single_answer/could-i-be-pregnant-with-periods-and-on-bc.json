    "question": "Okay, so I have not had intercourse since the beginning of May. My ex and I were not using a condom, but I am on the pill. However, I think there was one day that I took my pill around 5 hours late and I had intercourse the day after. But I still took it when I remembered. Well, I took a pregnancy test the day I was supposed to get my period because something just didn't feel right. It came out negative, and I got my period that day. I brushed it off for a while and didn't worry about it. However, the past month or so I've had frequent urination. I went and got tested for STD's and found out I had Chlamydia back at the very end of May. Took my course of antibiotics and was fine for 3 weeks. Then the frequent urination came back though, and I went back to the doctor to get tested for Diabetes and all STD's again. All tests came back negative. I am due for my period a week from today, and I've been having really sharp cramps in my stomach today. (Also, I have had 2 full on normal periods since the last time I had intercourse) Is it possible that I am pregnant somehow, but still having normal periods? Or am I just worrying myself for nothing?Also, I have had no other symptoms besides the frequent urination and what I'm hoping are just pre-menstrual cramps.Please help! I cannot be pregnant right now, especially with an ex boyfriend! :(",
