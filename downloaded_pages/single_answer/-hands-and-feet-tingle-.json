            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Tingling in the hands and feet only with urination is very unusual. If the symptoms are very brief then entirely resolve, I can not think of a good explanation. One possibility is hyperventilation; tingling in the hands and feet in general that is brief and resolves can be associated with hyperventilation (over-breathing, breathing too fast). Another potential cause is that with urination, valsalva is occuring (bearing down, as occurs with coughing, sneezing, or defacation, \"pushing\"), and if there is narrowing of the spine or pressure on some nerve due to spine problems, with bearing down (valsalva) the pressure is transmitted across to the nerves. however, if the tingling does not occur with other activities such as coughing, sneezing, etc, then this would not be a feasible explanation.If tingling in the hands and feet is more sustained, then a neuropathy would be one possibility. A neuropathy is damage to nerves from various causes, most commonly diabetes, but there are several other causes. The symptoms including tingling, burning, over-sensitivity, numbness, and sometimes weakness in the extremities. However, very transient tingling that only occurs with urination is again unlikely to be neuropathic.Discussion of your symptoms with your primary doctor/internist is recommended, with referral to a neurologist as he/she deems necessary after evaluation.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
