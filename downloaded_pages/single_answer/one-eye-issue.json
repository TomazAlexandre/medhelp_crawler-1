    "question": "Hello all,I have started having problems with my right eye.I have very blurry vision from far distances.I also notice a weird feeling behind the eye at rarely (almost a pulse)Well I know the solution here is to go to an optometrist but I not only do not have insurance, But have very limited cash flow at the moment.Also I was told years ago that I have low blood sugar. I am just hoping it did not take a turn towards diabetes.Any advise would be great.Thank you for your time.Oh and I am a 37 year old man if that helps.Thanks againJEFF***@****",
