            "answer": "Although it sounds like your sleep may be playing a role due to the fact you are only sleeping 5 hours/day during the week, your doctor is the person who needs to evaluate your fatigue. You also need to try to get at least 6 hours/day during the week to see if that makes a difference.Dr. Jacobs",

    "question": "For about three weeks now I have not been sleeping at my usual hours.\u00a0\u00a0I've been up every night and all night with my baby who is teething.\u00a0\u00a0Then, in the early morning hours I make my husband breakfast and prepare his lunch (he starts work at 5AM) and around 7AM my toddler wants to play and eat breakfst.\u00a0\u00a0I am constantly up around the clock and barely get any rest.My mother comes over on the weekends to help me out with the children so I can catch up on my rest but my toddler still wakes me up.\u00a0\u00a0So,\u00a0\u00a0here is an example of my most recent sleep patterns on a typical weekend:4AM-7AM1PM-7PMAnd on the weekdays:4AM-7AM12PM-2PM (I nap when the children nap) Then I am up until 3 or 4AM.I still feel extremely fatigued.\u00a0\u00a0I dont get any rest and when I do I still wake up feeling tired.\u00a0\u00a0Is this because my sleep patterns were off and I am starting to readjust again?I went to the doctor last month for a regualr check up.\u00a0\u00a0I have terrible sinuses which my doctor said could be another reason as to why I am so tired.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped taking allergy meds because they made me VERY DROWSY.\u00a0\u00a0The doc ran some blood tests and everything came back great (no diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0decent cholesterol level,\u00a0\u00a0no anemia,\u00a0\u00a0etc.).Just wondering if it is normal to feel unrested even though\u00a0\u00a0am trying to catch up. Sometimes my body feels too weak to move (although I remain active by force).\u00a0\u00a0My arms, legs, and eyes feel heavy.\u00a0\u00a0If it is not normal then what could it be?",
