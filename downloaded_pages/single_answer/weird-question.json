            "answer": "It's just something that a doctor decides. If you come back with High blood pressure, gestational diabetes & so on. But towards the end of pregnancy, some doctors push you with the idea of inducing although nothing is medically wrong in your pregnancy (my dr did with my 1st child) she kept trying to induce me when nothing was wrong.
