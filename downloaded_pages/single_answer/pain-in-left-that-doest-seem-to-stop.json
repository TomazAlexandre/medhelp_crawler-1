            "answer": "Hi,Pain at one place on your left arm which is relieved on medications is generally not related to stroke. It could be more on the lines of a tennis elbow.But with a family history of Diabetes and hypertension and you having a BP over 160/90: you are definitely at risk for stroke. Though some people have a higher BP, this high is rare and you need treatment.Regards",

    "question": "Hello, im a 32 year old African American male who has a family hx of Hypertension,stroke,Diabetes.. Im 5'6, 150 pounds, athletic build (i teach a high impact dance class twice per week (1)hour each class. For some reason,with all of the exercise I do, my blood pressure is high majority of times. I checked it tonight at Walmart and it was 161/94. I concerned because everything im reading about strokes point in my direction. I've had this irritating pain in my left arm just above my elbow, it feels like a sore muscle. It started on Fri...today is Wed. I started taking Tylenol yesterday and the pain went away temp. I was thinking the pain could come from the fact that I type on a computer all day. It seems to irritate me more when I type. I heard some people have higher blood pressure than others naturally...Also let me mention, I suffer from sinius problems also. I had to have surgery in 2004 on my sinuses due to blockage & pressure build up. I've been having headaches related to my sinus pressure off and on. I went to the ER about 3 mnths ago for bad headaches. After doing a CT scan on my sinuses, the Phy determined my headaches were being caused by a sinus infection. He said my blood pressure was elevated also because of that...Please give me your expert advise..\u00a0\u00a0Do I need to be on some medication for high blood pressure? Could the pain in my arm be signs of a stroke at my age?",
