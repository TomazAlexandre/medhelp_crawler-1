            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

    "question": "For the last several months I've had increasingly painful pins and needles in my right foot. It began with big toe pain (so I thought it was gout), but then progressed to whole foot. Two years ago I had a series of surgeries on the OTHER hip and I found that moving both\u00a0\u00a0my feet back and forth or in a circular motion helped with post op pain. Those movements have become ingrained - i don't even notice I'm moving my feet, but I've noticed I'm moving them\u00a0\u00a0virtually constantly. Forcing myself to stop is hard!Could such repetitive motion of the feet cause these pins and needles? Thanks, lohmeierThis discussion is related to/posts/show/297021.",
