            "answer": "Hello,Two possibilities are there for such depigementation. Firstly,it can be due to tinea versicolor. Tinea versicolor is caused by a fungus that lives in the skin of almost all adults. Factors that can cause the fungus to become more visible include high humidity and immune or hormone abnormalities. Treatment involves topical and oral antifungal medicines.Second possibility is of vitiligo. It is a pigmentation disorder in which melanocytes (the cells that make pigment) in the skin are destroyed. As a result, white patches appear on the skin in different parts of the body. Diagnosis can be confirmed by external examination, blood tests to check skin cell count\u00a0\u00a0for melanocytes and biopsy of the skin patches.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am\u00a0\u00a0a 30 year old, breastfeeding mom of indian origin. Around 3 weks ago I noticed a distinct oval patch which is lighter than the sorrounding skin\u00a0\u00a0(not completely white) on my left breast. Last week\u00a0\u00a0i noticed another light patch on my left leg (not very distinct from the sorrounding skin) with two white hair on it. My family physician suspects it is vitiligo and has referred me to a dermatologist but the appointment will take atleast two months. I\u00a0\u00a0am really scared that if it is vitiligo it will spread to my entire body. However, I have read that vitiligo is usually found on the sun exposed areas...so I am confused. Could it be some other disease such as tinea versicolor?I have no family history of vitiligo. However, my father has diabetes and both my daughters have severe eczema.What should I do ? Are there any alternative therapies or home remedies available which are successful in the initial stages of the disease? Can I continue to breastfeed my toddler ?This discussion is related to/posts/show/239677.",
