            "answer": "Hello,Your symptom is called polyuria (excessive frequency of voiding). It can be due to many reasons which can be physiological or disease-related, and include excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones.I suggest you to take opinion of your doctor who would do a clinical examination and advice for needful tests (such as routine urinanalysis, blood glucose test, blood & urinary osmolalities, ultrasonography of renal system, etc). Accordingly you might need to take measures such as control of excessive liquid intake, reduction in diuretic substances/drugs, treatment of any infection (with short-course antibiotics), removal of any urinary tract obstruction, treatment of diabetes, etc as the case may be.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Since Dec 19, 2010 I have had this overwhelming urge to urinate immediately after going to the bathroom and a slight burning when you start (which has since not occurred for last week), in addition I had a very red scrotum that burned for no apparent reason.\u00a0\u00a0So I took an at home UTI test with slight trace so went to doctor on Jan 3rd and got a negative result from their lab for a UTI.\u00a0\u00a0I was also tested by Planned Parenthood for STD as I was worried that based on these symptoms I had Chlamydia or Gonorrhea and both tests were negative.\u00a0\u00a0I am married but had an unprotected sexl fling over 10 years ago but was tested for all the STDs and AIDS and was fine with none and have not had another sexual partner besides the Mrs since and most recently on Dec 18, and 21st.\u00a0\u00a0I was worried maybe she on off chance she might be seeing someone hence the STD panel I tested for to be safe.My MD also when testing looked at my sugar count in urine and that was fine and just yesterday in a follow-up did a rectum exam to see if prostate was fine and it was.\u00a0\u00a0So they drew blood for a PSA test and that came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0Now he got me an Rx for next 2 wks for an attempt to see if it is an overactive bladder.\u00a0\u00a0This really is annoying to have to feel like you constantly have to go and to have your sac feel like it is on fire makes general daily life challenging to say the least.For the red balls my MD thought it might be jock itch on the scrotum and has me on Clotrimazole cream 1% but it just doesn't seem like that is that is the issue\u00a0\u00a0and stings a little at the moment.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like a train wreck so any advice on whether to leave the PCP's care and seek help from a Urologist and Dermatologist for the respective issues is what I am considering.\u00a0\u00a0My MD is a good guy just don't think he has the experience to deal with these more in-depth issues.I need relief and soon - help.",
