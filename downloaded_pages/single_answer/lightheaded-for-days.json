    "question": "For the past 3-4 days I have been feeling extremely lightheaded. When in a sitting position, I feel a little bit foggy (fatigue) but whenever I stand up (especially after lying down or sitting for a long period of time) I get extremely dizzy, I lose my vision and my head aches. I also get nauseous for the next 15 minutes or so. I feel like my blood pressure is constantly low.I do have type 1 diabetes but have noticed my blood sugar levels are not low (occasionally have been slightly elevated but not high to cause hyperglycemia.) I don't smoke and I am not taking any other medications. I'm also not on my period.This is really abnormal for me and I'm quite concerned. I realize a visit to the doctor could benefit me but my appointment isn't until next week and I would like to know if anyone else had a diagnosis for a similar condition. Thanks!",
