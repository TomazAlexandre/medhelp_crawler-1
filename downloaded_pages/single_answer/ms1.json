            "answer": "Hello there,Poor health, diabetes mellitus, taking steroid medications, chemotherapy can all make a person prone for oral thrush .Your doctor may prescribe an antifungal mouthwash nystatin which is to be used for 5 - 10 days. If they don't work, oral medication may be prescribed. If the infection has spread throughout your body or you have HIV/AIDS, stronger medications, such as fluconazole and itraconazole may be needed. The exact treatment can be decided only after a complete physical examination. I hope it helps.Best luck and regards!",
