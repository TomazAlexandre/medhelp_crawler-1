            "answer": "I'm a type 2 diabetic who recently treated and am SVR.\u00a0\u00a0I found little difference in my numbers and as far as how I felt, I was too wiped out from the INF and riba to know.I think it's important to get your diabetes in control before treating your hep c.\u00a0\u00a0This can be expensive because you need to have a glucose meter and strips, which aren't cheap.\u00a0\u00a0And you will need to test your blood sugar an hour or two (one or the other) after meals for several days to see how you respond to food, mainly carbs.If you're overweight, which you don't look like you are, it's best to lose it before treating.Unfortunately there are no generic meds for hep c, but the drug companies - Roche and Schering Plough - all have programs for people who aren't covered for the meds by insurance.\u00a0\u00a0They're supposed to be quite generous.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes meds should be covered by your insurance.\u00a0\u00a0There are some generic meds for diabetes, but some drugs are newer and have no generics yet.Then you need to find out, if you don't already know, your genotype, stage and grade, which usually requires a biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully your new health plan will do that for you.",
