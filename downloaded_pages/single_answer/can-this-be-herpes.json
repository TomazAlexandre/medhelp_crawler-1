    "question": "About a year and a half ago, i recieved unprotected oral sex from a female. I did not have any problems until about a month after i recieved it with a small looking zit in the area where my penis and scrotum attach. I went to the doctor and he examined it and told me it was an irritated hair follicle. He did the q-tip test and blood work for any stds and came back negative. A few months after that, my scrotum became irritated, sweaty,and sticky. There didn't appear to be any blisters. I am quite hairy on both my penis and scrotum with alot of little white follicle bumps. This persisted and returned to the doctor a second time. He did the q-tip test again and the results came back negative. I've had diabetes for about 10 years and I've read books that if you have poor control over your sugar levels that infections are more common in certain places on your body. For some reason, everyday I have this burning sensation on my scrotum and still my penis and scrotum stick to my underwear.It continues for weeks. I have never had sex and I'm 23 years old. I'm scared to death that I might infect someone because of my problem. Also for some reason, I appear to be alot whiter in my skin tone, and constantly tired. Not sure if it is from not taking good control over my sugars or the problem I'm having down there. I'm thinking about it constantly and is keeping me from going out and meeting girls. Please, any information would be greatly apprecited. Thank You.",
