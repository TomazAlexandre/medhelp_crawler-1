    "question": "Posted By Ken A. on July 30, 1998 at 20:10:49:My 12-year old son was tested a year ago and had total cholesterol of 240, hdl in the mid 20's, and triglycerides over 700.\u00a0\u00a0He altered his eating habits (primarily fat), increased his exercise, and has now had two tests with cholesterol going down to 190 and most recently, 165.\u00a0\u00a0However, his triglycerides have been 300 and 400, and his hdl has remained in the mid 20's.He gets a lot of exercise, is not overweight, and of course does not consume alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0When his triglyceride level was over 700, he used to get bad stomach aches, a messing in his pants was a common problem, often occuring in the late afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0This problem, which I think was related to inflammation of the pancreas, has virtually disappeared for the past 9 months.\u00a0\u00a0His doctor and I are both very concerned that his triglycerides are still so high. I worry about long-term damage to the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor has mentioned the possibility of medication.\u00a0\u00a0Could you tell me about the benefits and side effects, and also about the best and worst foods for him?\u00a0\u00a0One paternal great-grandfather died from diabetes complications in his 60's, and one maternal grandfather developed diabetes but did not require insulin injections.",
