    "question": "I failed my first by 23 points. I went in for the three hour test and made it an hour before throwing up. I did the diet and fasted as told so I don't know what happened. I have a bad feeling I have gestational diabetes. The women in my family tend to get it when pregnant. Not to mention regular diabetes runs in my family also. I'm nervous about this but I will make sure, even if I do have it, that the baby is taken care of as well as myself. I'm praying everything works out. As of now I know my baby is healthy so that puts me at ease.",
