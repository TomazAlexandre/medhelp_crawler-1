Sometimes, we think we've got thyroid disease, when we have parathyroid disease or diabetes.The cholesterol elevation is common with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, as well as his other hypo symptoms. If he does have thyroid disease, and ignores it, his symptoms will worsen. Hashis tend to have low vitamin D, which causes many muscle cramps.The blood tests required for Hashimoto's and/or other thyroid problems are TSH, FT3, FT4The\u00a0\u00a0blood tests for Hashi antibodies are TGab and Anti-TPO.Since he doesn't have insurance, here is a good website about self thyroid tests.http://thyroid.about.com/od/gettestedanddiagnosed/a/selftesting.htm:) Tamra",

    "question": "Hi, My name is Sarah and I am concerned about my 21 year old boyfriend who seems to be exhibiting a lot of symptoms of a thyroid disorder. I have some familiarity with thyroid disorders since hypothyroidism runs in my family, but I also know that there are a wide range of possible disorders and symptoms depending on the individual and I am not sure how seriously to take his symptoms. We have been dating for over a year and in that time I have noticed:fatigue and sluggishness, often it is hard to wake him if he has gotten under 12 hours of sleepchronic patches of dry skin reoccuring in the same spots on his back and chestgrey hairselevated cholesterolmildly overweightfrequent headaches, muscle soreness and stiffnessconstipation and bloating, gasseousnessmoodiness and depressionOf course, the fact that he is a 21 year old male who lives a largly sedentary lifestyle, has a poor diet and irregular sleep schedule has to be factored in. It seems to me though that his symptoms are more acute than his lifestyle choices would explain, and I would like to have him see a doctor and get tested. When I have mentioned it to him in the past he gets defensive and resists the idea of seeing a doctor, he does not have health insurance and this understandably is a deterrent. I am concerned that ignoring these symptoms could lead to more severe health issues for him and was looking for some advice. Are his symptoms severe enough to be concerned? What are the possible consequences of ignoring his thyroid disorder if he should have one? What resources are available for those that will be paying out of pocket? And finally, any advice on how to approach/talk to him about this issue?Any further thoughts/advice you might want to share would be welcome. Thanks.",
