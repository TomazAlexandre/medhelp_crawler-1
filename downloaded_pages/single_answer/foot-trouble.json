            "answer": "Hi Worried,What is your name? How old are you?I think your symptoms aren\u2019t due to peripheral neuropathy.These symptoms can be due to VitaminB12 deficiency or diabetes or some nerve compression along its course.The nerve in question here is sciatic nerve which starts from lower back and extends up to foot.You described you had shooting kind of pain, which is characteristics of Sciatica.I think you should be consulting an orthopaedician for further evaluation and if necessary get an imaging done to know lower back anatomy.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",

    "question": "I am concerned about PN from HIV. I only had a low risk to no risk exposure (fingering) about 5-7 months ago. For some reason I started worring about this exposure about a month ago. I read about the symptoms of HIV on being PN. Shortly after reading about the symptoms I noticed tingling on the outside of my left leg, nothing in the foot really. It would go away while I was standing or walking seemed to only happen while I was sitting. After about a week it went away for a while. Then about three weeks ago I started having tingling in the bottom of my left foot after about a week of that it went into my right foot also. Now the tingling has seemed to deminish a little when I get out of bed and stand I get a couple shoots of pain( doesnt really hurt just dont know how else to describe it) in my heels and after that I dont have much trouble. Every now and then I get random shoots in my foot. There hasn't been any pain. Does this sound like PN? Could I be getting PN so early after my possible hiv exposure? Or could this be anxiety? I was checked by the doc and he said I had all my sensations in my foot. I poked me with a needle all over my foot and had me close my eyes and tested my feeling between soft and blunt and said there were not problems. He also said my reflexes were OK.",
