            "answer": "Anything that is out of the normal range should be checked out by a Specialist. I have hepatitus C (on treatment right now so hopefully I don't have it anymore) and anyhow, when a doctor - which is usually the Primary Care doc gives a blood test and sees that the enzymes are raised, they usually tell the patient that they will \"retest\" in a few weeks......and that is fine,,,BUT,, people have to know (because the doctors don't know) that they MUST rule out Hepatitus,,,,because IF the doctor does retest and the blood comes back normal, they will send you on your merry way.......Most of the doctors that are not educated about the EPIDEMIC (HEP C) still \"profile\" people as to what they think a person \"looks like\" that is infected with hep C....... My doc didn't see a need to test me for hepatitus C after my enzymes came back \"slightly elevated.\" I didn't fit the image she had in her head I guess.....And if your doc didn't test you for hep after seeing your enzymes are out of range, that would tell me that you must have all your teeth too :o)But I don't want to scare you,,,you may NOT have hep, but please play it safe and get a hepatitus panel even if your doc says no need to.......I keep singing the same song, but its a darn shame that these doctors aren't testing everyone when they do their routine physical.....As far as the glucose, mine is normal. I know some people with hep do wind up with diabetes,,,,,,but again,,,,I am just giving you something to discuss with your doc from \"my world.\"\u00a0\u00a0There are plenty of other reasons that your enzymes can be elevated that \"aren't scary.''........such as strenuous exercise, alcohol, or maybe you took tylenol prior to the blood test......but anyhow,,,,,good luck!!MO",
