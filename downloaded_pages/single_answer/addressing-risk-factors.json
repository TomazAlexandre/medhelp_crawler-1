            "answer": "It sounds like you are doing a great job! One big thing I would be sure of-- have you been screened for diabetes?From a diet standpoint, I usually recommend the Mediterranean diet and you can find information on that heart healthy way of eating on the internet. I think it is one of the few you can do long-term. Most weight loss in America is related to diet so it sounds like you are doing it! Congratulations and let me know how you progress- keep in mind, that slow weight loss is the way to go. Consider more meals that are smaller in portion, too (5 small meals rather than 3 large meals)-- watch out for hidden carbs/sugars (soda is one of the worst culprits)",
