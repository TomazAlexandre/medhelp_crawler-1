            "answer": "Hi!Well, low sodium levels may cause lethargy, nausea, vomiting, headache, loss of appetite, fatigue, restlessness, irritability, confusion, seizures etc. The symptoms are related to the cause of low sodium.In your case, its probably due to drinking too much water. Please repeat the test after two weeks.For your information: Prolonged sweating, infections, drinking too much water, diabetes insipidus, adrenal gland dysfunction, kidney and liver problems, prolonged diarrhea,or vomiting, certain medications such as diuretics etc can all cause low sodium in the blood.Hope this helps.

    "question": "I am a 71 year old female. I had blood work done and saw my Dr. this A M, she is concerned that my sodium level is at 131, normal at the lab is 133-145 A year ago it was 136 but I did drink at least 32 ounces of water the morning before my blood test, she thinks this may be the cause. I drank the water because they have a hard time finding a vein.I am trying to find some info on the internet what a low sodium level can cause but find nothing. The rest of my blood work was fine except my glucose was 7 points above normal.Thank you, Linda",
