            "answer": "Unfortunately, unless those nodules are over 2 cm, docs may want to leave the thyroid. With enough hormone pills, your nodules will shrink. I have a large isthmus and four nodules. The isthmus pressing on my throat makes it difficult to swallow pills sometimes.Selenium once a day (200 mcg) helps with swelling. As does Motrin.Your antibodies are high, but believe me, they get higher on this forum. You will probably need a bump in Levo. I started on 50 mcg. Now I'm on 125 plus 5 cytomel and I will probably go higher. Eventually, we need to take enough of this hormone for the TSH to be low enough that our antibodies stop attacking (or at least slow down their attack) on the thyroid.I would seriously consider a doc who treats your FreeT3 and FreeT4 levels. TSH is a pituitary hormone. Treating the frees and getting those in the upper 1/3 of the range generally makes us Hashis feel better.My last endo would only treat my TSH, ignoring the frees. I had to fight to get her to raise my Synthroid from 50 to 75. Now my new doc has me feeling wonderful! I got him off the below site. You want an endo who specializes in thyroid, not just another diabetes doc.http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/Also, get your vitamin D and B12 checked. Many of us are low in these vitamins. Take all vitamins and other meds 4 hours after your thyroid meds. Take your thyroid med on a full glass of water, no food for at least an hour.Caffeine can make the swelling worse. Give it up if you can.Best of luck!:) Tamra",
