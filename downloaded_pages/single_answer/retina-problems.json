    "question": "Hey,Currently my husband has performed eye surgery in one eye due to a tear in the retina, also he suffers from diabetes which was also a problem. all of a sudden his eye started to bleed and lost his sight in one eye. he has done surgey, and now his eye is completly blind. he has got one eye he can see with but slowly he is developing the same symptoms he had with the other eye. so i was thinking if i can get advice to stop him from being totally blind in both eyes.also from a report he has recieved from the doctor.. it stated the following:Flash ERG (both scoyopic ans photopic) of the right eye showed subnormal delayed responses, indicating poor retinal function up to the ganglion cell layer. it also showed minimal photo[ic flicker responses, indicating severly impaired mascular function. Oscillatory potentials (ops) are markedly reduced\u00a0\u00a0(inner retinal Ischaemia) .a poor functional state of the putermost layers.poor functional state of the ganglion cells and inner layers on the central 30 degrees of the retina.",
