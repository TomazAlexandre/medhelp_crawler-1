            "answer": "As diabetic he can eat regular foods and does not need special foods, especially since he is a growing child. You should avoid fruit juices because that does spike the blood sugars. Suggest you go to a Diabetic Registered Dietitian (Pediatric back ground) who will help you learn about how to control your son\u2019s diabetes through diet which allows him to eat all types of food. To find a Registered Dietitian in your area go to the American Dietetic Association website, www.eatright.org. The American Diabetic Association is a good source too for information and cook-books. Hoped that helped you.",
