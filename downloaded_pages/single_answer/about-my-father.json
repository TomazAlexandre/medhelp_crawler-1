            "answer": "Hi there!Well, with the description this looks further degeneration/ fracture or avascular necrosis. I am not particularly in favour of \u2018partial\u2019 joint replacements and these are getting replaced with total replacements for better prognosis and lesser complications. Anyhow the benefits of doing a surgery would need to be well evaluated against the risks and while the conditions may not be absolute contraindications, these would need to be controlled for a better outcome. I would suggest consulting a nephrologist and an endocrinologist for appropriate management of the primary condition before seeking an opinion with an orthopedician and an anesthesiologist for suggestion of an appropriate management plan.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
