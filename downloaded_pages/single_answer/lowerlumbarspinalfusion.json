            "answer": "Hello Dear,The process of healing a fusion can take many months or well over a year to be complete. For these reasons, it is important to realize before surgery that positive results will be slow to realize and patience following your surgery will be necessary. A fusion is not a quick fix; rather, it is a commitment of patient and surgeon to a long process of improving your back and leg pain. Total or 100% cures are rare. Realistically, patients can expect a dramatic and lasting improvement in their back and leg pain. Though many patients are worried about a lumbar fusion taking away their ability to bend and twist, the majority of patients eventually regain the ability to bend in all directions. This mobility can allow for a return to work and many enjoyable recreational activities.The success rates of lumbar fusion can be lower in patients who smoke, are overweight, have diabetes or other significant medical illnesses, have osteoporosis, or who have had radiation treatments that included the lower back. Good nutrition and slowly increasing activity\u00a0\u00a0in the recovery period can help achieve success.Refer http://www.spineuniverse.com/displayarticle.php/article600.htmlBest",
