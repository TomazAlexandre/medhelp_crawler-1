His problem sounds most likely like acute angle closure glaucoma and that comes from the shape of the eye and would not be due to having been involved in the auto accident.JCH MD",

    "question": "My husband and I were recently rear ended at a high rate of speed.\u00a0\u00a0We were both transported via ambulance to the hospital and my husband complained that his right eye felt \"weird\".\u00a0\u00a0The issue was not addressed in the ER and my husband just let it go.\u00a0\u00a0He finally admitted that his vision had been blurry since the accident.\u00a0\u00a0Our family physician recommended seeing an opthamologist.\u00a0\u00a0We did not know one so we saw our optometrist.\u00a0\u00a0My husband sees the eye doctor at least every two years and has never had a problem with pressures or any other issues during these visits.\u00a0\u00a0His last exam was 17/17 pressures with his vision corrected to 20/20 with glasses.\u00a0\u00a0Now everyone saying that there is no way the accident had anything to do with his now blurry vision and pressure of 50 in his right eye.\u00a0\u00a0(Which we decreased with drops in less than 24 hours)\u00a0\u00a0He has always had astigmatism that has never caused a problem.\u00a0\u00a0He does not have diabetes, high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0He does have Idiopathic Epilepsy that is controlled with 600 mg tegretol daily.\u00a0\u00a0He has high cholesterol also treated with\u00a0\u00a0Lipitor 40mg a day.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I cannot believe that he now has sudden glaucoma when his last appointment with the 17/17 reading was in February of this year.\u00a0\u00a0 I have done some research and what I find says that you can get high pressure readings after a trauma.\u00a0\u00a0Adreneline rush that causes the pupil to dilate could cause trauma to the eye.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to know if anyone agrees with me.\u00a0\u00a0My husband still has blurred vision, may have to have surgery or may have lost vision in that eye.\u00a0\u00a0We are going to sue the person who rear ended us and I can't help but believe that these doctors just don't want to get involved.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any help you can give me.",
