            "answer": "If it burns or tingles when you are urinating, it could be a urinary tract infection. Or, it could be something as simple as urethritis, where your urethra is enflamed. You definitely need to make a doctor's appointment and figure out what is going on and have it treated.",

    "question": "Lately, I've noticed some pressure in my pelvic area. I didn't think anything of it until it started to become a daily thing. It's only when I sit down for a decent period of time that I can notice it. It doesn't hurt. It either tingles or gives me a light burning sensation. It also happens when I have to urinate.I've also noticed that I've been urinating frequently, but not sure if it's connected with the pelvic issue. I've been drinking more lately, so that's probably the reason. I got scared last weekend when I couldn't hold my urine. I was out with a friend, and none of the bars downtown would let me use the restroom. Two hours went by and it was very, very painful. I had to find an empty street to go before I spazzed out.I'm going to make a doctor's appointment, but I'm scared. I Google'd the symptoms and every negative disease has come up. I'm in my mid-twenties and I'm too young for cancer, diabetes and prostate issues.Any ideas?",
