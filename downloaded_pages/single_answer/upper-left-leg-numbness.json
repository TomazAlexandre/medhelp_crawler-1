            "answer": "Hi!Numbness on outer aspect of thigh can be due superficial nerve compression (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve), that comes from the hip area and gets pinched. This condition is called meralgia paresthetica and is often due to weight gain or wearing tight clothes and belts. Losing some weight or wearing loose clothes and belts often helps relieve the pain/numbness/tingling. Also injection of lignocaine (anesthetic agent) at the site helps. In your case you can apply a pain reliever at the site. Keep a hot water bottle/heating pad while sleeping and apply a local analgesic cream. Other possibilities are vascular pathologies such as deep vein thrombosis and clots and will need a dopplar study. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme's and lupus are the other possibilities. It can also be spinal nerve compression in lower back.If you are a female in the menopausal age, then crawling sensation on the skin is a common symptom. Hormone replacement therapy often helps. It is also seen in people who are very anxious and stressed out. Take up yoga, deep breathing exercise, walking etc to relieve stress. Music and aerobics are also good stress busters. Drink plenty of fluids and water (not caffeine), eat fresh fruits and vegetables and keep yourself busy throughout the day. Very dry skin and disorders of thyroid gland all can precipitate a crawling sensation. The other possibility is Morgellons disease often mimics scabies. The disease is believed to be caused by weak immune systems in people that have contracted the tick-borne Lyme disease at some point in their life. It can also be a fungal infection like Tinea corporis. If the crawling feeling is in your legs only it can be restless leg syndrome, pinched lumbar spinal nerves, peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, Lyme\u2019s or hypothyroidism, or it can be fungal infection.
