            "answer": "Hi,I see your concern being placed on more medication, but it may be necessary to keep you healthy in the long run. Your questions:1)regarding undertreatment of thyroid disorders: this could contribute to abnormal blood sugars if you are frankly under-replaced, but a slight underdosing should not affect glucose problems significantly.2)The right dose and selection of diabetes medication will make it possible for you to have some carbohydrates without too much blood sugar rise. You should try to limit your simple sugar carbohydrates in any case and try to stick with high fiber complex types like whole wheat bread/pasta and beans.3)You do not need to have blood sugars below 100 to be kept healthy. A fasting sugar below 100 is fantastic but under 120 is also very good.\u00a0\u00a0Sugars in the range of 120-140 are not perfect but over time will not likely cause significant damage to eyes and organs . Those blood sugars correspond to a HgbA1C of 6-6.7% or therabouts, which is the current goal of treatment to avoid complications.Keep up with your diet, try to add exercise as tolerated and talk to your doctor about medication choices. Good luck!",
