    "question": "I have been diagnosed with coronary small artery disease. I had an angiogram and was diagonosed with 40% and 50% blockage in two arteries. No stints were installed. I have severe angina attacks, but they have been greatly helped with Ranexa. I still have attacks but not as bad as before. I also have hemochromatosis , diabetes (type 2) and extremely high blood pressure which I take meds for the last two (diovan hct, mepropolol, and metformin and zocor for cholestoral), and have had regular phlebotomies (blood letting), for the last year and a half, finally getting my iron levels down to acceptable levels for the hemochromatosis. My doctor is monitoring my heart now and says it is just best to follow this course and hope that the blockage dosent increase.My questions are these, do you think the hemochromatosis can have had an effect on my heart, I understand that it can cause heart failure? Can this lead to a\u00a0\u00a0heart attack? I wonder if surgery will ultimatley be an option, and what can I expect for the future? I am 55 years old (male) and lost my father to hemochromatosis, heart failure and he also had cirosis of the liver and diabetes, I dont have cirosis. He was 55 when he died . Im a bottom line person so please be frank. ThanksThis discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/249891\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/249891</a>.",
