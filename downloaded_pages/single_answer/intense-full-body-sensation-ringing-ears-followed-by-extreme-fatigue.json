            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you mother feels are probably tremors all over the body. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Amongst the drugs she is taking salbutamol can cause tremors.Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with her doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am writing on behalf of my mother to see if anyone else has experienced the symptoms she is experiencing. She is in her early 60's and relatively healthy. She has some fairly common health issues like Asthma, Gastroesophageal reflux disease and Fibromyalgia but no major health problems.She is now experiencing the following symptoms which she describes as 'turns' or 'spells' she's been having where she gets a loud ringing in her ears (what she describes as almost the sound of high voltage lines buzzing) and an intense and powerful sensation in her head which then moves through her whole body. The entire thing lasts only a minute or two but leaves her completely and utterly exhausted for a day or two. She is not confused or disoriented in any way as these turns are taking place.She currently takes Prevacid, Singulair, Cozaar (Losartan), Flovent and Salbutimol for the Asthma, Reflux and Fibromyalgia. She recently had an exam and catscan done which showed absolutely no problems in her brain, sinus or middle/inner ear.I'm wondering if anyone else have ever experienced anything like this or has any idea what might be causing it? Thanks for any info :-)",
