            "answer": "Hi,I do think you should have some testing done. Especially if your symptoms are severe. Ideally you should have an oral glucose tolerance test which can help determine many different possibilities including diabetes, prediabetes and reactive hypoglycemia.In the meantime, eat small mixed meals during the day(meals that contain a little protein, carbohydrate and fat) and try to avoid heavy carbohydrate loads if you can. The testing should help answer some of your questions and you can go from there.By the way, if you ever have these symptoms while driving, please pull off the road until you feel better. Better to be safe...Good luck and take care.",
