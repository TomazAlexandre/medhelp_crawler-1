    "question": "Hello! So I have a ridiculous amount of unresolved health issues that I'm hoping someone here might have some insight or are experiencing the same things as I am. First, I have migraines with aura that I've had for years but the last 2 years I get 20+ a month and have recently sought help for them and am seeing a neurologist for them and just got a MRI today and awaiting the results. The last month or so I've been experiencing tingling and numbness in my pinky fingers and pinky toes that fans out to the other fingers gradually and up the arm and legs and feelings of muscle weakness. I also am VERY fatigued and tired ALL THE TIME , seriously I have no energy despite the fact I get 8hrs of sleep a night. Now I've been tested and been negative for Lupus, thyroid issues, Celiac (I mention this because I have stomach issues as well, am allergic to Nickle, negative also for Diabetes, and anemia. Does anyone else experience this or know what it could be?! I'm so desperate for answers it's excruciating and feels so isolating :(",
