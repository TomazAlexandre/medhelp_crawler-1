            "answer": "Hi there,There are no such medicines which can prolong the hardness of penis.The products available in the market have no supporting scientific literature .For a successful and prolonged erection physical and emotional factors both play a vital role. An erection involves your brain, nerves, hormones, and blood vessels. Anything that interferes with either of this can lead to erection problems .Repeated feelings of guilt, doubt, poor communication with your partner all can lead to erection problems. Depression, alcohol.stress, anxiety all can affect your performance. Intake of medications like beta blockers, antidepressants, and diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, and multiple sclerosis all can lead to this problem. Try to evaluate yourself and discuss it out with your partner. A relaxed mind and a good foreplay should help. In case the problem persists seek medical help. Do write to us again.Take care and regards!",
