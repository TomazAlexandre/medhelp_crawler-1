            "answer": "Hi and welcome,I had to look both these up because they were unfamiliar to me in relation to MS and i couldn't for the life of me work out, why your neuro would be prescribing these as a preventative for MS cognitive decline....\"What is simvastatin?Simvastatin is in a group of drugs called HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, or \"statins.\" It reduces levels of \"bad\" cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein, or LDL) and triglycerides in the blood, while increasing levels of \"good\" cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein, or HDL).Simvastatin is used to lower cholesterol and triglycerides (types of fat) in the blood.Simvastatin is also used to lower the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other heart complications in people with diabetes, coronary heart disease, or other risk factors. http://www.drugs.com/simvastatin.html\"What is Biotin.....It is not certain whether biotin is effective in treating any medical condition. Medicinal use of this product has not been approved by the FDA. Biotin should not be used in place of medication prescribed for you by your doctor.Biotin is often sold as an herbal supplement. There are no regulated manufacturing standards in place for many herbal compounds and some marketed supplements have been found to be contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs. Herbal/health supplements should be purchased from a reliable source to minimize the risk of contamination.\" http://www.drugs.com/mtm/biotin.htmlI genuinely couldn't find anything that could help answer your questions but i think it would be in your best interest to consult medical advice before attempting to be proactive with MS cognitive issues, self medicating is not recommended!Cheers...........JJ",

    "question": "Does biotin interact with or reduce the effectiveness of simvastatin?I am considering simvastatin a) 80mg/day to prevent cognitive decline due to MS, plus b) biotin 300mg/day to improve mitochondrial function. a) is based on the results of a phase 2 study published by Chataway in 2014, and b) is on the results of a small pilot study (no control) on this very high dose published in France this year.Conversely does simvastatin influence biotin.Thanks.",
