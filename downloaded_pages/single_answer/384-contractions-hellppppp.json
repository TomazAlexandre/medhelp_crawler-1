    "question": "When I went to the dr the other day they said I was having contractions with no pattern and sent me home. Today I am having contractions about 20 or so minutes apart. Not incredibly painful but uncomfortable. I have gestational diabetes and tested positive for gbs so I'm terrifies of giving still birth. Dr said they would induce me at 39 weeks if I haven't gone into labor but I haven't gotten a definite date yet. I know I sound like I'm rushing him out but I'm terrifies he is going to die. I've read such horrible things",
