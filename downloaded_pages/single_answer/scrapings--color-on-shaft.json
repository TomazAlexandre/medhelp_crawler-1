    "question": "Well Dr. Rokoff next question. If my dermatologist wishes to do some scrapings to get cells off of the glans/shaft area \"OUCH\" How does he go about doing this without causing much pain and also bleeding since that area is very spongy and probably bleeds a lot??Second I\u00a0\u00a0have been doing a lot of reading that states that candida comes many times from eating a lot of sugar or having a lot of sugar in your diet. I must confess that I am a sugar junkie and I have made a serious decision to stop this right away effective today!! Too much chocolate, fruit juices etc. My hemoglobin 1ac was up quite a bit and this made me think very soberly. Have you seen any patients whose candida skin rash was possibly due to a person eating a lots of sugar?Lastly, My RASH is on the shaft right next to the glans and goes around the penis bottom and top. When I looked this up on an internet picture the picture they showed looked exactly like a penis whose diagnosis they marked as candida albicans. Have you had any patients like this??Rich DeGarmo (Trainbuff)Look forward to your replies!!",
