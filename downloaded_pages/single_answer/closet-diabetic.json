    "question": "My husband has over the past few months, been getting very tired, dry skin and tingling/pins and needles in his hands and feet, sometimes to the point of extreme pain. He has always had a lagre appetite but it appears to be on the increase. Diabetes runs in his family with his grandmother, father and brother all carriers. We bought a blood glucose monitoring kit (finger stick) and his results from one test that we did 9 hours after eating lunch was 114, and the other 1 1/2 hours after dinner read 256. To me that seems abnormally high. could he have developed diabetes too?",
