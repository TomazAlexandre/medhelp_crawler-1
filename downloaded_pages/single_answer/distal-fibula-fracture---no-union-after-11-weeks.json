            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Well, without looking at your X-ray reports, I really cannot comment. However, please do not bear full weight on a fracture that has not united. The non uniting fracture can be due to low blood supply, poor mineralization, presence of diabetes, presence of infection, poor alignment, or too much space between the fracture ends. This is usually treated by bone grafts, immobilization with plates and screws, or removal of scarred tissue from fractured ends. Basically all these processes need surgery. Consult an orthopedic surgeon.\u00a0\u00a0If the surgeon allows you to bear weight without surgery, then go ahead with that line of treatment. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hi, I broke my right ankle (lateral malleolus, closed) on 9/9 while getting off a bus. ER put a splint on frcture and 2 days later I got a walking brace from a Podiatrist. I did NWB for 5 weeks (crutches & boot), then PWB (boot on ground with 2 crutches) for 5 more weeks. I did PT for 3 weeks starting from week #8. PT consists only of range of motion & resitance so far (no weight bering). I went to doc today and the X-ray still has a visible fracture. But doc is asking me to start walking with sneakers (no boots) and start weight bearing excercises in PT. He says the fracture may unite slowly or not unite at all. But he should treat me based on how I'm feeling. I have s light swelling in ankle area but other than that weight bearing is OK so far. Is this going to lead to long term issues? Will I end up with plating & bone grafting ? Should I get opinion from OS ? Please advise?",
