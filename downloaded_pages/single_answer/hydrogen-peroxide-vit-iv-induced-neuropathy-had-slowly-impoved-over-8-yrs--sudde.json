            "answer": "There may have been an injury to the peripheral nerve axons originally. In this type of injury, the nerves may have been damaged permanently, although some nerve regrowth can occur over 12-18 months after the injury. The hands and feet nerves, being farther from teh central nervous system, are more vulnerable to injury, and take the longest to recover.Once damaged, the pain may have settled down, but the damaged nerves may be more vulnerable to any further injury (less 'reserve')In any case, the cause of the second worsening may be something else, and should be worked up by your doctor to ruleout other conditions, such as diabetes, sjogrens syndrome, monoclonal gammopathy, HIV etcMost of these tests are simple blood tests. Electrodiagnositc studies are unlikely to be of much benefit. Sensory neuropathies can now be investigated by a new test - epidermal nerve fiber analysis from a skin biopsy, available at some of the larger neuromuscular centers (such as the Cleveland Clinic)Chronic lyme disease is an unlikely diagnosis.Good luck",

    "question": "Eight years ago i had a severe, acute, sudden onset of neuropathy from the knees down after being given 7 hydrogen peroxide/vit iv's.\u00a0\u00a0For two years, I could not walk or drive; the pain was unbearable.\u00a0\u00a0Very, very slowly, over the past eight yrs, the nerves had been healing.\u00a0\u00a0Though still limited, I even started taking ballroom dance lessons!\u00a0\u00a0Then, about two months ago, I overdid it by standing on tile/concrete too much.\u00a0\u00a0Standing on hard surfaces had remained the most difficult task for me.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't too worried as at that point in my recovery I usually bounced back in a day.\u00a0\u00a0The following day I pushed through the pain and ran a few errands.\u00a0\u00a0The next day, the burning, smashed-in feeling was back in my legs and feet.\u00a0\u00a0I tried one lyrica pill.\u00a0\u00a0It gave me the sensation of my whole body swelling, so I didn't take another.\u00a0\u00a0I was then given Amitriptyline.\u00a0\u00a0It, too, caused swelling, and I had some numbness in my feet, so after a week, I stopped that.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still struggling w/ getting swelling down.\u00a0\u00a0I was also taking low dose (25 mgs a night)seroquel off label for insomnia for about a yr.\u00a0\u00a0I could tell that aggravated the neuropathy, but I thought at the low dose it would be fine.\u00a0\u00a0Suspicious of that, I stopped about a month ago and am now taking Lunesta.\u00a0\u00a0The pain continues to worsen.\u00a0\u00a0Stabbing/burning is back & spreading-now my feet & hands feel raw and as though they've been sanded w/ sandpaper-some spreading throughout body. Likely have chronic lyme but thought bc of original cause and never having relapse, this couldn't happen.\u00a0\u00a0ANY IDEAS WHAT'S GOING ON NOW? NEED HELP!!",
