            "answer": "This could be folliculitis, dermatitis, or allergic reaction. In most individuals there are outbreaks of folliculitis from time to time.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months.Let us know if you need any other information and consult a skin specialist if the lesion is persistent.Regards.",

    "question": "This started about 2 months ago and is just getting worst. About a month ago I went to my doctor complaining to him about how I had these red bumps all over my arms and they itched so bad that I was not sleeping at night. He gave me some type of cream and said put this on it at night, and you should see it start to clear up in about 2-3 days. He called it foliculitous. Well whatever that stuff is. So I took my trip to Ohio, and when I returned I told my mother that it was worst. She said for me to use up all the cream and then to call the dr. again. Well I'm kind of tired of having this and it's very unattractive! To date, now I have the red bumps on my legs, thighs, lower stomach, belly button, and of course my arms. Sometimes the come up clear bumps and then you pop them and they have clear fluid that comes out. Other's just come straight up at red bumps. Back over the summer I did get staph in my leg but that's been long gone for months and I treated that correctly. Nobody else in my household is experiencing this \"rash\" but it's becoming really annoying especially when I'm out with my boyfriend and all I'm doing the whole time is scratching. Can anyone help me please?",
