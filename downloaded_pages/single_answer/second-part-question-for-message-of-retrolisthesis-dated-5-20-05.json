            "answer": "It may indeed be a radiculopathy, but could also be some nerve root compression in the neckI cannot give advice that substitutes for a formal evaluation by your doctors, but they should MR your neck, and look carefully for causes of a thoracic radiculopathy such as Lyme, diabetes, or early diabetes, or a herpetic viral infection.An EMG may be useful, but is more limited in the upper limb and thoracic area than further distallyGoo dluck",

    "question": "On the second part question for \"Retrolisthesis\" dated 5/20/05 I ran out of space, sorry doctor. In any case I wanted to know the possible pathology that the symptoms I described could possibly mean. I have been told by several doctors it could be a pinched nerve at the cervical area, however one doctor says it could be related to my mid-back, thoracic area. The only MRI I had performed several years ago showed 2mm bulges at C5-C6,C6-C7 with minimal anterior indentation of cervical spinal cord at C5-6. At the time the MRI had been taken I only had moderate discomfort with mild pain. I now suffer from heavy pressure at upper-left back that radiates to front of chest. I also have pain(moderate)with numbness at upper-back,pain at side of arms with tingling of pinky,ring finger. The pressure is felt at any time. I might lift something lite with my left arm, or lean forward, turn my neck either L or R,and it ussually starts as soon as I get up in the morning. Sometimes I could just be simply walking or seating down for 20 or so minutes and the heavy pressure numbeness starts. At my mid-back I have constant pain/burning sensation that is made worse by lifting my arms or doing some repetative action(like ironing).I have been told that I have a slight elevation at the midback area and that it feels hot.Sometimes the burning pain becomes like an electrical shock if I make a sudden movement. The only MRI I took at the Thoracic area showed nothing and a Lumbar MRI showed a small bulge of 2mm at T12-L1.What do you think is causing my upper-back symptoms, the midback or upperback?",
