            "answer": "Hi,You need to consult your doctor for your diabetes and blood pressure - you should start appropriate medication in consultation with your doctor immediately to keep the blood sugar and blood pressure under control.This could be due to acne/pimples/ or infection of the hair follicles called folliculitis or some bacterial infection/ fungal infection or some skin nodules etc.Nothing can be said with surety without having a look at the lesions.It would be best to reconsult your doctor about your symptoms if they do not resolve and get a proper clinical examination.Keep the area clean and wear clothes washed in a few drops of chlorhexidine preferably and dried in the sun.Let us know about what your doctor advises.Regards.",
