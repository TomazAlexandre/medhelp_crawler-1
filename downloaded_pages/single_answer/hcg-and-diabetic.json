            "answer": "Are you positively certain your medical doctor instructed you to NOT take your insulin? Speaking personally, I have my doubts about a doctor who said to try a health changing diet \"at my own risk\". Is she your PCP? If so, you need to get a second opinion preferably from a diabetes specialist, an Endocrinologist.You feel fine because your body has gotten accustomed to your very high & unhealthy glucose levels. Let us know what she has to say about your fax. BTW, what were those 5 day levels?",
