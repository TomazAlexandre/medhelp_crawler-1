            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If acute renal failure is caused by dehydration, blood loss, or obstruction in the urinary system is rapidly reversed and this may have happened in your case. High creatinine is also seen in kidney involvement in diabetes, glomerulonephritis or kidney infection. Hence these must be ruled out. Bleeding in the gut too can increase creatinine level, hence a stool test for occult blood should be done.If urine is being formed, then the creatinine level will come down with time but will need to be monitored for some time. Other than that only your treating doctor can access the situation better.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
