    "question": "I am 30 weeks pregnant with gestational diabetes, mild anemia, and hypothyroidism. I have good blood pressure numbers (usually kind of low) and no other issues except some swelling in my legs after standing or sitting for a long time. This afternoon, I took about a 2 hour nap and when I got up my skin on my face and neck and part of my chest was pretty yellow. This faded back to normal after about an hour or so. Would this be jaundice? I've never noticed this before. I didn't know if it was a weird pregnancy thing or what. If it happens again tomorrow, I'm going to call my doctor. I'm just curious if anyone else has ever had something like this happen or knows what it could be.",
