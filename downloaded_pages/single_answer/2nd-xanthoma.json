            "answer": "Hello,Xanthomas are deposits of fat/cholesterol in the eye lid. Possible causes are raised cholesterol, hyperlipidaemia states, diabetes mellitus and obesity.They cause no harm, but can increase in size producing cosmetic blemish. The only treatment is removal by surgery with/without skin grafting (depending on the size of the lesion) or use of laser (CO2 Laser). You can discuss these treatment options with your dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with an eyelid xanthoma under my left eye about 3 months ago. It came on quickly and grew quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I've been to my MD who put me on a statin. I've lost 12lbs and dropped my cholesterol 80 points, and dropped my triglycerides about the same. I'm 42 years old and have made major changes in my diet. I just noticed a second xanthoma on my right eye up near the corner by my nose. Can I expect this one to grow as fast as the first one? Is removing these considered \"cosmetic\" in the health insurance industry? Am I going to continue to get these the rest of my life? They are very ugly and people are constantly trying to wipe them off as if I have a smudge of make-up under my eye. It's embarrassing.This discussion is related to/posts/show/240909.",
