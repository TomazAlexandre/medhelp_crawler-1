            "answer": "Hello,Recurrent urine infections could be due to various reasons. Most common cause is stones in kidney which is blocking urine pathway. Other causes are changing sexual partners frequently, pregnancy, diabetes and of course childhood infections. The urine can also be due to retention of urine anywhere in its flow due to obstruction.

So you should get a ultrasound, CT scan done and also some urine and blood tests like urine culture and complete examination.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided.
