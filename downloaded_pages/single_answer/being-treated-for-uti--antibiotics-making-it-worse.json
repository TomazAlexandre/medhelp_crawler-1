    "question": "Hi all! I hope that someone may have some words of advice as I am about at my wit's end. For about a month now I'd had a fairly constant urge to urinate. I always actually did go, in small volumes, and there was never any pain or burning. It didn't let up though, so I finally went in to ask a doctor. They tested me for a UTI an that came back negative, they also tested my sugar levels in case of diabetes but they were normal. The doctor decided it was probably a UTI anyway and gave me 5 days of Ciprofloxacin.I'm 3 days in and the urgency has gotten much worse. It was almost completely tolerable before, just a little troubling, but now it is a constant terrible urge, still no pain, but it is often barely a couple drops. I went back in and told the doctor, he was puzzled, told me to keep taking the cipro as maybe it was about to get worse anyway. The cipro is making me feel sick and exhausted and makes what I'm taking it for worse, so I'm not too thrilled.Any ideas? Google has made me terrified of either IC or a tumor or cancer an I would love some reassurance that it might not be something awful.Thanks!!",
