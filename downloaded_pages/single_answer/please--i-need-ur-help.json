            "answer": "Hello,There are many conditions which can cause toe nail discoloration. Mostly, discolored nails are a result of infections with common fungi that can be found in the air, dust, and soil. Pseudomonas is a type of bacteria that infects the nail bed and result in a greenish color to the nails. Red or black nails may result from a hematoma (a collection of blood) under the nail as a result of trauma. Apart from that, medical conditions like diabetes, liver, kidney or heart disorders can also cause discoloration of toenails and aa detailed and through complete body check up is needed.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
