            "answer": "Hello & welcome to the forum......Cooking for your girl is a WISE decision....Please, throw the Science Diet away!!!Here's a wonderful link for homecooking recipes....Strombeck's Home Prepared Diets....The Link is below.....What your looking for will be listed under \"Endoncrine\" Diseases....When you get to the recipes and see the ingredients, \"Calcium Carbonate Tablets\" are Human \"Tums\",(Can be purchased at any store)....Regular strength \"Tums\" are 500 mg..... Calcium is the most important factor when homecooking.....\"Wheat Bran\" is located in the cereal Isle at any grocery store......The moisture in homecooked foods (As opposed to Dry Diets) will help with flushing out the Kidneys....Very important!Please, DO NOT Vaccinate your dog any longer (If you still do) and always add Filtered water to her water bowl.....Do not use tap water...There are too many chemicals that the Liver & Kidneys have to filter....Good luck to you and her...PLease, come back if you have anymore questions and let us know how she's doing.....Karlahttp://dogcathomeprepareddiet.com/",
