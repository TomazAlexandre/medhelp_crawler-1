It can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, neujrological causes or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve. If the symptoms persist then get the above mentioned possibilities ruled out from a neurologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided.

    "question": "Hi,I have been type tested for HSV and tested positive for HSV-1 only. If I've ever had an actual cold sore it was in my teens, I'm now 34. My question is that there is one spot on the vermillion border of my lip that constantly tingles, there is a slight burning sensation and it is red and irritated. There are never any blisters, papules or blemishes. the skin is just red and it always occurs in the same spot. I don't think that this would be associated with HSV due to the frequency of symptoms (almost everyday for the last 4 months).I take a daily suppressive medication (1000mg valacyclovir) everyday because it has made me so paranoid. However, I'm still experiencing these symptoms. If it's not herpes, any idea of what it could be? It's so confusing due to the fact that there's tingling but never any bumps of any kind.Thanks so much for your help!",
