            "answer": "Hi!With your symptoms you must look into the following conditions: IBS or spastic colon Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, diabetes, food intolerance, malabsorption syndromes, constipation, gallbladder and liver problems, and pancreatic dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0Taking a diet rich in sulfites juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, red wine, mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough can also cause too much gas, pale stools, diarrhea etc. Cancers of the gut (intestines, stomach, colon, rectum) and in female ovarian cancer too could be a cause.Also, yes, if you have IBS, you can both lose and gain weight. Weight gain would be related to anemia and electrolyte imbalance and weight loss can be due to poor absorption and nutritional deficiency. Please ask your doctor to look into all these possibilities. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
