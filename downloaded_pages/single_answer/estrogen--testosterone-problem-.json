            "answer": "Hi,Well, I do not have a specific answer to your problems, but can give you some points to ponder. In the first place, I am not sure whether your testosterone measurement is total testo or free testo. I am assuming it to be free, since if it is total testo, your LH being normal and testo being outside range may have to be viewed from another perspective. By the way, what was your LH level measured? So, my following comments apply assuming the measurement was for free testo only.I do not know if you have measured the SHBG ( Sex Hormone Binding Globulin), to which most of the circulating testo produced by testes gets attached and finally gets thrown out of the body, leaving only the remaining fraction available as bio available. The bio available circulating testo itself is composed of free testo (about 3% of total testo ) and balance about 40% are circulated being bound to albumin, which can also be recovered and used by the body cells.An obese body produces less of SHBG so that even if total testo produced is less, the free testo levels can be high.Further, high level of insulin produced in type 2 diabetes also tend to reduce SHBG levels, see the following link for more details:http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc0910143Thus in your case, if you have measured free testo levels, one could expect a higher level. But again in a obese body the testo gets converted into estrogen by aromatise enzyme in the fat tissues.So a high level of estrogen can also be expected.Thus the possible solution may lie in reducing the excess insulin production along with reduction of body weight.Interestingly, I hope, you know that there is a surgery for weight reduction, which also helps to cure type 2 diabetes permanently. As I understand, it involves bypassing the initial two segments of the small intestine, though I have my own doubts about the procedure. You can get more details by Googling for ' surgery for type 2 diabetes '.I await your response regarding the above points.Solace",

    "question": "Hi! I would be grateful for any insight to my problem. I am a 34 year old male, type 2 diabetic and 300 pounds (I'm working hard currently to reduce this).About a month ago I started to experience intense nipple sensitivity and a slight swelling in that area. My GP took some bloods TFT, FSH/LH, Prolactin, Oestrogen/Testerone levels and one other (can't recall).\u00a0\u00a0All the test were normal except that BOTH my estrogen AND testosterone were higher than the normal range. Estrogen was at 220 and testosterone was 42 (sorry - not sure about the unit of measure but the bloods were taken in the UK if that helps!).He thinks this may be diabetes related - I'm on a new medication (victoza) which has shifted my blood very quickly (in 4/5 months my hba1c went from 12.2 to 6.4).\u00a0\u00a0My GP is looking into this and I am seeing my Endo for a routine diabetes check up in a couple of months - so I will ask him.\u00a0\u00a0But in the meantime if anyone has any opinions or insight to this then I would be grateful.Thank you",
