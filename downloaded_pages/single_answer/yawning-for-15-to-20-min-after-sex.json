            "answer": "Hi!Some people feel drowsy or weary after sex and may yawn excessively. It could also be due to low stamina due to anemia, diabetes or hypothyroidism. The other possibility is a vasovagal reflex triggered by sex. This settles down a few minutes later when pulse or heart rate return to normal. It can also be a sign of multiple sclerosis or a manifestation of excessive day time sleepiness. Please discuss with her doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
