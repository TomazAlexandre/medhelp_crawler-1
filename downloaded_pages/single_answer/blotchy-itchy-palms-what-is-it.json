            "answer": "Hello!Blotchy rash can be due to any allergic reaction. Any tingling or numb sensation in the muscles is due to paresthesia. Any peripheral vascular disease, atherosclerosis can lead to a proper supply of blood and nutrients. The nerve cells can no longer then adequately send signals to the brain. Vitamin deficiencies, metabolic disorders like diabetes and hypothyroidism, Lyme disease, a brain tumor, motor neuron disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus all can lead to pins and needles feeling. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out. Do keep us posted.Take care and regards!",

    "question": "About 3 weeks ago I was on vacation and it was pretty hot outside. I got a rash on the back of my calves which I presume was a heat rash. Soon after my palms also started to have not normal spots. The spots have since gone away, mostly, they are still slightly visible but not as pronounced. However, the palm area in intermittently very itchy.Also been having pins and needles feeling in feet a bit too. Don't know if its related but started noticing that as well.Strangely both the pins feeling and blotchy palm are both on the left side. Right side seems ok.Any ideas?",
