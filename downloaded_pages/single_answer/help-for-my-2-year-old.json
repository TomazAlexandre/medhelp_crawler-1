    "question": "My son has had increased thirst and urination since august. he has had fevers on and off since June.They have tested him for everything.He was tested for diabetes and did the fasting and it came back at 94.we are still waiting for the a1c test.His appetite has also decreased for about 3 weeks now. He has not had a fever since 15 Dec.They kept calling all his fevers different viruses.He was in the hospital twice and has seen every specialist out there except endo. He also has Shones syndrome with his heart. I was wondering if its not diabetes what can cause the extreme thirst and urination.He drinks about 10oz cups of watered down juice or water and 2 cups of milk a day.He literally walks around with a cup in his hand and if he cannot find it goes frantic.Does anyone have any clues as to what he could have.You are welcome to visit my home page and read my posts of his past history.",
