            "answer": "Hi!In all probability your weight is the cause of your problems, especially if you are a person with a medium frame. The weight could also be due to an underlying cause such as diabetes, hypothyroid, Cushing's disease, or due to liver disorders. Hence all these causes need to be eliminated, as all can cause peripheral nerve disorders. Lower back MRI should be done to rule out pinched lumbo-sacral spinal nerves. Dopplar studies should be done to rule out vascular pathologies.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
