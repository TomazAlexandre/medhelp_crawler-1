            "answer": "Nothing in life is a guarantee. Children often times pickup parents bad habits and MAY carry them into adulthood. This is one bad. The other bad, that cannot be prevented, is you inherited your parents diabetes gene. Doesn't matter if you are Mr Universe, if you got the gene your risk of getting diabetes is higher than the next person.

That in itself is the best prevention and blood glucose control.",
