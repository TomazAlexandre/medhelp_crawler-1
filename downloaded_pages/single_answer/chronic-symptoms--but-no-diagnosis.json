    "question": "I am a 46 year-old female. About 10 months ago, I suddenly experienced a loud roaring noise in my right ear, coupled with neck pain, that is still with me 24/7. 3 months ago, symptoms progressed and I began to experience sharp headaches and fatigue, and low tolerance to cold air and/or windy conditions (just a general feeling of the onset of illness). In addition to the roaring sound in my right ear, I am now experiencing the roaring in my left ear on occasion.My thyroid is normal, MRI and MRA came back with nothing, X-ray normal. Antibodies are normal, so my immune system is strong.I've taken 2 rounds of antibiotics (one round self-administered, and another round administered by a doctor, who at one point thought I had an infection of some sort), and no results.I'm frustrated, because I don't know what is the cause of all these symptoms.I have considered my medications, and their possible side effects. One of them is DDAVP (Desmopressin Acetate), which I have taken every day of my life over the past 30 years for the treatment of Diabetes Insipidus, along with the low-estrogen birth control pill called Lo-Estrin, for the treatment of Endometriosis.I have lived many years with a lot of stress, and am beginning to believe the stress has finally taken a toll on my body. This is the only thing I can conclude at this point.",
