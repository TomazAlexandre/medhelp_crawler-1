            "answer": "Hi!The symptoms could be due to hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, hypothyroidism, lupus etc. Fibromyalgia is another possibility. At localized points it can also be a sign of deep vein thrombosis or vasculitis, especially if it is in legs and thigh. Compression of spinal nerves in cervical spine or lumbar spine region should also be looked into. This would need a comprehensive investigation. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
