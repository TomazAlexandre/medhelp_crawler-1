            "answer": "2 hour glucose test lab values are measured in mg/dl or mmol/L.In prediabetic -From 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 to 11.1 mmol/L)and in Diabetes Equal to or greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) on more than one tests.Please post results accurately.The kappa free light chain result should be repeated to establish a trend and I think also the kappa/lambda ratio would be useful as it indicates activity, however, more diagnostic tests may be needed.The 1:40 ANA is normal, considered negative up to 1:160, not useful for diagnostic purposes.Her doctor is likely right.Can you tell us more about her symptoms, dietary habits, fitness level,age, weight,etc, including brief med. history?Cheers,Niko",
