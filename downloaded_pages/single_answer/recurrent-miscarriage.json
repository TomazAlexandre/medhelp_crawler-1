            "answer": "I presume that ehe doctor found out that you ureaplasma/mycoplasma. I wonder what kind of biopsy was done?Ureaplasma/mycoplasma has been shown in some studies to be associated with recurrent miscarriage and it is a simple treatment ie Doxycycline.I hope that is the reason for your miscarriages.I hope you were tested for all the potential reasons just in case.Here is some general information from my website:\u00a0\u00a0www.integrativefertilitymd.com\"Women who have had two or more miscarriages can be seen in our clinic to be completely evaluated and treated for the various causes of recurrent pregnancy loss. Recurrent pregnancy loss can be attributed to many different causes. These causes include: genetic factors (e.g. abnormal fetal chromosomes, abnormal parental chromosomes); anatomic factors (e.g. structural abnormalities of the uterus such as scar tissue in the uterus, or congenital abnormalities of the uterus such as septate uterus); metabolic factors (e.g. diabetes); endocrine factors (e.g. abnormal thyroid, PCOS, diminished ovarian reserve); infectious factors (e.g. chlamydia, mycoplasma, ureaplasma); thrombotic factors (e.g. inherited thrombophilias); immunologic factors (e.g. anticardiolipin antibodies, autoimmune disorders, increased natural killer cell activity); male factors (e.g. sperm DNA fragmentation); and environmental factors (e.g. exposure to environmental toxins). \"",

    "question": "Hi, I'm 29 yrs old, did IVF twice this year. First & 2nd time got pregnant with no problem, got to about 7 weeks and heartbeat decreased, 2nd time miscarried for no reason. I did pregnancy loss testing,chromosomes, karyotype,etc. all came back negative. Had a biopsy and tested positive for urethritis. My Dr is putting me & my husband on Doxycycline to clear up the infection.Could this really be the cause of both my miscarriages?? If I get preganant again, could the urethritis come back again & cause a miscarriage again??",
