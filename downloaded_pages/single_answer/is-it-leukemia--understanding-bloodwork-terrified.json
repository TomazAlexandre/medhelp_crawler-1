            "answer": "Hello,Low WBC count shows some viral infections, immunodeficiency states, and bone marrow failure.Going by your symptoms, and low WBC,I feel that the possibility of multiple myeloma needs to ruled out.It is a tumor of the bone cells and typically presents with pain in the back esp lower back. It is diagnosed by Electrophoresis (EP) which measures the levels of various proteins in the blood or urine.Bone scans and bone marrow biopsy are also sometimes helpful in confirming.I feel that you should consult an oncologist and get this possibility evaluated.Hope it helps.If you have any additional queries,then pls post us.Take care and regards.",
