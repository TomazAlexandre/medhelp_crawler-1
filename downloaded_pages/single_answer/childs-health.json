            "answer": "Hi!If celiac, Crohn\u2019s, ulcerative colitis are ruled out then she could be having IBS. If she has a bad reflux since early childhood then she could be having a hiatal hernia. Along with ranitidine she may benefit from taking probiotics. Also burping, gas etc since early childhood can be due to lactose intolerance. So stop all dairy products and see.Diabetes can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence get her blood sugar tested. It can also be due to excess consumption of food rich in sulfites like juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough.Do discuss this with her doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "My 11 year old daugther had acid reflux badly as a baby and upto the age of 15month, but after that from about age of 3 I noticed she would bloat terribly-huge, when got to age of 10 lots kids asked if she was expecting, well she looks 3 years older than she is, already 5ft 6 at just 11, big frame. She also be sick or get terrible wind-or burping most of the time, had to take lot time off primary school. ...last year they asked me to get her help.She has seen dieticans over the years, who just said put on her a no processed diet also as overweight. She didnt eat alot of rubbish, my eldest child of nearly 16 petite, eats what she likes/more, i got fed up with them just blaming weight my youngest, saying just elimate things. a new doctor at my surgery put her on Raniditine a year ago.The bloating still occurs so blood tests for celiac, glucose, bowel probs etc where done 4 months, did come back clear thank goodness, she may have IBS they said. I said i was putting on her a low wheat diet, they suggested maybe no wheat-intolerance. The Ranitidine has helped stop the sickness and wind, if misses a dose more than two days though wiill feel sick again. 4 months had wheat free diet, she still get very bloated...alot of times she still gets constipated and bleeds when goes to the proper toilet. Im am starting to think she may have something else, well Diverticilitus. Any help please, I have heard Disgestive Enzymes can helpe, when she is 12. S Monk",
