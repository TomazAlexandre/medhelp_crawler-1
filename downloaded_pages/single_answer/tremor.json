            "answer": "Hi!If you had MRI and CT scan of head and neck then any muscle injury, pinched nerve, abnormalities in the vertebral column will be caught. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You will need blood sugar monitoring, MRI of brain and cervical spine, T3, T4, TSH, sleep studies, serum electrolytes, brain EEG, etc to reach a diagnosis. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi there, I am a 27 year old F/M. I had my neck injured by a chiropractior dec 19th 2011, my neck has heeld, however\u00a0\u00a0on the 10th Febuary 2012 I started to get an internal shaking on one side of my body, the shaking was constant and only started to clam down (but was still there) around 8- 6 weeks after. I still get the shaking now it is on and off. I also get body zaps in my foot, back, ribs, arms ( feels like very fast shaking in cretian areas, or a pinging rubber band). I also have cotremor in my vision, I can still see everything but I also see this shaking, it makes it hard to concentrate, I can see the shaking more when I look at dark objects, not so much in natural light. I have had a head/neck mri and ct scan because of the chiropractior\u00a0\u00a0neck twist, because i had weird swallowing problems.",
