    "question": "My husband, niece, my son and myself all have type 1 diabetes. I have three children and my eldest son who is now seven years old got diagnosed with it when he was two and a half. My youngest son who is five years old has been having random finger blood tests and some have been a bit elevated with the highest reading being 11.3mmols. He has had a HbA1c blood test done and it was 6.1 (a normal reading for a child should be between 4 and 6),so it is not really abnormal. The doctor still seems to think that he may be developing diabetes and has sent some of his blood off for testing the antibody levels which she says may indicate whether he is at a higher risk. I really don't know what to think as I have not noticed any obvious symptoms to suggest he is developing diabetes other than fluctuating blood readings. Is there anyone else out there who is in a similar situation as us. I would be interested to hear from those whereby both parents are type 1 diabetics. Have their children developed diabetes too? Any advice would be appreciated.",
