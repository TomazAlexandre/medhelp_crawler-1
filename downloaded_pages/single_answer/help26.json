            "answer": "These are not any of the symptoms I've heard mentioned with diabetes, but you should notify your doctor of your family history and get your blood tested.\u00a0\u00a0If you google, there are numerous sites on this topic.\u00a0\u00a0I've listed one below.\u00a0\u00a0The combination of your various symptoms caught my attention and are were noting in a journal from here on out in order to keep track of them with times and dates if possible to take with you to your visit.\u00a0\u00a0This will also be helpful for future reference.\u00a0\u00a0Should it take a while to determine the cause.\u00a0\u00a0I hope your test comes back good with the diabetes and that maybe this is due to a touch of allergies, ibs and skin sensitivity or just plain old stress.\u00a0\u00a0The other options become more complex, long-term and unpleasant.\u00a0\u00a0I hope the link on diabetes provides some assistance.\u00a0\u00a0I'm guessing you probably already know a great deal about it since you have it in your family.\u00a0\u00a0You could also try asking members with it about their earliest symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Some people tend to notice odd symptoms related to the start of their illness that never make it to the top ten, as most of these sites will list.\u00a0\u00a0Wishing you good health and peace of mind on this soon!",

    "question": "In the last three weeks, I have developed some rather unique problems. It started about 3 weeks and I had an itchy feeling in my right eye, as if something was trapped behind it. Then two weeks ago, when I woke up, and there was numbness in my upper left thigh, along with a burning sensation in my eyes. I took an antihistamine, and for a while the burning went away. The next week I was feeling odd, and the next day I took a sick day. I had pizza an hour before I went to a work related thing I had to go to, and when I stood up, I suddenly became nauseous and my right arm became tingly. On Saturday, I felt better, but when I went to use the bathroom, I had 2 small poops, and then when I wiped there was blood. Sunday, I felt mediocre, but got better and better over the course of the day, and by the afternoon, pretty much felt 100 percent. That evening I had turkey, but within an hour had awful gas, and had some diarrhea before taking immodium AD. Last night I went to sleep, and when I woke up and tried to go back to sleep, whatever side I slept on tried to go numb. Today I felt pretty good, but over the course of the day my stomach felt like it filled up. My question is that could this be diabetes as I have a history of it in my family?",
