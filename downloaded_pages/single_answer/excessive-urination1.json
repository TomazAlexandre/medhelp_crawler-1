            "answer": "Hello Tae-rg,We are volunteers here and not physicians, so please follow up with your doctor with anything you read here (or anywhere on the Internet!).Excessive thirst could be caused by a lot of things -- ranging from simply not drinking enough fluids during the day to diabetes or other endocrine imbalances.One simple test to see if you're drinking enough water and other non-caffeine, non-diuretic liquids is to look at the color of your urine in the toilet.\u00a0\u00a0Normally, it should be very light yellow.\u00a0\u00a0If it is dark yellow, it may mean you are not taking enough water/fluid.\u00a0\u00a0Be careful, tho', as some medicines or vitamins make our urine dark yellow -- and if you're taking one of those, the dark color is NOT a good indicator of how well hydrated you are.Talk to your doctor again ... repeatedly until you get the answers you need.\u00a0\u00a0If needed, ask him/her to recommend someone you can get a second opinion from.Losing sleep because you wake up to drink water will soon exhaust you!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
