    "question": "After taking the glipizide 2.5mg, I felt my heart palpitate, chest pain/tight, coughing, dizziness, SOB and light headed (pressure). I took this glipizide for a while, they told me it is not the glipizide side effect. I felt very hard to live with this medication. I need to lay down when these happen.If whole day I don't take any glipizide, I won't feel sick. Metformin caused me very very SOB and exhausted. My diabetes doctor don't believe when I told her these......Anyone has any idea or suggest? Could I leave with high sugar? That way I can live without much complication. Dr said it can cause more damages if I don't control my blood sugar.",
