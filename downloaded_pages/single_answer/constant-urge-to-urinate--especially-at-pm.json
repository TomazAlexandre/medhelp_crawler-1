    "question": "i (40 year old male) have an ongoing issue in which i almost continually feel the need to urinate. yet i pass very little urine, with a very weak stream. it's somewhat manageable and less acute during the day, but at night it's near unbearable, laying down seems to aggravate the issue. i'm unable to sleep more than twenty or thirty minutes at a time. i wake up feeling as though i need to really go, then it's just a few drops here and there. i'm up fifteen or twenty times a night. i seem to have virtually all the symptons of an enlarged prostate, yet after an exam my dr. has said that's not the case. any thoughts would be welcome, thanks.",
