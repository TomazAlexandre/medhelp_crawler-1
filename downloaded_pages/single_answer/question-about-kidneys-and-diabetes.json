            "answer": "Hi Phire,Welcome to our site.\u00a0\u00a0As you may know, we're volunteers, not medical professionals, so do check in with your endocrinologist for specifics that pertain to your particulars.In general, it's a good idea for us to drink water and to keep well hydrated.\u00a0\u00a0Doing so, allows our kidneys to process more diluted wastes included excess sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking normal amounts of water won't, by itself, get high blood sugars into normal range but it will help our body deal with the impact.Again, in general, if we are well-hydrated and healthy fluid balance is achieved, then for every additional liquid we drink, we'll excrete the same amount.\u00a0\u00a0As I understand what I've read, healthy fluid balance is when our urine is light yellow to almost colorless in the toilet (unless we're taking meds that affect urine color! ).Personally, if my blood sugar is higher than I want, I have found that drinking more water does seem to quicken the transition to more normal BG.\u00a0\u00a0I can't explain it, but perhaps you're seeing something similar.If you're experiencing high blood sugars for long periods of time, I encourage you to re-evaluate your treatment routines & your own lifestyle choices.\u00a0\u00a0We all go thru times of diminished motivation and some experience episodes of depression & frustration, and yet we can feel so much better (and happier) when our BGs are within our target range.I wish you good luck, and hope my long answer addressed your concerns.\u00a0\u00a0If not, post again ... :-)\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure that others will chime in.",

    "question": "Hello, I was wondering that if I were to drink just plain water with every meal if that would help my kidneys flush out excess sugar in my body? Or to drink water more often would help flush out sugar as well? After drinking adequete amounts of water then urination should not be as frequent since sugar levels have been lowered by flushing it out into the urine?",
