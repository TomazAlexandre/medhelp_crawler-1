    "question": "Hi, I am 29 years old and suffering with an erectile dysfunction for the past 8 years, I first noticed it when my erection strength started weakening and thereafter I started getting a lot of discomfort in the waist line moving to the right side(sharp pains) with medication from doctors it subsided and then I noticed the scrotum and the area between the scrotum and anus, like a very sharp pain, as if I was electrocuted. I also noticed a very bad odour coming out of my penis when I pull foreskin back to urinate, my semen smells very bad and also get complaints if I get oral sex, now I no longer get erections and also did not get the morning erection for the past 8 years, as if my base of penis is broken, there is no feeling or sensation when aroused, I get total paralysis from waist downwards after using the toilet for 10 minutes, I have tried so many specialists over the years and done so many tests, tried GP's, Urologists, Chiropractors, Orthopaedic Surgeons(Thought it was due to a vehicle accident 10 years ago), done biopsy's, MRI Scans, X-Rays, semen samples, urine tests, blood tests, all came back clear, however the pain is still there and still no erection, first they said epididymitis ochatis, I just don't understand, I used to be very sexual, should go for many rounds, now I cant even get it up, stimulants should work before but now they are failing, when they should work I could only go 1 round, testicles used to be very sore after that round,",
