            "answer": "Hello,First your blood sugars are excellent and you are doing a fantastic job of getting regular exercise, so you should be congratulated.It is indeed a pain carrying around multiple tablets. The GlycoMet is one of the few combination tablets on the market. I am not familiar with Mignar.\u00a0\u00a0There are various combinations of diabetes pills, as well as\u00a0\u00a0even some cholesterol/high blood pressure pill combos.\u00a0\u00a0Those pills you mentioned however are not in combination with each other, as far as I know. I admit I am not very familiar with the brand names you cited but tried searching for their generic names online to familiarize myself.\u00a0\u00a0Your best bet really is to speak with your doctor about simplifying your regimen while continuing such excellent control. I am sure if there are ways to simplify, he/she will g that route.Take care.",
