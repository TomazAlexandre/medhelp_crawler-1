    "question": "I've been experiencing weakness and numbness in my legs for 6 days. I've had this before but it was a long time ago. I also had this when I hurt my back in Feb. but my back isn't bothering me now. My calves feel cold or hot, and tingly at the same time. I feel the pins and needles as if they're numb and when I stand they are weak and wobbly and I feel like they can't hold my weight. My face is a bit numb as well. I feel dizzy and lightheaded when I stand. No vertigo, or spinning. Just off balance and like I need to sit down or have help walking. I have facial flushing too. I've had sinus tachycardia for years and was diagnosed with very mild mitral valve prolapse. Had an MRI of brain and spine in 2004 which was negative for MS. I've been tested for lupus, anemia, diabetes, gluten allergies, vasovagal, inner ear problems, meniere's, and a number of other things. I do have orthostatic hypotension on occassion and am experiencing it now with this weird episode. I've been having bad headaches for a few weeks when I stand up. I do not have high blood pressure. I get weird burning pains in my limbs like someone is burning me with a cigarette. I used to get these on my breastbone but now just in the limbs.These problems have kept me in bed for 5 years and for the last 6 months has caused severe depression and panic attacks. I cannot drive and most days I can't even take care of myself. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I'm at the end of my rope with this illness.",
