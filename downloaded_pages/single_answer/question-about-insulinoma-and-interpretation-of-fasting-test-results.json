This does sound like a question for a medical expert, not a mere diabetes veteran like me.\u00a0\u00a0I would think that the doctor who administered this test could give you a lot more information. Good luck to you!ES",

    "question": "Hi, I am not a diabetic and I'm unlikely to become one, but I have a question for the team that is probably relevant to those with knowledge of the pancreas and managing blood-glucose.I have a genetic predisposition for insulinoma through MEN Type 1, which can result in hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0I have had hyperparathyroidism but my Calcium levels are now stable (post surgery).\u00a0\u00a0I am asymptomatic but I get regular tests for a number of endocrine conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, I have begun getting raised proinsulin levels after a 12 hour fast.\u00a0\u00a0How should I interpret that?\u00a0\u00a0I can't find a lot of information on this.\u00a0\u00a0My recent results are as follows:May 2005Glucose 5.5Insulin 68Proinsulin 50.9August 2005Glucose 4.4Insulin 24Proinsulin 43.1I will have another 12 hour test in a month's time.\u00a0\u00a0My understanding is that proinsulin levels should be well below that of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0My Glucose and Insulin levels fit in the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0What is the normal range for Proinsulin?\u00a0\u00a0I have no C-peptide results to report as that doesn't seem to be measured by the lab.thanks,",
