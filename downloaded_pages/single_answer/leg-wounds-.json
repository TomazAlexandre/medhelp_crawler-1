    "question": "Hello. Basically I were shorts year round and I have a tendency to smack my right shin into everything. I get wounds that at first have a clear liquid coming from them. After time they heal to look red and bruised. No pain to the touch just very slow healing. I have had blood work done and I'm not diabetic. Just hate how long it takes to heal. Any ideas to help speed recovery.",
