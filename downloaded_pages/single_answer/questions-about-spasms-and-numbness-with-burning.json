            "answer": "Hi, Thank you very much for your question. From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

    "question": "i starting having twitching in the muscle of my left arm a yr or so ago, and my whole left hand and fingers stay numb for the most part. I recently started getting muscle spasms in the left side of my mid back and in the calf of my right leg. Is there any info out there as to what it might be? Also my left foot and leg from the knee down stays numb or burning and with pain upon laying down at nite. My right leg is not numb but my right foot is at times. Any info on this ? Thank you!",
