            "answer": "Thyroid problems do not cause this much weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0A low thyroid can cause 10-15 pound gain, half of which is fluid retention, and can impair efforts to actively loose weight.\u00a0\u00a0But with a completely normal TSH, your thyroid hormone levels are likely adequate.\u00a0\u00a0Most patients with nodules/goiter have normal thyroid levels.Would re-evaluate the high cortisol level to make sure you don't have Cushings.Would consider evaluation for sleep apnea which slows metabolism (probably not all the only source of symptoms, but may be contributor).If you have nodules then FNA biopsy is helpful.\u00a0\u00a0If suspicious, surgery.\u00a0\u00a0If benign, but nodules causing pressure symptoms, also consider surgery.",
