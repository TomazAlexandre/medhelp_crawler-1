            "answer": "Hi,Muscle cramps are often caused by activities that we perform for long hours every day \u2013 such as typing and playing a musical instrument etc.\u00a0\u00a0If this applies to you, then you may be suffering from repetitive stress injuries. Please make it a point to take a break after every hour and stretch your hands and shake them to avoid cramping. If your cramps recur too often, consult a doctor as it may also be another problem like tendonitis or carpal tunnel syndrome. It could be just a deficiency of minerals (also called electrolytes) like potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium. This is a dietary problem that you need to take care of . Sometimes cramps also occur as side effects of some medicines or therapies, like chemotherapy, for example. Please take a diet rich in fruits and vegetables and go for gentle stretching exercises regularly. The symptoms may improve. Consult your doctor if the symptoms persist. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",
