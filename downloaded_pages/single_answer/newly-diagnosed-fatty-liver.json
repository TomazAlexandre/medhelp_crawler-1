    "question": "I have diabetes but am also a recovering alcoholic of two years. Went to the doctor with stomach pain and while he was pressing all over my belly he pressed by my gallbladder. Which wasn't painful until he pressed on it. He sent me to the Er thinking i could get checked out with ct scan and ultrasound.they also did blood tests. My liver enzymes and the MRI or cat scan showed a swollen liver and I had fatty liver. When I tried to get more info he redirected me to talk to my doctor. So question time, is the fact its swollen mean an advanced stage of liver disease? The pain under the ribs, has been there off and on, sometimes its real bad and other times no pain. Its been there for at least four years. I was checked for gallbladder issues and it was fine. So anything in that stand out? Also loosing function in kidneys and anemic. Trying low carb for treating the diabetes and insulin and metformin.",
