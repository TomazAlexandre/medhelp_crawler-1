            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since you have burning in the armpit groin it is possible due to heat intolerance (hyperthyroidism) and due to sweat dermatitis.It is also possible due to peripheral artery disease. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, chemical burns due to any deo or lotions you use, peripheral nerve compression (possible as you have tingling and numbness) are the other possibilities. Please get yourself investigated in these lines. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
