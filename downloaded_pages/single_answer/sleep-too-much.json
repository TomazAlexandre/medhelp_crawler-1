            "answer": "Sleeping too much can be a sign of a number of things, from plain old severe fatigue (have you been working a lot or keeping late hours?), to stress, to depression, to diabetes (high blood sugar levels can cause fatigue).\u00a0\u00a0Even a lingering infection or virus can cause severe fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Have you been sick lately?I would suggest going to your doctor and begin with a good, complete physical to rule out any physical causes.\u00a0\u00a0Once those are ruled out, you may want to consider the possibility of depression.\u00a0\u00a0You don't necessarily have to \"feel down\" to be depressed - one of the symptoms is changes in sleep - either sleeping too little or too much, as well as your comment about not wanting to go out of your room - the not wanting to participate in activities (could be because of the severe tiredness, but could also be a symptom of depression)But definitely get checked out by your doctor and make sure they run some blood work, etc., to make sure all your levels are ok - perhaps even request they check your thyroid.I hope you feel better soon!",
