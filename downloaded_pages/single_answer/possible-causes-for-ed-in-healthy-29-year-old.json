            "answer": "It's hard to say. ED is a multifactorial condition and only a doctor can determine the exact cause of your problem and prescribe you an effective treatment. Don't expect any miracles, though. Oral treatments are very effective but they're not a cure and you'll have to keep taking them on demand. Moreover, your problem may be purely psychological (stress, anxiety, depression can have a drastic impact on a man's sex life). I suggest you seek another doctor (urologist) for a second opinion, maybe you should do more tests. I also suggest you do some research on this subject: the more you know about these problems, the less stressful they will be.",

    "question": "I'm a 29 year old suffering from erectile dysfunction in the form of weak erections. I can consistently get erections but they are not very hard and I am at the point where I can't have sex with a condom on (kills what erection I can develop).\u00a0\u00a0The first time this happened was about six months ago, since then the problem has gradually gotten worse to the point that now my erections are always weak, including during masturbation and morning erections.Other than this, I am very healthy:\u00a0\u00a0I work out around 4 time a week, I'm trim, I'm a long-time vegetarian and already eat many of the foods considered good for sexual health (fruits, vegetables, grains, fish oils, vitamin c, etc). The only negative health factor I can think of is that I have been a moderate smoker for ten years, although I quit recently when the problem became impossible to ignore.I recently went to a doctor and he prescribed levitra. This worked fine but the problem returns as soon as I stop taking the drug.\u00a0\u00a0He also checked my hormones etc and said that all my labs are normal, meaning no thyroid or other hormone problems, no diabetes, very low cholesterol, etc.So my question is what else could be causing my ED?\u00a0\u00a0Could there be some type of carcinogenic substance in my surroundings, or is that just paranoid?\u00a0\u00a0I think this problem is physical, not psychological, but how can I be sure (do the weak morning erections prove that)?Will I need drugs to treat this forever, and will my condition continue to worsen? I am very worried and think I am now developing depression, which will accacerbate my problem.Thanks.Edit",
