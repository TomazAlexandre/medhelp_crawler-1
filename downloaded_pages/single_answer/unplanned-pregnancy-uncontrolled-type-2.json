    "question": "I just wanted to put this out there. I AM WORRIED! I was thinking I was done after 2 kids and now at almost 35 and with uncontrolled diabetes, I find myself pregnant with #3.\u00a0\u00a0I'm freaking out because I was not ready, did not plan for this and A1C has been 9.0 for 6 months, if not longer. So worried about birth defects, I'm scared. My first OB appt is in two days. From what I can figure, I'm about 10 weeks. Anyone else out there in the same boat?",
