If you are overweight or obese, ask your doctor to order a blood test to check your liver functions and an ultrasound to check if you have a fatty liver.If you have a fatty liver or liver disease, you may also experience the following symptoms:1.Poor digestion2.Abdominal bloating3.Nausea4.Weight gain5.Constipation6.Irritable bowel syndrome7.Depression8.Allergies9.Headaches10.High blood pressure11.Fluid retention12.Unstable blood sugar levels13.Gallbladder disease14.Chronic fatigueA new studyA new study involving about 11,000 patients has shown that people who have a fatty liver have more possibilities of developing diabetes type 2 than those with a non- fatty liver. Here is the study as appeared in the WebMD Health page.Fatty Liver May Be Linked to Diabetes RiskBy Jennifer WarnerFeb. 25, 2011A new study suggests that fatty liver disease, also known as fatty liver, may be an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Researchers found people with fatty liver disease were significantly more likely to develop the disease within five years than those with healthy livers.\u201cMany patients and practitioners view fat in the liver as just \u2018fat in the liver,\u2019 but we believe that a diagnosis of fatty liver should raise an alarm for impending type 2 diabetes,\u201d says researcher Sun Kim, MD, of Stanford University in Calif., in a news release. \u201cOur study shows that fatty liver, as diagnosed by ultrasound, strongly predicts the development of type 2 diabetes regardless of insulin concentration.\u201dResearchers say fatty liver often occurs along with other risk factors for diabetes, such as obesity and insulin resistance, which has made it difficult to determine whether the condition itself is a marker for diabetes risk.But in this study, researchers found that even among those with similar insulin concentrations, those with fatty liver were still twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes.Fatty liver is a common liver condition that occurs in about one-third of adults in the U.S. In some cases, the condition is mild and causes no noticeable symptoms, but in other cases it can lead to permanent liver damage or liver failure. Fatty liver is frequently associated with alcoholic liver disease, but it may also have non-alcoholic causes.Measuring Diabetes RiskIn the study, published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, researchers looked at the relationship between fatty liver and diabetes risk in 11,091 adults in Korea. The participants\u2019 insulin concentration levels and liver function was measured at the beginning of the study in 2003 and again five years later.At the start of the study, 27% had fatty liver, as diagnosed by ultrasound. Nearly two-thirds of those with fatty liver were also overweight or obese compared with 19% of those without fatty liver.In addition, almost half of those with fatty liver were in the upper quartile for fasting insulin concentration, a marker of insulin resistance, compared with 17% of those without fatty liver.During the follow-up period, less than 1% of those without fatty liver developed type 2 diabetes compared with 4% of those with fatty liver.After adjusting for insulin resistance at the start of the study, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes was still higher among those with fatty liver. For example, among those from both groups with the highest levels of insulin resistance at the start of the study, those with fatty liver were twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes.In addition, regardless of insulin resistance at the start of the study, those with fatty liver had more risk factors for diabetes, such as higher glucose levels and cholesterol abnormalities than the others.Researchers say the results suggest that as well as being associated with insulin resistance, fatty liver may independently increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.Final wordHaving a healthy liver is very important nowadays because of the toxic chemicals that have crept into our environment and food chain. The liver performs many functions, among them detoxification and when your liver is overloaded with fat, chemicals, or whatever, some functions will not take place. This means that vitamins and minerals can be destroyed and you know what happens when your body lacks vitamins and minerals: disease.I would like to recommend a book that I have had for years with me and that I love. It is \u201cThe Liver Cleansing Diet\u201d by Doctor Sandra Cabot. You will find excellent advice on how to start cleansing your liver as well as menus and recipes for the suggested menus.",
