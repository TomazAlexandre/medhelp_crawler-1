            "answer": "Hello,This is due to fecal incontinence of which the most common cause is damage to muscles around the anus (anal sphincters) or injury to the nerves that sense stool in the rectum or those that control the anal sphincter. This kind of damage can be caused by childbirth, constant straining during bowel movements (diarrhea or constipation), or some diseases like diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel disease, etc.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
