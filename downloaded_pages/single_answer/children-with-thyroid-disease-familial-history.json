            "answer": "Here are their numbers.Child A:TPO - 127T4 - 7.7Ultra TSH - 1.74TG - 0.1TGAB - 78.5Anti thyroglobulin AB - 71.7TSI - 9Child B:TPO - 112.6T4 -7.6Ultra TSH - 1.44TG - 0.2TGAB - 36.5Anti thyroglobulin Ab - 37.3TSI - 7Normal reference ranges stated for these numbers are:TPO (0.0 - 9.0)T4 (6.1 - 12.2)Ulra TSH (0.34 - 5.60)TG (0.0 - 35.0)TGAB (0.0 - 4.0)Anti thuroglobulin Ab (0.0 - 4.0)TSI ( - < 10)Both children in question are girls. They are set of 9yr old female identical twins from a set of triplets. They were born 2 months early with a stay in NICU of 8 weeks. Growth has been normal with no delays in physical or mental development. At 71/2 Child A had acne, since then has become severe. Child B began acne at 8. Both girls started breast development after acne and at 8 and 6 months followed shortly by pubic hair and body odor. Child A had first period 2 months ago. As I stated above there is a strong family history of thyroid disease. Both children also have had issues with hypoglycemia. Both girls are tall in stature for their age and are thin built. When I took them to see the doctor this week Child B was acting weak and sluggish and some what uninterested. The doctor said from what he observed both girls are precocious puberty. He questioned if there might be an issue with diabetes. And based on the thyroid findings diagnosed them with Hashimoto's. He thinks that the sluggish behaviour exhibited is a symptom of their thyroid disease and has prescribed a low dose of 50mcg of levo. He said they present with \"subclinical symptoms\" and that this levo will help with their energy levels. I haven't started either girl on the medication because I prefer to understand exactly why.\u00a0\u00a0From what I can see their T4 and TSH numbers are within range but their antibodies are high. From what I have studied Hashimoto's and precocious puberty do not go hand in hand. What I read was in fact in very rare severe hypothyroidism do you see then precocious puberty. As I can see by their numbers this is not the case. I am concerned that their sluggish behaviour is due to an underlying undiagnosed condition and I don't want to aggravate it if it does exist. Whatever it may be. My second concern is that by giving them additional T4 it may make them become hyper. Also the doctor said that they didn't have any antibodies for Grave's. However from my understanding TPO can be used for diagnosing both diseases. Can some one please help me with my concerns? I will be seeing the endo with two other children this coming week and will be bringing up these issues to him. I would like to know if my concern are worth validating and arguing about or if I shoud blindly follow along. As you can tell I don't take lightly putting my children on any medication. Thank you if you can help!",
