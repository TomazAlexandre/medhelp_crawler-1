    "question": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0My 21 year old daughter has been playing video games since she was 12.\u00a0\u00a02 months ago she was watching her friends playing a video game and began to pass out/get very tired when she watched them do this.\u00a0\u00a0She is fine when she is looking at the screen and playing herself.\u00a0\u00a0After going to a M.D., she had an EEG done which came out normal.\u00a0\u00a0Now, when she gets very angry, she sees a silver circle which at first the inside of the circle was black, and now she can see through it.\u00a0\u00a0I have another appointment for her with the M.D. but wondered if this could be a sign of HBP or Diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas on if she should see an eye doctor instead of an M.D.?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your help.",
