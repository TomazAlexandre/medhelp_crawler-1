            "answer": "I think it would not hurt for you to go in and see your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Your symptoms could mean anything, and not necessary related to your heart. I am not a doctor but some of what you are describing sounds like hyperthyroid.\u00a0\u00a0This can cause your heart to beat faster, jitters, shaking, hungry feeling, nervous etc. I would ask the doctor to test your TSH and also check for diabetes. If you make an appointment for your doctor ask to have it in the morning and the night before do not eat after 8pm so they can\u00a0\u00a0draw your blood for the test.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not fast the night before they will ask you to come back the next day so you should be prepared and let them know that you are fasting and then insist on the test, you are the one paying for the visit. Good luck.",

    "question": "Today, I felt weak like I was going to pass out. My heart rate was about 90 bpm, but I felt lightheaded and weak anyway. And after i eat lunch my heart seems to race (and not neccessarly a big meal), and I feel nervous. When i get up in the morning my heart rate ranges from the 90's-100's. I have had these issues for about 2 mos now. I'll also get tremors after i eat as well, and palpitations. Now these palpitations happen more often. It's kind of hard to explain exactly what they feel like...It's like this weird suddenly harder pounding of my heart, usually 2 beats, then it'll lessen and so on. It has started doing this throughout the day now. I don't know what it is. I've not talked to a doctor yet. But what are beta blockers exactly and what do they do to the heart?I did cross country this fall, and now i've been resting, so it can't be overtraining...",
