    "question": "My mother-law (with type 2 diabetes) will go a good part of the day not eating properly, thinking that when she is feeling tired she will be picked up by a piece of candy of something. She often complains that she is tired and little episodes feeling out of sorts (nauseau, tired, weight gain). We are very concerned for her and when she wants to care for my children and driving them on lengthy trips (to take them to see family).
