            "answer": "It sounds like you have at least one risk factor for coronary artery disease: a family history of early heart disease. Negative stress tests are very reassuring; however, these stress tests may be falsely negative. before attributing your symptoms to reflux, it would be important to discuss your chest pain with your cardiologist. It is also important to address any other risk factors your may have for coronary artery disease, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, tobacco smoking, and high cholesterol. Also it is important to maintain a healthy weight, eat a heart healthy diet, and get regular exercise.",

    "question": "I am a 44 year old male that is overweight. I have had acid reflux for many years, I got diagnosed last year with mild sleep apnea. I get these mild chest pains just about everyday, almost in the exact center of my chest. I also had two different stress test last year that showed everything is ok with my heart(one with radioactive injection). I concerned about what it could be, could this be a warning sign for a future heart attack? I had a brother who had a heart attack when he was 36 and he later died when he was 57. I have another brother who had a heart attack 2 years ago at age 56. Could the doctors be missing something with the stress tests or could this be acid reflux?",
