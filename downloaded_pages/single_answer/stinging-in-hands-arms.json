            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Can you elaborate on the stinging sensation- is there numbness, tingling or pin pricking sensation? What other symptoms are present? If there is no history of animal or insect bite, this could be due to nerve injury, pressure on the nerves of the spine or peripheral nerves, medical conditions such as diabetes, underactive thyroid,\u00a0\u00a0or electrolyte imbalance. If it persists, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Your medical history and diagnostics such as blood tests and complete neurological examination are important considerations. Take care and do keep us posted.",
