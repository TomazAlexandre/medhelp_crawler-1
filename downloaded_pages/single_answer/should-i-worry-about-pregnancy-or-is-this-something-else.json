            "answer": "A period can just be irregular for a multitude of reasons. As a period is not possible while pregnant, you would not have one. The 'pregnancy' symptoms you described are just typical things that happen during life. Fatigue, appetite fluctuations, headaches.... all part of being human. If you use your birth control properly, your odds of failure are slim. Ask your doctor to do a beta blood test to check your hCG levels.",

    "question": "I am on birth control (evra patch), me and my boyfriend have sex about 2-3 times a week, we use the pull out method. For the past few weeks Ive been noticing me going to the bathroom about 15-20 times a day. I went to the doctors 2 weeks ago and they said it was possibly a UTI so they gave me antibiotics. I dont think my boyfriend and I had sex while I was taking the medication if so only once. I didnt think the pills worked so I went back to the doctor and they tested my urine and said I didnt have any signs of infection or pregnancy. I got my period when I went to the doctor the first time and it lasted 3 days. It usually last 5-6 days. I did blood work to test for other problems and im just waiting for the results. At first I was thinking diabetes becasuse I had almost all the symptoms besides weight loss..thirsty, peeing alot, more tired, dry mouth, hungry all the time, headaches. Then I realised these symptoms are similar to pregnancy ones. Im a fairly healthy eater and exercise regularly and only 22 yrs old. So I doubt diabetes is the case at this point and now worried about pregnancy since ive been having sore breast and pains in my lower abdomen (similar to growing pains in legs). Could I still be pregnant if Im on birth control? and would I still get my period during my regualr period time or would I miss it all together?.. so confused! someone please help!",
