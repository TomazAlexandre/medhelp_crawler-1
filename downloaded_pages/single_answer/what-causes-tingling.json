            "answer": "Hello,Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but are often felt in your hands, feet, arms, or legs.Many causes of numbness in the arm are there. These include injury to the back or spinal cord, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause tingling.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing paraesthesias are rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Take care and do keep us posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am a chiropractic patient and treatments have not helped. I am on my second year of a \"tennis elbow\" injury and I have advanced arthritis in both knees. My problem happpens when I raise this arm and keep it elevated on the computer mouse for even a short time, I get tingling in the fingers and it crawls\u00a0\u00a0up to the elbow. It also happens when I am in bed and lay on that side or put the arm under my head. Then it feels like there are little worms crawling under the skin of my forearm. It is extremely annoying, but I would like to know if other than pain meds, resting the joint,\u00a0\u00a0and icing what else I can do to this elbow to stop this crawling feeling up and down the forearm.Thanks you for you input.",
