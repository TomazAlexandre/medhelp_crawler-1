            "answer": "Hello,Garlic odor of urine can be due to concentrated urine, high protein in diet, asparagus, diabetes, urinary tract infection, cystitis, kidney stones and also on using vitamin B supplements.Just check your diet whether it is deficient in fluids and excess of proteins, asparagus or vitamin B supplements are there and if there is any burning is involved, then UTI needs to be ruled out. It will be best to consult a physician then.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
