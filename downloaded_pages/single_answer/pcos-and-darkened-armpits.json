    "question": "I suffer from PCOS, type II diabetes and RA. My diabetes is currently being managed with Byetta and metformin while RA is being managed with MTX and Prednisone. I was diagnosed with PCOS in high school. Since then, among other things, I have been battling with darkened skin in my underarms, neck, elbows and knees (primarily). Is there a surgical procedure which could alleviate this problem or are creams and lotions my only option?",
