            "answer": "Hello,Most children who get recurrent boils are colonised with Staphylococcus aureus. These bacteria are very good at sticking to skin, and can be carried in the nose or on the skin for a long time.So I feel that you should consult a dermatologist and get blood tests and swab tests of the nose, groin and hairline to see if he is carrying any bacteria, in particular Staphylococcus aureus.Other wise if the tests come out negative ,then causes like diabetes,eczema,anemia and iron deficiency and immune deficiency have to be probed.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how your son is doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",
