    "question": "Hi everyone... Ok about two years ago my mom was diagnosed with HCV and \"late stage\" cirrhosis. She was told many different things by many different doctors...things like she cant go on interferon (sp?) because of the cirrhosis, and she cant be treated (transplant) for the cirrhosis because of the HCV...well finally she was referred to the Mayo in AZ\u00a0\u00a0(where she was living) and things started looking better for her treatment wise...BUT as a result of poor choices made way back when... she was arrested, brought back here to WI and made to serve two yrs in prison. Well, they werent treating her liver there in prison but she obviously wasnt able to drink and had routine medical monitoring because of her diabetes...so she was physically FEELING better. Well, a week before she is released they take her out to the specialist for one last checkup and to talk about follow up, she is told that its not the HCV but the cirrhosis that is now really REALLY bad, she is basically told that unless she gets a new liver, she will die.\u00a0\u00a0Well, the transplant isnt going to happen, the woman has no insurance and cant even get IN to a doctor...right now she goes to a free clinic.Anyhow...this was about a month ago. From prison she moved in with us and things have been \"ok\"...but for the last few days she has had some EXTREME rightside pain, never really going away but just \"there\", she has been extremely lethargic, fatigued, sort of feverish (low grade) and shes had the chills...oh and white stools...the stools started last week, the rest of the symptoms started about two - three days ago. Finally today I MADE her go to the ER where she is now. They are waiting for the \"liver guy\" as she told me last time I called her...shes not filling up with fluid like shes done in the past, but I am REALLY worried about her.Can anyone shed some light on what might be going on? Are these just things we are to expect? I havent seen much of her since being diagnosed (remember she was incarcerated) and she tends to minimize things so I dont KNOW what to expect...I am SCARED for my mom, she is so young (she just turned 47 last Sept)...I dont know what to do and sitting her waiting is not helping, plus Im afraid that since she doesnt have insurance that she wont get the treatment she needs.Anyones input would be greatly appreciated, and Im sorry this is so long.Ashley(I posted this elsewhere too, sorry...wanted lots of feedback)\u00a0\u00a0:/",
