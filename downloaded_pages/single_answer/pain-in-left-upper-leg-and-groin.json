            "answer": "Hi John,I do not know if this is related to your diabetes(such as neuropathy or possible decrease in blood flow when you cross your legs), or more likely related to a possible back problem. It may be muscular and related to a medication you are taking. I suggest speaking with your doctor soon, having a good neurological exam and possibly dopplers to determine blood flow in your legs, and possibly imaging of your back. Your doctor should be able to narrow it down after examining you in the office.Take care.",
