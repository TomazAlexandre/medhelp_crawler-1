    "question": "For the last 1 1/2 years I have had a lot of numbness and tingling in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0It started when I had to be on my feet for a long time (9 hours a day).\u00a0\u00a0Now that I am not on my feet as long, the problem still exists.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking Synthroid and have had blood tests that show that I do not have diabetes or a vitamin B-12 deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Can you give me any idea what it could be?\u00a0\u00a0It is very annoying.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it hurts to have anything more than a sheet on my toes overnight.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, PatDear Pat:As you may or may not know, the causes of this sort of problem areextremely varied and some are neurologic whereas others are not. Certainlydiabetes can be one of the causes. There is no substitute (unfortunately) fora detailed neurologic hisotry and examination which I would advise you obtain.This can be done by seeking the opinion of a qualified neurologist who willbe able to provide you with more specific answers once he/she has performedthe needed studies.If you have more specific answers please write back!Good Luck!",
