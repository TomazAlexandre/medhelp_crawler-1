            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Penilel ulcers may be due to infective or non-infective causes. Infective causes are sexually transmitted and include syphilis, chancroid, genital herpes, LGV and granuloma inguinale.Traumatic penile ulcers may be caused by vigorous acts of masturbation or sex. Behcet's disease (if you have mouth ulcers too), Stevens-Johnson syndrome and diabetes (since the ulcer is not healing) should be explored.You should consult an urologist and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have a small red area, about 5mm round, on the lower middle shaft.\u00a0\u00a0I first noticed it immediately after having fairly vigorous sex, and thought it was a raw spot.\u00a0\u00a0However, the spot has shrunk somewhat but is still there 6 weeks later.\u00a0\u00a0It looks like raw, pink skin, and has a couple of shiny parts to it, almost like how skin looks after a burn.I'm worried that any trauma should have healed by now, and that this is an STD or something more sinister.\u00a0\u00a0Can you give me any advice or experiences with this sort of thing?",
