            "answer": "Hi there,Thanks for your question. Well as a matter of fact both these operations are not major ones and can be done within a matter of 2-3 hours. However, consideration also has to be given for anesthesia related complications. If you have any pre-existing hypertension or diabetes or any respiratory illness the morbidity associated with long duration of anesthesia also goes up.I advise you consult your urologist in this regard and suggest that you would like to complete both these procedures at one go.If you have any further queries do get in touch with me.Regards,Dr Sylvester, MD",
