            "answer": "If you have hashimoto's and your tsh is a 3.29, then you will have hypo symptoms. My endo said that anyone with hashi's, should have their tsh supressed to a .50-1.0, in order for your body to heal and for hypo symptoms to diminish. Sounds like you need to find an endo who specializes in thyroid and not diabetes with a little training in thyroid. :)Yes I agree that you should have a TSH, Free T4 and Free T3 tests done in order to get a complete view of what is going on.I feel for you....I stayed with my old endo for 2 yrs in which he undertreated me. I love my new doctors....they are on the ball with the lab ranges. I have an endo who encourages his patients to learn and he takes the time to sit and educated you as well. He even showed me my actual ultrasound films of my thyroid and explained everything to me.",
