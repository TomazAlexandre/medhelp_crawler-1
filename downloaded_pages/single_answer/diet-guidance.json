            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.It sounds like your dad is taking many of the necessary steps to maintain his health. As you know it is important for him to limit his carbohydrate intake. This can be difficult, but not impossible, when traveling. It is hard to give someone a \"must follow\" diet when you don't know them or their taste preferences. If the diet does not include foods that they enjoy, they are less likely to stick with it. My best recommendation would be to speak to his doctor or a nutritionist to come up with a meal plan that will factor in both his preferences and his medical needs. The doctor can give calorie and other parameters that you dad should follow. If this is not possible, then the American Diabetes Associtation has meal plans available free of charge on their site which may be of assistance.Cathy",
