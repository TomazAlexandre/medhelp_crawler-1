            "answer": "Hi there.I'm sorry to learn that your husband is undergoing all of these.\u00a0\u00a0From what you have described, the primary culprit from all these neuro-sensory symptoms may be the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Long standing diabetes may lead to this symmetrical glove- and stocking- like distribution of neuropathy which can be treated with good sugar control and medications like vitamin B complex or gabepentin (these should be discussed with your doctors first).\u00a0\u00a0From the medications you have listed, I believe that none of them can directly relate to these neuropathic symptoms, but I agree with you that their interplay might have some bearing.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you discuss these with his doctors when you get to meet, and I hope that everything will turn out OK.Regards to you and your husband.. God bless.",

    "question": "My husband, 77, has heart problems, diabetis, kidney (26%) PTS, and high blood pressure.He sees a kidney specialist, a heart doctor, veterans health care, and a private physician. He has medication from all and his medical information is supposed to be shared by all doctors, according to our health Insurance plan. He also has medicare A&B.; He has been operated on for prostrate cancer about ten years ago. He does not heal well and watches his diet. He is on a low potassium diet as well as a low protein diet. He has never used additional salt. For the past two years he has had periodic bouts with tingling hands and feet, swelling feet, burning feet, to the point that he is unable to stand. These bouts last from one to two weeks. He has at least 3-4 bouts a year. He thought it might be gout but none of his doctors think so. He has been given a diretic to relieve the water and swelling from his ankles but it doesn't seem to help his balance or his feet. I read recently that medications could be a factor in neuropathy. I aml wondering if I should get a referral to see a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0The medications he is on are: Isosorbide Dinitrate 10 mg 1 tab 3x day, Glyburide 2.5 mg 1 tab before breakfast, Lisinopril 40 mg. 1/2 tab daily, Lipitor 80 mg. 1x daily, Sertraline HCL 100 mg. 2x day, Metroprolol Tartrate 50 mg tab 2x daily, Furosemide 40 mg tab 1x daily, nitrate tabs as needed.His diabetis is treated by diet.\u00a0\u00a0He is currently suffering with burning feet, tingling hands that he cannot grip with, swollen knee and very sore shoulder. He is in severe pain. We will try to get him in to the doctors in the next couple of days. He is extremely stubborn. I would just like to know if it is possible a medication could be causing his pain so I may approach his GP about it when I go.\u00a0\u00a0Please help.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/296804\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/296804</a>.",
