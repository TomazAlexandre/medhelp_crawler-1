            "answer": "Flutecrazy, this is terrible that you have gone through all this.Please forget about investigating autoimmune conditions for now.You're tired of your doctors addressing symptoms, yet some of your underlying imbalances and deficiencies are greatly responsible for most of your issues, even if they have progressed to some suspected autoimmune disease.A few critical questions.Have you ever been tested for CELLULAR thyroid function? (not standard serum tests)Have you ruled out vitamin D resistance or vitamin D receptor issues?Were you tested for iron, B12, D and other deficiencies at first?How about your adrenals? have you ever been tested for adrenal fatigue?Cortisol levels, DHEA, etc?Have you been tested for leaky gut syndrome, Candida, hypochloridia,pathogenic mycoplamsa & co-infections including lyme's ?Conventional doctors are not necessarily the best health professionals to address most of the above.Functional Medicine Doctors, Naturopathic Doctors and Holistic Doctors are probably your best bet, except mycoplasma Lyme's and co-infections which are best dealt with by an LLMD.Let me know about these and I can offer you some suggestions.Best wishes.Niko",
