            "answer": "I often randomly have ketones even though my sugar levels are fine. I follow an extremely low carb/high protein diet & also don't eat that often; perhaps once daily. I know most doctors would have something to say about this but despite ketones for the 1st time since being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in May 2000 my suagrs are usually around 7 or 8 & my hba1c has dropped from 16.8% to 7.2%. Do you follow the usual \"prescribed\" diabetic diet or something different, or perhaps recently there has been a change in your eating habbits? You did not mention anywhere what your average blood sugar readings are at the moment. Do you feel unwell or tired in anyway or is it just the presence of ketones that's bothering you? I was told a few years ago after being particularly unwell that i fall within a rare group of diabetics that can have ketoacidosis in spite of near perfect sugar levels. I don't know if the GP that told me that had much of a clue on the subject but I've often thought in the past that this must be true. Are the ketone levels high? I think if you had a high level of ketones for a sustained period then you would go into ketoacidosis & this is extremely dangerous.I would love to know other opinions on my thought as this has been the philosophy i'm following recently & i don't want to make myself unwell in any way or be offering unhealthy/dangerous advice to others. I hope this is at least a little relevant to your initial query x",
