            "answer": "Hi!Apart from disc problems in the back and anxiety and panic attacks, muscle spasms can be due to several causes. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, muscle fatigue due to overuse, adrenal gland problems, pinched nerve due to wrong posture could be the cause in your case. Try and use the correct posture while sitting and walking and consult a physical therapist regarding some stretch exercises which you can perform to help relieve tension.If this does not help, then I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes, Lyme's, lupus or hypothyroidism can also be the cause. It can be benign fasciculation syndrome if all causes are ruled out.If legs are predominantly affected and that too while lying down then clots in deep veins, atherosclerosis and restless leg syndrome should be ruled out. Please consult your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I am 57 years old. I have type 2 diabetes. I take metfromine for it.About a year ago I started experiencing involuntary total body muscle contractions when\u00a0\u00a0I wake up. Before this I was having trouble with getting Charlie Horse cramps in my legs in the middle of the night.When I wake up my legs hurt very badly. They are hard to move. It is almost like my muscles are still asleep. I have to move them slowly to straighten them out. If I move too suddenly my body will go into a full muscle contractions. I tighten up into a ball (Fetal position). It lasts about 3-5 seconds. Once it is over I can move freely. but until I lay and move real slowly to stretch out or go through the muscle contraction It is hard to move.Once I am up; and moving I am ok.This is very frustrating.",
