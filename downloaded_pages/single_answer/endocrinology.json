            "answer": "Hi Tom,What a wonderful question! Ofcourse I am happy to answer it: there isn't actually a \"typical\" endocrinologist because they often end up in different fields of work. The training period can also focus on different aspects depending where you train i.e more or less research-based, specific areas within endocrine etc. Academic endocrinologists tend to stay at large academic centers associated with universities and have mixed clinical and research practices there. private practice endocrinologists see the gamut of diseases within the field including diabetes and thyroid(the majority) and less common diseases including pituitary, adrenal, reproductive etc. Their days can vary quite a bit depending on what they see in clinic. Some endocrinologists take jobs in industry and are involved with drug development and testing, so their jobs are also quite different.One of the great things about endocrinology is that the field can overlap with others so you have colleagues in other parts of medicine all working on the same disease process, for example endocrinologists and ENT surgeons often follow the same thyroid patients, neurosurgeons follow our pituitary patients etc.Hope this helps a bit. Best of luck to you It is a\u00a0\u00a0wonderful field and I have never regretted my decision to pursue it.take care.",

    "question": "Dr. Ramsetty,This is kind of off topic for this forum, but I was wondering if you could tell me what a normal day of an endocrinologist is like. I am an undergraduate senior currently applying to med school, and I am really interested in the specialty. I took a biochemistry course with a focus on metabolism and found it fascinating; I really appreciate the complexity of the topic.However, I don't really know what a typical endocrinologist does. Maybe you could fill me in a little bit?-Tom",
