            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!I understand you are losing muscle mass. This could be causing your problem if it is also affecting the involuntary muscles of the body too. The other reasons could be stress, functionally small bladder, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, urinary bladder wall instability, UTI, stones and neurological problems. Consult an urologist.Limit fluids in the evening. Set up an alarm your self and try and wake up 3-4 hours after sleep and use the washroom. This helps a number of times to break the sleep pattern and you will with time automatically start getting up.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am wondering if there is anyone out\u00a0\u00a0there that may have an answer to my crisis?.I am 59 yrs old female....I really have been\u00a0\u00a0wetting the bed at night noticeably more in the past year..I have to wear a bladder pad every night and I dont\u00a0\u00a0seem to be able to wake up in time! drat!I was on the statin\u00a0\u00a0Crestor in 2005 and at that time lost 42 or more pounds and developed severe\u00a0\u00a0mass muscle damage and a skeletal look., nausea, and fatigue. I have not been well\u00a0\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a04 or so years and I cant seem to be able to get over 105 lbs..I am 5'4' slight build, but was ever so skeletal and still\u00a0\u00a0not looking all that good..I\u00a0\u00a0partook in that New York study on rhabdomyolysis in |June 2009\u00a0\u00a0and never heard a word from the study nor did I ever get my out of pocket money back from the study as agreed..I feel that the study was\u00a0\u00a0a scam and that I feel used as it certainly didnt benefit me..Since the severe mass muscle loss and the skeletal appeareance I have had bed wetting problems.. I was in touch with the author of Statins, the Silent killer\" and he not seem to be of much help in directing me to a Canadian specialist although I feel that he does know.. I am extremely disappointed in that study and\u00a0\u00a0feel betrayed by the end result which was no response at all!I am having bedwetting problems and also fighting\u00a0\u00a0to keep my weight at least \" permissable to go\u00a0\u00a0into public\"..At several points I was embarassed to go out as was so skeletal thats it was\u00a0\u00a0ridiculous..I have a malabsorption and maldigestion probem .. I take Omega 3 and other health products..I\u00a0\u00a0noticed that my constant bedwetting ( near every night) got worse lately as I have been constipated as\u00a0\u00a0my dietitician had me try a new diet out to see if the carbohydrates would absorb..I have been having a hard time with stomach pain due to constipation.I also 5 months ago was an Id theft victim of\u00a0\u00a0thousands of\u00a0\u00a0dollars ..I have been extremely stressed and usually high anxiety to\u00a0\u00a0begin with.. I havent been sexually active at all\u00a0\u00a0for 4 yearsAny suggestions greatly appreciated..Canada",
