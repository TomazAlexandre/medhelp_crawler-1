            "answer": "That must be very frustrating.I'm going to guess that though you posted in the Type 1 forum, your dad has type 2 diabetes? Does he take his medication? Are his blood sugars in control?It sounds like something emotional rather than physical is going on with him. Perhaps your doctor can refer to a therapist who works with older people. (That is, if he is willing to go). Perhaps he is feeling hopeless or unsatisfied in his life and might need suggestions for new activities, more involvement with family and friends, etc.",

    "question": "Hi,I want suggestion on my fathers health...He is 70 and has been suffering from diabetes since 5 years...he has lost a lot of weight..Recently we admitted him to hospital as he was not able to eat and was throwing food out..he was hydrated and checked for any neck and stomach infection...He was duly treated for the same....One of the doctors suggested to take Alzeimer test ( since he doubted he might be forgetful of his appetite)...We also did those tests and the doctor said there was nothing to worry on that part as well...He was discharged and came home....He still finds difficulty in eating sometimes...What worries us most is he doesn't respond to questions as whats happening to him..why he is not able to eat...he has become unresponsive and doesn't talk...Does anybody has any suggestion what needs to be done as all the test show nothing seriously wrong with him ?",
