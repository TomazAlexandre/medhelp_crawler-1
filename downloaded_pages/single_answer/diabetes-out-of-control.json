            "answer": "I can only comment on your HgbA1c score not the others since you didn't provide the low to high ranges. This is your hemoglobin A1c test which measures glucose on new red blood cells for the past three months. Red cells last an average of 3 months before they die off. Excess glucose sticks to the outer parts of the cell and never get absorbed to get burnt off (used). The A1c measures this and is a good source of information to the doctor to determine whether you have diabetes or not.What is HPLC? I don't know of this acronym so I can only assume its the lab performing the test.Normal ranges for the A1c is 6% as the high water mark. Anything over that is considered diabetes. Your 9.8% is out of control glucose. You should be discussing with your doctor about medication, either oral and/or in combination with injectable insulin. Diet and moderate exercise will assist greatly with controlling diabetes.Good luck.",
