    "question": "So before i got pregnant i was on a diet and lost 46kg and got down to 84kg from 126kg i got pregnant stopped my diet and am only 25wks and am 103kg!!!!\u00a0\u00a0My docs are worried of the quick weight gain which could be due to thyroid problems (which my gp didn't tell me my levels were high! Or organise any action!!) Can now be a danger to my baby and my health!! Now im again at high risk for diabetes!!!!! Had anyone else gained alot of weight while pregnant? Its just i never put on much with my previous pregnancies but was at pre pregnancy weight of over 105kg with both. Im just so worried as ive had gestational diabetes with my first baby and i dont want it again! And i definitely don't want a large baby.",
