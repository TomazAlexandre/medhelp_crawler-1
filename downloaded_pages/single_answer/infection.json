            "answer": "Hello Dear,The risk of infection after joint replacement is\u00a0\u00a0much greater than with most other operations, unless special precautions are takenThe risk of infection in the weeks after the operation is increased if you have rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, if you have been taking cortisone for prolonged periods of time, if the affected joint has had previous infection, or if you have infection anywhere else in your body (teeth, bladder, etc.) at the time of surgery.Thus the prolonged use of corticosteroids seema to be the root cause of recurrent infection.You should discuss regarding this with your surgeon.Refer http://www.hipsandknees.com/hip/hipsurgerycomplications.htmBest",

    "question": "I had a total hip replacement 4 weeks ago today.\u00a0\u00a0My pain disappeared instantly and I was walking very well next day.\u00a0\u00a0However, on the night of my operation (6.30pm) I had excruciating itching which I was told was due to the anaesthetic and after 2 days of Piriton, the itching wnet.\u00a0\u00a0However, I had 2 dressing changes on the wound in hospital\u00a0\u00a0and on both occasions the dressing was green and yellow.\u00a0\u00a0No comment was mde by the medical staff of the \"dirty\" dressing ableit I voiced my concern about MRSA.\u00a0\u00a0I was rold the wound was O.K but that I had extreme bruising due to the steroids I have taken over 40 years for Asthma.\u00a0\u00a0I was still feeling well and in high spirits on discharge 3 days later.\u00a0\u00a0At the GP's the stitches were removed after 2 weeks and the dressing was still dirty (yellow & green) but the wound was not showing any signs of inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0The Nurse asked me to keep an \"eye\" on the woundfor inflammation. However, one week later I started to have the leg pain back and the groiin was quite tender.\u00a0\u00a0My GP gave me a week's supply of pencillin based abtibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0This stopped the pain in my leg after 1 day and the groin was back to \"good\".\u00a0\u00a0Now 2 weeks later, I am feeling extremely ill.\u00a0\u00a0I have the pain back in my leg and the groin is very tender.\u00a0\u00a0I feel quite weak when I stand up, headaches and extreme itching. I generally feel quite unwell.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think I could have a serious infection, do I need blood tests to determine this. I do not see my Consultant for another 4 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
