            "answer": "Hi there. It is important to make note that white matter lesions on a brain mri does not necessarily mean Multiple sclerosis. White matter lesions can be seen in various conditions. These represent micro vascular ischemic changes in the brain hence these white matter abnormalities on mri are common in patients who have microvascular and macro vascular risk factors like history of hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol. White matter signal changes on MRI are seen in infectious and other inflammatory conditions and migraine headaches. These white matter signal changes on brain mri need to be correlated to the history, clinical examination and other ancillary investigations. Hope this helps. Take care.",
