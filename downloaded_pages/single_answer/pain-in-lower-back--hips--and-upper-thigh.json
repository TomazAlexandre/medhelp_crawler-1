            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Yes, sciatica is a possibility. A MRI will be required for confirmation. History of taking injections in the buttocks in the recent past should be looked into. A number of times old injection sites start troubling if undue pressure is put on them as in prolonged sitting.Another possibility is ischiogluteal bursitis. This is inflammation of the bursa that lies between the ischial tuberosity and the tendon of hamstring muscle. The bursa may show inflammation without any cause or in association with hamstring tendinitis or inflammation of tendon of hamstring. The pain increases on stretching.Myofascial pain or trigger points in the Gluteus medius muscle and Piriformis muscles can cause pain in the buttock area which may radiate to thighs. Stretching the muscle increases the pain.Talk to your PCP and try and get referral for an orthopedic specialist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "my husband has had pain that originated in his right hip area that has moved to his lower back (sacrum area) and is now in his left hip area. the area on his back where the pain occures is slightly swollen out and is tender to the touch, also his hip and thigh on the left side are also tender. we have been to 2 different hospital emergency rooms because the pain has gotten more severe. the pain causes him to limp when he walks and he winces even when he sits down. the first hospital was quick to blame his diabetes (he has type 2, sugar under control), and a compressed disk in his spine. the doctor never told us which one, nor did he show the xray to us. that was frustrating, i asked them if he had come in with a broken arm, would his diabetes also have caused that, with no response from the doctor. the second hospital did nothing, said that it was chronic pain (he has had the pain for about 5 months, with the last week severe pain) and that he needed to see a private doctor. they did no blood work, no x-rays, no ct, no mri, no nothing. i was shocked. i realize that common people are not medical doctors for a reason, but it is very frustrating to go to a doctor for help and get the response that they know everything and you know nothing, even about your own symptoms. it's the god complex, please give it a break. anyway, can someone please help. we were thinking about a problem with the sciatic nerve, how damaging could it be if it's not looked at and treated?",
