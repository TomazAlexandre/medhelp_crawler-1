            "answer": "Is the level of albumin increasing over time? There are levels that are perfectly acceptable. If you're concerned, you need to discuss this with your GP.According to NDTV.com -\"The normal urinary excretion of albumin is less than 30 mg/day. An increase in urinary albumin excretion is indicative of increased permeability of the filters of kidney called glomerulus. Transient proteinuria may be associated with physical exertion and fever.The commonest causes of [chronic] proteinuria include diabetes, hypertension, any chronic inflammatory disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) or rheumatoid arthritis, infections (such as hepatitis B and C, malaria etc) and nephritis. Additionally, use of certain over the counter drugs such as pain killers, herbal remedies can result in such condition as well. Assuming that there are no other abnormalities in your urine test (i.e., red cell, white cells etc), diabetes or family history of kidney disease, I recommend that screening for hepatitis be performed, cholesterol checked, discontinue any painkillers or herbs and your blood pressure be strictly controlled to <130/80 with a medicine called ACE Inhibitor (rather than atenolol), lose weight to achieve BMI of 25 or less (your current BMI is 29), do renal sonogram and periodically monitor the albuminuria. If the albuminuria is noted to get worse, consult your nephrologist to assess if a kidney biopsy is needed.Read more at: http://doctor.ndtv.com/faq/ndtv/fid/5857/What_are_the_reasons_for_the_presence_of_albumin_in_urine.html?cp",
