            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to obtain a history from you and examine you, I can not comment on a formal diagnosis or treatment plan for your symptoms. I am sorry to hear that you are in so much pain and unable to find an answer for the pain. However, I will try to provide you with some information regarding this matter.Pain can present itself as different feelings depending on the location and cause. One type of pain called neuropathic pain has had descriptions that include burning, gnawing, aching, and shooting or lancinating qualities. This type of pain is caused by injury to a nerve. There are 2 types of nerves in our body, large and small. The small nerve endings supply the skin and sweat glands. There are two types of sensory neuropathy: small fiber and large fiber (depending on the size of the nerves affected). With small fiber neuropathies, symptoms including burning or buzzing or other vague symptoms starting in the feet and hands then in some cases spreading to other parts of the body. The EMG/nerve conduction studies (NCS) (tests done to check for neuropathy) will not show an abnormality, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a skin biopsy so that the number of nerve endings can literally be counted. There are other tests of the function of small nerves that can be ordered, such as QSART testing which looks at how much sweat the skin makes, since sweating is in a sense of function of these small nerves. There are several causes of small fiber neuropathy, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, autoimmune problems.The other type of sensory neuropathy is called a large fiber neuropathy which has multiple causes and can present itself with sensory changes as well as weakness and change in tendon reflexes. Some types of sensory neuropathies occur and progress very slowly, others sort of wax and wane (with flare-ups) and some are progressive. One of the most common causes of neuropathy is diabetes, and sometimes only glucose intolerances, or abnormal rises in blood sugar after a glucose load can be the only indication (this is called a oral glucose tolerance test. Other causes include but are not limited to hereditary/genetic causes (such as in a disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth, in which there is a family history of sensory neuropathy usually from an early age associated with other clinical features such as high-arched feet), autoimmune problems (such as lupus (SLE), Sjogren's, Churg-Strauss (in which asthma also occurs), polyarteritis nodosa, which affects blood vessels), and demyelinating diseases (such as CIDP). Vitamin B12 and B6 deficiency, as well as excess vitamin B6, can also cause neuropathy. Some toxins, such as lead, arsenic, and thalium can cause large fiber sensory neuropathy. Other causes include abnormalities of protein metabolism, as in a type called amyloidosis or monoclonal proteinemia. In many neuropathies, both the sensory and motor nerves (the nerves that supply the muscles) are involved, leading to sensory symptoms as well as weakness.\u00a0\u00a0This type of neuropathy can be diagnosed by EMG/NCS. In rare cases, a lumbar puncture and perhaps nerve biopsy may be necessary for diagnosis.Treatment for neuropathic pain, as described, includes neurontin and lyrica, and medications such as elavil but a careful cardiac workup needs to be performed prior to starting this medication.I am not sure what your MRI shows and what sequences were performed. I would recommend that you follow up with a neurologist in your area. He/she may wish to perform an EMG/NCS and do neuropathy workup.Regarding the syncopal event, there are different types of syncope. Some that occur from cardiac (either arrthymia or structural defect), neurally mediated (coughing, sneezing, vasovagal, etc), or some that occurs because of orthostasis either from being dehydrated or from autonomic neuropathy. The workup for syncope can be started by a local neurologist. The workup may include either tilt table and Qsart, echocardiogram, EKG/holter monitor, EEG, neuroimaging or orthostatic vitals depending on his/her evaluation/examination.\u00a0\u00a0If you are not safe at home (from the frequent falls), you should be evaluated at your local hospital and may need rehabilitation.Thank you for using the forum, I hope you find this information useful, good luck.",
