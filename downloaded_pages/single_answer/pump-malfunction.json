            "answer": "I don't know what kind of pump he had, but our son's Animus Ping has a safeguard where it will only allow a certain amount of insulin in a two hour time frame.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you try to bolus for more, it will pop up on the screen saying that there's no delivery because you've exceeded the limit (and to bypass this you have to go in and manually change the parameters of the amount allowed).Kind of odd that he didn't notice during that 24 hr period that he was having a lot of lower blood glucose readings prior to this if his pump was giving him excess?\u00a0\u00a0Also, our pump displays on the face of it how many units are remaining, so if it dropped quickly we'd know that there was a problem.\u00a0\u00a0We did have one incident where our son's glucose kept dropping quickly (despite giving him cake gel), but it was because his basal rate was adjusted wrong and he was still in the \"honeymoon phase\" of the diabetes where his endocrinologists were still trying to figure out the proper settings.\u00a0\u00a0We were monitoring him every 15 minutes, and ended up just having to \"suspend\" his pump and pull it off for a few hours to let his body flush out all the insulin... but it wasn't because of any pump malfunction.Only thing I can suggest is that he call the service center of his pump's manufacturer and see if they have any advice (or maybe ask for a replacement pump if his is still under warranty).Also, does he have an emergency Glucagon kit?\u00a0\u00a0He really should, and maybe even teach you how to use it if something like this ever happens again.Glad you were there to help him in his time of need!",

    "question": "I found a friend unconscious last week.\u00a0\u00a0His blood sugar dropped so low so fast he was not able to do anything about it.\u00a0\u00a0The paramedics got his blood sugar up to a normal range but within 20 minutes it was under 20 again.\u00a0\u00a0Upon checking his pump, it appears he received about 163 units of insulin in a 24 hour period (25 units is normal for him).\u00a0\u00a0No one can explain what happened.\u00a0\u00a0This resulted with a week in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone heard of any malfunctions with the pump or has this happed to you?",
