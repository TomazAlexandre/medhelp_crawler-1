    "question": "In August I had elevated ALT, AST and Alk Phos(499). I had a neg sonogram,neg MAP and neg liver biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0My GI Dr. said he wasn't sure what to make of it.\u00a0\u00a0I was in the hospital 4 days and taking SS Humalog rather than Metformin & Amaryl. I had labs drawn on discharge day and my enzymes were starting to decrease.\u00a0\u00a0Although I could find no info on oral diabetes meds causing the problem, I convinced my DR. to start me on 15U Lantus.\u00a0\u00a0My enzymes contined to slowly decrease(ALT & AST almost normal, Alk Phos 220).\u00a0\u00a0I was DX with Scleroderma in Oct and placed on Imuran 100mg daily. I decided to resume my oral meds since I REALLY hate the injections and I wasn't convinced the oral meds caused the increase.\u00a0\u00a0After 5 weeks on the Imuran, I asked to have labs again and now my ALT & AST are in the 80 range(the best ever), but my Alk Phos is 536!! I do not have pain, but whnever I eat or drink almost anything, I become distended and sometimes vomit.\u00a0\u00a0I do have a hiatal hernia, GERD and \"watermelon stomach\".\u00a0\u00a0I am becoming pretty discouraged with all these medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Could the Imuran cause the elevation?\u00a0\u00a0i sure hope not because it seems to be helping my Scleroderma. Thanks so much.",
