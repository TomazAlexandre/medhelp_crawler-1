    "question": "I recently develop very serious generalized itching mostly on my back arms, legs and back, which cool down when I take Benadryl, also when I scratched hard the area becomes instantly raised in weird snake-like fashion and turns a little red. I also started seeing this strain of Buttons under my chin, ant. and post. neck and lower back. At first I thought it was just acne, but they never turn yellow, just flesh colored or a little red. At first I thought maybe diabetes, then some sort of cancer, maybe HPV related but now I am freaking out cause these symptoms are sometimes related to HIV. I had unprotected sex about 6 months ago, my genitals itch often and I see some warts that come and then disappear. I have an appointment schedule for pap smear in 2 weeks, but I am just so worried I just need some kind of information to look into. Thanks so much",
