    "question": "Last year my 5 year old male (unneutered) cocker spaniel - poodle mix was diagnosed with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Young, but caught it early, the vet said.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past year, he's gone from 3-16 units of insulin (2x daily) and gained about 7 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0He's now at what the vet considers to be the maximum amount of insulin & my pup's fructose levels are also indicating that he's not being regulated.\u00a0\u00a0His injections are given exactly 12 hours apart, he is on a special diet & receives very little snacks.\u00a0\u00a0He loves going on walks and playing fetch but does get tired out quicker than he used to - although I did expect it a bit since he's getting older.Anyways, the vet just suggested that we test him for Cushing's disease.\u00a0\u00a0Could this disease have been present when we first took him in with the symptoms of diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I'm just curious as to why this possibility is just showing up now...",
