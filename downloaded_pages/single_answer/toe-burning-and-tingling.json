            "answer": "Hi.Toe tingling is a non-specific symptom and may be related to a lot of diseases. As a solitary finding, it would be unlikely be hereditary.\u00a0\u00a0However, a sedentary lifestyle could possibly present with that symptom secondary to decreased activity of the lower extremities.Do you have a history of diabetes or other endocrinological disorders. Some disorders can present with this symptom.You could initially try to do some stretching exercises on your lower extremities to get the blood flowing, especially during long periods of sitting. However, if symptoms worsen, you should try and consult a physician to check your condition.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I have been semi retired for about one and half years now. I am 59. About 8 months ago I started getting tingling and burning sensations in my toes. It comes and goes.I am not a very physical person. I basically watch TV and I am also on the internet alot. Sometimes my toes feel a little numb. And then it goes away. I remember my mother saying when she was in her seventies that her toes would burn every once in awhile also. I don't know if this could be something hereditary or maybe I need some exercise.",
