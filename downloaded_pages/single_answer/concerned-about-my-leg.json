            "answer": "Hi!Paresthesias or abnormal sensations due to peripheral neuropathies secondary to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme's or lupus should also be ruled out.The symptoms in your case could also be due to spinal nerve compression in the lumbo-sacral region. This can occur due to spondylosis, narrowing of root canal, bulging disc, reduced disc space, tumors etc. A MRI of the region can help you diagnose this.\u00a0\u00a0What I would like to add is that the nerve compression may be superficial too (lateral femoral cutaneous nerve), that comes from the hip area and gets pinched. This condition is called meralgia paresthetica and is often due to weight gain or wearing tight clothes and belts. Losing some weight or wearing loose clothes and belts often helps relieve the pain/numbness/tingling. Also injection of lignocaine (anesthetic agent) at the site helps. In your case you can apply a pain reliever at the site and see if it helps.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral to a neurologist. Take care!",
