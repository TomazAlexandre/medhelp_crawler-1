    "question": "I don't know if this is the right place to ask, but yeah. I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown. My quality of life is pretty bleak. After being hospitalized a year ago (cape coral fl) for what had to be the 20th outbreak of acute pancreatitis it finally broke. The doctor told me I have type 2 diabetes and chronic pancreatitis. Which is a crap combination since I overly avoid eating anymore in fear of the potential consequence. Idk what to do, where to go, how to gain some semblance of normalcy back, and it's destroying me. Any insights would be appreciated and welcomed..",
