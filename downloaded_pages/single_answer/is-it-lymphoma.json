            "answer": "Hi,How are you? I'm sorry to hear of your symptoms for the last few years.\u00a0\u00a0Aside from the thyroid test and ultrasound, what other diagnostic tests were done? Your symptoms may be part of a certain condition or\u00a0\u00a0independent\u00a0\u00a0from each other. You are right in saying that additional tests are needed to determine the underlying cause. Your medical history, occupation, and family history would also be very helpful.\u00a0\u00a0You may need to discuss each symptom with your attending physician- the back pain may be caused by musculoskeletal issues while problem in healing with your foot may pertain to underlying conditions such as diabetes. Imaging studies and complete blood count and blood chemistry may help. Talk to your doctor about this, write everything that you need to clarify and discuss this with him.\u00a0\u00a0A referral to specialists may be done if results of the tests are not conclusive. Take care and best regards.",

    "question": "I have been feeling miserable since 2007, mostly back pain that wakes me up.\u00a0\u00a0Then last year unexplained bruising on my left arm only.\u00a0\u00a0The other day a huge lump appeared on my arm. The ultrasound showed it was a portal lymph node. My Dr. ordered blood test for thyroid which was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I also have problem healingp after my foot surgery in 2011.\u00a0\u00a0Now my whole left side hurts. Feels like bone pain when a fever is present. I don't think my Dr. is ordering the right tests. How can I tell him which tests I think he should order without offending him?",
