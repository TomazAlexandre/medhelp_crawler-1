            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!This looks like an episode of transient ischemic attack wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. Otherwise it could be due to nerve compression very high up in the cervical vertebra.Another possibility is Vitamin B12 deficiency. Underactive thyroid and diabetes too should be ruled out. Sometimes migraine too presents with unrelated symptoms. Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon and seizures too should be looked into. MS is another possibility.Abnormal levels of sodium, potassium or calcium too can behave this way.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please consult your neurologist, with these possibilities. You may need to undergo MRI of the brain or cervical spine and some blood tests. If all the tests are normal then it could be a case of severe anxiety and panic attack. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi my name is Adrianna. I was wondering if any doctor can help me. On June 19, 2008 I was taken into the ER after an attack that no other doctor can explain to me. It started when I looked down I my hands and I saw three hands instead. Afterwards, I went dizzy as if the room around me turned into a sphere. My left arm and leg felt as if it had pins and needles going through it and had involuntary movements. I could not control my arm and leg at all, it was just moving all over the place. I was able to control it after a week after the incident. But my left side of my body has been numb since that day and I've had constant headaches and occasional dizziness since then. Earlier on that day I had gone to get a check up and stumbled from bending down after instructed by the doctor, I had told him I couldn't. My doctor and neurologist say that I have severe anxiety and panic attacks. So I was prescribed 10mg of anti-depressants. I took one and then my body felt like it was on fire, had dry mouth, I was babbling, dizzy, and couldn't move for about 2-3 hours. I didn't take them anymore. Could it be because of a car accident I had in 1997. Please someone help me confirm I have anxiety and panic attacks or please tell me whats wrong with me. I want my arm and leg back to normal. Thank you.",
