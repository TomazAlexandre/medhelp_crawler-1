    "question": "Hi, for the past month or so I've been having symptoms that seem consistent with diabetes - constant excessive hunger, constant thirst, and frequent excessive urination. I've also been having a myriad of seemingly associated neurological symptoms such as headaches, blurred vision, flashes of light in eyes, anxiety, fatigue, dizziness, lack of coordination, and the like.I'm a 21 year old male who is highly physically active and keeps to a clean and, to the best of my knowledge, healthy diet. I walk about 6 miles, run about 2, and lift weights for about 1-2 hours every day, I eat around 4000 calories a day and drink easily over a gallon of water.Now about four months ago I started having panic attacks regularly, which led me to develop bad health anxieties and thus perpetuate my panic attacks. But also during this time I noticed my blood sugar would seem to get quite low often and I would have to eat constantly to not feel like I was about to slip into a coma. I am unsure if it was just my health anxieties causing these fears about my blood sugar or if my blood sugar was actually low and that was causing my anxiety and panic attacks.Earlier this week I went to the doctor to ask about the migraines I've been getting after my workouts and had lab work done (unfortunately in the moment I neglected to bring up all these other health worries I've been having and just talked about the migraines). They took a blood and a urine sample and the results all came back perfect - except for my blood sugar, which was 47 mg/dl. However the doctor didn't seem all too concerned about my blood sugar being so low and just said \"thats how some people are programmed\" and that I need to eat more but smaller meals throughout the day to control it.So long story short, could I possibly have diabetes if I'm frequently hungry, thirsty, and peeing but my blood sugar tends to be very low?",
