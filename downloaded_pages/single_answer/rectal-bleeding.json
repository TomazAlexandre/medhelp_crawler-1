            "answer": "I agree with the colonoscopy.\u00a0\u00a0If negative, colon cancer or polyps are less likely possibilities for your rectal bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0Hemorrhoids can certainly be considered, and can be visualized by an anoscopy.If the bleeding continues in light of the negative testing, a bleeding scan can be considered to evaluate for AV malformations.A referral to a surgeon or GI physician can be considered to discuss the aforementioned options.I cannot comment on the clicking feeling without examination.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "Hi,I have small fiber neuropathy which affects my feet, legs, hands, arms, and digestive system. The pain is terrible unless I take my medication.\u00a0\u00a0I get my best relief from Lyrica and Methadone.\u00a0\u00a0Both of these drugs cause constipation and digestive problems.\u00a0\u00a0Because of my lack of ability to excercise, my digestive system has slowed from what it use to be.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 50 year old male who also has diabetes which is under control.Over the past few months I have had evidence of blood during my bowel movements.\u00a0\u00a0I contacted the doctor and he ordered a colonoscopy (November 2005) which was normal.\u00a0\u00a0He stated at the time that I had internal hemroids.\u00a0\u00a0With blood still occuring this fall, the doctor ordered a stool study.\u00a0\u00a0I sent the samples via mail and learned a week later that no blood was present.I decided to make an appointment to see my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He felt that I could wait until November 2008 to have another colonoscopy, or he would order one for this November.\u00a0\u00a0I decided to go ahead with the colonoscopy right away.\u00a0\u00a0I always have to push hard, or so it seems to relieve myself.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like the blood sometimes just drips into the toilet after pushing.\u00a0\u00a0I also notice a \"clicking feeling\" when I use my tailbone muscle when sitting...it is hard to decribe.\u00a0\u00a0I take Miralax and another drug to soften my stools on a daily basis.My question is: What do you think could be going on based on the above information?\u00a0\u00a0This has been going on for over a year.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much for this service.Jeff",
