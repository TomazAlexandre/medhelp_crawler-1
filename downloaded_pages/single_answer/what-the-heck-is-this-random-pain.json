            "answer": "Hi!It could be due to carpal tunnel syndrome. It could also be due to rheumatoid arthritis. If you are a diabetic or have a family history of diabetes, this should be checked as diabetes can cause stiff joints of hand.You could also be suffering from gout, which also results in joint pains and swelling. This is due to high uric acid in the body that gets accumulated in the joints. Chondrocalcinosis is a similar disease, caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate. Diagnosis is by finding the elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. However most confirmatory is study of fluid aspirated from joint to detect urate crystals (though rarely taken up). Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
