            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. Nocturia is having to get up during the night to go to the toilet. This is more likely to occur as people get older. Our body has a natural biological rhythm to follow in which a human being passes more urine in the day time when compared to nights.The change in this pattern can occur due to having a different 'body clock' which causes a normal daytime urination pattern to occur at night, use of diuretic, uncontrolled diabetes, recurrent cystitis, swollen legs due to heart failure, taking caffeine or alcohol at bed time, drinking excess fluid at bed time, insomnia etc.I think it would be better to get a check a blood sugars, check for UTI, and work up for heart failure. This would give the clear picture what is causing nocturia and if required\u00a0\u00a0diuretic can be taken in the day time to avoid inconvinience.If this is due to excess intake of water at bed time, treatment for menopausal symptoms can be considered.Consult your physician for further assistance.All the best.",
