            "answer": "I think it has to do with how high the spikes go and how long they stay that high. And if u are only on it 8 weeks, eat as healthy as u can, and your baby will be happy and maybe not a lot of extra weight will go on. And u are on a small dose, so I wouldn't stress over it. But I would like to tell u that since u have had GD twice, u are at a higher risk of Diabetes later on in life. So after the baby is born, look at life in a controlled manner, eat healthy and stay away for junk food and sweets and processed foods. I promise u if u do this u can supress the chance that its turns into type two at a young age. I got type 2 at 16, and 2 out of 4 pregnancy were hard because of the diabetes. The last I was on 4 shots a day. But for the rest of your life I would keep testing your BS and if u get sick test. Just take care of yourself, and remember diabetes is controlable, don't let it come back and control u, Bless u and your baby, and I hope u have a easy birth..Debbie",

    "question": "I am 30 weeks Pg with GD for the second time. I have only occasional (3-4 times a week) spikes in my blood sugar. My ob prescribed 2.5 mg of glyburide once a day. I read that is can cause alot of weight gain. I should only have to take it for a max of 8 weeks as I will prob. deliver early. How likely is it that I will gain alot of weight? (like more than 5 lbs) in that amount of time? Also is it really necessary for such few spikes to add meds???",
