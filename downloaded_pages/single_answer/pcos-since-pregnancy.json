            "answer": "HI,Excessive hair can be because of PCOS and you need to check your hormone levels. Excessive production of androgens can cause this problem. Virilising tumours of the ovaries and adrenal issues need to be ruled out. Depending on the diagnosis medications can be taken to reduce growth of hair. Diarrhoea can be because of irritable bowels or mal-absorption etc. Dietary modification will help. Also a stool examination may be done to rule out infection. Consult a physician and an endocrinologist for an evaluation.Hope this helps.Take care and good luck.",

    "question": "Hi.I was diagnosed with PCOS in my early teens ( I am now nearly 30). My periods were always fairly regular although I would often bleed for a few days, stop for a day or so, then continue.\u00a0\u00a0I had facial hair from this time too, mainly on my upper lip. I had electrolysis at the time. I have never been overweight and have pretty much been a size 8 (uk sizes) since I was a teen.My husband and I thought we would struggle to get pregnant, but I was pregnant within a few weeks. I got gestational diabetes during my pregnancy,\u00a0\u00a0which is gone now and had very low iron levels. But gave birth naturally to a 9lb2 baby boy who is now 18 months old.I have a few questions:1. Since pregnancy I am now very very hairy. I have almost a full beard on my chin, hairs leading down from my belly button and around my nipples. I have to tweeze at least daily, I am very pale and have thick black hairs. :( advise needed as it is making me very depressed. Hair removal creams do not work as the hair is so thick.2. Whilst pregnant, I was on iron tablets which instead of making me constipated gave me diarhoea. Not in a tummy bug sort of way, just in a everytime I used the loo it was diarrhoea.\u00a0\u00a0After a difficult labour I had to stay on iron tablets for some time after the birth of my son but came off them about 3 months later. Trouble is I still suffer from diarrhoea,\u00a0\u00a0pretty much daily. I should be grateful as I eat like a pig and I am still a size 8, but it isnt pleasant. Is this linked to my PCOS??Thanks.",
