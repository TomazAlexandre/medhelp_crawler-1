    "question": "Hi, I am a 48 yr.old female living with SLE. fibromyalgia. celiatic sprue, and arthritis. All of course resulting in depression and sleep disturbances. In addition to the sunburn rash I have on a daily basis to my chest, I have just recently been diagnosed with a skin disease known as granuloma annulare, cause unknown, but\u00a0\u00a0possibly related to a diabetic rash.\u00a0\u00a0I also have had a reoccurring out break of extreme itches from head to toe. I'm also experiencing nausea, along with\u00a0\u00a0tingling and burning sensations to my toes and fingers.\u00a0\u00a0My concern is if this can be diabetes or a kidney related condition or just symptoms resulting from my preexisting conditions? Thank you :)",
