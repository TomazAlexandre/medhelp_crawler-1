    "question": "I am a 39 year old female, I wear disposable contacts. My optometrist diagnosed me with corneal swelling after I noticed my vision was blurry. He prescribed prednisone drops and no contacts for a week. On day 7 I thought my vision had improved(though not 100%) so I put my contacts back in and discontinued the drops.\u00a0\u00a0I revisited him today and my corneas are still swollen and my vision per him is virtually the same.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing he told me to do is to not wear contacts for a month, and don't restart\u00a0\u00a0the pred drops.\u00a0\u00a0He blames the contacts for no apparent reason that I was able to discern.\u00a0\u00a0My concerns are: 1) I had Optic neuritis @ 12 years ago-subsequently diagnosed with hypothyroid disease\u00a0\u00a0so I'm uncomfortable letting my eye health and potentially general health hang in limbo for a month.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to my Family MD- Diabetes has been ruled out....Any suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you",
