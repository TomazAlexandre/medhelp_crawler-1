            "answer": "Hello,These lumps can be small cysts, swollen lymph nodes or lipomas which are benign fatty tumors of the skin. Exactly what it is can be confirmed only after examination and FNAC( fine needle aspiration cytology). I would suggest you to get it done from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
