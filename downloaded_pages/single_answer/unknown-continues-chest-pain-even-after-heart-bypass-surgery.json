            "answer": "Diabetes can cause pain from many affected vessels in the body, including the heart. It is known as neuropathy. Diabetes causes the vessels in the body to be more brittle even when the diabetes is under control especially over time. Many vessels are affected.I'm suggesting a conversation with his doctor about the micro vessels of the heart being affected and causing him pain. These things can be controlled with pain med and better meds to open up his heart vessels. Suture area of surgery can also be harder to heal.Best of wishes and tell him to take care and stop when he has pain.",
