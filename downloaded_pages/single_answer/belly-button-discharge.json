            "answer": "Hi!Smelly discharge from umbilicus or navel or belly button could be due to fistula, boil, infection. Umbilical fistulas are narrow tubes connecting the outer skin with anything inside like intestine, mesentry etc. Boils in the umbilicus can also burst and release blood and pus.\u00a0\u00a0In rare cases it could be Meckel\u2019s diverticulum.\u00a0\u00a0Do consult your doctor. A swab test of the sticky discharge should be done and culture and sensitivity tested to start appropriate treatment. Diabetes should be tested for as this may cause infection to linger. At times colored X-rays are taken after injecting dye to know if there is a fistula. Treatment will depend on the diagnosis. Take care!",
