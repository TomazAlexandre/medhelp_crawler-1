    "question": "I am 31 year old woman who is two months pregnant(first baby =0) and been diagnosed with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have done research and come to find out my glucose test was in the range of pre-diabetes. I check my blood level four times a day and twice have had a level higher than 130.(about three week testing) I visited with the obgyn and she prescribed glyburide for me to take two times a day. I am not sure if this is a smart thing for me to be taking. I am also unsure cause I dont feel that they have discussed things with me like they should.\u00a0\u00a0They just told me I have diabetes, never said I have pre-diabetes. I guess my question is is it right for her to prescribe me the medication while pregnant especially if I dont have the diabetes? What is a normal range of blood sugar I should have? They tells me 70-90\u00a0\u00a0fasting, one said no higher than 110 two hours after meals, and another said 120's after meals.\u00a0\u00a0I am confused and they are scarring me telling me this is wrong and that every time I leave and they wonder why my blood pressure is a lil high!",
