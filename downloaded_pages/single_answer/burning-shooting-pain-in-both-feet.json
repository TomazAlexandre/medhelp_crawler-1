            "answer": "Sounds to me like you have PN from your back problem years ago, I would have that investigated more. There are also many other causes being found in medical news, Look up neuropathy and you will see a list which might explain your pains. I have the same problems in feet and ankles and much more now but it is due to diabetes and am on a pain drug now as well. Seems to be taking the edge off some of the pains but leaves me feeling funny too. I am only on day five and the side affects are supposed to wear off or my body is supposed to get used to it. Funny that a neurologist would talk to you that way. They work in that area and should have more compassion when dealing with pain. Mine told me there was not much permanent damage yet but he could see some results from the DPN. I will probably have to do another one soon. I hope you are getting results by now. Let us know.",

    "question": "I\u2019ve had severe burning and stabbing pain in my toes and soles of both feet since January, 2007 and desperately need help.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 58 year old woman of average health/weight.\u00a0\u00a0I am non-diabetic but I have had rheumatoid arthritis since 1996 - am taking Celebrex (400mg) - and have had herniated discs years ago.\u00a0\u00a0My GP did some bloodwork which came back normal and I started taking Neurotin (300mg) and then took Lyrica and neither helped me.\u00a0\u00a0I then started going to a podiatrist who put me on B-12 and folic acid for my feet and he referred me to a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0I then saw my first neurologist who did an EMG and nerve conduction test which were negative \u2013 he first had me take Cymbalta and when it didn\u2019t work then Elavil which hasn\u2019t worked and gives me side effects of a \u201changover\u201d and headache and he also recommended I soak and put lotion on my feet which I had been doing all along.\u00a0\u00a0He told me that I had peripheral neuropathy but it was only mild and that I would be better off when my feet went numb \u2013 basically just to live with it and \u201cit would be better when it gets worse.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0I saw a second neurologist and he told me the same thing as the first and to stay on the Elavil for a couple more months.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m waiting for my bloodwork to come back from him and he also said I didn\u2019t need another EMG.The severe pain/burning is only in my feet and ankles right now but I can\u2019t get any help from the doctors I\u2019ve seen so I feel it\u2019s just going to get worse.\u00a0\u00a0I can\u2019t hardly walk now and get very little sleep so I desperately need help with this.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it.",
