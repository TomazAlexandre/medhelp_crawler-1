            "answer": "Hello,On reading your post carefully,I have a few possibilities in my mind.These are cholinergic urticaria(The exact cause is not known, but some of affected people have an allergy to their own sweat), restless leg syndrome(Itching sensation or burning sensation in the legs esp at bedtime and in sleep), obstructive biliary disease, chronic renal failure, neurodermatitis, diabetes, peripheral nerve damage or emotional stress.I sincerely advise you to consult a physician/dermatologist for these possibilities.A comprehensive profile along with investigations including skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.Hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",

    "question": "Dear Sir or Madam:A few days ago, I developed a terrible itching sensation on my inner thigh. There is no evidence of a rash outside of the itching sensation; there is no redness or bumps of any kind. I have not had sex in a year. So I suspect it\u2019s not a STD.Also, on another issue, when I am stressed, a specific area under my right foot begins to itch something terrible. Its only when I am stressed. The area where the itching occurs contains a large blood vessel. I am wondering if the itch is associated with it. What are your thoughts?Any thoughts you might have would be greatly appeciated.Thanks,George",
