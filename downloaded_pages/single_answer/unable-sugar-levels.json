            "answer": "maybe Her Dr. need to be spoken to by u, no the nursing home. because most of them could care less. I woked in them for yrs. And if she isn't eating well for all her meals that can be a problem also. And the food in nursing home can be very high in carbs also. I bet its the ups and downs of her blood sugars. U might better ask the Dr at the upper left of this page in blue ti says ASK A DOCTOR just click on diabetes-type 2, I hope u find the help your Mom needs. I worked in many nursing homes and I loved all the people life they were my family, but most don't treat them this way.",
