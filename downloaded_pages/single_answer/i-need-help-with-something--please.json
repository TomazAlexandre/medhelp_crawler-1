            "answer": "Hi,Your boyfriend's weight and dietary habits do put him at higher risk of developing diabetes. Some of his symptoms can be seen in people with diabetes but they are not specific, and it sounds like he is not showing some other signs like fatigue, frequent urination or increased thirst.The only way to know definitely is to have his blood tested, or to\u00a0\u00a0start checking his blood sugars with a meter you can buy at the drug store.
