            "answer": "Hi!I can appreciate your concerns regarding your mother. If the lump is removed, then a biopsy would be very diagnostic. It will tell you whether the lump was benign or cancerous. Another possibility is to test scrapings from the lump. Ask your doctor regarding this.In all probability the lump was an infected cyst. Hence, it is important to check for diabetes as persisting high blood sugar delay healing. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
