            "answer": "Hi...\u00a0\u00a0your message suggests that you have a family history of diabetes, and that you have some weight and other health issues (a recent fall?).\u00a0\u00a0I am sad that you were not given any advice about how to improve your health.\u00a0\u00a0I am NOT a doctor, but I really, really, encourage you to seek out expert advice about your health.\u00a0\u00a0I can tell you, from my own experience, that any physical movement you are able to regularly safely do will help (for example, lifting and lowering your arms several times, walking again if you can, really any physical movement that is safe for you to do)..\u00a0\u00a0otherwise, I think the most neglected aspect of medical care for helping diabetics is nutrition...\u00a0\u00a0see a dietician or nutritionist if you can, and I will tell you that for me, adding a LOT of fiber to my diet really, really, really, helped to lower my blood sugar *without* changing my diet *too* much... and there are SO many fiber products available now that it is pretty easy to increase your fiber intake; it slows down digestion of sugars and carbs, makes you feel full so you do not eat too much, and it helps make you \"regular\" ...I wish you well and hope you feel better soon.",
