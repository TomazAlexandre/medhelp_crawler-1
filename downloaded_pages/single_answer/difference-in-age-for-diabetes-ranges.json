    "question": "My daughter had a spell when she was 3 and had high blood sugar. The doctors never found anything but recently she has been feeling tired all the time and crabby. She is 9 now and will be 10 in September. Is there a difference in what a normal blood sugar reading should be according to age? I have been checking it lately and am afraid that I dont know what I am looking for anymore.",
