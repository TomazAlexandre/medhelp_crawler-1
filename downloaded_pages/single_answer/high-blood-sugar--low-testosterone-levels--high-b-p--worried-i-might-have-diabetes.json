    "question": "I am an RN who discovered yesterday that my blood sugar was 310.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting this am was 189.\u00a0\u00a0I take sular for b/p, methadone for a pain killer addiction I had, xanax for my nerves, zetia and tricor for lipid control. I have gained a tremendous amount of weight in the last 2 yrs. approx. 75lbs. In those years I quit body building where I used steroids(used for a total of about 1 & 1/2 yrs), lost my job, my marriage w/kids, everything and have been completely stressed out lately. My testes are of normal size but my testosterone levels are low and the md also put me on androgel. I weaned off the steroids, used luetenizing hormones and HCG to make sure my testes wouldn't quit on me.\u00a0\u00a0I am completely scared, I will see my doctor ASAP but I live out in the country and we are not the \"MECA\" of medical science out here and could use some advice.\u00a0\u00a0I have never been diagnosed with diabetes before.\u00a0\u00a0I feel I need an endocrine work-up.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any advice for me, it would be greatly appreciated.Thanks and God Bless",
