            "answer": "Hi,How are you?The difficulty in talking and pain in the chest could be due to lung nodules. This needs further evaluation.Since you have tingling numbness I would also suggest you to get a blood sugar test done to rule out diabetes.Diabetes can cause peripheral neuropathy which results in tingling numbness.Since your reports are clear, it is possible that your symptoms are due to excessive fatigue and sleep deprivation.Please discuss this possibility with your treating doctor. Keep us posted!",
