            "answer": "Hi Tootiesue,Welcome. I am sorry to hear about your troubling and painful symptoms.Have you had your vitamin, electrolytes, including mineral blood levels checked? If not I would request a complete panel done. Sometimes low levels of Vit D and B12 and potassium can cause the type of cramping.you describe.I assume you have been evaluated for diabetes. if not please consider looking into that possibility. If those conditions have been ruled out what specialist have you seen? In my opinion the key to a diagnosis is to keep searching with multiple medical specialties involved in the diagnostic procedure. A new set of eyes can often add more ideas..What muscle relaxants have you tried? I went through several until I found one that worked. Please let us know how you are doing. I apologize for my tardiness in responding to your post. I hope you will keep in touch.Take Care,Tuck",
