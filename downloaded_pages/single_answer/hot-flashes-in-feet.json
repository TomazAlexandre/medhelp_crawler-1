            "answer": "Hi!A heat sensation or sudden feeling of warmth can be a sign of blood clot or deep vein thrombosis. It can also be due to pinched nerve if it not due to diabetic neuropathy. If you are on birth control pills, then this could be due to the side effect of pills as they can also cause deep vein thrombosis. For diagnosis first a duplex ultrasound or color dopplar would need to be done. If this is negative then a nerve conduction study has to be done. If there is a chance then if everything else is negative, then lupus may need to be tested for. Other possibility is contact dermatitis or an insect bite.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Over the past few days I have been experiencing \"hot flashes\" in my left foot. It occurs in the arch of my foot, probably 15-30 times a day. It does not hurt, and only lasts a few seconds. I did a little bit of research online and mostly what I saw said it could be diabetic nerve damage.I know this is not the case because 2 months ago I went to my doctor for thyroid blood work and he also ran other tests to check for anemia, diabetes, etc. The diabetes test was negative.Is there some other cause for this, and should it be of concern?Thanks in advance!",
