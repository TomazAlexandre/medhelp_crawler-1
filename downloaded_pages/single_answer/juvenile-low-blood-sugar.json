            "answer": "We can't really give you prognoses on here; that's for the endocrinologist. I could wager a guess... Typically diabetes manifests itself through high sugars, rather than low, but I suppose it's possible. It's more likely to be hypoglycemia, where the body produces too much insulin, rather than none or not enough. usually that's treated by dietary monitoring.Again, she needs to see the endocrinologist before any treatment is done. 44 is pretty low... Typically to treat low sugar you want to feed carbohydrates - simple carbs to bring the sugar up quickly, or complex carbs to build a stronger base level.A brief explanation - Complex carbs are what we commonly call \u201cstarches\u201d and are found in grains, pastas, starchy vegetables, and beans.Simple carbs are also called \u201csugars.\u201d These include sucrose (table sugar), fructose (found in fruits), and lactose (found in milk).(from www. onetouchgold. com / diabetesbasics / diabetesdiet)I'd watch her for anything unexpected. My low sugar reactions when I was young came in various forms, none of which will help much to say - think of it this way: Carbs convert to energy for your limbs and organs. When the body doesn't have enough carbs to consume, it starts stealing energy from the limbs to keep the organs running ok. Keep feeding carbs for energy.Mostly - get her to a doctor for a diagnosis!Good luck!",
