            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. If there is a small painful ball then probably it is a callus or a corn. This occurs due to wrong pressure. Faulty foot wear\u2014footwear not suiting your feet, wrong posture and prolonged standing cause this. This is called a \u201ccorn\u2019 in general terms. Several adhesive caps are available which you can apply over them and which will remove these corns. Sometimes these cannot be removed easily and need surgical intervention. Diabetes too result in repetitive corns.The painful lump or swelling can also be ganglions which are swellings in the tendon of a muscle. They arise due to repetitive use of joint or due to rheumatoid arthritis or sometimes without a cause too.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your ortho specialist regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
