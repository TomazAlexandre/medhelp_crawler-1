            "answer": "Hi!Arm pain can be due to injury, irritation, or inflammation of muscles, ligaments, tendons, bones and joints. So it could be shoulder pain or elbow pain referred to arm region or it can be muscle injury. It can also be due to pinched cervical spinal nerves, diabetes or hypothyroidism. It can also be due to Scalene Myofascial Pain Syndrome, clots in deep veins, inflammation of veins or lymphatics. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
