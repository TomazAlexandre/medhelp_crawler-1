            "answer": "Hello,It is true that wound healing is delayed in diabetics but if it is under control and appropriate precautions are taken, then it won\u2019t cause much of a problem. Treatment options include removing with scissors, freezing (using liquid nitrogen), and burning (using medical electric cautery at the physician's office). You should consult a dermatologist to find out which treatment is the best one for your husband.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "My Husband is diabetic and currently taking glucophage for his diabetes which is being well controlled by myself at the moment. However, recently I notice that one of his skin tags under his arms was somewhat red and he said it was sore. 2-3 days later now it has turned solid black like something literally wrapped around it and cut off blood.\u00a0\u00a0It has one small piece that is holding on and it wont fall off as of yet.Because he is Diabetic should we worry? He has others that i am considering having him remove just as a precaution as he has more then 1 or 2. Thanks so much",
