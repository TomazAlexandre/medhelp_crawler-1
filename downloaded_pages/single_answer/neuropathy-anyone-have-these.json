    "question": "Trying to cut a long story short... I'm looking to see if anyone can relate or guide me towards a possible cause for the following sensations:- Feeling like my foot is randomly dipped in hot water/ sometimes feels higher like I've had an accident but nothing is there/ sometimes it feels like cold water trickling down my skin, can last on and off for days to weeks- Random areas of burning skin but nothing is visibly unusual looking at the area, skin is so painful and prickling I cannot let anything touch it including showers and clothes, lasts at least a couple days- Large muscle twitches and tiny twitches, like even my eardrum twitches and cramps including in neck, hands, under sternum, etc.- Flashes of light in side vision- Random sharp jabs of pain that either last a full 10 seconds or will pulse in place for seconds before stopping mostly likely to happen again later in the day, can happen in palm of hand, middle of arm, eye, tongue, leg, behind ear is worst I think- Lose balance /get a little dizzy- Left hand intention tremors in fingers that are greatly exaggerated by heatI have had multiple brain MRI's all clear and was scheduled for my first spinal and neck MRI but don't have the money yet for the high deductible that it will cost so I had to cancel.I had one neurologist explain MS to me and the medications to treat the symptoms but in the same sentence he told me to \"close the book on these normal symptoms.\" Needless to say I'm apprehensive about looking crazy to yet another doctor or looking at yet another crazy doctor :) but I just know something somewhere is abnormal. I'm an otherwise healthy 28 year old female. This has been happening for a few years now with newly introduced sensations as the years go on. Any pointers would be appreciated, thanks in advance.I'm also posting in neurology and spinal conditions communities for other possibilities.",
