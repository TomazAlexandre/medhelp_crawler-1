            "answer": "Hi!Well, yes, a compressed (pinched) or damaged nerve can cause muscle loss, numbness, fasciculations and loss of function of a part or limb. However there are many other causes of muscle loss.Liver diseases, hyperthyroidism and weight loss, diabetes, ALS (but this has upper motor neuron signs), Charcot Marie Tooth syndrome, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, myotonia congenita, muscular dystrophy, and myotonic dystrophy could be the cause of muscle wasting.If your doctor has ruled out these causes, then yes, going for surgery that lifts the compression on the nerves can improve muscle wasting and loss. Post surgery you will need rigorous rehabilitation and physiotherapy to build up muscle mass. Please discuss all this with your treating doctor. Take care!",

    "question": "Two yrs. ago my mri showed disc narrowing throughout lumbar spine. L2-3 has posterior disc bulge with bilateral facet arthropathy. The L3-4 shows same. L4-5 shows same and severe canal stenosis and left foraminal narrowing. Narrowing atL5-S1 level.My question is...can this cause muscle loss in my hips, ankles, knees, calves, and the tops of my feet? The muscle loss is pretty much equal on both sides.Because I have fasculations in both legs and equal muscle loss, and the emg and blood work, my neurologist has diagnosed\u00a0\u00a0als.The spine surgeon believes if I had surgery most of my muscle loss would get better.I would appreciate any comments. I know you can't tell me anything definite without seeing me or talking to the neurologist but I would like your thoughts please. I don't want to have the high cost of surgery if I am going to end up in a wheel chair. Thank you, Linda",
