            "answer": "Hello Luna_azul,What a great idea to produce a magazine for teens.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us were diagnosed as teens and still more were diagnosed as younger kids but experience adolescence & teen-hood with diabetes.I don't know about a specific plan for a magazine (but that doesn't mean there isn't one out there!), but I did find this reference on the Juvenile Diabetes Research FOundation (JDRF) website to online teen chat.\u00a0\u00a0Have a look at this article from June, to see if it's the sort of interaction you'd be interested in:http://www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=103709For an in-person experience I *highly* recommend that you contact your local chapter/branch of JDRF (you can find it either in your local phone book or from the JDRF website: www.jdrf.org -- click on Locations in the top menu bar, it's right in the middle...)\u00a0\u00a0Teens often volunteer at local offices either with office work or helping younger kids or just hangin' out with each other and getting moral support from younger & older teens who really understand what teens're going thru.Armed with your GREAT idea of publishing a teen diabetes magazine, you can likely find folks to work with and perhaps together you find sponsors to help defray the costs.\u00a0\u00a0I look forward to hearing more about your project!!",
