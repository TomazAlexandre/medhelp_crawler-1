    "question": "I am trying to search out answers to what could possibly going on with my mother.\u00a0\u00a0She has tardive dyskinesia, which is being controlled by tetrabenazine, currently has rapid foot movement at night, while laying down and my biggest concern is that she is FALLING DOWN all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Out of the blue she will just fall either frontwards or backwards.\u00a0\u00a0This happens like twice a day, being on a flat surface.She has severe lower back pain and has in the past had 3 of the lower vertebrea's fused together and set in a cage.\u00a0\u00a0She has type II diabetes, hyatel hernia, high cholesterol and high blood pressure which is monitored by medication.\u00a0\u00a0All of her brain MRI's show nothing of concern (small mini strokes).Any ideas of what could be going on to cause her to fall just like that?\u00a0\u00a0Could this be related to her spine?\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions on what the next step could be to find answers?Thank you so much.",
