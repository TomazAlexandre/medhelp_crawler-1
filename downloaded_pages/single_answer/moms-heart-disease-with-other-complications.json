    "question": "Mom is 62yrs old, weighs 360 lbs., has CHF, diabetes, COPD (still smokes), borderline failing kidneys, and carotid artery blockage (90% on one side, over 40% on the other and is restricted to a wheel chair or bed due to weight and a broken leg a year ago. She takes 160 mg lasix a day (they said that is the max they can give her with her kidneys). Her heart and lungs are in such bad shape they would not fix her leg last May. She has had COPD for years, CHF for four years at least, diabetes most of her life and has been morbidly obese most of her life. Her legs and feet look as though they are exploding. She was told she would be dead by Sept and then shortly after increased her lasix to 160 mg. My question is: Is the increased lasix prolonging her life? She is miserable being in a nursing home. Hospice is kicking her off because they said she doesn't need their care, they think she will live longer than 6 more months. Before she broke her leg last May, she was being admitted into the hospital for five day stays to drain 15-20 pounds of fluid off. Since being in nursing care and on hospice, they just increased her lasix. She is on Adavan and Morphine, she has increased number of anxiety attacks. She is DNR and doesn't want to continue to live this way. Your opinion is valued. Thank you, Concerned Daughter",
