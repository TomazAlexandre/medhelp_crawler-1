            "answer": "Hello,If you are diabetic, it is critical to control your blood sugar very well and not to forget.Normal blood sugars are in the range of 80-120.\u00a0\u00a0His numbers are way too high and he is going to have severe complications sooner than later.Blood sugars in the 500-600 range could kill him.\u00a0\u00a0Dropping from very high to relatively low can cause symptoms and cramping.It would be best if he can manage his diabetes to keep his blood sugar closer to normal and definitely under 180 (and even better if under 140).I would strongly recommend that he attends training sessions with a diabetes educator to learn how to control his diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively there are some excellent books if he is interested:-Think Like a PancreasDiabetes Solutions by Dr. Richard Berstein,Using Insulin by John Walsh.All available on Amazon, if not in your local bookshop.For diabetes, it is important to both use insulin appropriate and consistently, and to follow a low carb diet.Best wishes to you and your husband.",
