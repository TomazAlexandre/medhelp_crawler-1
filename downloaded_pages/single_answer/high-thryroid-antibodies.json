            "answer": "You need to get a second opinion from an endo, pronto, if you aren't on thyroid meds. What are your FreeT3 and FreeT4 levels? If the doc didn't test/treat these levels, then the doc doesn't know enough about thyroid disease.The frees are way more important than TSH, which is a pituitary hormone anyway. Besides, any doctor who is in the know will tell you that a TSH over 2.0 requires treatment, although too many doctors ignore TSH until it climbs over 5.0.Get to an endocrinologist right away and get on hormone. Although your antibodies aren't too terribly high, you should get on hormone so you don't go hypo. Hypothyroidsm in pregnant women can sometimes cause miscarriage, early delivery and developmental delays in babies. I gave birth two months early to a healthy/smart baby girl, but I'm pretty sure hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's was to blame for the early delivery.Below is an article that suggests thyroid treatment for positive antibodies.http://thyroid.about.com/od/hypothyroidismhashimotos/a/preventative.htmBelow is a website that lists recommended thyroid docs (endos). Make sure the endo specializes in thyroid, not diabetes:http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/:) Tamra",

    "question": "I am 12 weeks pregnant. My thyroid antibody level was 80. The nurse said normal level is under 25. TSH was within normal range. What are the risks to the baby at this level?\u00a0\u00a0Will the antibodies keep elevating if I don't start meds soon?",
