            "answer": "Gary,Many people are able to control diabetes and collesterol with diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0That is usually the first place to start.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if your first test was not a \"fasting\" test (done without you eating within 12 hours), it was in accurate.\u00a0\u00a0Or, if your diet had been unusually high in fats and sugars (holiday meals) a few days before the test, that would affect your numbers.I recommend that you discus diet and exercise with your doctors as your chosen mode of care for these problems.\u00a0\u00a0Diet and exercise should also help your acid reflux.\u00a0\u00a0If you need something for you reflux (long term uncontolled reflux can lead to esophageal cancer), there are other options.\u00a0\u00a0Nexium is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).\u00a0\u00a0There are other options for that, but they are typically a last resort.\u00a0\u00a0Dexilant is another PPI you can discus with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You should stay away from the generic forms/OTC of Nexium - omeprazole (Nexium is eomeprazole and they are closely related).\u00a0\u00a0Other options for you would be any of several H2 blockers.Diet and life style changes are generally very effective for reflux control, so discus those options with your doctor if your reflux does become problematic once the Nexium is out of your system.Take care.Merry Christmas",

    "question": "Hi againFirstly thank you for the advice I received from my first question.I will keep this one as brief as possible, 1 month ago I was went to see a specialist about a problem of acid and burning sensation after eating. I had many tests and eventually I was prescribed a tablet called Nexium. This cured my problem immediately.I was also told that my blood sugar level and cholesterol levels were very high, I was sent to see a diabetic specialist who in turn wants me to go on tablets for diabetes.I wrote my first post on this site because I was suffering with a terrible rash and wondered if there was any connection between the two problems.After some advice from this site I have been to see a dermatologist who performed many tests.Surprise surprise!!\u00a0\u00a0It was the Nexium tablets that were giving me the rash and blisters so thank God this problem is solved.My question with regard to the blood and cholesterol levels is as follows:4 weeks ago my sugar reading was 200 +, then after another test 2 weeks ago it was down to 168. I have just returned from another test which shows my sugar as 120, also my cholesterol is down to 180 now,I am afraid to start taking the diabetic prescription tablets when I have reduced so much without any medication at all. I am thinking that I may get addicted to the pills or again there may be some adverse effects, I have not got the Nexium totally out of my system as yet but I feel so much better.I would appreciate any advice you can give me, I am not able to go back to the diabetic clinic until after Xmas as they are now closed.Thank You and a Merry Xmas to AllRegardsGary Blue",
