            "answer": "I applaude your desire to get drug free, but you also need to consider how you are going to deal with your chronic pain condition.\u00a0\u00a0Narcotics should never be the long term treatment option in your situation until all other options have proven fruitless. So please explore other ways of addressing your chronic pain, such as physical therapy, exercise, other phamaceutics, which should be\u00a0\u00a0discussed with your pain doctorr once your are opiate free.There is really no easy way of detoxing from home. I have dealt with hundreds of addicts who have all told me horror stories of doing it by themselves.\u00a0\u00a0I would only guess that if you are successful in doing it at home you don't end up in my clinic. Just in case you are curious, it takes us three to four days to detox a patient and get him/her back home drug free and feeling well on Naltrexone therapy (no opiates).At home, the basic technique is to space out the pills you take on a consistent manner until you take only one at night, then half at night and then none.\u00a0\u00a0See if your doctor can write you a prescription for some Requip for restlessness, Neurontin is a great help for anxiety and malaise, some Flexeril or Soma for a few weeks for muscle spasms and maybe some Seroquel low dose for sleep. Clonidine regulates blood pressure, creepy-crawly feeling and\u00a0\u00a0will make withdrawals easier. Valerian and Magnesium is sometimes helpful remedies over the counter for mild sedation, sleep and muscle relaxation.But, seriously, you must be completely committed to the goal of quitting.\u00a0\u00a0I have written a blog that has rather detailed information about options for detox. If you click on my name and then click on blogs you will see one under that heading.\u00a0\u00a0Take a minute to read it. I hope you will find it helpful.The main thing of course is the decision that you make and making it a priority in your life, because that will determine what your life will actually be and mean in the end.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to sound preachy but it is not a decision you make one day, it is a decision you will make every day for the rest of your life.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you and take a look at my blogs and my clinic website for even more info on narcotic detox www.mdsdrugdetox.com",
