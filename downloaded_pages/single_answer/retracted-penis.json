            "answer": "Trapped penis is an uncommon but\u00a0\u00a0treatable problem with several aspects. The fat pad at the base of his penis as well as his sagging skin contribute to the concealment by engulfing the shaft, which is fixed to the pelvic bones. Infections under the skin around the head of his penis (more common in diabetics) may have caused scarring that has narrowed the tube of skin that hangs down around the head of his penis and now will not permit this skin to retract. The answer is usually NOT a repeat circumcision. This can often make things worse with leaving his penis without adequate skin coverage for future erections. Ideally he should lose weight and be seen by a urologist to look into a surgical release, possibly with an associated abdominal lipectomy (tummy tuck). A reconstructive urologist would be the person to see in this regard.S.A.Liroff, M.D.This information is provided for general medical educational purposes only.

    "question": "My good friend has shared a problem with me and I am trying to help him get more advice. He is single, has diabetes and is overweight. He takes medicines for diabetes II, blood pressure, and a diuretic. His penis has been retracted approx. 4 years. and his MD said not to worry about it if it wasnt a problem (he is not sexually active). However, his penis can no longer be coaxed out, at all, because his foreskin (circumsized) is all that remins outside his body. It has tightened into a hard tight circle which is too small to let the penis head pop back out, even while flacid. He thinks nothing can be done. Is this true? Is there any procedure that could possibly clip the foreskin enough to let the penis head back out. As far as the retraction itself, it appears to be medication related. Ay suggestions on how to approach this with his dr.? Thanks for your help.",
