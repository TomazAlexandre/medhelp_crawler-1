            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The image is probably being formed due to exhaustion of the eye muscles, due to work needing a lot of focus. Consult an eye specialist first. In all probability, you need to exercise the eye muscles and in between work focus long distance so that the eye muscles are not exhausted. Take care!",

    "question": "This is for any opthalmologists or neurologists:\u00a0\u00a0In the last few weeks I have noticed that after doing close work when my eyes refocus to a longer visual length I see my iris of my right eye only as an afterimage.\u00a0\u00a0This lasts 5-10 minutes and interferes with my visual acuity in my right eye where the afterimage is seen.\u00a0\u00a0I am 49 and just recently had an eye exam by an optometrist. I have a history of moderate hypertension and migraines. No diabetes or other chronic systemic illnesses.Should I see an opthalmologist or a neurologist or don't bother just learn to live with this?Thank you,CC1961",
