            "answer": "Hi Lizz,How are you feeling?I think it is due your lower back strain that is causing symptoms.Lower back strain and spinal disc pathology can cause such symptoms.The nerve which is compressed is Sciatic nerve and your pain typically suggests that it could be sciatica.There could also be Lumbar Disc Herniation.Herniation of a lumbar disc is 1 of the major causes of acute and chronic lower back pain. Lower back pain may be associated with leg pain, weakness, and numbness, often referred to as sciatica.You should be consulting an orthopaedician for further management.I think it should be at earliest.Keep me informed.Bye.",

    "question": "I joined the gym about a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0After i had been there for a few months i started using the ellpitical on a regular basis.\u00a0\u00a0I would notice frequently that my right foot would start to tingle and feel asleep when i did this exercise but would always go away after i was done.\u00a0\u00a0One day the tingling didn't go away and lasted for almost two weeks before i went to the urgent care doctor.\u00a0\u00a0They really didn't come up with any reason.\u00a0\u00a0Almost 9 months later it still continues but it comes and goes, almost daily.\u00a0\u00a0Where it used to be a very prickly pins and needles feeling, it is now a more dull falling asleep feeling.\u00a0\u00a0It usually starts in my foot/ankle area and moves up into my lower leg but doesnt' seem to move up past my knee.\u00a0\u00a0My family doctor has run many blood tests for B-12 deficency, diabetes, lupus, etc and hasn't found anything.\u00a0\u00a0The last thing she told me was if it got worse or spread they would investigate further for things like MS, which obviously freaked me out.\u00a0\u00a0I would like another doctors opinion on what the cause of this could be and if MS is the most reasonable next possibility.",
