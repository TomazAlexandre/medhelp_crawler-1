    "question": "A long time ago I was diagnosed with diabetes insipidus (it's not diabetes, it is just when your kidneys produce extreme amount of urine). I formed that after a had brain surgery. Anyway, they gave me an anti diuretic hormone (desmopressin) to take to slow up how much urine I produced, which I took for many years. Now they don't think I have diabetes insipidus anymore but off my meds, I urinate....8000 ml's a day! What else can it be if it's not that disease? Any guesses are welcomed!",
