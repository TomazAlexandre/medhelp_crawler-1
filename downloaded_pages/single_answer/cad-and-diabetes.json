    "question": "My husband is 38 and has been a type 1 diabetic for 25 years.\u00a0\u00a0He recently had a inconclusive EKG and Stress test for probable angina upon extertion.\u00a0\u00a0He was sent for a thallium stress test which shows possible CAD with a blockage in one artery but apparently proper blood flow in the others (proper thallium uptake).\u00a0\u00a0His EF is 50%.\u00a0\u00a0It shows a small area at the bottom of the hear that indicates a prior MI that we were unaware of.\u00a0\u00a0He is to see a cardiologist the end of March (best appointment available).\u00a0\u00a0He is now on Diovan 160mg, a beta blocker 10mg, lipitor 80mg aspirin and a thyroid med. He has stopping drinking, is losing weight and we have changed diet to cut out red meats and reduce dietary chloesterol and salt.\u00a0\u00a0Our family doctor feels that the cardiologist will do an angiogram and stenting.\u00a0\u00a0I've read stenting isn't the best procedures for diabetics.My question is, it appears 50% EF is still normal.\u00a0\u00a0Can this improve with stenting?Is stenting possible for him?Being diabetic, is he doomed to have this repeat regardless of the interventions we are taking?Thanks so much.",
