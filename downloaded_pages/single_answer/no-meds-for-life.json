    "question": "Read posting recently about diabetes 'reversal' and achieving A1C's under 5.0.\u00a0\u00a0Being 'well controlled' for 2.5 years since diagnosis, holding A1C at 5.5-6.0 seasonally without medication (low-carb/slo-carb diet+exercise) I was not aware this was possible without medication.\u00a0\u00a0What percentage of diabetics are sensibly not on medication (under 6.5-7.0, I guess), and what percentage of these are under 6.0, under 5.0?\u00a0\u00a0At 59, is it reasonable to expect to live a long healthy life without ever going on meds?",
