    "question": "Hi... I'm having a panic party for myself here and needed some help.\u00a0\u00a0I'm currently 25 weeks pregnant and the nurse from my doctors office just called - I flunked step 1 of the glucose screening, so now I have to go back and take step 2 (which is a 3 hour test).\u00a0\u00a0She said my Iron levels were perfect, but that my Sugar was too high.\u00a0\u00a0Of course she told me not to panic and that I could very easily pass step 2.\u00a0\u00a0But if I don't, that means I've developed gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Considering I took the test the morning after the super bowl, she's hoping that maybe I just ate too many carbs the night before.\u00a0\u00a0So she told me to watch my carbs between now and Tuesday (which is when I'm going to take the 3 hour test).\u00a0\u00a0I called my husband and started crying, I guess because it just scares me.\u00a0\u00a0Even though she told me step 1 didn't necessarily mean anything, it still bothers me.\u00a0\u00a0I really don't eat that many sweets, but apparently it's not the sweets, it's all those potatoes!!\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any advice?",
