    "question": "I'm a 24-year old male.\u00a0\u00a0For the last 2 or 3 weeks, I've been needing to pee a lot more often than normal.\u00a0\u00a0I probably go about 10 times daily now.\u00a0\u00a0I wake up 3 or 4 times every night to go.\u00a0\u00a0When I go, I can hardly get anything out and I have to strain a lot (not very painful, but some). Sometimes, I need to go again about 10 minutes after I went.I had hypospadias repaired as an infant and I haven't had any problems at all.I moved from the United States to Poland about a month ago, but I also lived in Poland from 2003-2005 with no such problems.No idea what's going on.\u00a0\u00a0Any help?",
