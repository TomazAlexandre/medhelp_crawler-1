    "question": "Hello. I've just spent 7 days in the hospital (isolation unit) after being diagnosed with Methacyllin-Resistent Staph. (MRSA).\u00a0\u00a0On a Friday afternoon, I noticed a nickle-size pink area on my inner thigh that looked exactly like a spider bite - but it didn't itch.\u00a0\u00a0By Saturday noon, my inner thigh looked like a hard-boiled egg had been \"implanted\" right under that faux spider bite.\u00a0\u00a0I went immediately to the ER; was seen by a genius MD who within seconds was concerned that this was Community-Acquired MRSA (as opposed to Hospital-Acquired MRSA which is often \"pneumonia-like\").\u00a0\u00a0I was hospitalized and typical tests (before my emergency surgery where the surgeon removed a large cyst - but tunnels had already formed letting the germs sneak out of the cyst sac) were performed including a regular CBC blood screen. After the results came back, I began to be asked by all 4 of my attendings - yeh, it required 4 MDs to handle what soon turned out to be a near-fatal problem - if I was diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I kept saying \"no.\"\u00a0\u00a0My glucose # always runs between 98 and 104.\u00a0\u00a0They wouldn't give me the exact #, but it was HIGH.\u00a0\u00a0I was immediately\u00a0\u00a0put on Glucophage. I was told that since I've never had any MD indicate that I had any risk of diabetes nor did anyone on either side of the family have diabetes, that it more likely than not that my new \"Diabetes II\" status was MRSA-induced and would take about 4-5 months to \"clear.\"\u00a0\u00a0[My last CBC was performed less than a month ago, showing the glucose level to be 100]\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone ever heard of \"infection-induced\" temporary diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Now, this infection almost took my life so I understand that my whole body is still adjusting to my recovery.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still on strong antibiotics and will be for another month.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to anyone who knows about this situation.",
