            "answer": "Anxiety is just fear, so it can't make your feet, back and arms stop working or even tingle. Throughout your life you naturally tingled, ouched, itched and twitched many times like the rest of us do, but now you are studying it because you think it is a disease. If you can stop studying it you will be much happier and have time to think about other things that are more pleasant.Here is the problem, and you will have to come to grips with it if you are to relax. You said that you are over analyzing everything and googling,\"The reality is Google is your enemy because no matter what situation you are in, then you can find someone on Google that dies from it. I read about a guy who died from a thumb tack injury that formed a clot and went to his brain. You don't worry about thumbtacks though, and it would be better for you to stop worrying about tingles too.So Google will ALWAYS find something to make you feel bad.\u00a0\u00a0How do you feel about giving up the \"security\" you hope to get from Google but never will get and replacing it with doing something that doesn't harm you?",
