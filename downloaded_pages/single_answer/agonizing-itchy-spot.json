    "question": "For many months now I have been suffering from an itchy spot on the left side of my back. Here is the strange thing, though. When I standing, sitting, or laying on my back or right side I experience no itchiness in the area. However, as soon as I lay on my left side, the itchiness begins. It is like a pinpoint spot, always in the same location, and the itchiness is so intense I cannot fall asleep. I usually sit up and grab a long ruler I have and scratch at the spot until it almost hurts. When I lay back down on my left side, the itchiness returns within minutes. Most nights I end up sleeping on my right side which is very painful for me as I had right shoulder surgery (torn rotator cuff) over 9 months ago that apparently has never healed correctly. I have tried to look at the area of the itchiness in a mirror but 1) it is in a difficult area to see and 2) I have a VERY hairy back which makes it near impossible to see the skin area. When I scratch the area with the ruler I cannot feel anything that would make me believe it is something like a pimple or a boil. So to recap, the itchiness is not a general area but more like a pinpoint spot, the itchiness only occurs when I am laying on the area, the itchiness is so intense it disrupts my ability to fall asleep, scratching the spot provides only a couple minutes relief. I have had the problem for months so it is probably not a pimple.",
