    "question": "I am currently 32 wks pregnant with my second boy and at 28 wks was tested negative for Gestational Diabetes, but back in 2005, with my first pregnancy I was diagnosed with Gest Diabetes... Was put on special diet to control my sugar but gave birth to a 8lb6oz beautiful boy at almost 37wks 6days. about 2wks ealy. This time around I am still wondering why do I not have Gest Diabetes sinceeveryone has told me it is more common to get it again and is there a chance this baby could be smaller or is the myth that babies get larger with each pregnancy true no matter the conditions.Also.. one last question... I am an instructional Aide at a little preschool working with 3-4yr olds but work onl three hours a day... plus I have my three yr old that I have to be taking to his preschool everyday back and forth... So I was wondering since I am 32wks and starting to feel tired all the time... when would be a good time to stop working?",
