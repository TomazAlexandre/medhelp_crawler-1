            "answer": "Hi!I\u2019ll start by answering your last question first. Though not taken up as routine practice, research has shown that celiac disease can increase a woman\u2019s risk of not conceiving or of conceding and not taking the pregnancy forward. Needless to say, as the age advances and the more chronic the disease is, higher will be the risk.Also, often thyroid function is affected and this adds on to the risk of not conceiving. Diabetes is also commonly found in people who have celiac disease or it can come up during pregnancy (gestational diabetes). Anemia and nutritional deficiencies are more likely to come up during pregnancy and also the disease can flare up when you are pregnant. So, if you want a baby, you must try as soon as possible. You will need careful monitoring by your GI doctor and your Obs and Gyn.If you have celiac disease you will need regular screening for vitamin B12, iron, calcium, folate and TSH levels. People with celiac disease are also often known to suffer from thyroid disorders. Also you may need bone density scan more often as you grow older.You need to urge other family members (especially immediate blood relations) to test for celiac. Check all food labels (for obvious and hidden gluten sources) before buying any packaged, bottled and tinned products. While eating out, place your order after ensuring there is no gluten in it (some times gluten free pasta is cooked in water where gluten containing pasta was boiled etc).You should not share toasters etc if others in the family are eating gluten. You must have your own cutting board, baking dish, butter paper etc. You need to avoid inhaling gluten congaing products like while sieving flour you are using for cooking for others.I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health.Good Luck and take care!",

    "question": "I\u2019ve just been diagnosed with Celiac disease. What are the main things that I should be concerned with right now?To date I have:-\tAsked my doctors to set me up with a dietician who specializes in Celiac disease-\tAsked my doctor to set me up with a GI doctor who specializes in Celiac disease-\tAsked my doctor to set me up with an allergist to see if I have any other food sensitivities or allergies-\tWe have also completely rid our home of any gluten-containing products and have done a \u201cdecontamination\u201d of the kitchen (including removal of all porous spoons, baking sheets, etc.).Is there anything else I should be doing?Should I be seeking testing to check my nutrient levels? Should I be supplementing with vitamins?Is there anything I can do to reduce my risk of complications from Celiac disease (like diabetes, arthritis, etc.)?My partner and I would also like to start trying for a baby. Is there any reason we proceed immediately?Thank you!",
