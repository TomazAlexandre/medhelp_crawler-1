    "question": "I was in a minor auto accident the 1st of July, I didn't think I was injured but a few hours after being hit I got an awful sickening headache that I couldn't get rid of so I went to the Dr. She said I had a pulled muscle and gave me a muscle relaxer. It did help some with the headache but I still couldn't get rid of it completely, so I went to my Dr. and he ordered an x ray which showed nothing and he gave me a different muscle relaxer, then I noticed that when my arm was above my head my fingertips would go numb, so I went to my Dr. and he ordered an MRI. It shows narrowing between C6 & C7. My question is, how can this be treated and could this have been cause by a minor jar in a car wreck?",
