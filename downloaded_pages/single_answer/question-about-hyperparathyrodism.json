    "question": "Last June I was rushed to the hospital due to pain. I was referred to a Nephorologist and he had me take test for Hyperparathyrodism and I ended up moving to another City during this time. The doctor's office sent me a copy of the test results and I shared with my new doctor. They never addresed it, but the test has the my calcium was 8.9, the Hyporparathyroidism was out of range (low), Hyperparathyroidism, primary was High out of range, the secondary was mormal or low our of range and the tertiary was high. Is this something to worry about? I am going to another doctor in a month or so.",
