            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Since your CT scan and MRI have been clear it is all right to exclude neurological lesions like brain tumors, stroke and aneurysms. EEG is showing some abnormality so it does seem to be some kind of seizure.Other possibilities that can be considered are aortic stenosis, diabetes and gastroenteritis.I would suggest you to consult an experienced neurologist. You can also opt for ambulatory EEG monitoring for 24 hrs after discussing with your doctor.",
