            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to UTI . UTI is urinary tract infection and no gender is spared. The cause of most UTIs is bacteria that initially settle (colonise) around the urethra (urine tube), and then ascend into the rest of the urinary tract. Factors that can cause this to happen include incomplete urinary emptying, hygiene of the urethra, urethra narrowing, bladder reflux disease (usually due to leaky valves between the bladder and ureter tubes that connect to the kidneys and diabetes etc. It is better to get a urine culture done as you need oral antibiotics.Till then drink plenty of water and cranberry juice. If symptoms persist then get other causes like infection and cystitis ruled out.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hi all-Hopefully someone can help me here and it's not too serious/self-correcting..Last Tuesday afternoon, I was stuck downtown and did not have access to a bathroom until long after the sensation of having to \"go\" had passed. As a workout fiend I drink a good amount of water and definitely have gotten into the habit of overdoing stimulants (mostly caffeine, energy drinks), so my bladder is used to being pushed to its limits. Though this time, its like my bladder doesn't even work anymore and my body tells me when I have to pee when my left testicle starts hurting-an uncomfortable pressure. At this point I try to go but its hard to get started and when it does I have trouble keeping the stream going. I've noticed getting it started has a lot to do with deep breaths. Afterwards, its literally a relief and takes an uncomfortable pain off my testicles until the pain does returns usually 20-45 min later at which point I try to go to the bathroom again and can manage to **** a couple fluid oz maybe. I can stay pain free the lesser I drink fluids but its tough to do so in the summer and being accustomed to so much fluid. Its worst when I'm sitting down, walking around can take away the pain. At first it was just the left one, but now sometimes the right one hurts though I am not sure of a pattern. I don't have trouble sleeping but it seems I've had\u00a0\u00a0to tend to this problem maybe 10 times a day since last Tuesday (today being Friday).Any advice would be appreciated.. If the things in my control are not enough to solve this problem, I will head to the hospital asap.Thanks!",
