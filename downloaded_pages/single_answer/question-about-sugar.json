            "answer": "I'm glad you posted. Your reaction is typical of a body not having the capabilities of handling excess sugar. Every 7 grams of sugar listed is equal to one heaping Tablespoon of refined sugar. Basically you consumed 8oz of liquid mixed with a little over 5.5 Tablespoons of sugar. I suggest you get tested for diabetes.The doctor may order one or more of the following tests:1. OGTT - Oral Glucose Tolerance Test. You are given a sweet substance to drink then measured to see how well your body handles the excess glucose.2. Fasting - No foods or colored liquids for 8-10 hours prior to a simple blood draw.3. A1c - Checks your blood glucose levels going back 3 months. Another simple blood draw.",

    "question": "hello everyone i dont have diabetes as far as i know but i have a question related to sugar and figured this was the right place to ask my question. a few days ago i drank a 18oz glass of welches grape juice. shortly after about 2 hours i became extremely anxious and my heart was pounding really fast and hard and also i had dry mouth. it lasted for about 40 minutes then it was over. at the time i figured maybe it was a severe panic attack but then the next day it got me thinking about the welches grape juice and i looked on the bottle and seen the sugar content which is 39grams per 8oz so thats about 80 some grams of sugar for what i drank. just wondering if maybe this could have led to my severe heart palpitations. i have read that sugar can increase adrenaline levels.",
