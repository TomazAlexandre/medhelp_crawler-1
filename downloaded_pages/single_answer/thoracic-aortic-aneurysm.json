    "question": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0I am a 47 basically healthy woman just diagnosed with a 4 cm ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm. I was put on Metoprolol 2 times a day, also an aspirin. My first test which was an Echo showed 4 cm. My surgeon put me on the Beta Blocker and saw me in 2 weeks. Meanwhile I had a CT scan which showed the aneurysm \"shrunk\" to 3 cm. From this info, does it sound like there is anything else to be concerned about? My family history is a father who died suddenly at 42 of a massive coronary and 2 sisters both with diabetes and heart disease.",
