            "answer": "Hi!Unintentional and unexplained weight loss is definitely not good. One possibility is that your friend is having an eating disorder. In which case taking help from a doctor specialized in treating eating disorders will help. There are many other causes like worms in stool, depression, anorexia nervosa, AIDS, cancers especially colon cancers, drug abuse, infections and loss of appetite. Loss of appetite can again be due to certain medications, drug abuse, depression, AIDS, acute and chronic infections, cancers and hypothyroidism. Either your friend does not eat well or there is increased metabolism as in hyperthyroid states, HIV, cancer etc. Poor absorption as in irritable bowel syndromes and malabsorption syndromes too is possible. Malabsorption syndromes are seen in intestinal tuberculosis, HIV, tropical sprue, parasites in stool and Whipple\u2019s Disease. Diabetes too can be the cause.Please ask your friend to consult a PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello, my friend is 14 and I'm worried about her health. She has always been slim but not too skinny, shes about 5 foot 4, I started noticing that she started to look skinnier about a year ago but I haven't said anything. About a year ago she was about 8 stone, now shes about 6. The size of her thigh is about the same size as my calf, and I'm about average size. Her face always looks gaunt, and her skin has got worse (acne e.t.c), do you think she could be approaching anorexia, and if so should I say something or not? I can tell she hasn't been eating that much either. We were shopping the other day and she missed out her lunch and she doesn't have breakfast, so that day all she had was a bowl of soup and a peice of bread and butter, I'm worried and I'm not sure what to do about it? Help?Thanks for any suggestions",
