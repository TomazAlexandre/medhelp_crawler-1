            "answer": "Hello,The ideal healthy urine color is a straw yellow color.It can be due to drinking more amount of fluids or diabetes insipidus.It is a condition characterized by excessive thirst and excretion of large amounts of severely diluted urine with normal intake of fluids.I would suggest you to consult your urologist and discuss these two possibilities with him.Investigations like blood tests,desmopressin stimulation test and MRI may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.Hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
