            "answer": "Hi there!I personally do not agree with cuts, rendering schools devoid of primary medical care for children. Though I am not aware of an organization that would do it personally, you could try contacting the social services department in your region and if they would be of any help or a better option would be to change the school if possible.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "Hello, my 4 year old son has type 1 diabetes. He is currently in preschool and the school nurse and his teacher are both well aware of how to treat him and what to look for. He will be going to kindergarten next year. His school district had just made major budget cuts and the school nurse was one of those cuts. He will be moved to a new school without a nurse and this really concerns me because there is no one there that is trained on how to treat him or even know anything about type 1 diabetes. So, my question is, is there anyone out there that knows of an organization/program I can contact that would come and train the teachers and staff at his school for free? I live near Toledo Ohio. Thank you in advance",
