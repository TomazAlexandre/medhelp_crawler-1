            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms can be due to side effects of certain medications. So stop this drug and see if it helps. It can also be due to fibromyalgia, Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. A pinched nerve can also be the cause. Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
