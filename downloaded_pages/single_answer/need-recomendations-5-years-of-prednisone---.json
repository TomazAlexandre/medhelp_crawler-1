            "answer": "Hi-Have you ever been tested to see if you have problems with your pituitary or adrenal glands? Our body makes it own steroids from the adrenal glands in response to hormones from the pituitary gland. There is a condition called Addison's Disease where the adrenal glands don't work right. There is also a more mild form called adrenal insufficiency. Even the thyroid gland is involved in some of this. There is a special type of endocrinologist/doctor that you can see called a neuroendocrinologist. Regular endocrinologist usually work with people who have diabetes and are not necessarily \"up\" on the special testing that these types of disorders need to be diagnosed. Neuroendos will talk to you about your history and symptoms. Then they order the special tests on your hormones in order to assess your situation to see if indeed something like this might be going on. They work at larger Medical Centers.Also there are some autoimmune conditions that can affect the way that the endocrine system works.I have adrenal insufficiency because I had a small cyst on my pituitary gland. When it was removed I lost most of my hormone function. So I take cortisol to replace what my body does not make. Without it I feel very tired and achey.Good luckHorselip",

    "question": "I have been on Prednisone for about 5 years on and off. One day I woke up after a long night of partying...I had Asthma like symptoms. Went to my primary doctor, put me on the Prednisone cycle (40 mg for few days, then 30, then 20...and it worked). Few weeks later, the same symptoms came back again since I was off the steroid... he recommended consulting with other specialists...I saw 2 rheumatologists, 2 or 3 lung specialists, Cardiologist. My symptoms worsen if not taking prednisone so I was admitted to the hospital twice to try to find out what was wrong....no luck.I just realized that i may have a mild case of \u201cMystery something\u201d!! When it gets too cold and if i am tired or I\u2019ve been partying\u2026the symptoms come back and worsen quickly. When i am rested and trying to be healthy it takes couple months before i have to take the prednisone. I am puzzled.... the pain usually starts by the shoulder, neck areas (Upped body) and works its way down sometimes, which causes my difficulty breathing and a general feeling of getting sick.Any help, experiences, suggestions or recommendations would be appreciated. Thank you",
