    "question": "Hi, I am hoping someone here can help me! I am a 32 year old female with multiple sclerosis and type 2 diabetes. I am currently keeping the diabetes under control with Amaryl and Metphormine. I also take Tramadol, Soma, and Atteral for the MS.For about a year now I have had a high white blood cell count, it fluctuates between 50,000 and 80,000. My neurologist sent me to an oncologist who took about 40 tubes of blood from me and performed a bone marrow biopsy to test for leukemia. The results of these tests came back negative. From there we just kind of left it alone for awhile.I started having bad headaches; I usually don\u2019t get headaches and have a very low pain tolerance so there\u2019s no telling how bad they really are. My doctor also found that I have an extra sinus and thought that maybe this was the cause of the headaches and possibly the high WBC. She suggested that I see an ear nose and throat specialist.I went to see the specialist. This guy checks it out and says, there\u2019s no way that this is the problem. So, with the way things have been going, I have now developed this red bump rash type thing on my arm. I thought they were hives because they are red and itch. I have tried Benadryl and a prescription type cr\u00e8me, which only relieve the itch but have no help in the healing. They are now starting to spread farther up my arm and are also on the back of my thigh. I noticed that one when I shaved over it! OUCH!Before I am broke and living in the street because of this guessing game, I was hoping that someone may have some knowledge of whatever that I am suffering from. My gut tells me that all these things are tied together, but the doctors are left scratching their heads. Please help!",
