            "answer": "Hi,Ischaemic Heart Disease( IHD), otherwise known as coronary artery disease, is a condition that affects the supply of blood to the heart. The blood vessels are narrowed or blocked due to the deposition of cholesterol plaques on their walls. This reduces the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the heart musculature, which is essential for proper functioning of the heart. This may eventually result in a portion of the heart being suddenly deprived of its blood supply leading to the death of that area of heart tissue, resulting in a heart attack. This also leads to the death of tissue within the organs supplied by the heart and their eventual failure or death.The major risk factors for IHD are smoking, diabetes mellitus and cholesterol levels. Those with elevated blood levels of cholesterol have a much higher tendency to develop the disease.Electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiogram, Treadmill Test-TMT, myocardial perfusion scanning with radioactive thallium, coronary angiogram provides accurate information about the actual site and extent of the narrowing and helps in deciding the method of therapy required. Medical therapy includes nitrates, beta-blockers, calcium channel antagonists. Surgical therapy is indicated when medical treatment has failed to relieve symptoms or when the Angiogram shows significant disease in the blood vessels. Coronary Angioplasty - dilating the blocked vessel by inflating a balloon inside the vessel and Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG) - replacing the blocked area of the vessel using a graft from the patient, may be done to relieve the blockage.Take care and regards.",
