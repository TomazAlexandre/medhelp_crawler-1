It may be a manifestation of some allergy, inflammation or infection. It can be a bacterial skin infection called impetigo. Are your blood glucose levels norrmal? Skin problems are common in people with diabetes mellitus. The exact cause can be determined only after a physical examination. If it is impetigo then a topical antibacterial will help. Do see a dermatologist. I hope it helps.Best luck and regards!",
