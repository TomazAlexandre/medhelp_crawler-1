    "question": "I would assume this is a dermatology issueI am over weight and in the last year, have developed a persistant under arm odor. I also have thyroid issues and diabetes so I dont know if this would play into the situation. When I take a shower, I scrub my under arms until they are red. Yet when I step out of the shower and dry off, its almost as if years of deoderant is just stuck to my under arms and it smells as if I didnt even shower. Im at my wits end and so depressed over this because Ive always been such a clean person. Ive tried switching deoderants and nothing is working. What is wrong and what else can I do?",
