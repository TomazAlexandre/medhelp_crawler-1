    "question": "Hello DoctorI was in India on vacation. On July 19th I had unprotected Vaginal & Oral sex with a TV actress. I know it was very stupid and no excuses for doing so. I will never take this risk again in my life. But the intercourse was hardly 10 mins.To add to this, I'm uncircumsized and I had a small cut under the penis head due to yeast infection (uncontrolled diabetes).I came back to the US on July 30th and I really got scared. I felt feverish (98.6-98.9), but no real fever, sore throat or rash that I can see.But I had headaches, itchy skin all over the body. On August 23rd (35 Days after the exposure) I tested for all STDs & HIV.My results just came and I tested negative for all STDs inlcuding Chlamydia, Gonorhea, Syphilis, HSV2, HPV etc., My HIV antibody testing also came back negative.Are my results conclusive? or Should I re-test after 12 weeks?",
