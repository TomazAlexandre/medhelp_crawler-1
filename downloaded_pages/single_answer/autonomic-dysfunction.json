            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.There are two types of sensory neuropathies in the body \u2013 large and small fibers. With small fiber neuropathies, symptoms including burning or buzzing or other vague symptoms starting in the feet and hands then in some cases spreading to other parts of the body. The EMG/nerve conduction studies (NCS) (tests done to check for neuropathy) will not show an abnormality, and a definitive diagnosis can only be made with a skin biopsy so that the number of nerve endings can literally be counted. There are other tests of the function of small nerves that can be ordered, such as QSART testing which looks at how much sweat the skin makes, since sweating is in a sense of function of these small nerves. Also, a tilt table can look at the changes in the blood pressure and heart rate in resposne to posture. There are several causes of small fiber neuropathy, and the most common is diabetes. The small fibers are found all throughout the arms and legs (e.g., sweat glands, etc) but also include the autonomic fibers such as those associated with the heart. The treatment is ultimately controlling the diabetes and symptomatic treatment, as you have been told (i.e., being aware of fluid intake, salt intake, meal sizes, posture, and wearing elastic stockings, etc). Medications such as florinef, midodrine, and pyridostigmine have all been used to treat dysautonomia.I would suggest you follow up with a neurologist who specializes in neuromuscular medicine. You may benefit from a formal tilt table if you have not had one performed. Also, you should continue to work with your cardiologist.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "Was recently diagnosed with Autonomic Dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor says it starts in the feet.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have any pain in my feet or anywhere but have fainted one time in December.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure and\u00a0\u00a0heart rate both drop when I stand up, sometimes when I lay or sit down.\u00a0\u00a0The cardiologist told me that medicine's would not help me nor would a pacemaker help me, told me to eat more food with salt, drink lots of water to not get dehydrated and to eat three meals a day.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot take any of the medications that help this.\u00a0\u00a0Am allergic to sulfur, can't take beta blocker's, can't take any sedatives, vitamins, allergic to them, all make me sick, interact with my diabetic medicine, Lantus and baby aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0They also lower my heart rate and can't afford for heart rate to go any lower.\u00a0\u00a0Want to know, if there is anything that can help me.\u00a0\u00a0Also, two doctor's told me this will not kill me, yet, every thing I read online says that a person would die within 5-7 years after being diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0Is Autonomic Dysfunction the same thing as Dysautonomia? Can you please help me?\u00a0\u00a0I feel normal except for the blood pressure and heart rate fluctuating constantly.\u00a0\u00a0When I read about dying, has me scared to pieces.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you",
