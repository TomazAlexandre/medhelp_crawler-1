            "answer": "Hi there.From what you have described, it seems that the problem is vascular. Meaning, this has something to do with the arteries or blood vessels supplying the muscles\u00a0\u00a0of the hips, thigh, and lower extremities.\u00a0\u00a0These problems arise more commonly in patients with predisposing conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that you discuss with your doctors regarding exploring this angle, and possibly have tests that will assess the arteries such as magnetic resonance angiogram or conventional angiograms.Take care and God bless.",
