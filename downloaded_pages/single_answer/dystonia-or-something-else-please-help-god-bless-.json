            "answer": "\"Multiple autoimmune disorders have been recorded with the neurovisceral and cutaneous genetic porphyrias including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, diabetes, systemic and discoid lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, Sjogren's disease and scleritis. Physicians should be on high alert for porphyrias in families with autoimmune disorders and care must be taken with potential porphyrinogenic drugs, including sulfasalazine.\"This seemed to be potentially of interest.Hemachromatosis was noted as being one of these conditions. Porphyria is an extremely rare genetic disorder that is clinically complex but can be worsened by some medications so it might be worthwhile to discuss this with her doctor and if they believe this to be within potential to do testing for it to rule it out as a potential cause of this.",

    "question": "My twin sister is 26 years old. Has been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis since she was 20. Was recently taking a strong antibiotic classified as a \"sulfa\" drug. Had a severe allergic reaction with flu like symptoms that kept her in bed for a week. Just when it looked like she was getting better she started convulsing and lost all control of her limbs. She stayed in the hospital for 3 days and they finally said she had Dystonia brought on by her reaction. She hasn't gotten better. She still can't walk without her legs giving out on her, her hands are stiff and claw like and she has a hard time finding words. She is easily fatigued and has lost weight. My question is this...my dad has hemachromatosis (sp?) and a b12 deficiency. I've read several articles that say a B12 deficiency can sometimes be misdiagnosed with Dystonia. Is that common? She has been sick formmuch longer than before she took the antibiotics so I wonder if there is more to it and that just set her off. Please help...she is my world and I would love to see her enjoying life again. Thank you!",
