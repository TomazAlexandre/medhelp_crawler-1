    "question": "I have a 4 yr old who is CONSTANTLY hungry.\u00a0\u00a0He wakes up sometimes at 0530 - 0600hrs and heads straight to the fridge or pantry to eat.\u00a0\u00a0He'll eat 4 yogurts and a muffin before I get up at 0700 hrs and make him breakfast which he eats in full.\u00a0\u00a0I realize he is growing but this has been fairly constant for a couple years now.\u00a0\u00a0He often disappears to sneak food!\u00a0\u00a0I don't keep a lot of junk food around (he'd inhale it!) so he makes fairly healthy choices (pears, cheese, yogurt) eating anything that he can easily open, so I don't worry too much but I have a nagging feeling something is going on with him (tapeworm maybe?). His height and weight are totally normal but his is a bit on the hyperactive side. I don't restrict his intake (as long as it is a healthy choice) but I do get tired of him thinking I'm a walking concession stand!\u00a0\u00a0He rummages thru my purse looking for a snack and is miserable if he can't find something!!\u00a0\u00a0He always has water with him and drinks adequate amounts daily.\u00a0\u00a0His older brother could go all day without asking for food.\u00a0\u00a0Just really wondering what symptoms brought you or you doctor to test for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
