            "answer": "Hi,I am so glad that you are finding the website helpful!In regard to your vascular health question, there are no strict guidelines relating degree of vascular or cardiovascular disease to certain A1C numbers. The goal for avoiding vascular complications is\u00a0\u00a0accepted as being the same as for microvascular i.e aim for an A1C below 7%. The cholesterol goals are aimed more towards heart disease and stroke, while the A1C and blood pressure guidelines are meant for all complications but came about mainly from data relating to eye and kidney complications. Hope this answers your question.take care.",
