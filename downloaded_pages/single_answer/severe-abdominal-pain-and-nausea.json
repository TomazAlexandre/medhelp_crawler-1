            "answer": "Hi, were motility studies done? Motility disorders can cause the symptoms described by you. Diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy and affect the digestive system, leading to problems with digestion and elimination. Check with your doctor to rule out these conditions. Also, make the shift towards a natural healthy lifestyle. Eat regularly at frequent intervals, smaller meals. Try to avoid oily or high calorie food. Aim for an ideal weight. And eat at least two hours before sleeping. Include exercise in your daily routine. This should help to settle things. Try to include yogurt in your diet as it is a probiotic which replaces lactobacillus acidophilus (good bacteria) that helps with digestion. Regards.",

I have had endoscopy with biopsy, colonoscopy with biopsy, ct, xrays, a test that used\u00a0\u00a0a radioactive substance, gall bladder has been removed(pain and nausea worse after surgery). I take nexium and it along with ALL other medications make me sick. I have been on many antidepressants from gi doc. Nothing helps. Was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and gastritis in the late 1990s, but years later and more tests from other doctors was told I had neither. I am absolutely miserable. Always nauseated and my abdomen hurts all over. Don't want to eat or participate in life at all. I am only living for my family at this point. Please help.Kevin",
