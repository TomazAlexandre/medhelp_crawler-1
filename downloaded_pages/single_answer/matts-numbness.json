            "answer": "Hi,Pain, tingling and numbness are signs of neuropathy. Nerve involvement may be single (mono-neuropathy) or multiple (poly-neuropathy).Mono-neuropathies are usually caused by trauma, compression, or entrapment.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.Signs of nerve dysfunction are pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness.You can try a Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator, which is an electronic device that produces electrical signals used to stimulate nerves through unbroken skin. The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. TENS works to decrease pain perception and may be used to control acute and chronic pain. It helps in regenerating nerve.Nerves regenerate, or heal, at a rate 1 millimeter/day. The only nerves that can regenerate are the nerves outside of the spinal cord, or peripheral nerves. The nerves in the spinal cord, once damaged, cannot regenerate. However, if the peripheral nerve is severely damaged or stretched it may never heal.Hope this helps.Bye.",

    "question": "My dad recently posted a question on this website concerning my post-op problem.\u00a0\u00a0The information that we received was greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I have seen my Dr. which has stirred up a couple more questions I was hoping to have help with.Quick update about my problem:\u00a0\u00a0My shoulder would frequently dislocate causing a ligament tear.\u00a0\u00a0I had surgery on my left shoulder to repair the torn ligament.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I have numbness on the outer part of my bicep and burning in the same area where the numbness is located.\u00a0\u00a0I only have this burning when I stretch my arm in certain positions.\u00a0\u00a0The burning occurs mostly when my arm is straight and then stretched.The information that we recieved said my problem sounds like nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0I have learned that nerve damage with my type of surgery is a possible risk (low %).\u00a0\u00a0But my question is, how can you tell if the nerve damage is permanent or if it will eventually go away.\u00a0\u00a0If the nerve damage will eventually go away, then I will just deal with it.\u00a0\u00a0If the nerve damage is permanent, I feel like someone has made a mistake.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr. today said that since I have a burning sensation that I could consider that as a good sign that the nerves are still entact and repairing themselves.\u00a0\u00a0My next question was\u00a0\u00a0\"if the nerve was damaged beyond repair, would I still feel pain?\"\u00a0\u00a0He responded by saying \"no pain what so ever\".\u00a0\u00a0Is this true? I would be better off if they had done more damage to the nerve than the little amount of damage they did (in his opinion)?\u00a0\u00a0Also, my Dr. said there is no way to tell if there is permanent nerve damage vs. nerve damage that is healing itself.\u00a0\u00a0My Physical Therapist deals with many shoulder surgeries and has never dealt or seen something like this.\u00a0\u00a0I get the impression by my Dr. that he has never dealt with something like this either but acts like he has.\u00a0\u00a0I have no doubt that he has dealt with numbness but not the burning that I am having.If someone could let me know what they think I should do I would greatly appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr. thinks I should give it 6 months (long) until I start to worry about it.\u00a0\u00a0I think something serious might have happened but I am just not sure.\u00a0\u00a0HELP!",
