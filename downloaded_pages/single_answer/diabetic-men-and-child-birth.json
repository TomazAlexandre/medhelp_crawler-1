            "answer": "Your worries are without merit on both accounts as there are plenty of men with diabetes who have children and i am one. Many women over thirty have children without complications. Both my children were conceived and born after my wife was thirty two aand about ten years after i became diabetic. There are other drugs and things to try for conception and the doctor who prescribed the clomid should be consulted for another prescrption to try. Good luck, babies are the most fun you can have in your life. bret",

    "question": "I am a 31 year old male. I have been diagnosed with diabeties last year. My wife and I are trying to have kids for the past one year but no luck yet. My wife went to her doctor and she is on clomid for the last 3 months still nothing. We are worried that it might have something to do that I have diabeties. Is it possible that we are not able to have kids because I have diabeties? We are also worried because we heard that women over 32 have alot of pregnancy complications. Can anybody clarify our worries?",
