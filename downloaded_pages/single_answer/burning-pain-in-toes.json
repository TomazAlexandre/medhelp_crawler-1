            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.Burning sensation is usually a pain syndrome associated with nerves, i.e.,neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain can be diagnosed by history and physical, and also may include an examination called EMG/NCS which assesses the condition of your nerves. (However, an EMG/NCS may be normal if the smaller nerve fibers are affected rather than larger nerve fibers). This test is performed at most neurology clinics. The most common cause of neuropathy is diabetes, and sometimes only glucose intolerances, or abnormal rises in blood sugar after a glucose load can be the only indication (this is called a oral glucose tolerance test). Other causes include but are not limited to hereditary/genetic causes (such as in a disease called Charcot-Marie-Tooth, in which there is a family history of sensory neuropathy usually from an early age associated with other clinical features such as high-arched feet), autoimmune problems (such as lupus (SLE), Sjogren's, Churg-Strauss (in which asthma also occurs), polyarteritis nodosa, which affects blood vessels), and demyelinating diseases (such as CIDP). Vitamin B12 and B6 deficiency, as well as excess vitamin B6, can also cause neuropathy. Some toxins, such as lead, arsenic, and thalium can cause large fiber sensory neuropathy. Other causes include abnormalities of protein metabolism, as in a type called amyloidosis or monoclonal proteinemia. Treatment for neuropathic pain includes neurontin and lyrica, and medications such as elavil (which is an antidepressant but has actually been found to be helpful with neuropathic pain as well).I would suggest you follow up with your primary care physician to discuss. You should have basic lab work performed including evaluating your blood sugar.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",
