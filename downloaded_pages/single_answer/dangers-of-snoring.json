            "answer": "HiSnoring is a symptom which may be either a simple snoring or snoring associated with sleep disorder.Obstructive sleep apnoea is an obstructive disorder characterized by repeated episodes of partial or complete cessation of breathing during sleep and excessive sleepiness during the day. These episodes may be classified as obstructive, central or mixed apnea.The upper airway resistance leads to snoring and resulting arousals during sleep. Use of sedative or alcohol and poor sleep hygiene also contribute to snoring. Patients predisposed to this disorder are generally overweight or obese and may have a short thick neck.Other conditions to rule out may be sleep deprivation, depression, narcolepsy, medications and hypothyroidism.Individuals who snore or have sleep apnea have an increased risk of being pre-diabetic (insulin resistant), type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease.You should consult a sleep therapist or a doctor for a complete medical evaluation. Diet and exercise counseling play a major role in the initial therapy.The other treatment options include behavioural therapy, Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), intra-oral devices and medications.Do write in if you need any other information.Take care!",
