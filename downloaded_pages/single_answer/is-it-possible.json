If it was a post-meal glucose(or random during the day)it would not have been thought of as abnormal at all, and even now.Take care.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with Type II diabeties. In a 1975 hospital record I recently requested for the VA, it was noted that my Glucose level was elevated to 125. In 1995 I suffered a massive heart attack. In 1997 I had to have by pass surgery. In 2006 I suffered sudden cardiac death this is when I was diagnosed with Type II diabeties. Afeter requesting all of the hospital and doctors records I could along with lab reports Ifound that every lad test that had a glucose reading was noted as high with the exception of two. Is it possible that I should have been diagnosed possible back in 1975 or at least in 1995 instead of advised to watch what I eat?",
