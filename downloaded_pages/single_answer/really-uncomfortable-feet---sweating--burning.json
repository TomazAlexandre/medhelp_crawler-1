            "answer": "Hello,Your condition sounds very much like hyperhidrosis but you make it fairly clear that its not the case. In feel that you may still have hyperhidrosis but it may not be due to the most common means, being increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system or due to increased anxiety. Other possible possible explainations for increased increased perspiration include (most common to least): poor diet, drug interactions, diabetes, gout or an endrocrine disorder such as thyroid or pituitary involvement.In terms of treatment you need to determine the cause. I am sure you have read alot about the treatment options as you have had the condition for a long time, in my experience surgical treatment has a very good success rate but does come with its drawbacks. If not wanting to follow the surgical approach I would suggest a visit to the podiatrist. They can make a custom made absorbent insole that will work better then the over the counter types.RegardsDr Foot",

    "question": "I've been searching for some explanation of a problem I have had for close to 20 years now. I'm a healthy 37 year old male with a problem affecting my feet. It's not a hyperhydrosis issue as I've had that treated and it didn't help. The primary symptom is that my feet can't stand being enclosed in shoes, although the same problem can occur just from being covered in a duvet. Regardless of the season or the type of socks/shoes I wear, my feet are either very cold and clammy or very hot, burning, swollen and sweating. The sweat is very watery and really doesn't cause an odour problem. It's just that wearing any kind of footwear is unpleasant. As I don't live in a jungle or a desert, that makes every day life less than pleasant. Typically, my feet will start to sweat after around 10 minutes to varying degrees. Very quickly the heal and toe of my socks will be wet to the touch. Almost always I feel a strong need to remove my shoes and allow the feet to cool down and try off. I've tried everything over the years - breathable socks and shoes, treatments for hyperhydrosis etc. Nothing has worked and no-one can tell me what the cause or cure may be.I can't be the only person in the world suffering from this. Would be wonderful to find something that actually helped.Thanks",
