            "answer": "I'm assuming you mean S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which is marketed as an over the counter antidepressant.\u00a0\u00a0Anytime you consume something that is not FDA approved, you run the risk of getting unlabeled/unstudied side effects not only from the drug itself, but from the additives that may be part of the overall compound.\u00a0\u00a0This particular antidepressant has been shown to interact with other medications and can cause mood disorders in some patients.\u00a0\u00a0The side effect profile otherwise is ok with some patients reporting GI upset.\u00a0\u00a0I did not find anything regarding nerve pain and discomfort, but if you're feeling better without it, just stop it altogether.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
