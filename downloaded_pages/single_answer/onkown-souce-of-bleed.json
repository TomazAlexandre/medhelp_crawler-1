            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you have blood in urine and low kidney function, then you could be having chronic kidney disease or kidney function compromised due to blood pressure or diabetes or infection.The most common cause of blood in urine is UTI. The next possible diagnosis is stone. The stone can be anywhere in the urinary system from kidney to urethra. Gross hematuria or blood in urine visible to naked eye is also seen in\u00a0\u00a0cancer of kidney, sickle cell anemia, bladder endometriosis, low platelet count and other clotting disorders, bladder injury and bladder infections.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
