            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!It is possible to feel tremors all over the body. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "For the last few months I've noticed that I shake uncontrollably. It started in my legs, mainly my knees; it was just a slight twitch and you could see the muscles moving. Then my hands started shaking and I would drop things I was holding and noticed my pencil shaking when I held it. I have trouble drawing straight lines and sorting through things and even typing this. It's almost like my fingers do not do what I want them to do. The last week or so I have developed severe headaches in my forehead and only sleep makes them go away, which made me think I was just extremely tired or needed to drink more water, but no amout of sleep during the night seems to keep them from happening and nothing I do seems to help. I just want to know if I should be worried and go see a doctor or if it's just normal. I do not take many medications and nothing about my lifestyle has changed recently.",
