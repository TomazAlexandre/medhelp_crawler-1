            "answer": "I do not know what rhythm problems ablation works (best) on, but it is a subject I think you should have with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not have a cardiologist, that would be a good next step.My experience, my cardiologist doesn't support me having an ablation for AFib, is given an ablation is less than 100% effective or safe, one has to make a risk/benefit appraisal.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, with minor (in the eyes of the doctors) symptoms and low probability of success takes ablation off the table.\u00a0\u00a0I'd go for it if my doctors would give me better than a 50% chance of success.\u00a0\u00a0I think the risk is low, albeit highest for AFib treatment due to the need to access the left atrium.",

    "question": "I have suffered with occasional Supraventricular Ectopic Episodes. Recently, I have had an increase in the frequency and duration of Ectopic beats in my heart rhythm. I have been to my Doctor and had a ECG and one occasion to the hospital for tests and they are not concerned. These Supraventricular Ectopics occur every 2nd and 3rd heartbeat when they are severe. I suffer from panic/anxiety disorder and having this problem is causing me a lot of distress. I have high systolic Blood Pressure even though I am on BP Meds which averages on 150/70. I also have Diabetes treated with insulin. With this causing me such distress on a daily basis, would I be a candidate for Ablation to remedy the ectopic beats?",
