    "question": "In August I had a bad yeast infection. Went to my primary doctor and she confirmed that it was indeed a yeast infection along with it being irritated. She prescribed medicine, which I took for the week. When the week was up, I got my menstrual cycle. When my cycle was over all the symptoms of the yeast infection minus the discharge came back. Went out and bought Monistat which my vagina ejected out. So I went to the emergency room and the doctors had me urine in a cup, tested my blood sugar for diabetes, and then did a pelvic exam and discovered little white sores on the inside my vagina. She immediately said herpes and did a.culture exam. Sent me home with antibiotics for herpes and yeast infection. Three to four days later called the hospital and found out I tested negative for herpes. I still have an itch and sometimes a runny white vaginal discharge from my vagina from time to time. What's wrong with me??? I've never had this experience before and to be honest I am scared. Please help clarify what's going on and what my next steps should be.",
