            "answer": "HI Steve,Congratulations on your weight loss, that is excellent.In terms of the diet coke, it will likely not affect your blood sugars terribly(for most patients , it does not), but just keep an eye on your levels. My problem with sodas, diet or not, is that they have no nutritional value whatsoever. If you like your diet coke now and then, and your blood sugars are not affected, I see no problem with that right now, based on data that we have. But I would encourage you to drink plain old water as much as you can. It may not be as fun , but it is alot better for you :-)Take care and keep up the great work.",
