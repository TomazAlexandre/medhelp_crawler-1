            "answer": "A couple questions come to mind, first of all why didn't your friend post here himself?Second, when you say the readings were over 250, what readings? Was this a lab test or a test on a home meter? Was he diagnosed as diabetic by his doctor? And if so the doctor should have told him what Type he was in addition to prescribing the correct treatment. There are a lot more immediate things to figure out such as what changes he is to make to diet and exercise and what medication he is to take and how often he is to test. Those things are more immediate than your other questions. At that age, Type 1 is more likely, but if he is significantly overweight than Type 2 is possible. It is odd he has no other symptoms.But as for those questions: Some meds do affect sexuality. He should ask his doctor about that. There are no \"precautions\" to take in order to have children. And yes, diabetes can be genetically passed on to the next generation. Again, all things to discuss at his next doctor's appointment. It would be a good idea to make a list of questions.",
