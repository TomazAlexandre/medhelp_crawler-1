            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since you have diabetes you should rule out the possibility of it being a clot in the deep vein or deep vein thrombosis or inflammation of a vein. Colored dopplar studies would be a way to diagnose these.The other possibility is a peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes. Please discuss this with your diabetes specialist.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
