            "answer": "Hi, has diabetes and hypothyroidism been ruled out? Improper nutrition due to Gastroparesis and anemia can cause the tremor and weakness described. Similarly lack of sleep can also aggravate your symptoms. In addition to any medications you are taking try to combat your symptoms with good lifestyle measures. In short if you eat a well balanced diet, sleep well and exercise moderately and lead a stress free life then you will be successful in preventing some symptoms. Take care.",

    "question": "I\u2019m a 29 year old male and over the past years I have suffered from a number of problems. First I have idiopathic Gastroparesis (diagnosed after I insisted on a stomach emptying study from my Gastro doctor) and Beta Thallasemia causing anemia (blood tests showed low low MCV 69 fl and how MCH 23 pg with high hemoglobin A2).Also I have other odd symptoms:-Dry mouth, dry eyes, dry nose (rheumatological problem?)-Fatigue in the morning lasting till about 5pm, when I get more energy and cant sleep at night (insomnia until 3am)- Muscle weakness, tremor, tingling, muscle twitching, numbness in hands when sleeping-Constant headaches (mostly on the right side of head), photosensitivity,-Orthostatic Hypotension (feeling dizzy and lightheaded when I stand up)-Sinus problems (stuffy nose, or sever dryness, deviated septum, sneezing all the time, postnasal drip)- Depression and Anxiety resulting from my constant health problemsIn April I had an \u201cattack\u201d where I lost feeling on the right side of my body and was having problems speaking. I went to the hospital and they kept me over night but could find nothing wrong with me except that I had low potassium. Could have been a transient ischemic attack or migrane they said.These problems seem to get worse during the summer (it gets over 90 degrees where I live and I do not have AC), or when I have high stress. I\u2019m hoping somebody here can shine some light on these problems as they are disrupting my life (just lost my job because of them).",
