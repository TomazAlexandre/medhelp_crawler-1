    "question": "Ok ladies so had my doctors appointment today as well as my diabetes check up. Baby doctor said everything is looking good and asked me to do an ultrasound next week at 33weeks to see how baby is doing. My due date is 23rd of November when I asked if there is any chance I'll go over due to my diabetes she said yes I could go over by 10days. After I went to my diabetes appointment and from being on diet control they are putting me on insolin on Thursday. My question is when I go on insolin is there a chance I will still go over my due date or no?",
