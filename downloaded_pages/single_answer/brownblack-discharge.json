    "question": "This morning I awoke to find a very dark brown/black discharge. Today is the 19th and my period was due on the 3rd. I normally have an irregular period, so this does not worry me too much, but i am just getting over a yeast infection. Every since I was diagnosed with Diabetes type 1, my period was regular. It is a possiblity that I am pregnant. i have a constant heavy feeling in my lower abdomen, also sharp pains daily. Does this sound like anything alarming? could this brown/black discharge just be my period finally coming very late, and that is why its so dark?",
