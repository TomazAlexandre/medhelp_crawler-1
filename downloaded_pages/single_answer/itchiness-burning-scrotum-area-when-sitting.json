            "answer": "Hello,Itching and burning sensation around the scrotum can be due to sweat dermatitis, chafing, fungal infections or contact dermatitis. Other possibilities are anal conditions like hemorrhoids, nerve compression or irritation, diabetes or referred pain from the surrounding organs like hip joint or pubic area.I suggest you to get an examination done from a urologist and get these conditions ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi,I get itchiness/burning feeling when I sit for a time. The burning appears to be near the scrotum area. When I want to go to the toilet (bowel movement or urination) I just feel this burning down there and after I am done with my bowel movement/urination the burning disappears. I also have aches pains in my legs and my lower/upper back, but only when I sit or stand not when I am lying down. I have the pain/ache symptoms for almost a year now and the burning in the scrotum area (after a few minutes of sitting) for 2 months.",
