            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Sedentary lifestyle, drinking less of water and acidity build up gas in stomach. So, eat healthy, drink plenty of water and take up some form of exercise.There could be many causes of gas in abdomen or lower stomach. If you have diabetes, it can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence get your blood sugar tested. It can also be due to excess consumption of food rich in sulfites like juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough. Check and see if you are eating something that is causing gas. Constipation can also cause bloating. Also if you have IBS or acidity, it can cause bloating and gas. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
