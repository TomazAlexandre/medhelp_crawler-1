            "answer": "Hi,The creatinine blood test is usually ordered along with a BUN (blood urea nitrogen) test to assess kidney function.If a patient has an underlying disease, such as diabetes, that is known to affect the kidneys, then these two tests may be used to monitor the progress of kidney dysfunction and the effectiveness of treatment.Low levels of creatinine are not common and are not usually a cause for concern. They can be seen with conditions that result in decreased muscle mass. The normal reference range for a male between 18-60 years is 0.9 - 1.3 mg/dL.The fact that you have lost weight and not built up that muscle mass is probably why the reading is low.ref:http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/creatinine/test.html",

    "question": "I was told today that my Creatinine test came back low, all my other test came back normal.i.e. cbc.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor hasn't really explained this to me as of yet and I was just wondering what this mean't.\u00a0\u00a0I have pre-diabetes and that is why he is keeping an eye on my kidneys to help prevent any unforeseen problems.\u00a0\u00a0I am not on any meds I am controlling it by diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I am doing a great job of it.\u00a0\u00a0My last A1C test was 5.4 which is great.History....I was diagnosed in 11/07, at the time I weighed 237lbs, and had a fatty liver, and such.\u00a0\u00a0Now I weigh 163 pounds, and I have everything under control.\u00a0\u00a0At least I thought.\u00a0\u00a0When I did the Urine test to check for protein in my urine the last time everything came back normal, I took a sample first thing in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0This time however, I drank a whole lot of water (about 3 bottles) before I went to the doctors.\u00a0\u00a0My urine was coming out close to clear cause I drank so much.So my question is :Does Drinking a lot of water before this kind of test effect the outcome, if so then thats why it was so low I am sure.Second:Since I have lost over 70 pounds, would this effect the outcome of the test as well?\u00a0\u00a0I do cardio a lot at the gym, and I haven't been doing any kind of weights training.\u00a0\u00a0Would the weight lose and the lack of muscle building cause low readings.Thanks",
