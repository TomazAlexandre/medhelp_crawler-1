            "answer": "Hello,The common cause for itchy throat and cough is air borne allergy. Cough is a way that the body clears particles such as allergens and secretions from the airways.Antihistaminics and bronchodilators are used in allergic cough.Your doctor is right in saying that this cough may be due to GERD. Acid from your stomach may back up into your throat. This is called acid reflux. It can cause heartburn or cough. Try raising the head of your mother\u2019s bed about four inches with blocks. It also might help to avoid eating or drinking for two hours before you lie down. To help control the stomach acid, one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them, or eat chocolate or spicy or greasy foods .You can give antacids and Prilosec for gastritis to your mother.Sometimes the cause of chronic cough can be asthma and medications like antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors).Pls check them out.I hope I have provided you with sufficient information. In case you need any more then pls post us.Take care and regards.",
