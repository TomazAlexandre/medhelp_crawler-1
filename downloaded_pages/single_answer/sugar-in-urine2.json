            "answer": "i think it can be indicator, but doesn't necessarily mean that you do have it. the tolerance test will tell you more. i was researching this last night because i had my 3 hr test today. apparently you may have glucose in your urine because during pregnancy you're kidneys work overtime and are super-efficient at filtering your blood. normally, glucose wouldn't appear in your urine, but while pregnant the kidneys may filter some of that as well. i guess it can be an indicator of the possibility of GD because if you have extra glucose floaitng around in your blood stream, your kidneys may filter it out. did you do a 1 hr glucose screen or a 3 hr? if it was a 1 hr and you fail, they'll probably send you for a 3 hr. it is possible to fail the 1 hr and pass the 3 hr. (thanks to the ladies on here for telling me that... it gave me some hope... plus, my ob confirmed it is quite possible).",
