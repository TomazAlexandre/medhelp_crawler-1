            "answer": "\"I have been taking it in the AM and breakfest\"This statement doesn't make sense. Breakfast is usually in the AM. Did you mean to say you take your Glumetza during breakfast?\"Should I be doing something different?\"That's hard to answer since you kept the following a secret:What are your doctor's instructions?Did you leave his/her's office without diabetes control documentation?What are you doing to help control your glucose levels?* Better nutrition?* No sugar?* Moderate exercise?* Are you at normal weight for your height? If not, lose the fat* When are you testing to get the above 200 readings?* How often do you test?Diabetic drugs help the patient to lower glucose but the patient (YOU) must drop all your old bad habits and practice control in order for the drug to work properly.",
