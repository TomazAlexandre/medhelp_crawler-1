            "answer": "Hi, I am a diabetic myself.\u00a0\u00a0I had hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I was pregant at the time, so I had a lot going on but since my body was making too much synthroid it affected my blood sugar readings making them go pretty high.\u00a0\u00a0I had to increase my doses.\u00a0\u00a0I did get my thyroid removed and now I am on synthroid and with my doctors help we have found the correct dose of synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0This took some trial and error.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor will only increase or decrease synthroid doses by 25% because they do not want to then put the body into hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0So, your daughter might still feel a little tired and have the same symptoms she experienced before she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism until the doctor tweaks the synthroid dose.\u00a0\u00a0When my dose of synthroid was too little I did not experience high blood sugar levels it was only when I had an overactive thryroid.I did however look on the internet to find out more about hypothyroidism and diabetes and it explains that due to the fatigue you may not want to do physical activity and will affect your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Also, hypothyroidism effects the way the body uses glucose is altered.\u00a0\u00a0When I googled hypothyroidism and diabetes there was a lot of information, just make sure you are looking a good site with sound medical information. I found www.thyroid.org very helpful.",
