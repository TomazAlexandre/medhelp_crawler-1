            "answer": "Hi there. This could be carpal tunnel syndrome due to pressure on median nerve, the nerve supplies feeling and movement to parts of hand. This is common in people doing repetitive motions of the hands and wrist. Typing on a computer keyboard, sewing, use of vibrating tools, etc. co existing conditions possible are diabetes, alcoholism, hypothyroidism, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE etc. Symptoms are numbness and tingling in thumb, palm, pain in elbow, wrist or hand and difficult fine finger movement. Certain tests would be required apart from clinical diagnosis like electromyography, nerve conduction velocity, wrist x rays. Treatment includes wearing a splint at night and day if required, hot and cold compresses, special devices like keyboards, different types of mouse, mouse pads with cushion etc would help. Medications include NSAIDS; corticosteroid injections into the carpal tunnel area may provide some relief. Hope this helps. Take care.",
