If you want to be comfortable to test at your desk, then consider talking with your coworkers about your diabetes and asking them if they mind your testing in front of them. They may even be curious about the whole process.",

    "question": "Hi, I recently started working and I am looking for a good way to test my blood sugar at lunch. You see, I work with two others in the same room and I'm afraid checking my blood sugar right there might freak them out a bit. Does anyone have any tips on how to do this more secretively? Thanks.",
