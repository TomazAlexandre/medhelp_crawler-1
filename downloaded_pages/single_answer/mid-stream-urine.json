    "question": "Hi guys i had a trip to the doctors and gave a urine sample for diabetes, UTI, bloods for prostate and urine for chlamydia and Gonorreah. I gave a mid stream urine sample first thing in the morning. The results were negative for everything, as I expected, but I realised I should have given a First Void urine sample and not a mid stream sample for the stds.. will this affect the negative results I got for the stds and should I do it again.",
