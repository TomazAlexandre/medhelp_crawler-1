            "answer": "Hello,why is insulin not an option.The insulin resistance does get much worse as the pregnancy progresses.\u00a0\u00a0The risk of high blood sugars to the baby is very serious.I don't know about the safety of chromium, but if you really want to avoid insulin (may not be possible) you should also try eating a very low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0To read up on this you could look for information from Dr. Richard Bernstein (his 2011 edition of diabetes solutions is very useful) and writings by Louis Janovich - who is an expert on diabetic pregnancy.I am 39 weeks pregnant now and have been on insulin the whole pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0At the beginning of pregnancy I needed less than 20 units of insulin a day.\u00a0\u00a0Now at the end of pregnancy I need more than 100.Insulin is not a failure.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is an excellent tool to be used appropriately.Best wishes to you and your baby.",

    "question": "I'm 24 years old, and pregnant for the first time. With insulin resistance. I'm almost 27 weeks and have managed glucose control perfectly with diet and exercise. To attain even better control though, around 20 weeks my naturopath put me on 300mcg of chromium a day to start with.Obviously glucose control gets harder during the third trimester. I've gradually increased my chromium intake over the last 7 weeks. I'm currently taking 2500mcg - 3000mcg a day now. Without it, my control isn't that the best (still not enough for insulin usage, but I'm trying to avoid insulin therapy at all costs anyways). Either way, I'm also taking 2000mg of metformin a day. The combination of the chromium and metformin has helped me attain perfect control. For myself personally, insulin is NOT an option.I've googled, but cannot find any relevant information. Can taking <3000mcg of chromium GTF a day be harmful to my child? I'd imagine uncontrolled blood sugar would outweigh the risks of \"overdoing it\" on the chromium, right?. And I'd assume a vitamin is better than adding more medication into my diet?I've also read a few studies on metformin use during pregnancy, but get a lot of conflicting information. Like I said, insulin is not an option for me, and metformin is working perfectly, so is there anything I should be worried about? Again, I'd imagine uncontrolled glucose control would = worse risks?Thanks in advance.",
