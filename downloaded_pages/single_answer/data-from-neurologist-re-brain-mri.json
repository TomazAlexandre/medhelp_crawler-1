            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Small insignificant white matter lesions can be due to multiple causes like chronic headache, smoking, alcoholism, high BP, diabetes, migraine and old age.They may not necessarily indicate MS. Have the lesions grown in number and size over recent years?Your symptoms can be due to excessive anxiety, peripheral neuropathy, stress, fatigue and sleep deprivation.The possibility of MS also cannot be denied although the chances seem to be very less as of now.",

    "question": "Their is a very strong possibility that I might have MS. I have seen two Neurologists and they stated that my Brain MRIs (2, one approx a year ago and the other in July,08) were normal. I decided to get a third opinion and consequently obtained all history reports from the other Neurologists.I was shocked to read the secondary report due to what it stated as I was not informed of this. Below is his report.DATA: She had a recently performed brain MRI with contrast. I reviewed the images. There were a couple of small, insignificant subcortical white matter lesions. There was no abnormal enhancement. The ventricular system in the right side of the brain was slightly smaller than that on the left.How can the lesions be insignificant considering I have had multiple symptoms for 3-4 years now? Numbness, tingling, vertigo, hair loss, dysphasia, etc.Thank you for your time and look forward to a reply.Susanne151",
