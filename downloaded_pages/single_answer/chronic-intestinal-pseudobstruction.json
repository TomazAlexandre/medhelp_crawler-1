            "answer": "Hi, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is a rare disorder that may be due to an underlying neuropathic disorder. Please check with your doctor to rule out diabetes. Diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy and affect the digestive system, leading to problems with digestion and elimination. Medications to promote motility may help in emptying the intestines by promoting motility. You can discuss with your treating doctor regarding the excuse note. Regards.",
