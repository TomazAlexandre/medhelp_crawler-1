            "answer": "Hi Tanja!Well, yes, if you have been a skinny person all your life and able to eat as you wish then naturally you are worried about the weight gain.Actually once depression lifts, appetite suppression also lifts. When a person is depressed he or she either eats a lot or eats very little. Either way the person is not aware of what he or she eats. This could have been with you as well. Earlier you may not be eating as much as you are eating now. This could be one reason for weight gain. Also, when you are in a happy mode the digestion and absorption is also better.You can make a conscious effort to eat healthy and exercise (as you are doing). You could also probably add walking or jogging on other days or play a sport or go for swimming. This will also help you burn calories.If you have to take the medication for long then it is best to keep a realistic expectation regarding weight. As long as your weight is within the range acceptable or ideal for your age, ethnic background, height and waist circumference, you should not worry much.If you have unexpectedly high weight gain then your doctor will need to rule out endocrine disorders such as diabetes and hypothyroidism, severe anemia etc as the cause of weight gain. Please discuss with your doctor.I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health.Good Luck and take care!",

    "question": "Dear experts,I was diagnosed with servere depression in April.This November I started treatment with trimipramin and trazodone.I know that trimipramin might cause weight gain and I tried to avoid it (it tried it with melperone, valdoxan and celexa) but no other med helped me with my severe sleeping disorder due to the depression.I am a skinny person and I'd like to stay like that. Earlier I was able to eat everything I wanted. Now I'm only able to keep my weight stable by avoiding carbohydrates in the evening.I'm working out 3 times a week in a gym.Where does the weight-thing come from?Is it due to a hidden increased food-intake the rest of the day? Or does it really slow down metabolism so that I have to reduce my calorie-intake?I would be very happy for your help, because I will have to take this med for a long time and will try to stay healthy on it.Tank you,Tanja",
