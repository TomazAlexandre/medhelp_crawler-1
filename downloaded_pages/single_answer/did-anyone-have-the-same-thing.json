    "question": "I've been looking on the net and I can't find anything about anyone who developed pre-eclampsia after giving birth like me. I also developed Hellp Syndrome (liver failure and blood clotting problems) and acute renal failure as a result. I has gestational diabetes during the pregnancy aswell. I had pre-eclampsia with my first pregnancy and had to be induced at 36 weeks. Has anyone had this happen to them or even some of it? I know I can't be the only one, I want to know if anyone who had the same thing decided to have another baby. The outcome could be bad, but I've always wanted more.........",
