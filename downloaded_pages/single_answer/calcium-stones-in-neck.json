    "question": "I have been noticing small lumps in my left neck area with pain, almost as if I was fighting sickness. My doctor ordered a CT scan and I was referred to an otolaryngologist for having calcific density in the left parapharyngeal region, which basically I heard as calcium stones.What bothers me is that in my left chest area, I've had a pain that seems to come down from the throat area, like a mesquite thorn is lodged in that area.\u00a0\u00a0For the past 2 years, I've had painful breasts and was diagnosed as having fibroidadenoma.Is this all related to one another?\u00a0\u00a0What causes this and what can I do about it?I'm pretty healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I have Type I Diabetes with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, but with no complications.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, I'm going to a million different doctors (endo, internal medicine, now an ENT).\u00a0\u00a0Shouldn't I find someone who can take care of the whole picture?\u00a0\u00a0What type of doctor?I do have an appointment with an ENT in 2 weeks, but I'm not sure what to expect, what kind of questions to ask, or if the chest area should be a concern as well.\u00a0\u00a0Any help is greatly appreciated.",
