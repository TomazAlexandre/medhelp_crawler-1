            "answer": "This is a somewhat confusing question. The title Gardnerella suggests you have been reading old, outdated information. Gardnerella is just one of many bacteria that overgrow in the vagina of women with bacterial vaginosis.BV is associated with similar risks as STDs, but it's not really clear whether it is sexually acquired. Your BV may have nothing to do with your recent sexual exposure, and certainly is unrelated to his diabetes.PID is more common in women with PID, but BV itself probably doesn't cause PID. The vaginal sex was condom protected, and PID isn't known to be acquired from oral sex exposures. Some PID is not sexually acquired at all.",
