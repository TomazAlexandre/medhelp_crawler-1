            "answer": "Tell your mother to think about all the money she has saved up all these years by not taking Alexander the Great to the vet.\u00a0\u00a0And now that saved up money would be very wisely spent by taking Alex to the vet now when he needs it the most!\u00a0\u00a0At 15 years years of age Alex is a senior citizen, but I have many feline patients who live well into their late teens and early twenties.\u00a0\u00a0Alex needs a complete blood profile and a urinalysis at the very least.\u00a0\u00a0Your mother may be right in that it could be kidney disease, however other causes for increased drinking are diabetes, urinary tract infections, hyperthyroid and infectious or inflammatory causes.\u00a0\u00a0All of these illness can be addressed medically and although we may not be able to cure all of them, we may be able to extend Alex's lifespan and increase his quality of life with the proper medical therapy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If Alex does have kidney disease he could be placed on a kidney prescription diet, receive fluid therapy, and some new medications that could help halt the progression of the disease.\u00a0\u00a0There are also holistic therapies that could be very beneficial.\u00a0\u00a0However, Alex's problem could be something totally different such as hyperthyroid which can easily be controlled with medications or Iodine 131 radiotherapy.",

    "question": "My mother has a cat, Alexander (the Great!), who is roughly 15 years old now.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, Mom has always held the belief that as long as the cat is an Indoor Cat, that it should never need vaccinations or vet care of any kind.\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, she's \"old school\" all right.\u00a0\u00a0;-\\Apparently Alexander is drinking a great deal more than usual, and Mom just shrugs it off as failing kidneys and says there is no point in taking him to the vet as nothing can be done for him.\u00a0\u00a0Is this true?\u00a0\u00a0I know nothing about cats, but if there is anything that will make this cat more comfortable in his last years, I would like to try to get it through Mom's head.\u00a0\u00a0If I have to, I'll take Alexander in to the vet myself.\u00a0\u00a0Other than the increased water intake, he seems very healthy - well, with the occasional fur ball thrown up!",
