    "question": "I am a 46 yo female with bileaflet MVP with moderate regurg and three stents in LAD.\u00a0\u00a0I am obviously on a multitude of medications now to try to manage the value issue and control any further buildup.\u00a0\u00a0I have NEVER had high cholesterol (my ratio has always been excellent, triglycerides have never been out of range),\u00a0\u00a0have never smoked, no high blood pressure, rarely drink (maybe 1 drink 2-3 times a year!), no diabetes but I am overweight (by about 50 lbs - 20 of that in the last year).\u00a0\u00a0I have hypothyroid - not Hashimoto's.\u00a0\u00a0Have paternal family history of CAD, bypasses, high blood pressure and strokes.\u00a0\u00a0Grandmother died as a result of episode of high blood pressure which caused succession of strokes.\u00a0\u00a0Two uncles (bypass w stroke, quad bypass), two aunts (bypass w stroke, medical mgmt of CAD and hbp)\u00a0\u00a0and my dad (CAD diagnosed in his 50s - needs bypass but won't go).I now take Sythroid, Plavix, Aspirin, Lipitor, Coreg CR, Spironolactone (originally for a hormone imbalance but now also to keep fluid off) and my dr recently added lisinopril (after I was unable to take altace).\u00a0\u00a0Between the Coreg CR and the lisinopril my bp is now averaging 85 over 55.\u00a0\u00a0As you can imagine this leaves me wrung out.\u00a0\u00a0My dr is pretty insistent on the lisinopril and has reduced coreg cr to accommodate the bp drop when lisinopril was added which was in the 71/48 range.Over the course of the last year the regurg has not progressed measurably but the size if the left atrium has.\u00a0\u00a0At least one EKG recently has noted atrial flutter.I am concerned about other health problems due to the amount of medication I may be on for an undetermined amount of time.\u00a0\u00a0I understand that I do not fit the criteria yet for a valve repair yet although I am clearly experiencingsymptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, the times my cardiologist and I have discussed the valve he keeps saying replace instead of repair.\u00a0\u00a0I understand that most can be repaired these days and don't want to miss my window of opportunity there.My questions are -Does the echo have to formally read \"severe\" before I become a candidate for repair?If it is clear the MVP is a problem and repairs are successful these days much of the time wouldn't it be more prudent to fix the valve while I am younger and in better health vs worse heart health and after years of the side effects of the medications?\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure why if they know what the problem is, that it is degenerative and a repair is possible why the repair would be delayed.\u00a0\u00a0Are bileaflet fixes less successful?",
