    "question": "Hi, my name is Brittany.\u00a0\u00a0I am seeking a second opinion in regards to my reproductive system.\u00a0\u00a0I am 23 years old and I did not start my menstrual cycle until the age of 17.\u00a0\u00a0Ever since then, they have been extremely irregular and it is not uncommon for me to go 7 or 8 months without having one.\u00a0\u00a0Right now, I am going on 8 months without having a cycle.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the nurse practitioner in my town and they ran blood tests and did an internal and external ultrasound and everything checked out fine, but from what she said, my follicles in my ovaries were immature and the lining of my uterus was extremely thin and showing no signs of having a cycle or ovulating.\u00a0\u00a0She said that although my test results were \"inconclusive\", she thinks I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0I have researched this extensively and I strongly disagree because I do not have any of the symptoms that go along with that.\u00a0\u00a0She wanted to put me on a medication for diabetes patients and I just can't do that when I strongly believe she has misdiagnosed me.\u00a0\u00a0I am looking for a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone else had any experience with this?",
