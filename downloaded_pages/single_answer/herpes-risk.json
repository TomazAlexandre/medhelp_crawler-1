            "answer": "There is no reason to assume HSV transmission has anything to do wiith any medications, and cerrtainly not with meds for cardiac disease or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0But no data are available, to my knowledge.Your plan for your partner to be tested for HSV-2 is wise.\u00a0\u00a0If he already is infected, then he is not at risk for a new infection.\u00a0\u00a0But regardless of his test result, don't worry about his medications.\u00a0\u00a0They won't have any effect on his risk of catching your infection.Good luck--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

    "question": "Is there is a higher risk of HSV-2 infection in people taking certain medications or who have certain medical conditions (other than specific immunocompromised states, such as HIV)?\u00a0\u00a0I'm an HSV-2 positive woman having mutual unprotected oral sex with a man with heart/vascular disease and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He takes medications for these conditions. We have also engaged in brief\u00a0\u00a0genital apposition and body rubbing.I use suppressive medication and have informed my partner of the risks to him of contracting herpes with intercourse, both with and without condoms. (I told him 2-3% over the course of a year.) I'm wondering if he is at higher risk because of his underlying medical conditions.He has not been tested for HSV but I may ask him to do this when we are both tested for HIV before moving on to intercourse.Thanks for the terrific forum.",
