            "answer": "I am not aware of any connection between diabetes and the likelihood of developing heat rash. Sun damage to the skin is something that gets worse over time, so it may just be that your skin is slowly getting more damaged and that this is now what happens when exposed to the rays. Just speculating here, for I am not a doctor. But I don't know of any connection to being a type 1 diabetic.",

    "question": "I have been diabetic for 12 years and have never expierenced a problem like this one. I recently started going to the tanning bed. (Yes, I know it's bad.) Shortly after tanning my brest area becomes extrelmley itchey and irritated. I figure it's heat rash. I have been tanning since I was 15 and never had this problem before. This is the first time I have went in 2 years. The rest of my body isn't affected, just the one area and I don't understand why. This only happens from the tanning bed. I can lay out in the sun and be fine. Even when I'm really hot and sweat from working out, I'm still fine. I'm not sure if this is diabetes related or not but it seems like every health issue I get is. Help!",
