            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs. Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems, including your joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart, nerves and lungs.I think you are been informed about peripheral neuropathy.Patient's with lupus usually manifest symptoms of raynaud's phenomenon, which cause tingling, numbness and bluish pale discolouration of fingers and toes.About 10% of patients may present with seizures or psychosis. One-third may test positive for abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid.Peripheral neuropathy, in its most common form, causes pain and numbness in your hands and feet. The pain typically is described as tingling or burning, while the loss of sensation often is compared to the feeling of wearing a thin stocking or glove.Auto immune diseases like lupus, alcoholism, diabetes, nutitional deficiencies can lead to peripheral neuropathy.In many cases, peripheral neuropathy symptoms improve with time, especially if it's caused by an underlying condition that can be resolved.Take care.",
