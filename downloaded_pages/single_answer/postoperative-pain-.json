            "answer": "hi,,Im so sorry your experiencing such severe pain. I have a few thoughts running through my mind about this.A post op low grade fevef is normal...like up to 100 anything above that usually means infection...thus the reason you got antibiotics in hospital. they should have leagally and morally told you the truth.Your trans vaginal hysterectomy means they had to create a new closure to the top of your vagina this is called a vaginal cuff. there is the possibilaty of a few thingsw regard to your pain1. Are you doing too much physically...you should be a couch potatoe for atleast 2 weeks\\2. you may have a tear in the cuff am area that as opened up,,,3. narcotic pain meds can cause very severe constipation...are your bowels moving with or with out stress? most Drs prescribe a stool softner (NO LAXATIVES) because it helps full bowel could cause pain also since lower bowels are right on top of surgical cuff now.I would strongly advise you to see your Dr ASAP like today..if he cannot see you go to the ERnerves transmit pain, heat, cold, it is why you feel pain or pressure or anything physical for example if I had no nerve endings in my hands I could not type right now.If you mean maybe your nerves are physically damaged because of the surgery I doubt it, possible yes.....my instinct tells me it is something wrong with repair(surgical cuff),,,,you may be loosing stitches too soon or you may have a opening ( dont panic) it would be small....if the whole surgical cuff was open you would be in sooooo much pain you would be in er by now and bleeding.not trying to scare you at all...I just really want to stress to you if I am right its a easy fix...dont wait another day...especially w the diabetes.Please write back and let me know how you are and what Dr said.Also are you using Heat like a heating pad...BAD for post hyster..as are tub baths.advice that will help with pain use a ice pack on 15 min off 15 min ask DR today abut stool softners and ice pack..we are educated volunters here not DRs or Nurses...I wish you all the best..get back w me ok?Cherie",

    "question": "I am trying to take my postoperative recovery from a hysterectomy in stride and not over react! However, six days after my total vaginal hysterectomy, I am now experiencing acute pain near the incision.A postop fever extended my hospital stay by one day for a total three days. There was no apparent cause for the increased temperature and quickly disappeared with the start of an oral antibiotic. The incision itself is healing nicely - a relief as a diabetic. Yet, occassionally when moving, a very sharp pain arises for a few moments adajacent to the incision.Pain medication has helped subside the general pain, but cannot adddress the intense temporary pain.I have a pre-scheduled follow up appointment with my surgeon tomorrow and, of course, will thoroughly present this pain. I'm anxious!!!Could the pain that I am experiencing be continued healing of nerve endings created from the surgery itself?",
