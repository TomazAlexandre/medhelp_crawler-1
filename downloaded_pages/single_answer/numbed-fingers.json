            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.The distribution of the numbness you describe is in the territory of the Median Nerve. The Median nerve if one of the major nerves which supplies the skin and muscles of are arm. The median nerve comes down the front of our arm and then passes through the wrist to supply the hand. You may have heard of a condition called \" Carpal Tunnel Syndrome\" , which is a compression of the median nerve as it passes through the wrist. Although the wrist is the most common site of compression, it could be higher up in the arm too.The classic symptoms are numbness in the thumb and first three fingers of the hand, but if it is very severe, it can cause weakness of the hand muscles.People with diabetes, thyroid problems, arthiritis, vitamin deficiencies are more at risk of affecting nerves.The treatment for mild carpal tunnel is just wearing a wrist splint for a while. For very severe carpal tunnel syndrome, sometimes surgery is required to relieve the nerve.You should see a neurologist. They may do an EMG and nerve conduction study, which basically looks at the function of the nerves and the muscles it supplies.This is a very common condition so you shouldn't be too scared, but should be evaluated by a doctor if it does not resolve on its own.I hope this helps. Good Luck!",

    "question": "So I woke up in the middle of the night, to find that my right index finger, thumb, and middle finger are asleep. Problem is that it wont go away. At all. It isnt the pin ***** type of asleep, its the numb type.I am 19 years old and type 1 diabetic. And im terrified. I thought that you slowly lose circulation in your limbs and that you notice it. Is this what it is? I can still FEEL with my fingers, but they are asleep. I dont have a doctor, i recently moved to vancouver.",
