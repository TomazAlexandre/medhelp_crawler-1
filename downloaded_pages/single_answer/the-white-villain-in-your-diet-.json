    "question": "Sugar: The white villain in your dietEven if you avoid most sweets, the food industry sneaks sugar in to just about everything on the shelves these days. Just take a look at your favorite whole wheat bread. Chances are, it\u2019s got high fructose corn syrup in it. (This stuff is still sugar. I think of it as sugar on steroids.)Sugar is bad news, no matter how you slice it. When it enters your blood stream, your body goes into overdrive trying to get rid of the stuff. Your pancreas releases insulin to help get rid of it. Eventually, it\u2019s converted into glucose and used up by the body as energy (or stored as fat).But when you eat lots of refined sugar (or carbs)\u2014such as a white bagel, a soda, or a bowl of cereal\u2014your body goes into overdrive. It starts releasing lots and lots of insulin to deal with the sugar. As a result, your blood sugar drops way too fast and goes way too low.By this point, you may start to feel low after your sugar \u201chigh\u201d (headaches, fatigue, etc). Plus, because your blood sugar dropped so low, so fast, you may feel cravings for more sugar. Over time, your body gets addicted.The ticking time bombSay it\u2019s your birthday and you treat yourself to a big slice of chocolate cake. But you\u2019ve already spent years honing quite a sweet tooth.When your body receives the signal to respond to the chocolate cake, the party\u2019s already over. Your pancreas has called it quits. It doesn\u2019t produce the insulin (or can\u2019t produce enough). So your blood sugar stays high\u2026and voila\u2026you have type II diabetes. But you\u2019re not alone. Today, almost 24 million Americans have got it.Reversing the damageThe good news is\u2026you can prevent and even reverse type II diabetes. The key is to control your sugar and carb (which turns into sugar in the body) intake.In 2003, researchers at Duke University Medical Center examined the effects of a low-carb diet on blood sugar in diabetics. They found that 95 percent of patients who followed a low-carb diet either reduced their need for insulin or discontinued it all together after 24 weeks.I recently read another study about how you can help your body cope with type II diabetes. Researchers at Harvard studied the effects of taking the mineral zinc on women between the ages 33 and 60. A trace mineral found in the body, zinc helps maintain a healthy immune system. It keeps your skin and hair glowing. And it also influences your cognitive and muscle functioning.Researchers analyzed nutritional data documenting the women\u2019s zinc intake over a 24-year period. They found that high amounts of zinc reduced a woman\u2019s likelihood of developing diabetes by up to 28 percent. This is a pretty recent study, so I\u2019m sure one with men is probably in the works. I would gamble that zinc performs equally well for men, if not better given the male metabolism.Unfortunately, the scientists could not zero in on the mechanism that caused this drop in diabetes risk. More research is needed here as well.But the data certainly makes the case for getting more zinc into your diet if you\u2019re at risk for developing type II diabetes. (Interestingly, though not surprisingly, we know that sugar uses up all the zinc stored in our tissues. So if you\u2019ve got a lot of sugar in your diet, it\u2019s not surprising that you\u2019d have low zinc stores as well. And since zinc is vital for healthy skin, it\u2019s also not surprising that a sugar junkie probably doesn\u2019t have a healthy glow.)Getting more zincYou\u2019ve got to get rid of the straight sugar in your diet. That\u2019s a no brainer. But whole grains may still work for anyone who\u2019s yet to develop full-fledged diabetes.Here\u2019s why\u2026Whole grain foods contain lots of good nutrients, like zinc. And, whole grains get metabolized much slower than refined flour products. So you\u2019re much less likely to incite an insulin invasion.Throw out all the refined flour products in your cabinet. (Refined flour products remove all the healthy nutrients, including zinc.) Keep only the real whole grain breads, crackers, pasta, and cereals. You\u2019ll have to become a serious reader of the ingredients list. Look for whole grains such as \u201cwheat\u201d as the first ingredient. And make sure the products don\u2019t contain \u201chigh-fructose corn syrup.\u201dAs a final note, you\u2019ll find zinc in any good multivitamin. But I\u2019d also recommend taking 50 to 100 additional mg of zinc per day, especially if you\u2019re concerned about your blood sugar. Go for zinc in the chelated form or as zinc picolinate. Also, zinc can deplete your stores of copper. So you\u2019ll also want to take roughly 1 milligram of copper for every 15 milligrams of zinc as a precaution.But don\u2019t get carried away. Zinc by itself is nontoxic within these limits. But one study that I know of has linked high doses of zinc over 10 years to an increased risk of prostate cancer.DR.S.",
