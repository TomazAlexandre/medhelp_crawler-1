            "answer": "Hi!To tone up your body and make it look right and dissolve the fat pads you need a combination of exercises and diet restriction. Since you have disproportionate fat distribution, you need to rule out disorders such as adrenal gland problems (Cushing\u2019s disease), hypothyroidism and diabetes. If you have any of these, you need appropriate treatment for them. Apart from it, you need to eat frequently but in small portions. It is best to eat lots of fruits and non-starchy green veggies, go slow on fats, eat carbohydrates in moderation and increase your protein intake (lean cuts, whites of eggs etc). Drink plenty of water and non fattening fluids such as clear soups etc. Look for hidden calories in salads and soups and avoid them (eg: cheese, butter, dressings etc).Diet alone will not tone up the body. For this you need exercises specific to the area of the body that has maximum fat, along with general exercises which include aerobics, stretching and strengthening exercises. You need to either join a gym or consult a physical trainer. Please consult your family doctor to rule out the above mentioned diseases first. Take care!",
