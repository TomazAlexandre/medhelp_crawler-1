    "question": "I would like to know if diet non-compliance in a diabetic can trigger episodes of A-Fib?\u00a0\u00a0My mother was diagnosed 2 years ago with A-Fib after contracting Influenza A.\u00a0\u00a0She has Type 2 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She recently has been eating a lot of things she shouldn't and last night was rushed to the ER because she thought she was having an MI, but it was her A-Fib.\u00a0\u00a0She has a positive history for HTN, Smoking, and Obesity.\u00a0\u00a0She also comsumes many cups of coffee/day.\u00a0\u00a0I believe she may also have some sleep apnea, but I am not sure.\u00a0\u00a0She certainly snores loudly.\u00a0\u00a0I realize that all of these things can trigger episodes of A-Fib, but I am curious if there is a correlation between blood glucose levels and A-Fib.I am an RN and have exhausted myself trying to discuss all of the possible problems associated with non-compliance with her.\u00a0\u00a0I think she believes because she isn't on dialysis and has all of her limbs she is doing alright.\u00a0\u00a0I would love to know if her failure to comply with the diabetic diet could be contributing to the A-Fib episodes.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
