            "answer": "Hi,How are you? It is good that your enzymes were okay and initial ct scan was done. Development of NASH may be the result of\u00a0\u00a0liver insults where , macrovesicular steatosis, inflammatory response and progression of liver damage occurs. There is no treatment for NASH but you may be able to limit damage to the liver by managing conditions that increase the risk for NASH or make it worse. Also, outlook of NASH depends on risk factors such as\u00a0\u00a0obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes. It is best that you check with your doctor\u00a0\u00a0regularly for proper evaluation and monitoring. Take care and do keep us posted.",
