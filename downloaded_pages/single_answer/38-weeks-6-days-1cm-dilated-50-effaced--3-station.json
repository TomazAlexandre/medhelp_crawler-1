    "question": "My appointment Friday I was measuring 41cm. They said at my next appointment Thursday I will be hooked up to a fetal monitor. I thought they only did that at 40 weeks?? I have gestational diabetes and baby was measuring at an estimated 7 lbs 12 oz friday. Why would they hook me up to a fetal monitor this week? And do you guys think they will set an induction date Thursday? I will probably be measuring at 42cm",
