    "question": "Hi I'm 32 weeks and my fundal height is 35cms. My doctor didn't say anything when I was at the appointment but then a friend said that this is pretty high. At my 30 week appointment I was 31cms. Should I be concerned? I don't have another doctors appointment until 34weeks. I also have gestational diabetes but all my sugar levels have been good.",
