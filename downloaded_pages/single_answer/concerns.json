    "question": "I have been trying to conceive for 2 years now. I have PCOS and on top of that I have diabetes. I have lost weight and I get a period every month. I go see my doctor next week. I'm thinking about talking to them about clomid. Should I have any concerns? I'm worried that clomid won't work. All I really want is to be able to have a baby. It's really stressing me out. Please any advice or input would be really appreciated.",
