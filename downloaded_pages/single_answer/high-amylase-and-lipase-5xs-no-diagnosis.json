            "answer": "It sounds like a typical case of cholecystitis, however pancreatitis has to be ruled out as well.These are\u00a0\u00a02 conditions where both\u00a0\u00a0Amylase and Lipase levels are elevated, however, cholecystitis affects the\u00a0\u00a0upper right quadrant.The lack of a diagnosis, should this suspicion prove to be correct, puzzles me, as it is rather common and simple to diagnose. I guess, there's always the possibility of missing what seems to be the obvious to most doctors.If your gastroenterologist is not willing to be supportive and work with you, perhaps, seeking a 2nd opinion would be the logical next step. Ask for a HIDA scan which has high sensitivity, if the ultrasound does not help in establishing a diagnosis.BTW, diabetes is a\u00a0\u00a0risk factor in both cholecystitis and pancreatitis.Best wishes,Niko",

    "question": "I also need a \u201cred herring\u201d explanation please. With Amylase and Lipase both over 5 times normal, gas, continual deep pain in upper right quadrant, fatigue and nausea, I'm at square one in getting any answers. Tests since Dec 2015: CT, Colonoscopy, Endoscopy, MRCP, Celiac blood test - all \"appear normal\". Primary Care Doc says \"Nothing more to do. Everything looks fine\". But when the Gastroenterologist gave me the \"fish theory\" it sounded like he thinks it's all a figment of my imagination. I don't smoke or drink and control diabetes with diet, exercise and minimum dose of Metformin ER. Fats are very problematic. I need some hope and direction! Any comments appreciated. It is good to hear I am not alone although I do not wish this on anyone. Does anyone have any suggestions or comments?",
