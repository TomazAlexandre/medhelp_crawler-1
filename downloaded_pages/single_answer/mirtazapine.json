            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.There are some studies that suggest that the use of antidepressant medication can increase the incidence of diabetes in people who are already at risk for the disease. I have not found much information specific to Remeron, just to antidepressants in general. I would recommend speaking with your doctor about your concerns. Have you had elevated blood glucose on you lab work? If not, but you are concerned because you have risk factors for diabetes, I would recommend asking your doctor to check your blood glucose\u00a0\u00a0with your lab work to keep on top of it. If you have had elevated blood glucose, speak with your doctor about recommended treatment. It is important to remember that you should not just stop taking an antidepressant. Your doctor is best able to help you understand the risks and side effects of any medication you are taking.I hope this helpsCathy",
