    "question": "My brother had a quadruple bypass the first week of December. They also found a hole in his heartand the doctors claim they patched that up successfully. He was also diagnosed withDiabetes 2. After 12 days he was released and was back at home. Three weeks later,he was rushed back to the hospital because he was found unconscious at home. The doctors drained 1-1/2 litresof fluid from his lungs and I was told they were conducting tests.My brother told me not to visit him in the hospital because he knows there is conflict between thesister-in-law and myself. Well, in point of fact, she's jealous of me and appears to hate me. She has mental issues.Anyway, that's besides the point. I am not able to get any information about what's going on. She emphatically told me not to call my brother. The nursing station won't give me info on the phone.can someone tell me what could cause the lungs to fill up with fluid and why he's still in the hospital7 days later. This is very difficult for me since he is my only remaining family member aside from mydaughter. Jan. 27/12",
