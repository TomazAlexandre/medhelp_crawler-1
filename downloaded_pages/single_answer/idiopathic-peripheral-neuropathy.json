    "question": "i'm 27 years old, and for 2-1/2 weeks, my feet have been 'asleep'.\u00a0\u00a0it started a bout 2 weeks ago, with just my feet. and afte a few days, i noticed that my lowers legs felt 'numb' to the touch, *** well as my buttocks and groin areas.i went to the ER and i was diagnosed with PN. there were no tests performed, only questions asked. i was prescribed\u00a0\u00a0an anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxers, and was told i'd feel better in a week. well, i didn't, and i have 2 small children, so i can't take muscle relaxers 2 times a day! i don't feel any difference at all. i went to a chiropractor. i feel no difference. i've even done accupuncture, and all i got from that is a pain in my back, literally, from the needles.should i seek a second opinion from a different doctor? there is no evident cause for this. i'm starting to worry.",
