            "answer": "Hi. I'm a personal trainer & I also suffer from thoracic spine herniations & compression fractures. Have you tried light exercising & stretching? Stretching can be especially beneficial for tight muscles & remove the build up of toxins in your body. Exercise will also release your body's 'feel good hormones' such as endorphins, serotonin, & dopamine.You could also try massage, physical therapy, or even chiropractic, but I would definitely incorporate exercise in your daily regimen. Good luck to you & don't give up till you figure out what's going on with your body & what treatments or course of action is right for you.",
