            "answer": "Hi,Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but are often felt in hands, feet, arms, or leg. There are many causes of numbness in the leg . These include injury to the back or spinal cord, Lack of blood supply to the legs as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause tingling in the knee and legs.You can take multivitamins for some time. Please also get your blood sugar tested.My opinion is to get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.Pls keep us posted if you need any more information.Regards. Take care.",

    "question": "Ever since Thursday night, I've noticed a slight tingling in my left shinthat lasts as much as 3 seconds after standing with some weight on my leftfoot, and then lifting the foot up (like to start walking).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It itsubtle, so far, but concerns me mainly because it is not \"supposed tohappen\".\u00a0\u00a0There are periods of time when it doesn't happen.\u00a0\u00a0Also it may nothappen exactly as I described.\u00a0\u00a0For example,\u00a0\u00a0the tingling may not happenuntil the 2nd step after I start walking after having stood with some weighton the left foot.\u00a0\u00a0It is intermittent to an extent, but has been happening alot since Thursday night.There is no tingling if my leg is at rest.\u00a0\u00a0 The tingling only happens inresponse to either movement (especially after standing\u00a0\u00a0with some weight onmy left foot), or in response to tapping (such as lightly kicking my heel tothe ground)\u00a0\u00a0When it was happening today, I noticed that tapping my leftheel (either by kicking it to the ground, or be tapping it with my hand whenbarefoot can cause the tingling.\u00a0\u00a0Also flexing my knee and lightly kickingmy toe to the ground, when wearing sneakers, can cause the tingling tohappen).\u00a0\u00a0 Tapping on certain points on the shin (especially the lower partnear the foot, on the right side) with my fingers can cause the tingling tosome extent, although it is even more subtle.Note: Although I sit down a lot throughout my day (since I work on thecomputer), this isn't something that has been happening only after I've beensitting down for a while.\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes it doesn't happen immediately after Iget up after sitting down and then it starts happening several minuteslater.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it doesn't happen if standing or walking for a while too.If I walk for a while I usually don't notice it.\u00a0\u00a0It is more noticeable ifstanding and then moving the left leg.Anyway, I don't know what to make of this.\u00a0\u00a0 Can't think of anything I mighthave done to trigger this and never experienced anything like this before(except maybe when a leg falls asleep..but, when that happens that goes awayafter a few minutes of walking around).\u00a0\u00a0No other symptoms so far other thanthe tingling.\u00a0\u00a0So far it hasn't affected coordination of the leg, orsensitivity to touch, etc.\u00a0\u00a0 Any ideas what this could be?Thanks,J.",
