            "answer": "Hi,A history of back pain and the present symptoms of pain in the thigh may be caused by\u00a0\u00a0the affection of a nerve root. A herniated intervertebral disk, with or without degenerative spinal disease, is the most common cause of a root disorder. Bone changes in RA or osteoarthritis, especially in the cervical and lumbar regions, may compress isolated nerve roots. Less commonly, chronic meningitis, especially carcinomatous meningitis, produces patchy multiple root dysfunction. Epidural abscesses and tumors, spinal meningiomas, and neurofibromas may present with radicular symptoms. Diabetes mellitus can cause a painful thoracic or extremity radiculopathy. Herpes zoster infection usually causes a painful radiculopathy with a dermatomal sensory loss and characteristic rash; it may result in a motor radiculopathy with myotonal weakness and reflex loss. Please go for an MRI of brain and spine with contrast to find out the cause of nerve pathology . Please consult a neurologist for the diagnosis and management of the symptoms . Hope this helps you . Take care and regards !",
