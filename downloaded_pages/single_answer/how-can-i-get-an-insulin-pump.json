    "question": "I come from New Zealand, where there is no funding from government for pumps, and no private insurance to cover it. I am 20 years old,had diabetes for 18 years and since I got sick in my lungs a year ago, my diabetes has been crazy and seems the harder I try, the more unstable it gets.I am looking at getting a pump, but $8000 is way over my budget, I am 20 years old, and only working casually due to my instability. Do you know any people that have a pump which is not too old they are willing to sell cheaply or even give?I am quite determined, and have done alot of research. I even made a website for anyone who wants to check itout : www.pumpitup4lisa.bravehost.com.Please let me know if you have any suggestions or can point me in the right direction..I am getting pretty desperate.",
