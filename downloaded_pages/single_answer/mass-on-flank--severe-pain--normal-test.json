    "question": "In Mid-December 2014 I went to the doctor for what I though was a bladder infection. I had really bad pain on my left side toward the back and occasionally in my groin. it woke me up in the middle of the night. My urine test came back clear, but my doc found a round mass in the area of the pain. Its about where my kidney would be.I had an ultrasound and they couldn't see the mass. The tech kept looking and while you can feel the mass with your hand, it didnt show. Its underneath the skin, like inside (not a cyst or skin condition)My doctor told me to just wait it out for 3months. He said I could have been injured and it caused necrosis or something. I was NEVER injured. I've told him this, but he said its nothing.Its now the end of Feb and I'm trying to just wait it out, but its getting worse. My entire left side is in pain on most days, and I can only take so much Motrin. The pain is now extending to the front near my lower stomach. I can't lay on that side, and its really warm to the touch. Sometimes I'll have a sharp stab of pain on my left side out of the blue. Happens about 3x a week.I can't go to ER and waste money as I am getting married and we don't have much to spare.BTW: 26/ female/ diabetes & asthma.",
