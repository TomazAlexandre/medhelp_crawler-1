            "answer": "Hi, difficulty breathing is usually not related to digestive disorders, unless due to causes like hiatal hernia causing compressive symptoms. Inadequate oxygenation can produce symptoms of breathlessness, as the body tries in an effort to compensate for the decreased oxygen supply. The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause breathlessness. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance. Regards.",
