    "question": "In 2005 I was diagnosed w/ Diabetes- type-II. I learned that same year that the Veteran's Administration approved a list of diseases that frequently occur when Viet Nam era vets had exposure to Agent Orange and DM type II was on that list. My VA disability exam in 2006 was negative for peripheral neuropathy in either upper or lower extremities. By 2010 I had been diagnosed with severe bilateral CTS. Is there a greater incidence of CTS amoung DM patients? And is CTS aggravated by the general neuropathy\u00a0\u00a0due to DM?",
