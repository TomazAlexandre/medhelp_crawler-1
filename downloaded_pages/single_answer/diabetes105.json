            "answer": "Type 1 diabetes means your body no longer produces sufficient insulin and you need to take insulin to replace it. Oral meds of the type used by people with Type 2 will not suffice to control Type 1. The only exception to this is LADA/Type 1.5 may be able to do well for awhile on oral meds because their insulin production decreases more slowly. Also occasionally people with Type I are able to not use insulin or drastically reduced doses of insulin during their \"honeymoon period.\" However, sometimes Type 1's are prescribed Type II type oral meds in ADDITION to insulin to help manage their blood sugar.",
