            "answer": "Dear mrc:\u00a0\u00a0Calcifications appear normally in breast tissue.\u00a0\u00a0However, sometimes calcifications will \"cluster\" around areas of concern.\u00a0\u00a0In this case, a biopsy is needed to determine if there is a cancer \"hiding\" amongst the calcifications.\u00a0\u00a0IF this is a cancer, then treatment will depend upon her general health as well as the particulars of the tumor.\u00a0\u00a0Surgery is usually recommended and can be breast conserving (lumpectomy + radiation) or mastectomy.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, the treatment is the same as with other age groups but the preferences in an older person may be different.\u00a0\u00a0Additional treatment will, again, depend upon the extent of disease.\u00a0\u00a0The use of hormone therapy will depend upon whether her tumor is estrogen/progesterone receptor positive as well as her ability to tolerate the medication.\u00a0\u00a0Physicians are generally cautious about recommending chemotherapy in older folks....but I think we are crossing a bridge too soon in the\u00a0\u00a0process.\u00a0\u00a0Better to sort out what this is first.",

    "question": "My 81 y.o. aunt recently had an abnormal mammogram that revealed \"calcification.\"\u00a0\u00a0She is not clear as to whether that implies blood\u00a0\u00a0vessel or milk duct calcification. She has had no pregnancies. She was a smoker, but has not smoked in 25 years.\u00a0\u00a0History of high blood pressure, recent diagnosis of Parkinson's.\u00a0\u00a0No diabetes. Two of her sisters had breast cancer in their forties (one survived) and another in her 80's who died of other causes.\u00a0\u00a0She is scheduled for biopsy, I assume needle biopsy. (I have not been able to speak with her physician yet.)\u00a0\u00a0My question is, how likely is this to be cancer, and if so, what is the treatment for a woman at her age?\u00a0\u00a0Many thanks...",
