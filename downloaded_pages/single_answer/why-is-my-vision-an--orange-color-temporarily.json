    "question": "Today and a month ago upon awaking, Everything looked like it had an orange color wash on it. Tt lasted several minutes and then returned to normal color.\u00a0\u00a0White color was absent totally.I wondered if it might be blood in my eye.\u00a0\u00a0I saw my Doctor, who specializes in the retina and behind it.\u00a0\u00a0He could not find anything and had never heard of this. He suggested getting with my regular doctor and having a brain scan.I am a 60 year old Female and my A1C level is 6.2.\u00a0\u00a0It has been continuing to climb the last couple of years.\u00a0\u00a0I wondered\u00a0\u00a0if\u00a0\u00a0this or a high glucose reading in the morning could be a factor.\u00a0\u00a0 I did not think about checking my glucose at the time. I have not been diagnosed with Diabetes.Do you have any information on this?Janice",
