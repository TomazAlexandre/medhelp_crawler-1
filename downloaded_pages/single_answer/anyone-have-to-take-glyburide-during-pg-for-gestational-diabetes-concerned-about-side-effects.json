    "question": "I am currently 30 weeks PG and this is my 2nd pg with gd . My ob recently suggested glyburide 2.5 mg a day to help control some spikes in my blood sugar that I am having despite diet and exercise. I didn't have to do this with my DD. I am concerned b/c when I google it it says that it is associated with alot of weight gain. I know this sounds selfish but I hate that I am so limited in what I can eat and I would still gain weight if I took this med. With DD I didn't gain any more weight at all after DX, I actually lost weight. I felt like this was a reward for having to have such a strict diet. Now I feel that I will get the worst of both, strict diet and lots of weight gain. Has anyone else taken glyburide during PG, if so how much weight did you gain?",
