            "answer": "Do you have any underlying disorders such as diabetes or immune deficiencies?Those are two of the biggest reasons for wounds not to heal quickly.I would have to suggest seeing a doctor before it does become septic. Sometimes even the best home care may not be enough.It sounds as if your sore is an abscess, and without medical care it won't heal properly...and it may continue to get worse.Lots of air is key to the healing process. Keeping your leg elevated as much as possible may help as well.If the sore has been there for a year, and the santyl isn't helping...I would suggest it's time to see the doctor.",

    "question": "I have a sore on my true ankle. It has been there for over a yr.It has redness (not bright), and a center that drains slightly. Since can't reach the wound, I have a friend that comes to help. I put santyl in the center and try to cushion as much as possible. Even orderred foam boot to wear at night. However, the location and lack of venous flow inhibits healing. Does anyone know if this thing will heal or will I have to maintain and make sure it doesn't get septic. Any ideas are greatly appreciated.",
