            "answer": "Do you mean peripheral neuropathy?Neuropathy often results in numbness, abnormal sensations called dysesthesias and allodynias that occur either spontaneously or in reaction to external stimuli, and a characteristic form of pain, called neuropathic pain or neuralgia, that is qualitatively different from the ordinary nociceptive pain one might experience from stubbing a toe or hitting a finger with a hammer.Neuropathic pain is usually perceived as a steady burning and/or \"pins and needles\" and/or \"electric shock\" sensations. The difference is due to the fact that \"ordinary\" pain stimulates only pain nerves, while a neuropathy often results in the firing of both pain and non-pain (touch, warm, cool) sensory nerves in the same area, producing signals that the spinal cord and brain do not normally expect to receive.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0There are a lot of websites that talk about it.\u00a0\u00a0I know that people with diabetes can suffer from this as well.",
