    "question": "My son was diagnosed with type 1 seven years ago, just before he turned 13. At that time we learned that it was not hereditary. Since then we have met a family of 7, of which the 4th person in that one family was just diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. My question, although quite obvious is, if its not hereditary then how is this possible?",
