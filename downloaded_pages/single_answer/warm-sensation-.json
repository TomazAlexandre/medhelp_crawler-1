Warm sensation in the leg can be due to several causes.Alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, vitamin deficiency, herniated discs, nerve compression, certain medications, kidney or thyroid disease, Lyme\u2019s disease and any type of peripheral neuropathy can cause this symptom. In all these conditions there will be other associated symptoms which may provide a clue to the diagnosis. Seek the opinion of a local health care provider. He may refer you to a neurologist. A thorough clinical evaluation and tests like fasting blood sugar, metabolic profile, EMG or NCV may be needed. Good luck!",
