            "answer": "7-9 hours is a lot of anaesthetic. Waking time depends on many things, like how much was given and even body weight. There are up to 20 different gases which can be used in surgery. They do have stimulants they can use, and there's a very high chance he will wake up and be back to normal. With that length of anaesthesia it can take 48 hours of more for the gases to get out of the body.",
