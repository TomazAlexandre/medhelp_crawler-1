            "answer": "Considering the fact some people carrying Latent Autoimmune Diabetes are overweight or obese, weight loss can improve the sensitivity to insulin. Unlike Type 2 diabetes, however, just about all with LADA will need to eventually take insulin (whereas only between 12 and 23 percent of actual Type 2 diabetics do). Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults starts off with its treatment strongly similar to that of T2DM; within 3 to 14 years after diagnosis, however, those who have LADA will have to eventually take insulin. Latent Autoimmune Diabetes can be managed by exercise, weight loss (for some) and a proper diet.
