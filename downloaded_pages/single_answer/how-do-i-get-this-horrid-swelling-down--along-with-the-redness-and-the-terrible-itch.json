            "answer": "Hi,I think you should continue with the medication your doctor has prescribed. Are you having any other symptoms? Were any tests done?This seems to be cellulitis, though nothing can be said with surety without having a look at the lesions.You need to wash the areas several times with fresh water. Do not use any cosmetic products at the sites.Apply calamine lotion at the site of the lesions and see if it helps. You could take some oral antihistamine medications like cetrizine or loratadine. You need to maintain a good personal hygiene .Anti-itch drugs, often antihistamine, may reduce the itch during a flare up of eczema, and the reduced scratching in turn reduces damage and irritation to the skin.Treatment consists of resting the affected limb or area, cleaning the wound site if present (with debridement of dead tissue if necessary) and treatment with oral antibiotics, except in severe cases, which may require admission and intravenous (IV) therapy.Do get your blood sugar levels checked to rule out diabetes.The prognosis with uncomplicated cellulitis is good. Antibiotic regimens are effective in more than 90% of patients.Some patients may require admission for intravenous antibiotic therapy. Early discharge utilizing parenteral antibiotics on an outpatient basis has been shown to achieve cure of infection and improved patient satisfaction.The exact time frame for this cannot be specified. It would be best to reconsult with your doctor and get a review clinical examination.Prophylaxis for recurrent cellulitis may be achieved by treatment with oral penicillin or erythromycin twice daily or intramuscular benzathine penicillin monthly.It would be best to consult a doctor to find out the cause of your symptoms.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "I Feel like I have tryed every thing. This has been going on since Thankgiving weekend. I had an allergic reaction to a antibiotic so i went off of that, it was Ceftin. Then I started benadryl that helped but in 2 daays it started turning into a different kind of thing. Kinda looks like baby heat rash but much worse. I have bought everything WalMart has to offer, I went to speek with the Pharmacist. He said keep taking the benadryl for a few more days and it will clear up. It has not I finally got into my Doc's office she put me on Cipro. She said this rash I have is due to a extreme bladder infection. The swelling is so bad I cant bend my elbow completely, HOW DO I GET THE SWELLING OUT OR AT LEAST DOWN??? Every night, the last 3 have been worse no sleep, I scratch all night long. I have used so many anti itch creams, gels, sprays. Aloevera gel, Aveno bath Great Plains bentonite (just for soaking my arms right now) Later I can use it internally. I am drinking a gallon of H2o every day some times more. I live in CO. and have to run around ina tank top there is no way Clothing could be rubbing against this, The cold wash cloth is bad enough.So PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS SOMETHING I CAN BE DOING TO RELIEVE THIS SWELLING AND ITCHING, BUMPY RED SPOTS????Thanks so much for your time.This discussion is related to/posts/show/242494.",
