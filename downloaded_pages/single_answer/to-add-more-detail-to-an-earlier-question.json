    "question": "Hi I left a message earler about an eye issue regarding a cloudy film in my left eye. It is occasional and usually at night, but not always and it usually lasts for a minute to five minutes. It's a cloudy film that affects my vision and I cant see out of my eye very well during the few minutes it last. Is this any concern? Diabetes have already been ruled out.",
