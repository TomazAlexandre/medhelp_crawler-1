            "answer": "We are not pharmacists or physicians on this Forum, and so any advice I give to you is from personal experience or from reading articles on various diabetes-related topics. I did some reading and did not find that elevated glucose levels were listed as a possible side effect of this drug on any of the sites I checked. However, any drug that changes the levels of certain hormones could possibly have an effect on glucose levels, for the balance of hormones in the body has a great deal to do with the effectiveness of insulin. I would recommend that you contact your son's endocrinologist and tell him about this situation. He may have more information about Buspar and its possible effect on a diabetic patient or he may suggest an alternative drug just to see if the glucose levels change when the drug choice is changed.",

    "question": "My 16 year old son is Type 1 and also is OCD and has anxiety issues.\u00a0\u00a0He recently needed a medication adjustment and his BUSPAR was increased from 10 mg to 30 mg over a 2 week period.\u00a0\u00a0During this time his blood sugars became out of control.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't equate the two, instead I thought maybe he was hitting a growth spurt...can Buspar affect control?",
