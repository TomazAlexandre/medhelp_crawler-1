            "answer": "Hi!Blood rushing to hands and feet can be due to paresthesias or abnormal sensations due to peripheral neuropathies secondary to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme's or lupus. High blood pressure could be another cause. It is difficult to determine the cause on net. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been having to keep my hands up (not reaching down toward the ground) because it feels as if blood is rushing to my hands. (kind of like when you hang upside down and blood rushes to your head.) Sitting in my chair now, I have to prop my feet up because I'm getting the same sensation in my feet. What's going on with me?",
