            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms you suffer from could be a combination of Vit D deficiency and MS. Multiple Sclerosis should be ruled out. Your PCP is right, consult another neurologist for a second opinion. If there are areas of ischemia, then this too needs to be investigated further.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 40 yr old female with PMH of fibromyalgia. I have had a lot of strange neuro symptoms the last few months: numbness, tingling, memory loss, migraines, blurred vision, severe depression, personality changes, etc... Was referred to a neurologist. Neuro exam quoted as \"normal\". Labs and MRI brain and c-spine orderd. Phone call from nurse two weeks later: Vit D was very low at 8.2. Was started on 50,000u 3x week for that. Was told that can cause a lot of \"weird neuro stuff\". Was told MRI was \"fine\". No follow-up appt ordered. Follow up with primary physician. Saw PCP the next week. He ordered MRI images and reports from the hospital. He is very concerned about MRI results. Wants me to see another neurologist. Here is what the brain MRI showed: \"Small punctate foci of abnormal signal in the deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres- most likely minimal old small vessel ischemic changes. Were not present on previous study in 2001. Two small 5mm diameter rounded structures are noted in the right and left parotid glands and most likely represent small lymph nodes. These are unchanged from previous study.\" I am only 40, have no history of hypertension, diabetes, CAD, etc. What does all this mean and should I be concerned for anything like MS or something like that?? I am very worried and confused. HELP!!!",
