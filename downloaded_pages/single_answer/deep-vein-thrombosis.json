            "answer": "Hi!If the lymphedema is due to deep vein thrombosis, then the baby cannot get it. However, the baby can be susceptible to metabolic disorders (like diabetes) which can increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis. If the lymphedema is due to some infection then the treatment taken during pregnancy can affect the baby. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
