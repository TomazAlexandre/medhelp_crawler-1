When she is low, do you over feed her too much to bring back her sugar to a good number?\u00a0\u00a0That could be the reason for the weight gain. I know of some pumpers that just gain weight too. When fixing a low sugar and she has eaten something to help, after 15 minutes goes by recheck her sugar. That will tell you if the sugar needs more food.",
