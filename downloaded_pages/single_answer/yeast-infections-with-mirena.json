            "answer": "Hello.The Mirena IUD contains hormones for\u00a0\u00a0pregnancy protection; hence, your hormonal balance is now different than before. Because of the additional hormones and how hormonal methods thicken cervical mucus as part of how they work, women on hormonal methods may have yeast infections as one side effect. Call your physician and tell her/him what's happening. An exam and tests should tell you whether this is the case. Of course, it could be coincidental. There are many causes of yeast infections, including:Antibiotics: they're prescribed to kill bacteria to cure other infections, but they can also kill off the healthy bacteria which are needed to keep everything in balance in your belly and down south.Tight clothing, especially man-made fibers: things like tight polyester pants, pantyhose, and undergarments which aren't cotton are big causes. The vulva and vagina like to be able to \"breathe.\"Douching or feminine \"hygiene\" sprays, as well as deodorant tampons and anything that goes in or on your vulva and smells like roses: your vagina cleans itself, and gets really angry when you try and do its job for it with chemicals. Spermicides can also have this effect.Diet: high levels of simple sugars, processed foods and simple carbs can be a contributor to yeast infections. Some food allergies can also cause yeast infections.Sexual transmission: men CAN have yeast infections (their doctors may call it \"jock itch\" which can make it tough for a guy to even know he has a yeast infection), and women who are sexual partners can also transmit them between each other.Other health conditions or diseases: a common way women find out they have adult-onset Diabetes, for instance, is often due to getting chronic yeast infections. Some other conditions that can contribute include HIV, Lyme disease, and other conditions which compromise the immune system.Review the above list to see if any might apply to you; then call your physician.
