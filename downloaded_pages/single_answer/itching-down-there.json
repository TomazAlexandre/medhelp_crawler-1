            "answer": "Hi,Itching in the vagina and vulvar areas has multiple causes. Vaginal itching can also arise due to chemical irritants that may be found in detergents or soaps, douches and vaginal creams, toilet paper, bath products, feminine hygiene products, and vaginal contraceptive products. Infections like yeast, bacterial vaginosis, and Chlamydia and lichen sclerosis can be the cause of itching.Women in the menopausal transition may experience vaginal itching due to fluctuations in oestrogen levels. It is a known fact that stress and medical conditions like diabetes have a negative effect on the immune system and could possibly increase the likelihood of getting a yeast infection.Use of soothing creams, steroid creams and anti-histaminic medicines will help relieve the symptoms. Consult a gynaecologist and a dermatologist for an evaluation.The answer is based on information provided. Exact advice is not possible without a proper examination and investigations. You are requested to consult your Doctor. Take care and keep us posted.",
