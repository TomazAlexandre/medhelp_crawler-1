    "question": "My husband started seeing double one evening. For no apparent reason, just started feeling dizzy and then started seeing double. He doesn't see double from every angle. For instance if he looks out from the top of his eye or bottom of his eyes he can see normally. Otherwise he sees double, with one of the pictures slightly slanted. Diabetes has been ruled out by going to a MD. He then went to an ophthamologist and told him that he would have to wait 3 months to see if it got better. Since he cannot work waiting for 3 months is not an option. He is scheduled to get an MRI but has been told that he has 4th nerve palsy. We are wondering what is and how did he get it? Is there something we can do to prevent this. What can he do to be functional during the healing process. He is 58 years old and otherwise in good physical condition (he's a runner). Takes no medication and has no other symptoms.Thanks for your time.",
