            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!There are a few possibilities that you must look into\u2014diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vitamin B or C deficiency and anemia. Gastric bypass surgery is known to cause several nutritional deficiencies if you do not monitor your diet properly. Please consult a nutrition specialist regarding the diet you should follow. Try some multivitamin supplements and get your self investigated for the above enumerated possibilities.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Discuss this with your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
