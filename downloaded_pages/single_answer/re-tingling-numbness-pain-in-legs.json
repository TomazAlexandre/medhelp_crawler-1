            "answer": "Hi!An abscess on the bikini line cannot cause pain, numbness and tingling in legs. If you have an abscess at the bikini line, then depending on how big it is and in which stage, it can be treated with hot fomentation, antibiotics and anti-inflammatories. This will then discharge on its own. Otherwise it will need an incision and drainage.Pain, numbness and tingling in lower legs can be due to compression of the spinal nerves in the lumbo-sacral spine region. This can happen due to overuse of the lower back as in work requiring too much of bending, lifting weight, fall on the back, overweight, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. Poor posture while sleeping, sitting on computers or jobs for a long time, uneven bed, exposure of back to cold air while sleeping can cause a discomfort for a few days.\u00a0\u00a0Take a multivitamin, plenty of fluids, and an OTC analgesic. Apply a local analgesic and apply a heating pad and see if it helps. If this does not help, consult a neurologist. A MRI of the spine and nerve conduction studies may also be needed. The treatment is to remove the compression. You have to discuss the best treatment option with a neurologist, which can range from medication to physiotherapy to traction, lumbar belts, lumbar corsets or even surgery.The other possibility is peripheral neuropathy as seen in diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lymes, and lupus.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
