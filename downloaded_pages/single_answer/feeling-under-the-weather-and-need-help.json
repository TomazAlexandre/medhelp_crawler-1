            "answer": "Hello,Without examination,confirming a diagnosis is tough but the various possibilities for your symptoms are GERD(gastro esophageal reflux disease), gall bladder disease, pancreatic disorder,peptic disease of upper GI tract,H.Pylori infections,gastric carcinoma,CNS diseases like infections, tumors, and metabolic disturbances like diabetes and adrenal insufficiency.Eat small nutritious meals at frequent intervals instead of a heavy single meal. Exercise frequently and take your dinner atleast 2 hrs prior to bedtime. Also raise the head end of the bed by 2 blocks.Pls not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them, or eat chocolate or spicy or greasy foods. Take some OTC antacid like Mylanta.You can also take zantac(ranitidine)or prilosec(omeprazole).These might help.If the symptoms persist then upper GI endoscopy and ultrasound or CT abdomen may be needed to confirm a diagnosis.In that case,consultation of a physician will be the best.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.",
