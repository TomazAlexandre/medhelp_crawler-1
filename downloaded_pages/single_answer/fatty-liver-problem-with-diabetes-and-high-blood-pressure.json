            "answer": "Please keep working with your doctor. This is definitely your primary health care provider. We are not doctors here. But we do know a lot in dealing with chronic liver diseases, we are patients or friends ourselvesAnd fatty liver is definitely a curable condition, provided you take the right steps. In fact, it can be turned around in a short amount of time. Sometimes less than 6 months. So absolutely, it is something you can stay on top of with non-medical methods. But your doctor needs to be your guide in this change. We can help of course and will.A real change in diet and overall lifestyle activity level needs to happen. But this will eliminate the need for most, if not all drugs. Take care.",
