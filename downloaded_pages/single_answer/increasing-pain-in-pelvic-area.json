    "question": "I am 30 years old, with a history of melanoma and type I diabetes. My melanoma was removed last year, but I continue to get mildly-severely atypical results. 25 of them total. I also have \"explosive\" diabetes, as my doctors have put it, which is a result of gestational diabetes. I have serious complications from my diabetes. (down to 10 a1c from a 16).I have had pain now, in the very same spot (near right ovary?), for going on 7 months. Although it does occur in flashes throughout the month, it is strongest right before ovulation and right before my period. My periods have been very light for about a year (usually only a day or two) and contain mostly brown-black blood. This month the pain has been significantly worse, and it seems to really flare literally seconds before my flow begins. I did have an emergency c-section and infection 3 years ago after 3 months bed rest. My point is that I have had very serious medical complications in the last three years, and I now have a pain that is bordering severe near my right ovary. I am very scared. My gynecologist recommended a laparoscopy and then retired.I have multiple Tarlov cysts on my spine, which I read can cause abdominal pain and hip pain, and I do have severe pain in both hips...Nkygg",
