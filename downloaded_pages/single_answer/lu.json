            "answer": "Hello.Looking at the shaking hands and the numbness together, I suspect some problem 9piched nerve) at the spinal cord level. Please consult a neurologist and get an MRI of the cervical spine done.Your age also goes with a possible case of diabetes, as far as the numbness is concerned. But this is a distant possibility.Do your hands shake when you want to hold something or even when they are free ?Regards",
