    "question": "I just had my glucose tolerance test (the 3 hr one because I failed the 1st one), and I was fine during the test, towards the end I got restless and cold. But about an hour after it was all finished I have gotten very very nauseous and have a horrible headache. I feel so sick it's unbelievable!! I just want to know whether it is normal to feel really sick after to test? I have eaten, I thought that would help. Has this happened to anyone? Does it mean that I may have gestational diabetes?",
