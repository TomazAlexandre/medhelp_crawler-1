    "question": "I am 35 and I have 5 weeks left until my baby boy arrives and I have gestational diabetes and I was doing great maintaining my sugars until this last week. My doctor said that my body just isn't breaking the sugars down as good anymore so he put me on Glyburide and I will start NST's (Non stress tests) twice a week next week. Has anyone ever gone through this?",
