            "answer": "Hi there,If a person has one kidney which is functioning normally and is healthy it is compatible with life. There should not be any problem in conceiving unless you have long standing diabetes .If one kidney is removed the single normal kidney will increase in size to compensate for the loss of the donated kidney .These patients may need a follow up with kidney function tests, blood pressure etc.A healthy pregnancy is possible but is usually recommended to avoid it for at least six months after the surgery. It is best to discuss your concerns with the doctor before taking the decision of kidney donation. Keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",
