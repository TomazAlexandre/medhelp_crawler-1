I have been tested for countless diseases all with negative results yet my alt and ast continue to rise. Did the doctors find the answer to your problem?",

    "question": "Day 1 While at dinner I noticed it felt like someone kicked me in my upper stomach and I waited it out and was ok. I thought it was just a tummy ache.Day 3 I ate a piece of pretty plain but fatty roasted chicken, and an hour later I collapsed with a pain that felt like someone kicked me in the upper stomach, almost where the rib cage meets in the center. It was difficult to breathe and got worse over ten minutes until I was overcome with sweating, nausea, dizziness and disorientation. I was brought to the emergency room and the symptoms faded away over about 2 hours. All my labs were normal, EKG normal, urine normal and was sent home with a prescription for Zantac (they think it was just acid reflux).Day 4 So I ate that night and was fine with my Zantac, and the next morning after I ate the same episode happened within 30 minutes but much worse. I vomited and had a bowel movement that was normal, the pain was worse and lasted longer (2-3 hours) but continued to sit there in the background (2 on a pain scale). I was able to eat brown rice, eggs, bread and peas and carrots without issues later on.I went to my doctor on DAY 5 My AST\u00a0\u00a0level was 45 and my ALT was 60. They did an utlrasound of my liver, gallbladder, spleen and kidneys and they looked clean, so gallstones or other gallbladder issues were out. However, when the doctor first examined me on\u00a0\u00a0she pressed up on my liver and seemed to know that it would be sore, and then she stopped because she was convinced the issue was there. She ordered more blood tests and said to make another appt in a week. What?? Clearly there is something wrong here. I continued to have level 2 pain along my ribs sometimes radiating into my back and difficulty breathing at times. I ate chicken noodle soup and white bread, and yogurt.Day 6 I feel more localized pain in my bottom, front, left rib. Almost near the edge and more to the center of the torso. It feels like something is poking me there. It is dull and feels like it almost throbs. Again I have no appetite or desire to drink but I have eaten crackers. It aches where my underwire would be and even out to the back of my ribcage. 3-4 on a pain scale maybe but tolerable. And this is where I am posting, as my doctors havent even considered upper GI issues.I had an Upper GI done several years ago and there was a cloudy spot near my duodenum. I was supposed to swallow a camera but I moved and forgot. however, they hadn't made a big deal out of it so I didn't bother.I had a stomach flu (they did several blood and stool tests and could not find out what it was) that lasted 15 days. It started with intense lower abdominal cramps for 6 days and the last days my body pushed everything out that I attempted to eat. i couldn't eat the first ten days until they gave me antinausea meds.I have been losing weight since this \"flu\" about 2 months ago.I have recently increased the amount of beans in my diet as I believe I have pre-diabetes and PCOS along with diagnosed cyclical migraines and an imbalance in my inner ears. I am diagnosed with chronic cysts that burst and I had a cyst burst on my ovary the last week of december causing extreme pain, this happens every two months or so.I have a history of a malignant polyp found on my colon ten years ago followed up with clean colonoscopies every year.There are diabetes, bone cancer, thyroid cancer, and diverticulitis in my family.The symptoms I have felt the last three days:-difficulty breathing-ache in rib cage underneath breasts to the outside as well (where an underwire sits) that radiates as achy pain in the same spot on my back-followed by a constant localized achy pain in my left ribcage near the center, bottom of the ribs.-eye puffiness-a migraine that lasted nearly two weeks-light burping throughout my day even when i haven't eaten or drank anything-loss of appetite for several weeks, no desire to drink water though I usually drink 8 bottles a day-mental blocks, I have a hard time finding words lately-episodic pain following meals in upper stomach, lower rib cage 10 on a pain scale-increased levels of AST (45) and ALT (60)I think that's it! Clearly I have a lot of other issues, but I do know when something is wrong in my body. Ideas??",
