    "question": "Off and on for some time now I sense an odor which seems to me to be emitted from my chest (and not my armpits)as a gas since it can occur immediately after a cold shower in an air conditioned room and there appears to be no thing but dry skin. I will not believe this odor has anything to do with persperation. It seems to be a very sweet musty odor. I feel great but the odor is alarming because it seems very unnatural and I have never smelt it on anyone and I can not associate it with anything I have ever encountered. It almost smells like an acetate. I am almost afraid that I have some chemical imbalance or err like a rotting organ. I wonder what it is. I can smell it right now and I can[t tell if I am exhelling the odor or I am perspiring it from my pores. Where is House when you need him?",
