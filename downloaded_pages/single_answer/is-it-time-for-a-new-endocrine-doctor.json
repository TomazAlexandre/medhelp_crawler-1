            "answer": "You should have an ultrasound if you have not, and yes, you sound just like me...I have been feeling the same, all those symptoms as well as swallowing issues and hoarseness, wacky cycles, night sweats, heat/cold intolerance, and blood pressure spike that I could not control.\u00a0\u00a0My thyroid was function fine, all hormones were within normal range EXCEPT TPOab, which was positive.\u00a0\u00a0However, I had an ultrasound done, we found four nodules, long story short was in my case papillary cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Had a two surgeries, one lobe then the other, and am currently awaiting RAI treatment and feeling crappy.\u00a0\u00a0Are the outside of your eyebrows nearly bald like mine?\u00a0\u00a0I can't wait until I can have the RAI and get on some synthoid!\u00a0\u00a0You should insist on an ultrasound, it is painless, inexpensive and could shed some light on what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0Your TSH may be that your pituitary gland is trying to compensate for your lack of thyroid hormone, that is what is happening to me right now. Good luck and keep at it, you will find the answer, although you may FNA biopsies are relatively painless and very cost effective, you should suggest them both.\u00a0\u00a0I got lucky, my husband is retired military, there are plenty of residents who need the practice at Naval hospitals...infact, FNA biopsy doctor and one of my surgeons were residents.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "I am a 43 year old woman who had been complaining to her family doctor for about 2 years of uncontrolled weight gain even with limited diet and mild but constant excersize, chronic fatigue, constipated, muscle aches and pains, joint stiffness, periods getting longer, brian fog, dry hair and body hair loss on my arms and legs so much that I have not had to shave it years. I originally thought is was just due to age until it just kept getting worse over time no matter what I did. After 3 or 4 visits of 'eat less and excersize more' as the recomendation, she did a thyroid test. My TSH levels were normal however symptoms were getting worse.With that she threw up her hands and sent me to an endocrinologist. He looked at my TSH test which was taken 4 months prior and normal and decided to run tests for Diabetes and Cushings instead and did not run a new thyroid test. Both came out negative. But since I have a family history of diabetes and my sugar ran on the high side of normal (115-120) he started me on Metformin and said that will help. I asked about the pain and fatigue and other symptoms and he laughed - and actual out loud chuckle - and said 'lets just focus on this right now. See you in 3 months'. Basically ignoring all the other symptoms I was complaining about like they didn't exist.My family doctor then sent me to a Rheumotologist for the pain and fatigue becuase she was at a loss - everything she tested for was normal. Low and behold he runs a bunch of tests and finds out 2 Major things. First that I have a severe vitamin D deficiancy (14) and gives me a supplement and I tested positive for Hashimoto's. I find out that Hashimoto's basically explains ALL of what I have been going through symptom wise for so long. I finally felt verified in that the pain is real and not in my head as well as the other problems. The down side? As a Rheumotologist, he does not prescribe hormone replacement medication as it needs monitoring so he sent my test results and me back to my Endocrinologist.So - the Endocrinologist basically asks me why he ran that test. I told him he was trying to actually find out what is wrong with me. Then he tells me even though he knows about Hashimoto's, he doesn't prescribe Synthroid unless or until the TSH levels are elevated. WHAT?? When the other doctor and everything I've read about it states that a hormone medication is required for these symptoms and because is it not only an autoimmune disease of the thyroid but also the leading cause of hypothyroidism? So in other words I felt like he was not only ignoring my symptoms, but now he is actually ignoring a confirmed blood test and won't treat me for what I was diagnosed with until it actually does damage to my thyroid or causes hypothyroidism to make my TSH level go up?Is this at all normal or should I be looking for a new endocrinologist? Please help. I and so upset now and so tired of being in pain every day and eating less than 1200 calories a day to try and lose a pound a week and constantly tired. The only thing I am 'not' anymore is constipated because the Metformin he put me on keeps me in the bathroom 4-5 times a day /sigh.",
