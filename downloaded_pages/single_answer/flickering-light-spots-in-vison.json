    "question": "OK I was shoping today and while looking at something I started to get a weird vison problem. Thinking maybe its the bright colors I put it down and moved on. With in a few second I really couldn't see. I started to be confused and have a very lost feeling like I couldnt communicate with anyone. The flickering was like the little black spots you get right before you black out. You know how your hand or foot feels after its fallen asleep and starts to weak up?? That feeling is what I saw. It lasted for about 20 min. and now I more just dazed.",
