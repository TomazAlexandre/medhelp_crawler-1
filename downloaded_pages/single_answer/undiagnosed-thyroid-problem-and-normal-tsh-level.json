            "answer": "I responded to your previous post as follows.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure if you saw this reply.Don't get your hopes up too high.\u00a0\u00a0Being an Endo does not guarantee a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Many of the specialize in diabetes, not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Also many of them had the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\" and only pay attention to that, which does not work for most people.\u00a0\u00a0Also if they test beyond TSH it is usually only Free T4, and then use \"Reference Range Endocrinology\", by which they will tell you that a test result that falls anywhere within range is adequate.\u00a0\u00a0This is also wrong.A good thyroid doctor will treat a hypothyroid patient clinically by testing and adjusting Free T4 and Free T3 as needed to relieve symptoms, without being influenced by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Symptom relief should be your objective, not test results.\u00a0\u00a0You can get some good insight from the following link.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest reading the first two pages, and more if you want to get into the discussion and scientific evidence for all that is recommended.http://www.thyroiduk.org.uk/tuk/TUK_PDFs/diagnosis_and_treatment_of_hypothyroidism_issue_1.pdfNote on page 2 all the tests you should try to get done.\u00a0\u00a0You may run into resistance, but you should push for all of those.\u00a0\u00a0When you have test results, please post them here along with their reference ranges shown on the lab report and we will be happy to help interpret and advise further.",

    "question": "I am 23 and my heart rate rest at 120-130 on the daily. I had my tsh level tested due to occasional heart palpitations. My tsh is at 3.8 and considered normal, due to the range being 4.5 and up. I experience symptoms of joint pain,muscle weakness, dry skin, puffy face, dizziness, excess shedding hair, and fatigue. I can't walk long distances due to getting out of breath and knee pain. My gp did further thyroid testing and everything is normal. I feel awful and exhausted everyday. I have an appointment with the endo next week for the first time. Hopefully it goes well and not write it off as anxiety or everything is normal, when I feel anything but.",
