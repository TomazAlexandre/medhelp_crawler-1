            "answer": "Honestly, I don't see why they make such a big deal of GD. Usually it can be well controlled through diet. Can the doctor have you prick your finger to take blood sugar a few times a day instead? 2x a week for that seems silly. Maybe there is another reason why he wants you to go in more??? I would tell him you can't take that much time off, or switch. I drive 2 hours to see my midwife after another one didn't work out, due to her betraying trust by completely changing her position on an issue I had without giving me any reason as to why. I moved since the last time i was pregnant, which is why it is so far. To me, ya it is scary being so far away, but at least I am able to be confident in the care I am getting from my midwife that I had with my first 2 babies. If you feel unsettled about what the doc is doing now, it won't be any better when it comes time to having the baby. That was why I had switched back.",

    "question": "Had GD with my 2nd, pregnant with 3rd and current doctor is way more aggressive treating the condition. Which has been OK until now @ 32 weeks I need to go 2x week for stress test and ultrasounds. It will really interfear with work because Dr is opposite direction of work.My previous Dr had me come every other week until 36 weeks, I'm thinking about switching back (but he is farther away and so is hospital) but I have good relationship with him and believe he does only what's necessary to care for me & baby.Need advice",
