            "answer": "Hi Dickie,How are you feeling now?The treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy is often the major management problem and can be challenging. For mild cases, simple analgesics may suffice, as may cold water soaks and the use of support stockings for evening pain.The potential for nephrotoxicity limits the usefulness of chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and the potential for addiction (as well as the occurrence of tolerance) limits the utility of narcotics, although controlled-release oxycodone may be effective for the treatment of moderate to severe pain related to diabetic polyneuropathy.Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline, desipramine, carbamazepine (perhaps the drug of choice if the pain is lancinating or paroxysmal), gabapentin, topirimate, and mexiletine have been shown to be of value.Anticholinergic side effects associated with tricyclic antidepressants limit their utility for patients with accompanying autonomic dysfunction. These agents, as well as others, have been reviewedI think you should be consulting an endocrinologist, pain management specialist and neurologist.Neurologist would be assessing you clinically and he would do NCV test to see the motor function of the nerve.Keep me informed regarding your decision and about your consultation with consultants.Bye.",
