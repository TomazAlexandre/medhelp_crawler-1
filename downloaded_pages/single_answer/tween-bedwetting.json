It can be due to overtaking the fluids at night, urge incontinence, inappropriate bladder contractions, constipation, infection ,a stone in the bladder and use of diuretics (\"water pills\").If it is the first episode of bed wetting then he should go to bed without a full bladder. But if the repeat happens, then please get it evaluated from a urologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "My son age 11 has started wetting the bed in the past two or three weeks.\u00a0\u00a0He hasn't wet the bed at night since age 6!\u00a0\u00a0He is starting puberty also.\u00a0\u00a0He is reminded to urinate before bed and we have been limiting his water intake before bed a little.\u00a0\u00a0Wondering if this could be a warning sign of something more serious (diabetes?) or if even possibly he's having wet dreams and then urinates during or after?",
