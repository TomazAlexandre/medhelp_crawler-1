            "answer": "HI and thanks for using the forum.Since you already discussed the blood in your sputum with your doctor, it is probably exactly what he/she said-\u00a0\u00a0you can pop blood vessesl with frequent, coarse coughing.\u00a0\u00a0This would give you some tinges of blood in your sputum.\u00a0\u00a0However, if the bleeding is occuring every time you cough and is more than a few tinges of blood, I would have it checked out again.The foot ulcers were probably related to the blood clots which were probably from the torn muscle/tendons.\u00a0\u00a0 The smoking does not help the matter since it causes vascular compromise and can lead to blood clots as well.\u00a0\u00a0The quicker you \"kick the habit\" the better.I find your shortness of breath a little concerning (mostly because of your smoking history and because of your history of a blood clot) and would recommend you see your doctor and have a chest x-ray and some blood work if warranted.Good luck,Bridget",

    "question": "MY HISTORY. so about 2 years ago i tore some tendons in my ankle. shortly after i got a blood clot, and then i started getting diabetic ulcers on my ankle but i don't have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0i am 25 years old. male, 6'8\" 344lb, i started smoking about 3 and a half years ago and have been working on cutting back. trying to quit.anyways i have been coughing up blood here and there like once every few months. and its not that i'm coughing up blood so much as its mainly when i'm in the shower and i cough really hard and cough up some flint and tons of mucus about 20 seconds later i spit and theirs blood in my spit. i asked my doctor a while ago and he said its nothing to worry about i just popped a blood vesicle. is this true? is this something i need to worry about? i am the type of person where if i'm around some one who's sick i automatically think i'm sick.also i have been feeling shortness of breath off and on.. i have mainly noticed it after over eating or when i get constipated. i'm not sure if that is something i need to worry about.anyways any help on these would be greatly appreciated.btw i'm taking blood pressure meds, water pills, wellbutrin, and some other pill for blood vesicles. if you need to know the names of them i can go look at them..anyways thanks once again in advanced.",
