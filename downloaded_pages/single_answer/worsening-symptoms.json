    "question": "Hi..........I have had problems with my neck hurting for about a year and thought nothing of it really, but as of probably 3 or 4 months I have had problems with my right arm hurting, my back (upper), when I breathe and a burning sensation when i breathe through my back.(and pressure feeling)......thought it was my lungs but it comes and goes.......well lately I have hard time breathing when i walk up stairs or even just exerting myself more than usual and takes a few minutes till it goes away. My heart feels like it is gonna jump out of my chest at times also ....and other night i had a dispute and got upset and felt like my head was gonna blow off and my nose started bleeding.....so i took B/P and was 194/111 with pulse being 105...otherwise my BP runs normal to 132/80 something.......i am overweight since i quit smoking 4 years ago and i feel like I am being paranoid if I go to the Dr. for this.....so I would just like to know if this could be at all heart related..also i feel my pulse in my neck really strong..and get mild headaches lately......I am 46 and yes heart , diabetes and kidney problems run in the family..\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 would appreciate any feedback i can get........thanks ....CONCERNED",
