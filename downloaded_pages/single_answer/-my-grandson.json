            "answer": "Your grandson is weighs much more than expected for a 29 week premature infant.\u00a0\u00a0If his head circumference and length are also proportionately large and there are no other signs of anomalies, this can be a good sign.\u00a0\u00a0The most common reasons for large babies are misjudgment of the gestational age (there can be up to a 2 week margin of error unless assisted fertilization techniques were used), maternal gestational diabetes, and a family history of large babies.The fact that he is not requiring oxygen is definitely favorable.\u00a0\u00a0This may be a result of treatment of the mother with betamethasone to enhance the baby's lung maturation, or earlier lung maturation due to other causes.Weight changes in the first few days of life are really due to fluid shifts in the baby or variability in the scales that are used, not to real changes in growth or body mass.\u00a0\u00a0It usually takes between 7 - 14 days before a 29 week premature baby starts to gain real body mass.",
