            "answer": "Hi,It is possible that the bleeding could be due to a kidney stone.The blood in urine could be originating anywhere along the tract.You can identify the part of the tract affected based on when the blood a appears in the urine - beginning, throughout, or end of micturition.Since your symptoms were pain, frequency, and cloudy urine, it is possible that you still have cystitis or an infection further up the tract.Kidney tumors usually present with painless bleeding.You should just start a course of antibiotics to eliminate your symptoms. That will not be an issue with the insurance.SOme measures you can take to help cure this infection includeDrinking fluids in excess of 2000 ml per dayIncreasing intake of vitamin C-rich foods and citrus and cranberry juices.Avoiding caffeine and alcohol.Maintain hygiene.Add vitamin A supplements to your diet.Do keep us posted on your doubts and progress.regards",
