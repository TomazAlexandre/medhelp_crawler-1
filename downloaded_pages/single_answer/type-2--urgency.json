            "answer": "\"Numbers are well within range now\"What are they? Normal fasting glucose range is 60/70 to 99 mg/dl. Above 126 mg/dl is diabetes. Postprandial [2-3 hours after a meal] for diabetics is <141 mg/dl, optimum <121 mg/dl. If your numbers do not fall into these ranges your diabetes is not well controlled or managed.Frequent urination not caused by diabetes can be associated with other diseases - an infection, kidney, bladder, or prostrate issues.",

    "question": "Hi there- have type 2 diabetes and am doing well on metformin and lifestyle changes.\u00a0\u00a0 Numbers are well within range now.\u00a0\u00a0My question is - even though my diabetes is ' under control' right now- why do I still have urgency to urinate and frequency? I thought that would be controlled as long as my diabetes is controlled.\u00a0\u00a0Have not had a uti since way before diagnosis.... and last month when urgency started -\u00a0\u00a0 went for a urine test which came out clear -- they gave me cipro - which relieved it for a while- but now the urge is back.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice is welcome and thank you.",
