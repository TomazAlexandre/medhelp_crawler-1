            "answer": "Chest pains that get better with exercise and are worse at rest are rarely if ever cardiac in origin.\u00a0\u00a0One possibility is that you have variant of syndrome X, which typically causes chest pain in people that are obese, low HDL, glucose intolerant with high triglycerides.\u00a0\u00a0The mechanism is thought to from dysfunction of the \"hormones\" from the lining of the blood vessels in your heart.\u00a0\u00a0You didn't mention anything about diabetes or glucose intolerance, but the rest of picture seems to fit.If all your stress tests and EKGs are normal and with that history, it is unlikely the pain is from an obstructive lesion or blockage in the arteries in your heart but it is absolutely worth talking to a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0You clearly have risk factors.There are other mediations like fenofibrate or tricor that is used to treat high triglycerides rather than a statin, but that should be the choice of your doctors.I think your doctor is like to recommend either another stress test or a\u00a0\u00a0heart cath to make sure your symptoms aren't from blockages.I hope his helps.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for posting and good luck with the weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0It is an important and potentially life changing step for you.",

    "question": "Have had chest pains that come and go for last 2 weeks. The pains are seconds in duration and then a few days ago a light pressure in the chest. No shortness of breath or dizziness. The pains feel like a twisting of the muscle. sometime they are on the left, the right, sometimes on the breastbone. Maybe I notice them 30 times a day. Went to the ER because I was freaking out.The Dr. there did a EKG and blood work.\u00a0\u00a0The pressure subsided but the twisting / sometimes stabbing pain remains with some light pressure. Saw my GP today who repeated EKG and compared to prior years , he said there was no change and referred me to a cardiologist. I have been to the hospital 3 times in 5 years with chest pain.\u00a0\u00a0I do not notice any pain when exercising (walking 30 minutes) , in fact I feel much better afterwards, then maybe an hour later I might notice another twinge.In 2003, did a nucleotide stress test (normal),in 2004 a Ct scan for calcium scoring (calcium score of 3.9 in left anterior descending.. all others zero),in 2005 a stress echo (normal)My GP noted mild ventricular hypertrophy in March 2007 via ultrasound. Resting BP averages around 132/85I am 40 years old, weight 275, 6 feet tall, BMI of 37.2, cholesteral latest test last week, total 184, hdl 37, tris were too high to measure ldl accurately,\u00a0\u00a0and this is on 20MG of Lipitor. I am also taking a baby aspirin a day, 2 grams fish oil, synthroid for hypothyroidism, a multi vitamin.I am on a mission to lose the weight, I am a reformed smoker/snuff dipper and quit all of that two months ago after being a light to moderate user for the last 20 years.I'm just nervous that maybe me or the Dr's are missing something, what should my next steps be with my Cardiologist?",
