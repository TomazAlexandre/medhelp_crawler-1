            "answer": "Recently I asked my doctor about menstrual troubles and type 1 diabetes and was startled to find out that most girls with our type start menarche late and get menopause early! I think it has to do with the whole endocrine system being a bit up in arms because of the antibodies. I also know that there's a moderate percentage of female type 1's who also get thyroid disorders because of the same antibodies! Thyroid disorders can really affect menstruation, mood, metabolism and so on.My biggest suggestion is to talk to your diabetic specialist who can research and hopefully answer these questions for you. I'd also hope they could help you work a regime around the sudden high blood sugars your daughter can get the week before menstruation, the sudden bottoming out of the same when it actually starts (it's been my experience the last 17 years\u00a0\u00a0^_^\u00a0\u00a0). Hopefully it will go easier and better than when I had to learn about it when I was diagnosed in my early 20's.I really hope this helps! When in doubt though, please talk to your daughter's health care team! ^_^",
