            "answer": "Hi!You are probably doing more weight lifting than required. Also, the protein shake may be rich in calories. I suggest you join a physical trainer and get the right combination of aerobic, strength training and stretches for you. Also, watch what you eat. It is best to eat lots of fruits and non-starchy green veggies, go slow on fats, eat carbohydrates in moderation and increase your protein intake (lean cuts, whites of eggs etc). Drink plenty of water and non fattening fluids such as clear soups etc. Look for hidden calories in salads and soups and avoid them (eg: cheese, butter, dressings etc).If you are unable to lose weight even after this, then please consult a doctor to find out whether you suffer from thyroid disorders, diabetes, polycystic ovary etc\u2014as all these make it difficult for a woman to lose weight. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
