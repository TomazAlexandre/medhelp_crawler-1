            "answer": "Hi, it unlikely that your symptoms are due to the lab test. It could be due to Small fiber sensory neuropathy (SFSN), a disorder in which only the small sensory cutaneous nerves are affected and is often due to diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism (i.e. early or pre-diabetic state) and may progress to typical diabetic polyneuropathy. The symptoms of small fiber sensory neuropathy are primarily sensory in nature and include unusual sensations such as pins-and-needles, pricks, tingling and numbness. Some patients may experience burning pain or fullness and electric shock-like brief painful sensations. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies are done to eliminate involvement of motor and large sensory nerve fibers. Skin biopsies are used to confirm loss of cutaneous nerve innervation.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment of SFSN depends on the underlying etiology. If it is due to diabetes or pre-diabetic state, then optimal diabetic control and exercise and weight loss to reduce insulin resistance are needed. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance. Regards.",
