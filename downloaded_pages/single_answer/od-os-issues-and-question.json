            "answer": "It is widely known and documented that removing a cataract in a diabetic may cause diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy to develop or worsen. Using these guidelines most Eye MDs would recommend you wait until the cataract in your LE is causing the vision to be worse than in your RE and you are troubled by activities of daily living such as reading signs, recognizing faces and has glare problems at night.Also read my article \"Considering Cataract Surgery? Read this First\" under Today's Pulse at the bottom of this page.JCH MD",

    "question": "I have long term type 1 diabetes that over the past 15 years has been well controlled with A1C between 6.0 -6.8. I also have chronic renal insufficiency which has a strong correlation to my ocular issues. Twenty years ago I had a vitrectomy with scleral buckle OD and also a subsequent mono focal IOL placed. Now I have a slight cataract OS but it has not affected my vision as of yet. I still see 20/20 OS, and 20/40 OD with the buckle and IOL. My periphery OD is poor however. I have had PRP in both eyes for microvascularization post buckle and IOL.My question which neither ophthalmologist( a retinal specialist) and other opthamologist who has supposedly done 20,000 cataract procedures where\u00a0\u00a0I live has answered is should I have the cataract removed and an IOL placed in the left eye which is the dominant eye for vision and now sees 20/20 realizing there was PRP from 20 years ago in that eye and what are the associated risks with loss of vision since OD I only correct to 20/40 with minimal periphery? Any help would be sincerely appreciated! Mahalo.",
