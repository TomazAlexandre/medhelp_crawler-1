            "answer": "It means... you need to find a good endo - not just any endo. Your symptoms are of high cortisol but your test showed low cortisol. This is not unusual for an expert, but for a regular endo that normally treats diabetes, they will not have a clue how this works.Cortisol normally fluctuates - so if you took the test at the wrong time of the day, if you are on meds that impact cortisol (usually the free type but that can be something common like birth control pills), lab error (that happens a lot!), and all sorts of things can happen - one test just cannot swing it one way or another for a good doc but it will for a not so good one who only has 5 minutes to give you.Yes, you do have a pit tumor and maybe some other stuff going on - get to a university neuro-endo or pit center and see how they can help you. You need testing testing testing.BTW, the fibro can be from the cortisol going up and down - it happens to be very painful. Been there. I had Cushing's disease.",
