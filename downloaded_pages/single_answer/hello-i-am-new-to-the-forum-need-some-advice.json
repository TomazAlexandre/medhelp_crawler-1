            "answer": "It would be very uncommon for a woman your age to have heart disease. Is it possible, yes, but not very likely. Women of chilkd bearing age are generally protected from heart disease. What you describe does sound like anxiety issues. I understand your financial sitation, but the only way to know for sure is to see a doctor. There must be some clinics in your area that would see you and work something out, even state aid. You should see a dcotor to be sure and get some reassurance.Hope this helps, good luck!Jon",
