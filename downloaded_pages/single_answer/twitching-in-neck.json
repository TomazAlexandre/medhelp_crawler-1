    "question": "I have had two episodes of twitching in my neck.\u00a0\u00a0I have MS and diabetes, I got up one night to use the bathroom and my right hand and arm went numb and weak and then my neck started to twitching and eventually I had a seizure.. Could this be a cause of low blood sugars?\u00a0\u00a0I went to the ER and I know my blood sugar level was low, but did this cause my arm to be lifeless or was it a sympton of MS?",
