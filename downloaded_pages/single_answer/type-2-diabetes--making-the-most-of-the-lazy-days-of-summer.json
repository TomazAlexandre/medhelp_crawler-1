    "question": "Summer is in full-swing, which means that the lazy days of summer are officially upon us! Whether you're summer plans involve relaxing by the pool with a good book and cold beverage, diabetic meals, getting some sunshine at the beach, or driving the kids from one summertime event to another, here are some tips to help you make the most of these lazy days while staying healthy and energetic!Get in the Water: The summer is filled with activities that are centered around water. From water sports like sailing to simply jumping into the crystal clear pool waters you've been dying to test out, it's time to take advantage of water rather than sunbathe near it!Swimming and water aerobics provide some of the best outlets for toning your entire body using water for resistance (rather than those clunky weights at the gym). Or spend some time in the water with your kids next time they jump in the pool\u2026you'll be surprised by how toned your arms can get from tossing them into back flips!Walk that Beach: Just about everyone takes a few days to get down to the beach each summer. Next time you're at the beach, don't just watch the sand crabs; get out and enjoy the sand yourself! Walking or running with diabetes footwear\u00a0\u00a0in sand not only helps to tone your leg muscles (the softer the sand, the harder it is to walk and the more calories you'll burn), but it will ensure that you get at least a little bit of cardio in between bouts of wave watching and book reading. Be sure to apply sunscreen before you head out for a walk; just 30 minutes in the bright summer sun is enough to burn your skin and scalp.Don't Just Wait in the CarIf you're like many parents and you think that the summer has come down to a series of waiting periods while your children complete their summer activities, you're not alone. But next time your child has a soccer practice, dance lesson, or art class, don't just wait in the car; get out and exercise!Dress for the occasion in workout clothes, or simply keep some sneakers in the car if you don't have time for a full-on workout. While your child practices soccer, walk or jog around the field. If your child is taking a dance lesson, take time for yourself to run around the neighborhood where the dance studio is.With the high prices of gas these days, it's more cost effective to stay in the vicinity of the lesson rather than going home and coming back after your child's activity anyway. You'll usually have about an hour to yourself to get active and keep your weight down, or pull in other parents to work out together while you wait.Always Have a Snack On-Hand Like hand-made sugarfree chocolatesAlmond Snack It's easy to gain weight in the summer with the level of physical activity decreasing in the hot sun while the number of ice cream stands generally goes through the roof. In order to put cravings at bay, make sure to always have a healthy snack on hand for you and your family. Almonds and dried fruit are excellent, healthy choices and they last in even the hottest of cars.For more information, visit:\u00a0\u00a0http://www.*****************.com/Women-s-Diabetic-Dress-Shoes-s/43.htm",
