            "answer": "Hi there! I was diagnosed with PCOS in February... I had kinda known for some time that thats what it was. It took going to a new Ob/Gyn to FINALLY have it officially diagnosed. It was really simple actually. I have a history of ovarian cysts, not too mention a number of the physical signs associated with PCOS...these are the commonly looked for signs...*\u00a0\u00a0infrequent menstrual periods, no menstrual periods, and/or irregular bleeding* infertility (not able to get pregnant) because of not ovulating* increased hair growth on the face, chest, stomach, back, thumbs, or toes\u2014a condition called hirsutism (HER-suh-tiz-um)* ovarian cysts* acne, oily skin, or dandruff* weight gain or obesity, usually carrying extra weight around the waist* insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes* high cholesterol* high blood pressure* male-pattern baldness or thinning hair* patches of thickened and dark brown or black skin on the neck, arms, breasts, or thighs* skin tags, or tiny excess flaps of skin in the armpits or neck area* pelvic pain* anxiety or depression due to appearance and/or infertility* sleep apnea\u2014excessive snoring and times when breathing stops while asleepSo, i had a number of these. My new doctor did some blood work that they call a PCOS panel which pretty much measures you estrogen, testosterone, etc... and that was that. She called me a few days later and referred me to an Endocrinologist to treat the PCOS before we could start any further fertility treatments. The Endo. put me on Metformin, which is actually an insulin-sensitizing drug that has been known to help woman with PCOS as well. I responded really well to it and now I'm starting Clomid in the hopes of finally having a successful pregnancy!Sorry to be so long winded, I like to be thorough. I hope that helps!! : )Oh, and a lot of doctors will do an internal ultrasound to look for cysts too.. I had no need for that with my history!",
