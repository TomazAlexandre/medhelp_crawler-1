            "answer": "Hi,How is your brother? It is good that the initial diagnostic test results were fine. However, further evaluation may need to be done especially if the symptoms persist. A referral to a specialist may also be beneficial.\u00a0\u00a0The headache may\u00a0\u00a0also be caused by primary headaches such as migraine or one of its variants, hemiplegic migraine. This usually presents with normal imaging studies as well as symptoms like headache, numbness, dizziness, paralysis, visual aura and language difficulties. Hope this helps. Take care and do keep us posted.",
