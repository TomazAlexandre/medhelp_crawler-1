I do, and as long as I'm moving around or even sitting up, I'm okay, but when I do lay down or sit still a long while, my feet tend to get really cold and turn bluish in color. I don't think it's serious, unless it is correlated with diabetes. You can try drinking hot cinnamon tea before bed and see if that helps since cinnamon is good for the circulation. Just make sure it is real cinnamon.",

    "question": "I'm a 50 year old female with epilepsy, gerd, asthma, and have recently been informed my cholesterol has been increasing over the years and would be in my best interest to go on medication. Over the past year through the colon and stomach polyps were found but were told to be non cancerous. In any event within the past year 3 times was during the times I was sick however within the past couple of days a situation has occured for yeat a fourth time to which I have no explanation for. I will be ok while I'm up and about and am feeling completely at normal temperature however once I get into bed My feet are ice cold and I will shiver for quite some time. I will need double layers on till I warm up. I am only cold on my feet and upper chest area but rest of body is fine. When it occured when I was sick I figured Ok, what can you expect after all you're sick so it's likely to happen. However this time several months later I am not sick as well as it was not cold that very night. Apartment was comfortable. What could be happening? I wondered if it has a connection to epilepsy, or gerd, then maybe being doctor said cholesterol but then this specific symptom I have never heard of having occured with any of these illnesses. Has anyone ever had this situation? Could anyone help shed some light on this while I wait for my visit with my doctor? Also I have been trying to post a question in the doctors forum but have had no success in finding out how it is done. Can anyone advise me how I may go about doing so?",
