    "question": "Hello and thank you for your help. I'll try to be thorough but succinct. I'm uncircumcised and 30 years old.About 3 months ago I noticed the opening of my urethra was swollen, like a pair of lips. This was accompanied by dripping after urination and (possibly) a more regular need to urinate. I have since developed pain in the penis, it feels internal but the meatus stings as well. The pain comes and goes, lasting at a minimum for a few days up to a week+ and has done this about 5 times, currently stinging. Masturbation and intercourse inflame/start the pain when not hurting and I have stopped both almost entirely for the last month and a half.My current symptoms are a constant, dull to sharp feeling of pain and a need to urinate. All day, every day. My meatus is red and swollen. I urinate and then feel the need to sit for extended periods of time, trying to pass what I can for temporary relief. I have potentially noticed a smell coming from my head when cleaning but not noticed when urinating, no change in urine color that I have noticed either.My genital hygiene was poor before this and I have since taken to cleaning my penis regularly, pulling back the skin (which does not hurt to do or have a problem doing) and soaking it in warm water. I do not use harsh soaps or perfume/chemical soaps nor have in the past.I have looked up and found balantis, urethritis, UTI, diabetes, etc. I am open to pursuing solutions to any of the problems but wanted to consult a professional. Does it sound like a fungal infection? Bacteria? Other?What can I do to help subside the pain?\u00a0\u00a0What could be the cause? I'm having a hard time dealing with this.Thank you for all your help!",
