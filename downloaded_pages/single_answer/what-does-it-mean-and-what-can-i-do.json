    "question": "Hi,I am a Samoan, a Pacific Islander. Its been four months now living in New Zealand. I had a follow up check up with the doctor for my liver function. This would be the first time I had ever had a blood test since the day I was born. The results are as follow:GGTP: 57 IU/L (0-36)ALT: 34 IU/L (0-30)AST: 32 IU/L (0-30)ALKALINE PHOSPHATE: 67 IU/L (20-110)I am very concerned about it. What does it mean?. What can I do to make it normal? And another thing is that my mother has high blood pressure and diabetes.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/228654\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/228654</a>.",
