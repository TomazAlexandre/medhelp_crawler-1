            "answer": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0Well, that's no fun, is it?\u00a0\u00a0Sorry to hear you are sweating so much. Is this new?\u00a0\u00a0It's not from excessive heat and exertion/exercise (normal time to sweat)?\u00a0\u00a0Have you started any new medications as sweating can be a side effect of some drugs.\u00a0\u00a0When that happens, it is often your whole body that sweats instead of parts of it (underarms).\u00a0\u00a0Also whole body sweats can be part of hypothyroidism (slow thyroid) and anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0If you are close to menopause, that can do it as well as the hormones shift.If your sweating is in certain spots instead of the whole body like under arms, hands and feet, there is a condition called hyperhidrosis.\u00a0\u00a0This is known to be an 'awake' sweating as it often stops when you are asleep (unlike the others that can hit you any time).Other medical causes include heart issues, diabetes, endocarditis (inflammation of heart), obesity, and some other more serious things that they would rule out.So, in short (or long, ha ha as this was kind of long), I would schedule a physical with your primary care doctor.\u00a0\u00a0best of luck to you!!",
