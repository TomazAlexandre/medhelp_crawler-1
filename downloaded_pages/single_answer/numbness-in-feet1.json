            "answer": "Hi,The numbness caused by diabetes usually occurs after a long duration and/or very poorly controlled diabetes. It is unlikely(though not impossible) that your daughter has this without having other symptoms or a prior diagnosis of diabetes. She should certainly be examined by a doctor, if not a neurologist then her primary physician, to see if indeed her feet are without sensation ON TESTING(which is quite different from subjective feeling of them being numb). If you do have concerns for diabetes given her weight and family history, the best way is to get her bloodwork done at a doctor's visit.You can also buy a small meter at the drugstore and check it youself as well.Good luck and take care.",
