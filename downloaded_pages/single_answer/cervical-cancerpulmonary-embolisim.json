            "answer": "Sometimes with advanced cervical cancer, you will experience leg swelling, etc....it could be from the tumor. Have you had a chest xray recently? I ask because\u00a0\u00a0you said you are having\u00a0\u00a0pain/knot in right lower shoulder blade. I would definately have the dr. do a chest xray, to rule out spread to your lungs. Are they going to do anymore follow up scans to check on the cancer?I know from reading other posts by you that you have refused the conventional treatment for your cancer. That is why I was wondering if there were going to be anymore scans. With your symptoms I would think they would be doing more than just ultrasounds for DVTs and embolisms.",

    "question": "Hi, I was DX with: Advanced/Invasive squamous cervical cancer Stage 3B/IV with lymph nodes involved....not currently in organs. 42 yrs old. This is 6 mths ago. Recently I have been encountering leg edema. 1st only from knees down to feet, very swollen, this cleared in 3 days approx. 3 weeks later I get this again but this time it is really bad!! It goes all the way from my mid back around the ab down the upper leg/thighs and lower legs too tops of feet are really swollen. This was a little scarrier due to being so high I was finding it hard to breath. THe upper back and ab settled that evening but the upper legs and lower legs lasted quite a bit longer 5+days!! I was also very tired. The skin was hot in places and stung, due to stretching I guess.?? The other thing that is happening is I have a pain/knot in right lower shoulder blade. It hurts like hell when I coff or move in certain ways and if just right it will make it very hard to breath. This is since the last leg swelling incident.Now that this has cleared up, I was able to get to a walking clinic. I explained all to doc. His first thought was veinous insuf, I had done some looking online and wondered if it were secondary lymphedema>? He sent me for a vein ultrasound on legs. Crotch down to ankles. This was absolutely clear. I have no: heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure ect ect. I do not partake in chemo/radiation.My question is: Could this be a Pulmonary Embolisim of a tumor type>? Instead of a blood clot embolisim?I am 5 days into having this, the doc has me booked for a bone scan? He did do some blood tests to check for the Hyper>>>>> calcimieas ect (SP?)Help PleaseThanks Elizabeth",
