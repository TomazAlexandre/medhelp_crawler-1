            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Hair loss can be attributed to several factors like recent illness or a major surgery, hormonal problems, certain medications, infections or as part of an underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. Since hair loss may be an early sign of a disease, it is important to find the underlying cause so that it can be treated. If it persists, have this evaluated further for proper management. Your medical history, complete physical examiantion and some tests may help determine the underlying cause. With regards to your feet, soaking it in lukewarm water may help provide relief. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hi. My name is Kyndel, and I am 21 years old. For the past 3 or 4 months, I have had several things that feel wrong with me. My main concern is that my hair is falling out. When I am in the shower, it comes out in handfuls. When it is dry, it still falls out, but not as much. Just in the past month, I have been extremely tired all the time, but I'm having trouble sleeping. Even if I have a full nights sleep, I will feel so tired that my eyes will water in the middle of the day. I have to be in bright places so I won't feel so sleepy. Just in the past couple of weeks, I have had a pain that changes locations everyday. One day it will be in my knee, the next day it will be in my shoulder, or other places in my body. Sometimes it won't be there for a couple of days, but it seems to come back. Also, my feet have been hurting at night. It doesn't bother me any time other than when I'm laying down and relaxed. I'm afraid that I may have some type of disorder. Any ideas on what could be causing this?",
