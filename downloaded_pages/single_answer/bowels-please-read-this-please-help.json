            "answer": "Because of how a man's urinary tubes are formed, if his prostate is enlarged it could pinch off the tubes in a way that makes it difficult to go. So in theory, it's possible that a tumor could cause a similar issue if in the same area. So urinary problems could be connected. BUT frequency urinating can be caused by diabetes, kidney problems, infections, or just incontinence (as well as possible others). It sounds like his doctor treated him for incontinence, which is usually managed with a pill, kegels, and adult diapers.Blood in the stool can be a sign of cancer, so they usually don't mess around with it. Especially because if caught early, it's very very treatable. However, blood can also be caused from ulcers or other stresses on the colon tract -so there is no point to be too worried until you get the results. The camera they're going to put up will help them determine the cause of the blood, whether it be ulcers, polyps, or something else all together. While I have never had a colonoscopy, I imagine it's as fun as getting a pap smear. It's a pretty common procedure, so while I'm sure it's uncomfortable doctors will usually do their best to make it as painless as possible.If they do find something, I'm a little foggy on where they usually go from there. My grandma's colonoscopy showed a very ugly tumor estimated the size of an avocado (although it was actually much bigger) so she went into surgery and got a colostomy within a month of finding it. I'm pretty sure her case was abnormal though.",
