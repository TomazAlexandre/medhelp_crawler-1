            "answer": "Angina is usually far more frequent. I am wondering with your description of the pain if the cause could be a pinched/trapped nerve. The areas of pain you state are very common with disc inflammation in the vertebrae just below the neck. If you run your finger down the back of your neck, it's where the first vertebrae feels like it's sticking out more, virtually level with the collar bone. MANY arm, shoulder, arm pains originate from this area because this is where the nerves run from this area. If compressed, the nerve causes pains in the areas you mention. It might be worth considering a scan, and trying prescribed anti inflammatory medication.",

    "question": "I am a 44 year old woman who had a mitral valve repair about 1 1/2 years ago which was very successful.\u00a0\u00a0My total choleterol is 239, HDL 104 (that is not a mistake), LDL 118 and Triglycerides 61. I do not have diabetes, do not smoke and weigh about 120 pounds.I have been having very bothersome pains for the last year on and off and I am convinced that it is some type of angina.\u00a0\u00a0I get a horrible constricting feeling with deep aching in my left upper arm radiating to the left shoulder and upper left back. NO CHEST PAIN.\u00a0\u00a0It comes out of nowhere and usually happens when I am sitting at my desk, driving my car and NOT doing physical activity.\u00a0\u00a0It will last anywhere between 1-2 mintues but is absolutely scary and horrible.\u00a0\u00a0I have a dr appt coming up in Dec.Prior to my surgery I had to have a CT Angiogram done.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor never gave me the result.\u00a0\u00a0I obtained a copy and this is what it said.\u00a0\u00a0Basically the short version is I have a small area of soft plaque with minimal calcium in the proximal LAD before the first diagnol artery without stenosis.Could this small area of plaque be causing a problem with the blood flow through my heart or could it be spasms.\u00a0\u00a0COULD THIS BE A FORM OF ANGINA?\u00a0\u00a0It happens about 3-4 times a month.Please I would like someone to answer my post.\u00a0\u00a0I posted a while back and never received any replies.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate it soooo much!",
