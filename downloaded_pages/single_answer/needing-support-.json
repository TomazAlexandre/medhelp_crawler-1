    "question": "Hi,I'm new to this and have never interacted or come across many other type 1 diabetics. So, forgive me if I'm blunt. But does anyone just get really overwelhmed by this?I've been diabetic for almost six years now, and I have minor panic attack every time I think about this diagnoses and my future. I just get really scared that my kids will have it. Or I will have complications during pregnancy. Or that I will lose a body part/organ to this. I just want to know to that I'm not the only one who is scared.Sincerely,Terrified",
