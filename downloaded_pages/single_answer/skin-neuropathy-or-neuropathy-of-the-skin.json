    "question": "Ten years ago my diabetes started. I am Type 2 insulin dependant and have been suffering with peripheral neuropathy.I happened to read a post by Melinda about skin neuropathy that might be associated with diabetes. I have thesame almost identical problem. Rash, intense itching, and sores (from itching?) on my shoulders, back,upper arms,and neck. The doctor in her reply suggested consulting with a neurologist and dermatologist.I went to 5 doctors in 1 year (some teaching in their field) and got the standard answer - I don't know what it couldbe. For 35 years my livelihood was owning a large dairy farm and being a pharmacist, I worked enough to keep current.Finally I asked my primary doctor to put me on gabapentin (1200mg. qid) and I used diphenhydramine. I had to take100 mg. tid to get lasting relief. Occasionally I take some prednisone for short periods. The problem seems to be thebest it has been in 3 years.The conclusion I came to is, if you want to befuddle an MD ask him about neuropathy of the skin. For myself I willcontinue to look for a treatment. When\u00a0\u00a0diabetic patients asked me about having this problem, I thought a littlehydrocortisone and antihistamine would help. But, now that I have it wait a minute!!!Anyone have some suggestion?ps. Aquaphor seems to help alsoThis discussion is related to/posts/show/899456.",
