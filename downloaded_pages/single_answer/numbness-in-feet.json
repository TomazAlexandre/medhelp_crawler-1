    "question": "Whenever I sit or lay down for periods of time, when I get up I experience a numbness in my foot. It has a tingly feeling and feels like it is asleep. This feeling lasts for about a minute or two. Could this be a problem with poor circulation or a high blood pressure issue? High blood pressure, stroke, and heart attacks have been a factor in my family.. My blood pressure has however been kind of low lately.",
