    "question": "I just wanted to know from any of you women who have had to take Prover to bring down their periods, if after you took it and had a period did your periods continue to come normally? I was on Provera in September and i finally brought down my period after 5 months, now I'm late about 7 days for my period and I just wanted to know if anyone else who had taken Prover had experienced the same thing. Just to clarify, there was no reason why my period stopped for 5 months, everything was normal in bloodwork and ultrasound. Doc said it was my stress cause my mom ha dbreast cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the responses.",
