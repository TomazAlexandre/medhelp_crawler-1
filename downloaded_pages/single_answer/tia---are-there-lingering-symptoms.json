            "answer": "Hi, TIA or transient ischemic attack, which as the name indicates there is a temporary lack of blood flow to a particular part of the brain. This usually lasts less than 24 hours. If you are a hypertensive, diabetic and overweight, you fall in the high-risk group for TIAs. In addition, if you are a smoker, the risk increases many fold. So, therapy for TIAs is focused on controlling hypertension and diabetes and to improve blood flow to the ischemic areas plavix is indicated. If your doctors had suspected a TIA, they would have investigated further. It could also be due\u00a0\u00a0to other causes like cervical spondylosis, here the symptoms can worsen with exercise. The numbness could also be due to vitamin deficiencies.\u00a0\u00a0Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time. Regards",

    "question": "Hi, I'm a 28 year old guy and a few months ago I was playing soccer/football (as I did regularly at this time). It was quite a strenuous game which was longer and more intense than usual, but I felt fine. A short time after we stopped playing however, I was sitting down drinking some water when suddenly my vision went all blurred, almost to the extent I couldn't see. It lasted about half an hour then went away.Ever since I've had lingering dizziness, a foggy feeling and tingling/numbness in my left arm and my legs. I've gone to the doctor's surgery repeatedly with this and they keep passing it off as if it's nothing - they seem to want to blame it on an ear condition, but I really don't think that's the cause. I have an appointment with an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist scheduled but it's not for a long time.I was wondering if a TIA can cause these kinds of lingering symptoms? From what I've read, most TIAs come and go quickly and don't leave any lingering symptoms, but it seems far more plausible to me than an ear condition. It definitely seemed to be related to the strenuous exercise beforehand and the numb/tingling feeling seems to be a common thing with TIA/stroke.Thanks in advance,Gordon",
