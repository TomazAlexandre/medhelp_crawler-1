            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. The symptoms could be side effects of some medication. Other possibilities are drinking excess alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. The symptoms can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, hyper and hypothyroidism, lupus, and Lyme\u2019s. Multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonism, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, low vitamin B12 or low vitamin D, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. and certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP.A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You will need blood sugar monitoring, MRI of brain and cervical spine, T3, T4, TSH, sleep studies, serum electrolytes, brain EEG, etc to reach a diagnosis. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
