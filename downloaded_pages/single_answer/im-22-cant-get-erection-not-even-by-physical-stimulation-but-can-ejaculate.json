    "question": "Hi people or doctors. It's my first time being on a medical\u00a0\u00a0forum. I'm facing this certain problem, I am unable to get erection at all. Even when I masturbate, my penis remains limp but I can ejaculate after a minute of stroking. I am a virgin and have never made out with a girl. I just turned 22 last month but I am having this issue since 4 years. I didn't pay attention to it thinking it would get better. Everyday I feel the urge to have sex that is I get excited but can't get erect. I then masturbate with limp erection cause there is no other way of relieving my sexual tension. I also have this problem that I need to urinate more frequently. I feel thirsty but if I drink water I need to urinate frequently. Even when i get that limp erection, I feel the urge to urinate. I was thinking of trying a Viagra pill and did a bit of search on erectile dysfunction and the causes mentioned were cardiovascular problems or brain related problems or kidney failure and this got me worried all of a sudden. What could be the reason? I really hope it is not something serious related to my heart or brain or kidney. By the way, I once had checked my blood and there was no excess amount of sugar present so I don't think I have diabetes since it also can induce ED. I also have this jock itch like problem since a year. The skin on my thighs has turned black and scaly and it feels itchy. The itching increases when sweat forms down there. The black patch has spread to the anus and is present on the scrotum and half of my penis too. What could be this, jock itch? Eczema? Could these two things be related? What should I do next? See a urologist and skin expert both?",
