    "question": "Several weeks ago I went to the Dr, for pain in my right big toe, He gave me steriods and an anti inflamatory and told me to call him in 3 weeks if the pain did not get better. A week or so later my second toe the one next to my big one went numb on the side closest to the big toe. Then a few days later my baby toe on my left foot went completely numb. What would cause that? My Dr, is sending me to a specialist but did not give me a clue as what it could be. (I called him I did not go back in to see him) Should I be worried?",
