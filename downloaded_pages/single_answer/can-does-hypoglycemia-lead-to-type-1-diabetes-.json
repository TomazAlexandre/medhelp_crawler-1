    "question": "I have recently been diagnose with Hypoglycemia. I am not at risk for type 2 and therefore this topic does not concern that type of diabetes. My grandfather has type 1 diabetes. My question is, is there any evidence that having hypoglycemia can lead to or raises your chances of contracting type 1? I have no other signs of type 1, I'm only hypoglycemic The reason I'm worried is because I'm going through training to become a professional pilot and If i was to come down with type 1 they would strip me of my license no questions asked. Anybody have any experience with this? Thanks guys..",
