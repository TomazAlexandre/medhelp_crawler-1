            "answer": "Hi!Vibrations cramping etc can be due to drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in pinched spinal nerves, peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You will need blood sugar monitoring, MRI of brain and cervical/lumbar spine, T3, T4, TSH, sleep studies, serum electrolytes, brain EEG, etc to reach a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Brain pathologies are probably ruled out in your case. You need other tests. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
