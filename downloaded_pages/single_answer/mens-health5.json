            "answer": "Hi!The symptoms can be due to generalized weakness, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, low testosterone, low vitamin B 12 or vitamin D or due to peripheral neuropathy (diabetes, hypothyroidism, lupus etc) or a nerve disorder like multiple sclerosis. You will need some tests and a clinical examination. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
