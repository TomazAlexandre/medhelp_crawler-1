            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to hear about all this, and yes, this must have been a really traumatic experience. All I can suggest to help you is that you undergo a neuro-psychatric assessment to overcome the stress, anger, depression, and to find out if there is a neurological basis of your symptoms.Also it is necessary to rule out anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism. Take up activities that interest you, do deep breathing exercises, and maybe yoga to help you overcome this traumatic experience. Take care!",

    "question": "Sorry the first question wasnt enough info. I had a large menigima removed the first of March 2011. I had no previous symptoms that we were aware of. This all came as an emergency that started at work with seizures. and so on and so on. I was on lamictal for depression and that is one possible reason that the seizures did not start until it did. Lamictal is also prescirbed for depression as well as for seizures. O very long sad story is I woke up a week later after a craniotomy, spent a month on pain pills and now here we are. I am losing my job - because I am not at 100%. If you cannot go back to the job the company does not have to put you somewhere else.I am depressed - I am angry - I am bored - I am tired - I am tired.I dont sleep well because of some sort of night seizures. I can drive short distances as long as I dont have a full blown seizure. It is hard to explain. I want to work, I am tired and easily frazzseld, I just do not know anything any more. I guess I dont really have a question. I just want some-one who had something similar to relate to. I dont want this to all be in my head (so to speak) oh and my job is important to me. I need the money. I need the insurance. I need the outlet of people and normal. ok I think that is it.",
