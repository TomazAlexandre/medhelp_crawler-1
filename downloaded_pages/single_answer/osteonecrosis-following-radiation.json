            "answer": "Thank you for your post.\u00a0\u00a0I can understand your concern. You are correct; osteonecrosis is not a reported side effect of brachytherapy for prostate cancer.\u00a0\u00a0 Certainly, the use of radiation to treat cancer of any type can lead to tissue fibrosis and can result in damage to the area surrounding the tumor but I am not sure that a direct relationship between the addition of additional seeds and his osteonecrosis is evident.It is not possible for me to give a medical opinion without performing a detailed history and physical exam and reviewing his laboratory values and diagnostic images.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect, however, that there are other factors responsible for his condition.Did your husband receive any hormone therapy for his prostate cancer at any time?\u00a0\u00a0Does he have cardiovascular disease or diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Has his nutritional intake changed drastically since his treatment?\u00a0\u00a0Has he been evaluated for osteoporosis? Has he had any medical problems related to his prostate cancer treatment such as urethral stricture, inability to empty his bladder, rectal bleeding or the formation of a fistula?I would suggest that you sit down with his urologist to address your concerns with his prior treatment and an orthopedic surgeon to discuss the treatment options.All the best,AT",

    "question": "My husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the fall of 2002.\u00a0\u00a0In December of 2002 he had implanted brachytherapy seeds. 3 months later, the doctor realized he had implanted the seeds in the wrong locations and a second seed implant was done.He has recently been diagnosed with osteonecrosis of the femoral head (bilateral) and doesn't fit the profile for usual cause.\u00a0\u00a0External beam radiation is linked to osteonecrosis, but I haven't found anything linking it to brachytherapy.My question is this:Could the *double* dose of the brachytherapy cause this?",
