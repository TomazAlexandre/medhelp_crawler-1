    "question": "One week after I gave birth to my third child, I developed a headache that lasted 12 days until I finally called my doctor. I took Lortab to take the edge off, but it didn't get rid of my headache.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure had been fine,\u00a0\u00a0as I was monitoring it at home (I have a history of borderline high blood pressure).\u00a0\u00a0It had been running high a few days before they induced my labor and had admitted me to monitor it for a few hours before it went down. The day I finally called my doctor, my blood pressure was 140/105. They admitted me and put me on magnesium.\u00a0\u00a0My pressure eventually dropped to 50/20 and I fainted.\u00a0\u00a0It gradually went back up to about 140/95 and they kept me on the magnesium for a total of 30 hours.\u00a0\u00a0My headache went away after about 15 hours. They finally released me three days later with a prescription for low dose blood pressure medication and my pressures have been fine.\u00a0\u00a0Now my headache comes back off and on.\u00a0\u00a0They diagnosed me as having postpartum preeclampsia. My question is, could this really be what I had? I had no other symptoms,\u00a0\u00a0such as swelling.\u00a0\u00a0This was my third child,\u00a0\u00a0which is very rare to develop this condition. My headache includes pain on the right side of my neck. This is one of the symptoms of headache after having an epideral, which I had. I was told that probably wasn't the cause of my headache because it didn't start until one week later, though I read on a website that it can begin up to 8 days later. Also, my headache is back now.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be because I was misdiagnosed and the cause is from the epidural?",
