    "question": "I'm 20+5weeks with my forth and this has been by far the scariest pregnancy EVER! First off when pregnant I'm always a worry wart as I have never carried to term due to preeclampsia. This time not only do we have preeclampsia to worry about in the 3rd trimester but I have been diagnosed with complete placenta previa. At my 20 week ultrasound follow up my doctor expressed great concern and moved me to the high risk clinic. He made mention that he was going to consult with the perinatal team and if serious he would schedule an appointment. The office called today to let me know about appointment with perinatal team and my doctor wasn't there to explain why. Im freaking out and being stuck on bed rest I have nothing better to do than worry.\u00a0\u00a0Not to mention all of the pain, discomfort and pressure I feel. Any moms had placenta previa before?",
