    "question": "I developed mild preeclampsia in my 37th week with my son, and had to be induced. I was soooo swollen, my blood pressure was extremely high and I had protein in my urine! I am just wondering if any of you ladies have had preeclampsia in one pregnancy and went on to have one or more pregnancies without developing it again. Im so scared that Ill develop it even earlier this time, and I would like to be able to carry my baby past 37 weeks. ive been eating much healthier this pregnancy, no soda this time, and have been drinking nothing but water! I also have a 2 year old to keep up with so Im much more active than I was with my first pregnancy. Any advice or suggestions?",
