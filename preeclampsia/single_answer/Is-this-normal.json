    "question": "I have a history of graves disease with a recent total thyroidectomy (Sept 2008), IUGR and Preeclampsia with last pregnancy (delivery Aug 2007) I am 23 years old and 36 weeks and 4 days I am followed in HROB due to past pregnancy issues. I had hypothyroidism until last month due to meds finally being adjusted correctly. I had elevated risk from quad screen of having an infant with Trisomy 21, 1st ultrasound reduced risk to 1:296. I have been monitored every 4 weeks thorugh ultrasound and last ultrasound in March 2009 showed mild polyhydraminos, AFI: 26.7. the size of the baby was measuring 31 weeks 5 days (2 days off) They did not find any GI blockage. Yesterday I had my, hopefully, last ultrasound and the fluid had decreased to 20 but now the baby is measuring 1 week and 6 days off (34 and 4 days). Is this normal to be off by this much, everytime I look up anything I find Trisomy 21 somehow related, but then everything could be idiopathic, I just want to be worry free. Please help! Thanks.",
