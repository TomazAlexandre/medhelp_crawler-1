    "question": "HIIm a 24 year old mother of 1. sept. 9th of last year i gave birth to my beautiful daughter. she was premature due to preeclampsia, and i had to have a c section with which they used a spinal block. About 6 weeks later, my face started tingling. at first it was sporadic, then it was everyday sometimes all day. there was no numbness or pain, just tingling. This has lasted from last year all the way to today. currently its back to being sporadic but now (starting from about 2 weeks ago) my hands and feet are tingling. sometimes i get pain in just one finger or just one toe. sometimes i feels as if something is crawling on my legs or feet or like a stray hair is running up and down my leg. i feel burning in my hands and feet at times and sometimes itching. There is no weakness or other symptoms. i went to a neurologist who did a neurological exam in his office and told me that everything looked fine but that he would do an MRI. when the results came back he told me they did see a small lesion at the base of my brain but that it was \"unimpressive\" and we would just wait it out for 6 months, have another mri, and see if there are any new lesions. The only possibility he mentioned was MS with which he said was unlikely. does anyone else have any similar experiences? i hate waiting for months and months without knowing whats going on with my body. What other than MS could cause these symptoms?...the only other issues i have is high blood pressure and occasionally i have heart palpitations. Other than that im healthy..i eat right, workout 5 days a week and am not overweight. im on meds for blood pressure and an echo showed my heart normal. could this be related to my c-section? i find it hard to believe that these symptoms started several weeks after the surgery by just coincidence. any input would be greatly appreciated",
