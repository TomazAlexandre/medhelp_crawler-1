    "question": "Hi im 31 and I had my son in 2003 via c-section due to preeclampsia other then that normal pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last 18 months we have been trying again. (FYI we waited so long due to him going to the military) I've been pregnant 3 times all ending in miscarage at about six weeks. My doctor prescribed me (progesterone and low dose aspirin) to start taking ASAP when I become pregnant again. My progesterone was low the day before I miscarried. But I don't understand why they won't help me by running any other test to try to figure out why this is happening. They don't even see me until I call and tell them I'm bleeding,\u00a0\u00a0and it's to late by then. I would appreciate ANY advice someone could give me TIA.More information about me.....*my periods are normal 28 day cycle always*I do have extreme anxiety/stress with depression (started after birth of my son) i can't control.... it controls me!*I'm 5'2\" 145 lbs* i exercise (walk 1 mile 5X days week) eat pretty healthy 80%*no drugs/limited alcohol maybe drink once a month at most",
