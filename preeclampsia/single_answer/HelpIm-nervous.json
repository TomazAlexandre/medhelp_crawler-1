            "answer": "I had it severely with my first and was told I'd be unlucky to get it twice, but here we are again at 17wks with hypertension. My dr saw me at 6wks because I was considered high risk straight up due to last time. Why don't you see if you can get in to see your dr earlier to put your mind at ease? Mine started me on calcium and aspirin from 6wks to try to 'grow a good placenta' and prevent it and has monitored my bp closely which is how he picked it\u00a0\u00a0up this time. If it makes you feel any better, he said it is highly unlikely to present in the first trimester because you're still growing the placenta. I hope you have a better experience this time!",
