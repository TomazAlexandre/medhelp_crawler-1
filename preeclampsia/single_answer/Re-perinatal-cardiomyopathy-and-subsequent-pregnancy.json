I was three months post-partum at dx.My first echo demonstrated an ejection fraction of 35% coupled with mitraland tricuspid regurge & an O2 sat rate of 98 %( I had preeclampsia &tachycardia during pregnancy, and the baby was delivered a month earlyby emergency c-section). I was placed on 12.5 mg lopressor bid ( not carvedilol- though it is being investegated @ the teaching hospital where I am followed).My last echo in June was termed \"nl\" with an ejection fraction of 60% andcontinued regurge..My exercize tolerance has always proved to be excellent( I passed theupper levels of the stress test early on, and I have been on a progressiveexcersize & diet program ( I had gained 125 lbs due to the preeclampsia)to the point where I can now jog for 30 mins at the gym along with therest of the aerobic portion of my program ( I average 2.5 hours @ the gymthree times a wk, -\u00a0\u00a02 of which is spent on aerobics - I still have a heartrate restriction of no > 140 bpm - I wear a monitor at the gym), and allsymptoms of CHF that I originally presented with ( SOB, chest pain,passing out, lethargy)have vanished, - except for the tachycardia-resting hr is ~ 70's, - walking down a hall is ~109-116).I have occasionalrebounds after I finish sometimes where my pulse will jump up 10 or sopoints, - stay there, - and then down.Throughout the course of this illness, I have recieved differing opinionsre: recovery and the prospect of future pregnancies. The literature is notfull of outcome studies ( though I understand one is underway here inBoston) re: women who have had perinatal cardiomyopathy and attempted asecond pregnancy. Trivia: when I was initially dx'd my materials weresent from my Internist to Dr. Young's attn @ Cleveland, yet neither shenor I recieved a response despite her phone contact & letter and ourconfirmation that my materials were recieved (I had planned to travel toCleveland for evaluation, - but since we never heard anything - ? ).I continue to be treated at a major Boston teaching hospital where theopinion is that 2nd pregnancies are possible, and at the institution whereI am being followed, - it has been done.I would be interested in anyone's take on this, and anyone's experienceor ideas re: this illness.I would also appreciate any studies/journal articles that you ( whoever )could steer my way re: recovery and outcome. The 1970's African studies aretoo old.Many Thanks,Eliz-------------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Eliz,Im sorry to hear that your doctors request was not answered by Clinic.\u00a0\u00a0If you care to give me your full name and the name and address of the doctor who referred you here I will try to find out why they didnt follow-up with you.As you mentioned in your letter there are no good studies of second pregnancies in women with pregnancy induced cardiomyopathy.\u00a0\u00a0In no small part I suspect that is due to the reluctance of the women and their doctors to proceed with a second pregnancy after such a harrowing first.\u00a0\u00a0I will ask some of the doctors in the heart failure division here what the feeling is here about second pregnancies. Obviously you will have to have to weigh your decision very carefully with your family and personal physicians before walking that path.Information provided here is for general educational purposes only.
