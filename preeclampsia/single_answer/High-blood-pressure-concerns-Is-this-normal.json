    "question": "I'm 24w3d & am already on medication for high blood pressure. It has been under control for the most part thus far. Last night my husband said I felt kinda warm, but I didn't think much about it. This morning I still feel warm, have a dull headache & cramp-like pains in my lower back. I am currently out of town visiting my husband & cannot get to my regular doctor. (I did call & they said to go to the ER if it gets worse) Should I be worried enough to go to the ER or just wait it out & see if it gets better?",
