            "answer": "This is my third pregnancy. EVERYTHING changes with pregnancy. The same thing happens to me, its frustrating and can be painful. Since it sounds like you have terrible vision like me; I don't have to tell you to rest your eyes, and maybe even a warm washcloth over them. Good luck.",

    "question": "I'm about 7 weeks (as far as I know) and am experiencing vision changes. I normally wear contacts and have pretty terrible vision but I've noticed things are blurry that I previously had no issues seeing. Anybody else have this? I looked it up and everything says hormones OR .. preeclampsia! So maybe it's normal, or maybe there's something wrong.. Thanks internet:p",
