    "question": "Okay, so I have an ultrasound on Wednesday, but when my doctor checked last week (gest sac said I was 5wk 2 days) on Monday, no yolk sac or fetal pole were found. The doctor said it could be too early or I could have a blighted ovum and we would try again in a week. We also did hcg levels. Two days later when I came in for the second round of hcg, I was spotting so they did another ultrasound. This time the gest. sac said 5 weeks 5 days. Also, the first ultrasound showed a lot of fluid on my left ovary (I have been cramping on and off on that side for a week or more) and the second ultrasound showed most of the fluid was gone. There was still no yolk sac or fetal pole. The u/s tech said something about seeing echo activity (red dots...don't know what that means). They said we will wait. My hcg went from 9900 to 18000 in those two days. I know a blighted ovum can cause a woman to still feel pregnant, and I am worrying myself sick about this. I am wondering about my odds, because I have two previous miscarriages (both at the end of the first trimester...not blighted ovum) and two extremely premature babies (1 lived 3 weeks and the other 1 day--diff pregnancies) due to severe preeclampsia. Obviously, I have some issues, but I just had this \"feeling\" this time. Especially because I have endometriosis and was on b/c when I got pregnant. I am on 200mg/2x Prometrium for my low progesterone and a baby aspirin for abnormal anticardiolipin results. I cannot believe the wait it killing me so bad. I am not spotting anymore, but have read this can still be indicative of a blighted ovum as well. Any info I can get would be greatly appreciated. Oh, also I do have a tilted uterus and know it can be hard to see the bany; however, I have never had problems before with earlier u/s",
