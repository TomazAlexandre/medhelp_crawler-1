    "question": "I am 19 weeks pregnant - in the doctors office my BP measured high so they ordered a blood test and a urinalysis. Protein showed up high (286 mg). I have been measuring my BP regularly outside the doctors office and it has been totally normal (and continues to be) but the high protein is making me really nervous. Does this signal that I am developing preeclampsia? I had a very stressful week, could it just be an isolated incident? I am having a hard time feeling secure waiting until Monday to speak with a specialist.",
