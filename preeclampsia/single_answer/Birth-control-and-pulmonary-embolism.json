    "question": "First for a little history.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on oral birth control for almost 20 years.\u00a0\u00a0Specifically, I had been taking Ortho tricyclen for about 12 years.\u00a0\u00a0I had my third child this past April at age 39.\u00a0\u00a0(I got pregnant while taking the Ortho tricyclen.)\u00a0\u00a0Seven days after giving birth, I woke up with stabbing pains in my left chest and could barely breathe.\u00a0\u00a0After going to the ER and having a CAT scan, I found out I had several small blood clots (pulmonary emboli) in my left lung.\u00a0\u00a0I spent several days in ICU and had to take Lovenox shots in my abdomen for 14 days and Coumadin for four months after being discharged.\u00a0\u00a0As my physician said, the clots may have come from my uterus or from one of my calves.\u00a0\u00a0(He thought they might have come from my calf because the morning I woke up experiencing the symptoms, my left calf was swollen twice as big as my right.)\u00a0\u00a0I was scheduled to have my tubes tied after my 6-week checkup, but had to put that off due to the blood clots and the blood thinner.\u00a0\u00a0My physician said I won't be able to take hormone therapy again, even during menopause (God help my husband!).\u00a0\u00a0Today I went by the health department to pick up some foam and condoms (my physician told me I can never get pregnant again due to those complications, plus I had gestational diabetes and postpartum preeclampsia) and the nurse told me that she thought I could take a progesterone shot, such as Depo Provera or Lunelle.\u00a0\u00a0Now that I've finally gotten around to asking my question, can a woman with a history of PEs take Depo or Lunelle safely?",
