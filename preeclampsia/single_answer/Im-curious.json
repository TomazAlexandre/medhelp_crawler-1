    "question": "For the past two days now I've been experiencing an odd tingling sensation in my vaginal area. The best I know to describe it is as a \"zing\". It isn't necessarily painful, however I can definitely call it uncomfortable. When it occurs it is very short lived and I'd say it occurs maybe five or six times a day. I know it occurs at night as well, although I've only felt it once when I got up to use the restroom. I'm wondering if any others have experienced this sensation, and if you have, do you know what causes it?A little more information that may help you to help me: I'm 34+5, I've been experiencing mild cramping today minimally punctuated by a more moderate strength cramp (also short lived), I was put on bi-weekly NSTs the 8th (yesterday), and am also being tested for preeclampsia (I get\u00a0my liver enzyme results tomorrow). Thank you in advance for any advice you can give me. I'm not too worried about it - I can and plan to ask about the sensation tomorrow, however I'm curious. Perhaps one of you could give me an idea and I could ask my doctor if its a possibility. Again, thank you and God bless. :-)",
