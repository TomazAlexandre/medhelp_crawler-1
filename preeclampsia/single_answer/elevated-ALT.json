    "question": "Hi therejust wondering if you could help me, whilst i was pregnant with twis my liver ALT levels went to 368, i was told this was high and was basically being accused of drinking whilst pregnany, are they stupid - and no i didnt drink. My bile acid tests were done and they were 58. During my third trimester i expperienced very high blood pressure and remained in hospital for two weeks while they decided what was wrong with me. 13 blood tests and cultures later they decided i had that liver disease in pregnancy, except i had no itching. Once i gave birth i then developed preeclampsia - not very luck i knowwell all i wanted to know was as i do not know why my levels went so high and if i should get a retest done as my twins are now 14 weeks old and i have started to experience itching, and yes they are my true ALT levels when i was pregnant the doctors couldnt believe i had not turned yellow lol.thankssteph",
