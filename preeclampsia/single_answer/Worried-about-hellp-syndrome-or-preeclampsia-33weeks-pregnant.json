    "question": "I am currently 33weeks pregnant . I was told my blood platelet count was low and currently waiting to see a hematologist. I have sharp pain on my upper right side around my ribcage and was concerned about the hellp syndrome or preeclampsia. The pain started a few weeks ago and just keeps progressing. Not sure if I'm worried for no reason. Not sure if I should go to the Er since my next doctor appt isn't scheduled for another 3 weeks and it's impossible to reschedule with them since they're always booked. Also the hematologist doesn't have any openings until jan13.",
