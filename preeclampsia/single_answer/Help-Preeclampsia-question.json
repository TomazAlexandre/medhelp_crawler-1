    "question": "Is it possible to develops preeclampsia before 20 weeks? I'm 19 weeks and the thought never occurs to me until my mom pointed out I have all the symptoms and she had it severely and eclampsia with her last pregnancy. I've had debilitating migraines blood pressure and pulse raised by nearly 40 dizziness to the point of collapsing violent mood swings and blurred vision. Only thing I'm not sure about is protein in urine but I did have that frequently before pregnancy due to poor kidney functions. Please experiences with this or help is appreciated",
