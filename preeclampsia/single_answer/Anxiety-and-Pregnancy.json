    "question": "Hi,I am 30 years old and I already have 2 children.\u00a0\u00a0I would really like to have a 3rd child, but my anxiety is holding me back.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't suffer from anxiety until after my 2nd daughter was born.\u00a0\u00a0I have severe white coat hypertension and am absolutely terrified to go to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0This fear stems from a bad experience that I had where I was actually sent to the hospital by ambulance for a racing heart.\u00a0\u00a0Everything turned out normal and I've been to the cardiologist 3 times - he keeps telling me that my problems are not cardiac related and my heart is normal and healthy.\u00a0\u00a0But I can't get over it.\u00a0\u00a0I constantly worry that pregnancy will cause me to have a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0I also worry that the doctors will end up taking the baby early because of my white coat hypertension, thinking that I have preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I would also have to have a 3rd c-section and I worry about panicking before the surgery to the point that they have to put me under genereal anesthesia.\u00a0\u00a0I visited my OB/GYN today and had a nice long talk with him.\u00a0\u00a0He thinks that I will be just fine and expects my anxiety to actually improve throughout the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure at the visit today was 180/80, because I freaked out when the nurse took my blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0When I check my BP at home, it's always below 120/80.\u00a0\u00a0I talked with my doctor about that as well and he really thinks that I will calm down when I'm pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0He knows me pretty well - he's been my doctor for over 10 years and did both of my c-sections.\u00a0\u00a0My recovery after the c-sections was very easy and fast.\u00a0\u00a0I had gestational diabetes with both of my previous pregnancies, but it was well controlled and I did just fine.\u00a0\u00a0But gestational diabetes is another concern, even though I know how to handle it.My daughters are 5 and 3 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to look back 10 years from now and regret not having another baby, but I need to somehow get over all of this worry.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I'm just looking for some advice, support or stories of women in a similar situation.\u00a0\u00a0I really want another baby, but I worry so much that I'm afraid that I will hurt the baby or cause myself to have a heart attack!\u00a0\u00a0Please help!",
