    "question": "I went into my appt today with my midwife...I'm 32 weeks along as of yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0At 28 weeks I lost my mucous plug, had a stress test, and everything appeared ok.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been leaking any fluid, and the ultrasound I had done was ok.\u00a0\u00a0I had a fetal fibronectin test done, and that was also negative.\u00a0\u00a0Today, @ my 32nd week appt, I have some other problems.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past 2 or 3 days, I've been having a lot of pressure in my lower abdomen/inner vaginal area...painful at times.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't been noticing the contractions terribly, they come and go.\u00a0\u00a0I've been moving my bowels about 5-6 times a day, and urinating about every 1 1/2 hours.\u00a0\u00a0I feel so crappy.\u00a0\u00a0My b/p today was 150/68, then they rechecked it and it was 140/80.\u00a0\u00a0I'm having mild swelling of the ankles, nothing severe like it was for my first pregnancy (I had preeclampsia).\u00a0\u00a0So, my midwife did another fetal fibronectin test, and checked my cervix.\u00a0\u00a0She says it's soft, and opened a little less than a centimeter.\u00a0\u00a0Does this mean that the baby is coming early?\u00a0\u00a0I'm worried...I hate even waiting for this test to come back!\u00a0\u00a0She said that if the test comes back positive, that I'm going to deliver in the next 2 weeks, that I'll get some shots of steroids to help the baby's lungs develop, and she also told me the baby weighs 4-5 pounds right now, so that's good right?\u00a0\u00a0Give me some advice please....I'm ready to pull my hair out!\u00a0\u00a0Oh, I'm also very irritable and fatigued.\u00a0\u00a0(haha, that's pretty normal, though, I suppose...)Thanks...",
