    "question": "I am a 34 yo female, 17 days postpartum after my 2nd csection. I had an emergency c-section due to mild preeclampsia and was on magnesium sulfate for 24 hours. I had bowel movements up to 9 days postpartum, and then they ceased. I then went almost a week being able to pass gas, but little poop. Like maybe just a couple pieces a day, no bigger than a half dollar in size. I tried stool softners, and Miralax to no avail. All it did was cause some stomach cramping. I can pass gas, no more than I normally would. Yesterday, I went to the store and got prune juice, and things have been moving. I have had several smaller size bowell movements since then. Should I be concerned about an intestinal blockage, or do you think it was just constipation?My doctor told me if I am passing gas and poop that I would not have a blockage. I don't have an extreme amount of abdominal pain, only a little sore from straining for a few days, trying to make myself go, and some burning around my incision area which is normal. Everyone around me (my boyfriend and mom) tell me I am making too big of a deal about the issue, that my system is just sluggish from the magnesium and the surgery and recovery. I don't want to ignore something that could be quite serious. Anyone have any input on this?",
