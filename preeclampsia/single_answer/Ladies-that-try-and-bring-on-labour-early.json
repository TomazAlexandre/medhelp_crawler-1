    "question": "Hi ladies, congrats to all of you mummies :)I see a lot of post of ladies wanting to bring labour on from 38weeks and sometimes earlier because \"they just want their baby\" of corse we all want our baby in our arms ASAP andYes you only have two weeks left but please let it happen naturally.I have a high chance of preeclampsia and this is a high risk of me having my baby very early. I prey every night my baby goes full term and there is no complications :(Be happy pregnancy is a blessing and enjoy it, you might of been sick with vomiting and you have been hot and had no energy, just be very grateful your beautiful baby is at 38 weeks.(No bashing please I'm just saying)Congrats to all.",
