    "question": "So for background info, I've been having high blood pressure which my doctor diagnosed as preeclampsia and put me on bed rest even though I had no other symptoms. I was having false labor contractions for 6 days without rest, unable to sleep or keep food down. My doctor refused to even talk about inducing me (I'm 37+5) because he said the baby was laying sideways, but refused to do a sonogram to confirm that. Last night I was having contractions 2 minutes apart for 4 hours, painful enough to not be able to stand or speak, but he they weren't doing anything. The doctor sent me home without any kind of pain relief or advice at all. Well last night they got that bad again and he told me not to bother coming to the hospital unless my water broke. I went to a different hospital and they immediately gave me pain relief (and a prescription for more) and did a sonogram and showed me that the baby wasn't sideways at all. He was head down where he should be. They couldn't give me anything to help my contractions along because I needed a primary care doctor to order that. But I'm switching doctors and hospitals. When a patient is repeatedly asking for a sonogram to confirm something the doctor said, and is repeatedly asking for pain relief because her contractions are too much to speak through and coming every 2 minutes, you shouldn't just brush her off and send her home with nothing. And when I didn't show for my appointment today, they didn't bother calling me, they called my emergency contact before even trying to call me or the father!",
