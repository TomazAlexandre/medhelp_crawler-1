            "answer": "Hi, understand your anxiety. Babies need to complete 36 weeks, for safe delivery. According to management guidelines, patients with preeclampsia at \u226537 weeks of gestation are delivered; however, before term, the risks of serious sequelae from disease progression need to be balanced with the risks of preterm birth. So, you will need to take bed rest and medications to control blood pressure. If needed your doctor may admit you for monitoring. So, take care and follow up with your doctor. Regards.",
