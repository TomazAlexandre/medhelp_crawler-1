            "answer": "Hi!Migraine during pregnancy can be caused due to number of causes like pregnancy hormones, imbalance of the brain chemicals, altered blood flow to the brain etc.Few women may experience severe migraine in pregnancy while few of them may have decreased symptoms.Chocolates,Chinese foods, processed meat, bright glaring lights, lack of sleep, stress all can act as triggers of migraine.Migarine sufferers are at increased risk to develop hypertension and preeclampsia so you need to be careful and be closely monitored by your doctor. Acetaminophen is the safest medicine. If you are aware about the triggering factors try to avoid them.Rest, relaxation, use of cold compresses on forehead can be helpful.
