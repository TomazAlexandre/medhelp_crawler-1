    "question": "Please help.\u00a0\u00a0I'm doing some independent research while waiting on the results from my daughter's autopsy.\u00a0\u00a0This was my second pregnancy, second loss.\u00a0\u00a0I delivered at 22 weeks, 5 days after being induced due to the onset of severe preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0This was a complicated pregnancy from the beginning.\u00a0\u00a0I experienced 1st trimester bleeding starting at about 5 weeks and occuring about every 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with having a subchorionic hematoma and every time I bled, I was ultrasounded and the baby appeared fine, heart beating, moving, and growing.\u00a0\u00a0Every time, the hematoma seemed to resolve itself.\u00a0\u00a0The red bleeding stopped around the beginning of my second trimester (though I continued to have brown spotting) and things seemed to be improving until I got a call from my dr. that my 3 out of 4 quad screen levels came back abnormally high, the AFP and HCG, and particularly the inhibin level at 30x higher than the median.\u00a0\u00a0I had a level 2 u/s, baby only had 1 soft marker- a bright bowel, but she was small, about 1-2 weeks delayed, and my placenta was abnormally large, about 2x the size of my baby.\u00a0\u00a0Amnio performed, dark brown-colored fluid.\u00a0\u00a0Went home, seemed to be leaking brown fluid, so was hospitalized for PPROM.\u00a0\u00a0Dr's very pessimistic.\u00a0\u00a0Seemed to think baby had triploidy, even though she appreared perfectly normal on u/s, just a little small.\u00a0\u00a0Initial and final amnio results came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0Amnio levels remained low.\u00a0\u00a02 weeks later, started bleeding red again and thought I was experiencing contractions.\u00a0\u00a0Ultrasound noted baby alive, still small, amnio levels still low.\u00a0\u00a0They took my blood pressure and hooked me up to monitor contractions, which were coming painlessly every 2 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosed me with having severe preeclampsia, and appeared to have placental abruption.\u00a0\u00a0Decided to induce me then with no hope of continuing the pregnancy or saving the baby.\u00a0\u00a0Delivered a beautiful tiny girl stillborn, placenta delivered with no problems.I've gone for one follow up dr appt. So far, all they could really tell me was the placenta had a lot of blood clots in it.\u00a0\u00a0Desperately looking for answers, mostly to know if I should even attempt to get pregnant again.\u00a0\u00a0This was my 2nd loss, no living children.\u00a0\u00a0First loss was miscarriage at 12 weeks, a missed miscarriage as the baby appeared to have died at about 9 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Before that, the pregnancy seemed to be progressing well.\u00a0\u00a0Both pregnancies were spontaneous.\u00a0\u00a0Prepregnancy issues- PCOS, irregular periods, and slightly low thyroid levels for which I was taking meds for with my 2nd pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry this is so long, but I just keep hoping that with the laundry list of problems I experienced, there has to be some definitive cause that ties them all together.\u00a0\u00a0We buried my little girl a few days ago.\u00a0\u00a0I want to try again, but don't think I can handle another loss.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anyone who can tell me what all these issues may be caused by?",
