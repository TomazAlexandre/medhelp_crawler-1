            "answer": "RE:Proteinuria and Hematuria PART 2- I had to finish my long story down here because I didnt know how long the question could be. So the cardiologist said I needed to see a specialist like a Rheumatologist because He said I had Raynauds and he thought I may have some type of autoimmune disease because of the rash I have, my hair was falling out everywhere, I also had some type of lacy looking stuff under my skin when I would get the flare of Raynauds, and I was so fatiuge! My heart rate was staying at 120 or higher and all the meds he tried me on for my bp werent helping at all ! I went to a primary care for a while who tried to figure out what was wrong she knew I had lupus but the tests were negative! I went to another primary care to get a second opinion same thing he knew I had lupus but still tests were negative! So another! Same thing they knew it was autoimmune but they thought I had multiple ones so they referred me to the Internal med Dr I see now! Still same problems only worse and more symptoms of autoimmune diseases! Now all these kidney issues are getting worse! I was diagnosed with Nephrotic syndrome by my Internal med Dr but when the blood work came back kidney function was normal because my creatinine was low! I didnt put all the symptoms like edema,hypertension that came on suddenly, little to no urine output for many years despite drinking tons of water I would only swell more! I also had confusion, alot of bubbles in urine and still do, dark urine , white flakes in it but when they check it in the lab and culture it I dont have mucous,infection,or wbc. I do have squamous epithelial cells\u00a0\u00a0 no matter how much I clean and be very careful not to contaminate the urine. But the Dr said its not from contamination. I only pee once or twice a day no matter how much water I drink! I get up all night though which is highly unusual for me because I have never gotten up to urinate in the middle if the night. I\u00a0\u00a0was put on diuretics but they didnt stop the edema or help really so I was taken off because I have low potassium now. But I have had hyperkalemia( high potassium) a few times in the past! It is very weird that it goes up and down like that! I have high sodium which I dont even eat alot of salt . I have high blood protien levels despite loosing it in my urine! So many different things going on and no one knows why! I had a ultrasound of my kidneys done and my kidneys looked normal! The tubes or whatever they r were normal no blockages! I have hypoglycemia off and on and with the last 3 pregnancies I had gestational diabetes with my babies born with low blood sugars and blood pressure dropping from the blood sugars. They also were born with fevers because I had sepsis during labor ! In the mornings my eyes are very puffy and swollen and my hands are so stiff I cant move them! By the time I go to bed at night my legs,ankles, feet, and hands are very swollen! But when I wake up the swelling is gone in my legs, ankles, and feet until I start walking around! But my hands and fingers stay swollen and are hurting constantly! So my questions are # 1. Can you have kidney disease with low creatinine? # 2. Does kidney disease go undetected like this for many years without pain or without\u00a0\u00a0 frequent infections?\u00a0\u00a0# 3.Does all this sound like kidney disease or autoimmune related problems!\u00a0\u00a0# 4. Is protein in urine amount of 40 or 60 very high or is it just elevated?\u00a0\u00a0 # 5. Should I be focused on the kidney problems more or is this a mild problem if any? I would appreciate any feedback becaus I never thought I would have to be worried about kidney problems?",

    "question": "HI Everyone , I really need some opinions of as many people as possible who have kidney disease! I have been seeing a Internal Medicine Physician for autoimmune diseases related symptoms for a few months now and every time I go I have protein and sometimes blood in my urine! I always have atleast 40-60 protein I dont know\u00a0\u00a0what that means but on dipstick they tell me its a +4. I was also seeing a Endocrinologist and Rheumatologist months before I started to see the Internal Med Dr which was also in the same Plaza so the urine tests they did were also in the computer because they are all a part of a college of Medicine. I also had a couple of urine tests that were in the computer from a year ago and the results back then were protien was 60-80 and many blood cells I dont know the actual #s. So I went and got all my labs from the main lab I use from the past 6 years and I had blood and protien most of the time on all of it. The weird thing is I have never had problems with my kidneys hurting too bad or had many kidney infections . I have only had maybe 3 kidney and UTI's and they were when I was pregnant with my children. Kidney disease does run in my family but I never thought I would have any problems with it. My Dr has referred me to a Nepherologist but my appointment is in Dec. and I was referred back in Sept. with a urgent appointment requested by my Dr. But there is only 1 near me who accepts my ins. so I have to wait . Yesterday my Dr called and said she wanted me to come in for another urine test because It hasnt been checked in a couple of weeks. I have had severe edema for years but always thought it was due to autoimmune diseases. After 1 hour of just standing or walking my feet, ankles, and lower legs will be so swollen you can literally push on them and see and feel the fluid moving inside! They turn blood red and burn! When pushed on or touched they turn white for a few seconds and then turn red again. I am only 29 with 6 children and I am not overweight unless( I swell that day). I have always had low blood pressure sometimes to low it was always 90/60- 80/50 until 2008 when I got pregnant with my last daughter I developed preeclampsia and was induced at 39 weeks. My blood presssure had been very high for the last couple of months before that but I had preterm labor with all my children and all were born premature except the last. The Dr figured it was due to my pain because I had really bad contractions from 24 weeks until I delivered due to my water bag getting a hole in it at 23-24 weeks and the Drs wanted to take the baby then but I said no if God wanted her to be born she would but they werent going to take her until I dilated pretty far so I was put on antibiotics and\u00a0\u00a0kept in the hospital and given steroids for her lungs and meds to stop contractions that didnt work. They said she wasnt even a pound yet soo if I did have her she probably wouldnt make it ! So I am very glad I made that decision because she wouldnt be here! Despite carrying her the rest of the pregnancy with very low water and contracting every 3 minutes the whole time she was the only child I had that was full term! She was a miracle from God! She barely weighed 6 lbs when born and they kept saying she looked premature but she wasnt ! After all that my blood pressure never went back down! I was on 3 blood pressure meds and diuretics off and on and they did absolutely nothing! It started flucuating up and down after a year mostly high but atleast it wasnt stroke level! I went to a cardiologist who did tests and said it had to be related to something other than my heart because all tests were pretty much normal.",
