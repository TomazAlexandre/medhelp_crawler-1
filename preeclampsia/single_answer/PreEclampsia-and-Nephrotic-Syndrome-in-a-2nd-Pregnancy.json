            "answer": "Hi!I'm so sorry that you lost your little girl.\u00a0\u00a0Those tiny tiny babies are so precious!Pre eclampsia is more common in the first pregnancy than in subsequent pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0So, you have that going for you.\u00a0\u00a0Your risk of recurrence is pretty high though, given that in your case the pre-eclampsia was probably due to your kidney disease.A couple of thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with their use of Clexane, and I certainly hope they continued it for 6 weeks post partum.\u00a0\u00a0If you could tolerate it, you might consider taking a baby aspirin daily during a new pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Because both medications are \"blood thinners\" you might not be able to tolerate them without bleeding, but some studies have shown a reduction in the risk of\u00a0\u00a0recurrent pre-eclampsia with daily aspirin (81mg).Also, there is some pretty good literature suggesting that controlling blood pressures with medications is safe(as opposed to delivery) in certain cases of pre-eclampsia when the baby is very early. (I don't know the details of your case). If you could even get 4 weeks further along, you would very likely take home a baby!Another thing to consider, if it hasn't been done, is a work up for antiphospholipid antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0If you are positive for one or several conditions, your risk would be higher than if you were negative.I hope some of this is helpful!Good luck!Dr B",
