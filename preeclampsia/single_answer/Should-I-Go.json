    "question": "Im 39 weeks pregnant, all day today ive been cramping (like menstrual cramps)and its been mild. Its been consistent... Not like contractions. Wednesday i went to the DR and i had a super high amount of protein in my urine & normal blood pressure. My.doc is concerned about preeclampsia. So i did a 24HR pee thing .. Which came back super elevated for protein. He told me to come back Monday to check my blood pressure. But today has been really painful with these cramps that havent went away. I text my doctor about a hour ago and asked him if it was ok to take Tramadol for the pain. He told me if i felt like i needed tramadol then i needed to go be evaluated. My boyfriend said i should just try the tramadol. Im debating on if i should go or just try the meds. Help?",
