    "question": "Hi ladies, I have had a massive scare yesterday. Waken up with a gush of blood then blood clots. But thank god my son is okay.I have high blood pressure and they have put me on asprin so it can lower the risk of preeclampsia and thin out my blood. It's just a small dose a night but I have read that asprin can cause blood clots etc. Did anyone have preeclampsia or had medication to lower there blood pressure and had a normal birth?",
