    "question": "38 weeks today, last Sunday I had premature contractions and went in to the hospital. Was told I had mild preeclampsia and was put on light bedrest because I am a single mom with no support as long as I come into the hospital twice a week for NSTs. Had my doctors appointment on Thursday and was told by my doctor that I am no longer at risk of preeclampsia but she did strip my cervix. Went into labor soon after and was in the hospital for 6 hours with strong contractions but no progress. So they sent me home. I'm am getting impatient. I am single so I can't do sex to induce. Tried maturbation (sorry TMI) but no progress, castor oil doesn't work for me (Tried with my last two pregnancies), walking has deemed useless as well, what can I do to get the show on the road? I feel like I have been pregnant forever.",
