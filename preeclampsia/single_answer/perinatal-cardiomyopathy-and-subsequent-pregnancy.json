    "question": ": I am a 38 years old and it has been 17 months since I was diagnosed with: perinatal cardiomyopathy (nullipara). I was three months post-partum at dx.: My first echo demonstrated an ejection fraction of 35% coupled with mitral: and tricuspid regurge & an O2 sat rate of 98 %( I had preeclampsia &: tachycardia during pregnancy, and the baby was delivered a month early: by emergency c-section). I was placed on 12.5 mg lopressor bid ( not carvedilol: - though it is being investegated @ the teaching hospital where I am followed).: My last echo in June was termed \"nl\" with an ejection fraction of 60% and: continued regurge..: My exercize tolerance has always proved to be excellent( I passed the: upper levels of the stress test early on, and I have been on a progressive: excersize & diet program ( I had gained 125 lbs due to the preeclampsia): to the point where I can now jog for 30 mins at the gym along with the: rest of the aerobic portion of my program ( I average 2.5 hours @ the gym: three times a wk, -\u00a0\u00a02 of which is spent on aerobics - I still have a heart: rate restriction of no > 140 bpm - I wear a monitor at the gym), and all: symptoms of CHF that I originally presented with ( SOB, chest pain,: passing out, lethargy)have vanished, - except for the tachycardia-: resting hr is ~ 70's, - walking down a hall is ~109-116).I have occasional: rebounds after I finish sometimes where my pulse will jump up 10 or so: points, - stay there, - and then down.: Throughout the course of this illness, I have recieved differing opinions: re: recovery and the prospect of future pregnancies.

Trivia: when I was initially dx'd my materials were: sent from my Internist to Dr. Young's attn @ Cleveland, yet neither she: nor I recieved a response despite her phone contact & letter and our: confirmation that my materials were recieved (I had planned to travel to: Cleveland for evaluation, - but since we never heard anything - ? ).: I continue to be treated at a major Boston teaching hospital where the: opinion is that 2nd pregnancies are possible, and at the institution where: I am being followed, - it has been done.: I would be interested in anyone's take on this, and anyone's experience: or ideas re: this illness.: I would also appreciate any studies/journal articles that you ( whoever ): could steer my way re: recovery and outcome. The 1970's African studies are: too old.: Many Thanks,: Eliz-------------------------------------------------------------------------Dear Eliz,I",
