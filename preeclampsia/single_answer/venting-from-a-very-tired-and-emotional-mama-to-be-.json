    "question": "At 35 weeks pregnant I've had a relatively easy pregnancy medically. I initially had a very low lying placenta but that corrected itself by 32 weeks. Recently I've been told I have high risk preeclampsia - that's easy enough to deal with too. I'm know I'm lucky that I have my fiance by my side but lately I feel unloved and have started to resent him to the point where I don't even want our son. And that scares me. I've struggled with depression for the past five years but up until now I had been the calmest and happiest with myself. We live with his family and lately I don't even leave our bedroom - not that it feels like its mine at all. My stuff is still in bags because there's no room for it. I'm a very homey person and need my own space to be comfortable. We've been here for over six months now and I just feel like I need a break. From everything.My partner has cheated on me three times throughout the past two years (twice since being pregnant - and with the same girl) yet somehow I feel like that's my fault?His mum is a lovely woman, she's just very overbearing and I don't have a good relationship with any females in my life. No aunts and my mum choose drugs over her children when I was 11.If I could go back two years I'd change my life completely. I never wanted children and now as my due date approaches (36 days to go) I'd honestly rather just walk away. I don't want to be a mum at any cost with the way I feel right now. I could pass him off to another less fortunate couple for adoption and not look back.Very unhealthy mental state right now with no one to talk to.. :'(",
