            "answer": "I had HELLP and severe preeclampsia the first time around, although at 35-36 weeks and had a c-sec at 36 weeks. My ob said I am less likely to have it with my second pregnancy but more likely than a person who has never had it (you chances are higher in your first pregnancy). He watched me very carefully throughout my pregnancy and even gave me steroid shots at 34 weeks as a precaution in case I developed it again. I made it to my scheduled delivery date and while I might have been starting to develop it (my platelets were dropping) everything went well. I did have some bp problems after I got home, but it never went too high.",
