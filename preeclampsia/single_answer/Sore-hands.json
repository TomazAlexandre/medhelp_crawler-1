    "question": "Haven't read much about this but I assume it's pregnancy related haha I'm 36wks and starting this last weekend my fingers on both hands really hurt, like when you jam your finger kinda. It's not the knuckle where fingers meet the hand but where the fingers do their biggest bent. I can actually see the veins. My wedding ring is also no longer going on/off without a push and when I keep it on that finger hurts the worst :( I feel like they hurt cause they're swollen. But swelling is suppose to go down right? My blood pressure has never been an issue and I've never been told I have issues with my urine samples so I doubt it's preeclampsia, but I really was under the impression if selling doesn't get relieved after you sleep there's another issue? Should I call the midwife or just wait a week till my next appointment?",
