            "answer": "Hi there.From your history, it is very hard to point out which one is the real culprit.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to think more of your symptoms as contributions from a variety of factors from your previous ailments, aggravated by the physiologic changes of pregnancy (increased blood pressure, blood volume, hormonal changes, water retention etc).\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you keep a close watch on your pregnancy with regular consults with your obstetrician, and might as well be managed by an internist so that any complications in your pregnancy can be anticipated and addressed.\u00a0\u00a0I hope your pregnancy will be as uneventful as possible.Regards and God bless.",
