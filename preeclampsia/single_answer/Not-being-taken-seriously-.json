Now at 35wks1day she says well maybe 39 weeks. I told her my bp has been 160 over 103 or so multiple times and days in the last days since I saw her and she said well we don't see that here sp just stop taking it at home. Like if my heart hurts shouldn't I take it? I am so disheartened. I just want to see my baby girl. I'm miserable and I've gained so much fluid it's terrible. What do I do ?",
