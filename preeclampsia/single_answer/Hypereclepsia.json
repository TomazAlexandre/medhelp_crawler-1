            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Can you elaborate on the medical\u00a0\u00a0diagnosis provided by the attending physician? If you are referring to preeclampsia or developing high blood pressure and protein in the urine after the 20th week of pregnancy, this usually go away within 6 weeks after delivery. Hyperplasia, on the otherhand, is an increased cell production in a normal tissue or organ that may be a sign of abnormal or precancerous changes or due to the growth of completely normal cells. It is best that you discuss this with your doctor for proper evaluation. Your medical history is also important.\u00a0\u00a0Hope to hear from you soon. Take care always.",
