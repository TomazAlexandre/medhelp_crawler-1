    "question": "I was due January 29 due to my preeclampsia I have to have the baby at 37 weeks. So my induction date is January 8th. My mother is ecstatic because this is Elvis Presley's birthday. Who happens to be one of my favorite artist I listed to when I was a kid. Weird part is I was at my non stress test today and the nurse asked if I was cramping I'm like yes she goes rate ur pain 0-10 I'm like I can't use that scale I have a high pain tolerance but I can compare these cramps to I have to stop and take a breath when they happen. So she monitors me for another 20 mins then I see my doctor and she says that I was having contractions. What's weird is they didn't hurt so bad Imean they were painful as all get out but I could handle it with easy breathing. Either way excited I have a set date now. :))",
