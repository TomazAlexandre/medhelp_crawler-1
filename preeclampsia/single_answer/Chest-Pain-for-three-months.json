    "question": "This seems so bizarre I am almost too embarrassed to write it! Starting in December, I have had severe, excruciating chest pain that lasts for around 40 minutes. When it first happened in Decmber, it was December 6th (the day before my nephew was born). It started on the way home from work, and I only live 12 minutes from there. I thought that it was gas of any kind, but had no relief. I got home, and the pain got worse and worse, it was in the dead center of my chest and was sharp and pressing. EMS arrived and took me to the hospital; of course, they found nothing. The first week of January it hit me again, on a Saturday, when I was home with my six month old son. I called my husband at work who brought me, upon my request, chewable aspirin and mylanta, just in case it was heartburn as I had never had it, not even during pregnancy. It still lasted just under an hour, despite the meds. (Note: Nitro during the EMS ride did provide some relief). Last night, February 9th, I was sleeping on the couch, and this horrendous pain awoken me from sleep. Again, lasting just under an hour, despite previously noted home meds. Obviously I have skipped the $400 per ambulance ride in January and this month, and the $200 copay for the ER x 2.... is it a coincidence that this happens around the same time every month? OH! Also, the pain travels at an excruciatingly slow rate from the center of my chest, and, without losing intensity, toward my stomach. It seems there, my stomach \"swallows\" it up, but I still feel pressure. Sorry for the TMI coming up, but trying to relieve any gas or BM doesn't work....in fact, I cannot in any way expel any gas or stool in connection with this. I don't necessarily have shortness of breath but the pain is so great that it does seem to take my breath away. PLEASE......if anyone can help, I desperately need yours! History: CHF secondary to preeclampsia this past July, first baby (a gorgeous seven month old boy now!); chronic back problems: compression fracture, scoliosis, disc dessication; an otherwise healthy 29 year old female.",
