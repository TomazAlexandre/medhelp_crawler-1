    "question": "Hello, I'm 18 weeks pregnant and yesterday I went to the doctors for just a regular visit for my pregnancy and the doctor said the last few visits, I have had protien in my urine so she gave me a jug and I have to collect my urine for 24 hours then drop it off at the lab. I'm so nervous. I'm afraid I might have preeclampsia because my blood presure was also high and I've been getting headaches. What will they do if I have it? I'm not even near my due date so they obviously can't deliver the baby. I'm just super scared. This pregnancy has already been horrible for me:( my last one was healthy now this one, I have lots of complications:(",
