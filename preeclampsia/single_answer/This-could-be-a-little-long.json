    "question": "I went to my antenatal checkup yesterday. I'm 25 weeks. My blood pressure was slightly raised. I also had plus protein and large amounts of blood in my urine. I then went. I started feeling sick so I went to a local doctor. My blood pressure had gone up so off I went to the birthing unit. They checked my blood pressure again and it had gone back down. I still had the protein and blood. They were slightly concerned about this. I have to go back on Monday. I don't have any UTIs because I was just checked for one. The one thing they did say it could be my cervix because when I had a pap smear this April it came back abnormal. They asked for a repeat next April. Does anyone knbow what could be the problem?",
