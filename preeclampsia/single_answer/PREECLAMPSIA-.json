            "answer": "I would say try to see another Dr just for a second opinion. I've been put on bedrest and they wanted to keep me in the hospital until deliver. Although I was never officially diagnosed with preeclampsia just at high risk (having BP spikes and occasionally elevated levels of protein in my urine). Preeclampsia is really something to be taken very seriously, especially like it's your case!",

    "question": "Hi everyone I was diagnosed with preeclampsia a month ago I am 35+2 and I'm really getting annoyed because it seems like my OB and my Specialist are ignoring my symptoms and I'm so tired of it the only concern they have is my blood pressure bc I feel like I need to be induced, my BP has been spying up and down but when I'm at the Dr its normal or PreH and they are like your fine, but my eyes are really blurry, I've had the same head ache for a week, I'm always dizzy, I feel twice down the stairs(landed on my bottom), pains in my stomach, and nauseous and vomiting, but they say oh well you blood levels and BP are fine it's just your Protein level in your urine and that's nothing to be concerned about I'm like really everyone that I know were induced at 37-37 weeks to prevent it from going from Mold to Severe. I'm wondering could I demand to be induced at 37 weeks or should I just let them do their \"JOB\"?",
