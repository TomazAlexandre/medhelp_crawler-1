    "question": "I am a 30 year old female, 5'8\", 230 lbs, and don't smoke or drink alcohol. I drink a moderate amount of caffeine. (a medium sized coffee in the morning usually) I am a stay at home mom to a 15 month old (had severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome when I was pregnant, and have borderline high blood pressure around 130/80) For the past two months or so, I have been having a trembling sensation through my body as if there is a small earthquake as I sleep, especially as I have just drifted off. It's especially bad if I fall asleep sitting up in a chair but has happened twice while I was lying in bed. I awaken immediately and continue to feel the sensation, but do not appear to be shaking. I usually panic and get extremely nervous afterward, and have not been sleeping well since I began feeling like this. It happens about twice a week, especially on nights when I am very tired (And it makes the problem worse of course!) I usually sleep around 5-6 hrs. a night lately, could it be related to sleep deprivation or something more sinister? I worry it may be epilepsy, brain tumor, ALS or worse. Please help, God bless.",
