            "answer": "this is something that would warrant a call to your doctor in the AM (not a middle-of-the-night emergency, but don't wait to call once they open) because rib pain can be a sign of preeclampsia...so they'll probably want to test your BP and urine for protein...just to be on the safe side. but it CAN be normal as well, so no freaking out, hehe.if it is just \"generic rib pain\" then the best thing you can do is make sure you get enough potassium, water, and make sure that your posture is good...good luck hon, remember to call the doctor and ask if they want you to get your BP checked! remember..preeclampsia can develop all of a sudden without any previous indicators so it's good to pay attention to any potential warning signs.",

    "question": "So I'm 28 weeks preggo and this is probably normal but my ribs hurt so bad. It feels like their being stretched open from the inside, which they probably are....but the pain is especially bad right under my boobs, and it helps to apply some light pressure to my ribs but dunno if that is a good idea if they are trying to expand.Anyway I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this and if anyone has any advice for dealing with it then just \"grin and bare it\" lol.",
