            "answer": "If you have it, you'll be watched closely. I go twice weekly for monitoring and once a week for a regular appointment until I get induced at 37 weeks because of the preeclampsia. The only symptom I have is high blood pressure and protein in my urine thank goodness and hopefully it stays that way but blurry vision or spots in your vision can be a sign but coughing hard could have just messed with your vision. Swelling can also be a sign but that can also just be a regular pregnancy symptom. So I'd just discuss it all with your dr!",

    "question": "I am 32 weeks and 1 day today and I believe I've had a couple of signs of pre-eclampsia. I'm just looking for advice or more info from other mommas who have had it. I haven't been to the Dr in about 3 weeks to a month because we moved an hour away and I was trying to find a Dr closer to where I live now but no office will see me until I have my records faxed. I didn't want to delay going to the Dr any longer so I made an appt for this afternoon with my current dr. This morning I started coughing really hard (from air going down the wrong pipe- stupid I know) and I saw lots of spots/stars and then it took 3-4 minutes for my vision to go back to normal. This isn't the first time it's happened but I thought it would just go away or it was related to stress since we moved and I just started a new job. I've also been noticing that I haven't been having to pee so frequently. I can go 4-6 hrs or even longer with no problem and not having to pee. At this stage in pregnancy I thought that was abnormal because most women have to pee every hour if not more often. My ankles get very swollen after I come home from work even though I'm not on my feet all day just occasionally throughout the day. (I work in an eye drs office).So my question is to other mommas who have had pre-eclampsia, if the Dr finds I have high blood pressure today or protein in my urine what do you think she'll say or what will the next steps be?",
