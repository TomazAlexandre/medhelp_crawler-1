I had a baby 8/97 by c-section 12 weeks premature, because I had preeclampsia and HEELP syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0A week after delivery I almost dies with 2 pulmonary embolisms.\u00a0\u00a0Three months after that, I began nasua vomiting diareah, and rt upper pain.\u00a0\u00a0Some test were done (blood) and found me thyroid was way way off hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0The pain and what I call attacks continued. I had ct done for poss gallstones, what showed up was an extremly fatty liver, with no answer why. In May I had a severe attack so bad I needed 2 blood transfusions, after colonoscopy and biopsy dr were stuned to find out it was Ischemic colitis, they dont have any clue where it came from.\u00a0\u00a0It did clear up for a couple of months then returned again though not as severe I am still having intermitant pain diahrea vomit and nasua, I went to another dr, had another ct to show liver still the same. It is a mystery to what is causing this, I am not overweight, I do not drink, Could there be a problem no one has picked up on. I am really tired of feelining sick and tired of bein woke up at all hours with pain. I also follow a strict diet even though they feel there is no relation. I also feel my skin looks yellow alot of times and when I get sick I vomit yellow fluids.
