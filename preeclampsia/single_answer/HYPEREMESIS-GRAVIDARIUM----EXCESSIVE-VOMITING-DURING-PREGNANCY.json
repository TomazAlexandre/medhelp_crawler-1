    "question": "Posted By Andrea on February 03, 1999 at 15:41:41:I am considering getting pregnant again (I have a 6-year-old daughter), but I can't seem to find any information on this condition.\u00a0\u00a0When I became pregnant with my daughter, I had hyperemesis gravidarium for the duration of my entire pregnancy (from about 6 weeks on through delivery).\u00a0\u00a0I lost 13 pounds in my first trimester, had ketones in my urine, was severely dehydrated and on IV's, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Also, during the last month of my pregnancy, I developed preeclampsia and had to have an induced delivery.\u00a0\u00a0Naturally, I'm kind of gun-shy about going through all that again!\u00a0\u00a0My obstetrician treated me with Compazine (first suppositories, then pills) which is an antipsychotic in addition to being an antiemetic (I didn't have any medical problems prior to the pregnancy).\u00a0\u00a0It gave me terrible side effects (blurred vision, inability to concentrate, twitching muscles, inability to sleep, etc.)\u00a0\u00a0Are there any new treatments or preventatives for hyperemesis?\u00a0\u00a0I'm afraid to become pregnant again because I'll have to take the whole 9 months off of work if I have this condition again!\u00a0\u00a0Are there ANY treatments besides Compazine?\u00a0\u00a0I really want to have more children, but I almost died during my last pregnancy, because I couldn't get to the doctor (the HMO wouldn't make me an appointment because they said \"vomiting is normal, eat crackers.\"\u00a0\u00a0By the time I got in to see the doctor, I was so dehydrated that they put me in the hospital.)\u00a0\u00a0Are there any doctors in the MD/DC/VA area that specialize or have experience with treating hyperemesis?\u00a0\u00a0I would also love to hear from those of you who have been through this with suggestions!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks -- Andi (Mom of Kira, 6)",
