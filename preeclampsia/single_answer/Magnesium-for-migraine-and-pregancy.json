            "answer": "Hi,How are you? During\u00a0\u00a0pregnancy, magnesium helps build and repair the body's tissues. Magnesium and calcium work in combination. Research suggests that proper levels of magnesium during pregnancy can help keep the uterus from contracting prematurely and a severe deficiency may lead to preeclampsia, poor fetal growth, and even infant mortality. Pregnant women, 19 to 30 years of age usually are given 350 milligrams of magnesium per day. Magnesium is usually included in prenatal vitamins but supplement may be taken if you have not been eating well.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your doctor about this first for proper management. Regular prenatal check-up is highly recommended. Take care always.",
