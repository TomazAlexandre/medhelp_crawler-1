    "question": "I'm 36 weeks and my doctor diagnosed me with mild preeclampsia due to my high blood pressure and a high lever of protein in my pee. I stayed in the hospital for 2 nights and he finally let me go home but on bed rest. He's planning on inducing me next weekend. Anyone else with preeclampsia?",
