    "question": "I had my baby at 30 weeks and 6 days gestational age due to preeclampsia. I had high blood pressure and protein in my urine. It has been about 11 weeks since I had her and my blood pressure has still been high. I have also started having other problems. My head has felt numb in some spots, I feel tingling sometimes when I touch it and I have had a headache for about a week. I know they said I would have headaches with high blood pressure but I have been taking my blood pressure medicine but my pressures have still been high and I cannot get ride of this headache. I took my pressure earlier and it was 150/123. My insurance has run out and I cannot afford to go to the doctor so I was just wondering if I really need to. Please help!! I haven't gotten a good nights sleep in over a week. Thanks!!",
