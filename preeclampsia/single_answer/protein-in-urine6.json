    "question": "hey girls! I just found out when going to get my bloodwork done about an order from my doc for an 24 hr urine analysis. Now I have only been into my docs office twice so far, once for a physical and the first visit which was to confirm pregnancy, ultrasound, etc. So during those two times they must have found large (or more than they like) amounts of protein spilling into my urine? Well they didnt say anything to me about it, I suppose to squash any freak out I may have until they know for sure. So I did the pee in a jug thing, took it back to the lab yesterday (Friday) and am waiting for results. I know my bloodwork should be fine, but since there is without a question something in my urine they dont like, will they let me know the results of that immediately if there is something wrong? and doesnt it almost certainly mean I could have preeclampsia? Im only 12 weeks!!! I didnt have any of that until like the last two weeks of my last two pregnancies and they were so mild the doc didnt even look twice at it. And I dont see how I could have it already, that is very scary. Has anyone ever had an experience like this? I though usually it was something that happened later in pregnancy, Im not sure why... but I have a pretty healthy diet...? My sis is a nursing student and shes let me know every outcome of this if its preeclampsia, and its not pretty. I mean this is really early in the pregnancy",
