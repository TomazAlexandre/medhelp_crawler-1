            "answer": "I was just told that my BP is slowly rising and I am on labetalol 100mg 3x a day for it. So they are watching for preeclampsia. I don't have gestational diabetes but dr thinks that is cause I was on metformin till 22 weeks and the test was done like 2 weeks later, I was not feeling my daughter moving for the last few days so I had to go in today and have a fetal monitor done. Everything seems ok but she has slowed down alot in movement so I am set for appts every week with ultrasounds he said. Plus I have to keep track of fetal movement at home.",

    "question": "We knew at the beginning of the pg I had potential to go high risk as I have high BP that could lead to preeclampsia and a history of gestational diabetes in the family.They've been checking on me more closely for the preeclampsia, but so far that looks good even though my BP is starting to rise.\u00a0\u00a0All my labs there look good.However, after yesterdays appt I have been classified as high risk due to anemia and gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was told I have to start taking extra iron supplements for the anemia and they are referring me to a dietician for the gestational diabetes.Does anybody have any experience with either of these pg complications?",
