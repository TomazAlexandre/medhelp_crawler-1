    "question": "I went into the ER yesterday with what we thought was preeclampsia. Turns out I'm anemic, no preeclampsia. I ended up with random contractions, then they came on regularly. Every 6 minutes. They told me if we let it go on, my baby would be making her way into the world. I'm 33 weeks! I was given a bag of iron through an IV, then given Flexiril to stop the contractions. I was sent home when they got weaker, and was told to go back if I started contracting again (4 or more an hour). Anybody else go through this? Did you make it full term? I was doing good all day, but right now my lower abdomen and lower back are achy. Like a dull achy pain.",
