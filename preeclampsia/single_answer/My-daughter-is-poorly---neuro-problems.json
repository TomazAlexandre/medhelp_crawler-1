    "question": "My daughter was born in May 2005, at 33 weeks, by emergency caesarian weighing just 3lb6oz. She spent 8 weeks in SCBU, on oxygen and tube fed. No other health problems were recorded. During the pregnancy, I had severe preeclampsia, and I also have Wegeners Granulomatosis and a tracheal stenosis, which meant my oxygen levels were poor throughout pregnancy and I had an operation at 30 weeks pregnant to widen my airway. A very risky pregnancy.However, since birth, my daughter has continually been a low birth weight. She is now almost 3, and weighs just 21lbs. She hardly eats, and her haemaglobin is 10.8 and she has started an iron suppliment. She has suddenly become incontenant, and has behavioural problems. She is also very tired, and sleeps more than usual.Could this be a neuro problem? Thanks",
