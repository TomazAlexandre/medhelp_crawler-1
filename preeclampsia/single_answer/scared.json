            "answer": "I'm sorry you had to have the emergency induction with your first. It sounds like it was the best route at the time.My advise is to read up on the stages of labor. This will help you a lot when determining when it's the real deal. You can simply google it or I like the Bradley Method book because they do a good job of talking about the stages of labor.Best wishes to you!!!",
