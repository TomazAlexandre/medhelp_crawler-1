            "answer": "If you only have swelling in one side it's a good idea to get it checked by your doctor in case of blood clots. I have 1 leg that has been swelling since about 30 weeks (I'm 38 weeks now), and Dr said it's because I favor that leg when I stand at work. He made me wear compression stockings and cut back on working, keep my feet elevated, drink water and rest a lot. Are you on your feet often? Also, because your baby is so large he could just be pushing down harder on one side causing more swelling in that leg.My baby is also thought to be a big baby and my Doctor said that could be a factor.",

    "question": "I'm 38+1 carrying what is believed to be a big boy! A couple of weeks ago I had a growth scan to check on him and they estimated 8lbs 8oz already, potentially looking at a 10lb baby!My left ankle has been swelling up and going down for what seems like forever, probably from about 6months. But yesterday my left leg went really tense, I wouldn't say so much swollen but tender and tight all the way up to my knee. This gradually happened through the course of the day so I had a hot bath and slept with my foot up all night but it's still like it this morning.Anything to be concerned about? I have no other symptoms and I was checked for preeclampsia a couple of weeks back. I'm wondering if it's his weight bearing down making my leg like it as as my right ankle has now swollen ever so slightly and that one hasn't swelled at all the whole pregnancy??",
