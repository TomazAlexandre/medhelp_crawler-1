    "question": "Hello everyone, this is my first pregnancy. I am 14 weeks + 4. I have had elevated blood pressure for the last few years. The OB said that it might lead to preeclampsia. And put at a high risk pregnancy. Has anyone had to deal with this? He also mentioned delivering early to try and avoid it. Saying around 37 weeks. I am just worried and have been trying to not stress out about it.",
