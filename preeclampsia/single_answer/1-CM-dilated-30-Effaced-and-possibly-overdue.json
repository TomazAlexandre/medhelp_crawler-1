            "answer": "You can ask to wait to be induced, most definitely. They can only guess your baby's weight. When they guessed my friend's baby to be over 8 lbs and induced her, her baby ended up being under 7 lbs (she was like 6 lbs 12 ounces or so).Make an educated choice in this matter. Being pregnant following a miscarriage does not make one high risk. The BP can be a problem and so long as they're closely monitoring it, you should be fine.",

    "question": "I was due July 29th according to my peroid which has always been on time. After my first U/S they changed my DD to 8/10/09. So I guess technically I am not overdue although I feel I am. I have been having spikes in my blood pressure and they want to induce me tomorrow. All of the tests for preeclampsia have come back negative but they say they want to induce before I develop complications. They consider me a high risk pregnancy because I have had high blood pressure since 10 weeks as well as I got pregnant immediately after a miscarriage. They want to use Cytotec to ripen and soften my cervix but I am scared b/c i have heard lots of bad things about cytotec. Should i ask my doc to let me wait to be induced. I have been 1 cm and 30% effaced for 2 weeks now. They say baby is already 8lbs and if I wait any longer she could get bigger and cause complications. This is my first baby so I am not sure what to do....",
