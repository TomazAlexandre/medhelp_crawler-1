    "question": "Iam a 30yr old mother of 6 as well as veterinary technician and I just delivered my 6th child in june I was induced for severe preeclampsia/hellp syndrome however I had symptoms of hellp for weeks before my delivery that were ignored by my midwife leading me to get a second opinion ultimately leading to immediate admission and then delivery, in either case lately I've been so exhausted it's ridiculous, still having upper right quandrant pain, nausea, vomiting, seeing spots but delivery was supposed to cure it, so I pulled and ran my own bloods and my liver enzymes are mildly elevated, low calcium, low iron and extremely low alp levels could I have liver/kidney damage? And what effect could it have on my heart? As I have a congenital form of heart disease im very worried.",
