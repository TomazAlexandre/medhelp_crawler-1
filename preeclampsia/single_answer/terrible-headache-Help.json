    "question": "I'm 24 weeks. I have been getting really bad headaches for the past 4 days. I thought it was because I was drinking enough water so I started drinking more. I don't normally get headache unless I'm dehydrated. They got so bad I took Tylenol for it took up to 2000 yesterday 1000 in the am and 1000 in the afternoon. It didn't take the headache away but helped. I called my doctor yesterday then she brought up my blood pressure saying it hasn't been regular. I had high pressure with my first pregnancy but don't remember headache. She told me to drink caffeine and then take a nap. I did that but after I woke up it was way worse. What the chance I can end up with high blood pressure again with this pregnancy and is headaches a sign of preeclampsia?",
