            "answer": "Dear Carol1,Thanks for writing in.You are right that anorexia can indeed lead to many complications during pregnancy. As the nutritional stores in the mother\u2019s body is low, pregnancy drains them further. This puts stress on both the mother and the child.The risks for the mother include depression, miscarriage, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia ( a condition where the blood pressure is increased and can have dangerous implications for both the mother and the child), complications during labor and increased risk of caesarean birth.The risks for the child include low birth weight, delayed fatal growth stillbirth or fatal death respiratory problems and premature labor.During pregnancy, her gynaecologist needs to be informed early on about the possibility of an eating disorder. Further, she should strive for healthy weight gain, eat well-balanced meals with all the appropriate nutrients, find a nutritionist and seek appropriate counselling. Also, she needs to be tested at regular intervals to make sure that the baby is doing fine.Medications for anorexia are best avoided during pregnancy. But many a times, especially in high risk cases, a risk benefits analysis need to be done. In the latter situation, the decision to continue therapy is taken after a detailed discussion with prospective parents, review of past history, consideration of co-existing medical problems and physical & mental status examination.Till the time you can actually follow the above recommendations, keep a record of your sister\u2019s diet and motivate her to eat more and healthy food.I hope this answer your query.
