    "question": "I used to post a lot on this forum when I was first pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I experienced a lot of bleeding that started at around six weeks or so.\u00a0\u00a0My pregnancy progressed well and the only thing I had to worry about during it was gestational diabetes, although that went away about two weeks before I delivered.\u00a0\u00a0I delivered our daughter on the 17th after being induced.\u00a0\u00a0(She is healthy and weighed in at 8lb 13 oz.)\u00a0\u00a0One week after delivering, I woke up that morning EXTREMELY short of breath.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't have a cold or anything and thought it was weird that I was smothering that badly out of no where.\u00a0\u00a0I called my doc to get in that day and was told with my symptoms, I needed to get to the ER immediately.\u00a0\u00a0When I got there, the doctor ordered stat blood work and a stat chest CT.\u00a0\u00a0When he told me that it sounded like I had a pulmonary embolus (a blood clot in the lungs), I started panicking.\u00a0\u00a0It ended up that I have several small clots in the lungs.\u00a0\u00a0I was admitted to ICU and stayed there for several days because after my doctor came over to do the admission assessment, they also discovered that I have a condition of postpartum preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0See next post for rest.",
