    "question": "Im 35w4 days. Im a type one diabetic since i was 9 n have chronic hypertension before pregnancy and am srarring to show signs of preeclampsia. Im so miserable and sick and swollen everyday its like im confined to my bed. Some days i cant even get out of bed due to swelling. Ive been admitted to tge hospital 3 times inthe last month n im just so ocer it. Ive tried to ask about the possibility of being induced and the doctors insist on no sooner than 39weeks. Not to mention at my 32 weeks ultrasound they baby was more than 6.8 pounds. I know every pregnancy is different but even my sister who only had diabetes as a pregnancy complications was induced as early as 34 weeks? Anyone else going thru this or have any advice? Thank :)",
