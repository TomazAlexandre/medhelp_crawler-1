    "question": "My wife delivered a baby girl on 11th May on Mother's day. During her pregnancy, she was perfectly healthy & normal and all tests conducted during pregnancy were also reported normal.The delivery was a normal vaginal delivery without any epidural or any other medication. Post delivery, after 2 hours, she had a tonic clonic seizure for 30-35 seconds and recovered on her own. Doctors shifted her to recovery room with oxygen mask and loaded her with Phenytoin thru IV. Then after 2 days, she was shifted to tablet dose of Eptoin 100 mg thrice a day and she is still continuing with it.Before release from the hospital, the Neurologist performed an MRI, which came out normal. Also, my wife carries no history of seizures.please help me:- upto what time should my wife continue with the dose?? and what could be the possible causes of this post partum seizure??",
