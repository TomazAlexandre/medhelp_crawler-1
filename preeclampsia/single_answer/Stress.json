    "question": "Is it really true about stress being harmful to the baby??, I'm 28 weeks pregnant with my first & the entire pregnancy I have been stressed & it makes me feel like a horrible mom because I couldn't avoid it. I had to drop school, my mother kicked me out, I went broke, getting health insurance, I was told my blood screening came back that my baby could of had Down syndrome which worried me (tests came back fine), now I'm being told a screening back & I have a chance for preeclampsia or premature labor, work, putting together a shower & I'm not sure if we're I'm living will still be an option when the baby comes. I love my baby & I really wish she didn't have to fe my pain, I just want her to be born as happy as can be..",
