    "question": "Any one scheduled for a csection? Currently 37weeks 2 days, due May 21 and have a doc appt tomorrow. My doc told me last week, that my baby grew considerably compared to the last measurement 2 weeks prior. I asked him so are you going to schedule me for a csection, he says no we will have you push first and go from there. How do some people end up with a scheduled c section and others not? I would hate to have to push and still get cut.",
