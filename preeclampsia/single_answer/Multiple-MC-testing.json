            "answer": "Hello,First I would encourage you to discuss this issue with your ob/gyn and if you have not, consult with a high risk obstetrician prior to attempting conception.I assume by A&A you are referring to anti-phospholipid antibodies (Lupus anti-coagulant and Anti-cardiolipin ab and Anti-\u00df2 glycoprotein).\u00a0\u00a0These are acquired antibodies that can put women at an increased risk of developing blood clots or blood clot related complications.In pregnancy it has been associated with recurrent pregnancy loss, fetal death after 10 weeks gestation, premature birth due to severe preeclampsia, and placental insufficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Because pregnancy itself increases a woman's risk of developing blood clots, low dose aspirin is a recommended treatment for women with a + test and no history of clots.The blood thinners are used to counter act the propensity to form blood clots.I hope this info is helpful.Best regards,Dr. Downing",

    "question": "I have had 2 MC's in the past the most recent in Aug. 2007\u00a0\u00a0And after this MC I had a D&C and blood work done to see what might be the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Well I was told my A&A test came back positive and my clotting factor is off by one point.\u00a0\u00a0So if I get pregnant I will need to take baby asprin and blood thinners.\u00a0\u00a0 My question is what is A&A and why the need for blood thinners and asprin?",
