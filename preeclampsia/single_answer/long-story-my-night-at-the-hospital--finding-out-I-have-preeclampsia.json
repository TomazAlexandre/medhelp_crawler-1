    "question": "Hoping for the best.. first off I'm supposed to be 37w today, due Dec 11th. Yesterday at my routine checkup, my midwife said she she wasn't happy with how I was progressing. Bub was measuring to small and I wasn't what they considered 'healthy' .. she told me to come back and see the doctor that afternoon and I did. Doctor asked a few questions, I answered and he said he is 99% sure I have preeclampsia and that he wanted to induce me immediately. Meaning that night or early this morning. He booked me in for bloods and ultrasounds and they discovered that I'm actually 35w4d (Supposed to be due Dec 21st.). Someone had changed my dates when I came in for my 20week scan, when they shouldn't have. I was aware of this but didn't question it because after all, I trusted the Dr and as a Ftm didn't know any better. So when this doctor said it was a massive no to do that, I was quite concerned. Anyway, this answered the question as to why bub was measuring small. However, they decided not to induce me as they would prefer they get a few more weeks out of me if possible. Now it's set that I go back every two days for tests and monitoring but what they plan on doing is inducing me by about 38w (the 10th of Dec), if they think I will be okay to last long enough. Incase bub needs to be born via cesarean. Doc said they could do it earlier but it poses risks, they would prefer to avoid if possible so that was the safest option. So yeah.. kept overnight and it looks like everything is okay for now.. back tomorrow to find out what the plan is hopefully. I'm hoping everything goes smoothly now but I think I've got a few rough weeks ahead of me x",
