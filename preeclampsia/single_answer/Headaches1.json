    "question": "I am 34 weeks pregnant and been having headaches my whole pregnancy and have had to be prescribed something for it. But recently I have had kind of high blood pressure so they wanted to see if I had preeclampsia. I did all the tests and they came back negative. Just confused as to why they can't find a reason. Has anyone else experienced this?",
