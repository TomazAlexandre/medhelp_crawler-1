    "question": "Im 39 weeks 5 days. This morning I woke up with a burning sensation in my bladder area. Im worried that I got a UTI? I have also been experiencing extreme fatigue over the last week. Every time I wake up I feel ready to go back to bed. im sleeping almost all day! I have had high blood pressure for the last two doctors appointments, and at labor and delievery last week for my false alarm. They tested me for preeclampsia but it came back negative. Should I still be worried about my blood pressure? And could the UTI feeling just be him putting extra pressure on my bladder?",
