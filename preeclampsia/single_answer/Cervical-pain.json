    "question": "Hello! I am 20 years old, on my second pregnancy. My first pregnancy I had preeclampsia and had to be induced and kept in the hospital because of my blood loss during delivery. I am almost 25 weeks along in my current pregnancy at this point and I have been having some VERY uncomfortable symptoms. I have VERY sharp pains that seem like they come from my cervix whenever I move my legs. It seems to be especially worse when I wake up in the morning, get up after sitting for an hour in my class, or at night when I lay down for bed. The doctors in the town I live in arent very up to date on a lot of things, so I was hoping to maybe get some answers from others on here. My doctor and the high risk specialist I have been seeing are both stumped as to why I am in such terrible pain. I was on bed rest and taking lortabs for about two weeks earlier in my pregnancy because of this issue and it only seems to be getting much worse with time. Any advice for the pain, or advice period on what this might be would be GREATLY appreciated. =) Thank you so much!",
