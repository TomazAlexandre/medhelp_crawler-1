    "question": "I probably misspelled that, but hopefully you know what I mean.I am 25 years old, this is my first baby and I am 27 and a half weeks. I was overweight before, but I've been doing very well. My doctor told me that my BP has been borderline a few times and she wants to get a 24 protein test now. That way if my BP goes up she will be able to test if it's just a raised BP or preclampsia. It scares me a lot to think about. Anyone else go through this?",
