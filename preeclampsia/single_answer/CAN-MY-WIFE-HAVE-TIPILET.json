            "answer": "Hello,Before wanting for triplets you need to consider several risks associated to the health of mother and her babies in a triplet pregnancy. There are very high chances of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. The risk of miscarriage and preterm labor is increased significantly. A baby born prematurely has a higher risk of cerebral palsy, developmental delays, learning disabilities, and general health problems. You definitely should give a thought of accidentally becoming a father of triplets and trying to have triplets. Do consider all the risks and consequences and discuss it with your doctor. Hope it helps.Best luck and regards!",
