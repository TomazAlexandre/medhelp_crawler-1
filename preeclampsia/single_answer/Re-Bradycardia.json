    "question": "Posted By CCF CARDIO MD-APS on August 15, 1998 at 15:28:55:In Reply to: Bradycardia posted by Shannon on August 12, 1998 at 17:25:02:I am a 24 yr. old female with a heart rate of aprx. 44 bpm. This seems to have started after the birth of my first child in 1993, with wich I suffered with preeclampsia. I've been doctoring for about 5 years for symptoms of fatigue, mental fogginess, weight gain, hair loss,\u00a0\u00a0etc.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms present as hypothyroidism, but when checked, all levels are within normal limits, all blood tests posible are normal.\u00a0\u00a0Echocardiogram was normal, 24 hr holter test was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I live in a rural area and I am fed up with not getting any answers from my physician.\u00a0\u00a0I've been told I suffer from depression and CFS.\u00a0\u00a0You'd be depressed too if you were 24 and felt like, well I suppose, a 100 year old.\u00a0\u00a0Can you give any suggestions to other possible causes of Bradycardia and what my best course of action should be?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time I'd appreciate any suggestions.~Steamless___Dear Steamless,Firstly, this is certainly not a case for the country doctor, and secondly it isvery possible (regardless of the cause) your bradycardia is causing your symptoms, anduntreated these can lead to depression.\u00a0\u00a0Many times bradycardia requires a pacemakerinsertion, as only highly trained athletes are able to fully function with a heart ratein the 40s and 50s.\u00a0\u00a0If your heart rate also does not respond appropriately to yourattempts to exercise, then again a pacemaker is almost always required.\u00a0\u00a0Just so youknow, a pacemaker insertion is a procedure, not an actual surgery, and you are awakefor the entire procedure.\u00a0\u00a0The type of cardiologist you need to see is an electrophysiologistwho specializes in rhythms of the heart.\u00a0\u00a0Since a very few but definite patients can have signsof hypothytroidism and yet not have the corresponding lab abnormalities, it would greatly benefityou to also see an endocrinologist, which is an internal medical doctor (internist) who specializesin abnormalities of the hormones of the body.\u00a0\u00a0Now since these are no where near common diagnosis thatjwe are discussing, you need to go to an academic/major medical center that has a medical school, asthese are usually the centers where all the difficult cases go to.\u00a0\u00a0You are much too young to be feeling asyou do and things will only get worse if these symptoms are left untreated or simply placed in the 'grab-bag'diagnosis of CFS without a full and proper work-up that preceeds such a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck.\u00a0\u00a0Unless yourinsurance company says otherwise I would suggest you see these two specialist that I spoke of without going toa general internist first.Information provided in the heart forum is intended for general medical informational purposes only,actual diagnosis and treatment can only be made by physicians with whom you seek care.",
