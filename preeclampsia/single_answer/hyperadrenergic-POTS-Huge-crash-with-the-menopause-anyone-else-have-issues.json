    "question": "I guess my story is similar to alot of people out there. I originally suffered from my first bout of pots at the age of 20 after a bout of glandular fever. I was rushed into hospital with suspected heart problems and spent a week there with many tests etc.\u00a0\u00a0At the end they said although i clearly had an issue they couldn\u2019t actually find anything wrong and i was sent on my way with propanolol to calm things down.\u00a0\u00a0 After about 6 months things did settle and for the most part my symptoms where not an issue. Roll on 4 years and my second pregnancy. It nearly ended in death for both me and my son due to fulminating preeclampsia . I was never right again as ME/CFS quickly kicked in and left me struggling to do the most basic of tasks with 2 small children. At the time i didnt know what it was and just got the usual.. oh you have small kids your just tired etc, so i carried on as best as i could for 6 years until one day i just couldn\u2019t take another step and ended up back at the docs in a state. I was diagnosed with GAD given meds and sent on my way.\u00a0\u00a0Then 3 years ago at the age of 43 i had another serious collapse that put me back in bed but this time i had a whole new list of symptoms to go with it. After the usual tests i was diagnosed with CFS/ME, and i can\u2019t tell you what a relief it was to finally be taken seriously and to know i wasn\u2019t going mad.\u00a0\u00a0Roll on again to the February this year after yet another collapse after a bout of swine flu and i decided to do alot more research and that\u2019s how i cam about POTS.\u00a0\u00a0After another trip to the docs and explaining my life to him he agreed there and then that i most definitely had POTS which for me was another huge relief as it finally explained all he weird symptoms i had been living with for most of my adult life.I\u2019ve had a rough year with my health and now I\u2019ve just finally stopped my periods and the pots has kicked in like never before. I have hyperadrenergic POTS which causes anxiety neck pain stiffness ontop of the usual POTS issues. I was just wondering if anyone has had the same issues with change of life etc?",
