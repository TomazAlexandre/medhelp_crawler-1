            "answer": "I have had several friends that have been induced for this- sometimes the high blood pressure can come on without any history of it- they do induce pretty quickly when it comes to high blood pressure- there are just so many risks.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you can have preeclampsia with no protein in your urine.Complications from high blood pressure near delivery can include- a decrease in blood flow to the placenta, the placenta separating from the inner wall of your uterus- which can be an issue that results in death for you and baby, and it can even lead to future heart disease.I'm not a fan of doing inductions unless they are needed- so I can understand wanting to find out more.\u00a0\u00a0I'd give your doctor a call and ask them more questions so that you are comfortable with what's happening.Let us know how you and baby are doing!",

    "question": "I'm 38 weeks and 4 days.\u00a0\u00a0I went for my check up today and for the first time ever, my blood pressure was a bit high (144/80).\u00a0\u00a0The doctor figured I had just rushed in to the appointment so he said the nurse would check again after he was done with me.\u00a0\u00a0Oddly enough, my blood pressure went up when they did the second check.\u00a0\u00a0Because of this, he wants me induced a week earlier than what was planned.Has anyone had this happen before and know why I need an earlier delivery?\u00a0\u00a0This is baby #2 for me.\u00a0\u00a0No preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0No protein in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0No history of high blood pressure.",
