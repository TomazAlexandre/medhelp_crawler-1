Its not more than any ither pregnancy and my blood pressure is fine so I'm not conerned about preeclampsia. My question is, does anyone know a remedy?\u00a0\u00a0The normal taking. A rest and laying on my left side only works for short amounts of time. I have three children so that isnt a good solution for me lol. Any suggestions would be welcome! Oh and as a side note I do not eat sodium caffine or sugar in excess and drink lots of water!",
