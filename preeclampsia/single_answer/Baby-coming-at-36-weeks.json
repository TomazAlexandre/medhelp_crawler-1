    "question": "I'm 29 weeks pregnant now and went to my obgyn today.. I've had protein in my urine since 17 weeks which is signs of preeclampsia but haven't been diagnosed with preeclampsia because no other symptoms have occurred, my bp is good, no headaches with blurred vision and not much swelling other than the occasional puffiness. My doctor is way concerned and has sent me to a specialist to be watched along with she has sent me to a kidney Dr. Neither doctor is concerned about the protein because I don't have no other symptoms of preeclampsia but her, she's the only one that seems to think at 32 weeks I need to start doing steroid shots for the baby to be sure the baby's lungs are mature and that she wants to do a scheduled csection at 36 weeks. I'm concerned because at our local hospital they don't have a nicu and I don't want to be in a different hospital than the baby and they would have to transfer the baby to a nicu hospital, I also am very nervous that I'm not going to be able to breastfeed if this is the case. We have nothing ready for the baby and now she says my baby may be here in the next 8 weeks. Any input on this to help ease my mind is appreciated!",
