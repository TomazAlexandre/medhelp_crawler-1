    "question": "I went to the doctor yesterday for my 37w apt and my countdown went from 17 days to 5 days in less than an hour.I've been developing preeclampsia and since baby did so well on the nst, doctor decided there's no reason to wait. She's scheduled my c section for Monday at 8am. I understand its what's best for my health and that baby's not at risk, but I'm still feeling a little down that I won't be getting my vbac. And on top of that, I have so much I want to get done before the big day. I'm just feeling anxious and very much overwhelmed.",
