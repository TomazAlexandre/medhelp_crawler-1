    "question": "So I'm nearing the end of my pregnancy and I am just feeling totally overwhelmed and not myself. I have preeclampsia and have been on bedrest till I deliver. I've had to get state assistance bc I'm not able to work and now have the stress of bills on my mind.\u00a0\u00a0I can hardly fit into any of my clothes comfortably, and have a horrible head cold/cough. My fiance\u00a0\u00a0is trying to be positive and supportive but I just push him away bc I don't want to burden him with what he already knows. I feel unprepared, alone, and can't stop crying. What can I do to overcome these feelings?",
