    "question": "I was having a really good day enjoying the day with my guy he took me out to lunch did some shopping, and went to our baby apt. But the apt didn't go like I was expecting, evidently im way to dehydrated and then to top it off my blood pressure was really high and they tested it a couple times but it didn't get better.\u00a0\u00a0Now I have to do a urine collection this weekend because shes afraid of me getting preeclampsia,\u00a0\u00a0or she said because I have a history of high blood pressure she said it has to be monitored closely since im in my third trimester and if it doesn't get better I will have to deliver him sooner than expectd. Now im all worried and just bummed out in general",
