    "question": "I'm currently 34 weeks. The past few weeks I've had very high blood pressure and swelling, but no signs of protein in the urine, no preeclampsia. I went in Wednesday to check my blood pressure, and it was high again (155/97), so they did a non stress test. Baby was moving fine. Today, I felt very little movement. Hardly any at all :/ I have an appointment tomorrow morning. Should I just wait it out until morning?",
