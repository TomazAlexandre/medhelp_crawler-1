    "question": "So yesterday I had my 6week check up and my husband and I had sex 4 weeks after I gave birth. Csection. We took it easy and made sure I was hurting. I healed pretty quick. The doctors told me. I did have have preeclampsia though and my c section was not one to remember. Anyways I was wondering if there's a possibility that I can be pregnant again. I got the birth control shot yesterday too. We used condoms. And twice we didn't,but\u00a0\u00a0he pulled out. Please no negative comments I'm a first time mom.",
