            "answer": "I'm 31, and I too developed preeclamsia during my pregancy and was in the hospital for two months and had a pre-mature birth at week 31. 3lbs, 4oz, but my son is now 6 and doing great.\u00a0\u00a0During this time my kidney's also went into shock.\u00a0\u00a0However I too have had many of the symptons your describing and have had severe edema ever since which no one seems to know why. I have seen cardiologist, neurologist, orthopedic, accupuncturist, chiropractors, uroligist, physical therapist, blood tests, MRI's, CT's, Sonograms, Ultrasounds, x-rays etc...I think I have had almost ever test done.\u00a0\u00a0I have the same problem as you do with bowel movements, let alone severe migranes, joint pains in neck, back, ankles etc...my primary doctor has actually told me \"what else do you want me to do for you\"\u00a0\u00a0I truly understand what you're going through. I'm now scheduled to see a Nephrologist to check for a kidney disease, back to a cardiac surgeon and a Rehumotologist.\u00a0\u00a0I've done some research on my own to get this far - best bet is to also see a Rehumotologist and a Nephrologist also.\u00a0\u00a0They can check for various diesease's of the kidneys that could cause the swelling and for autoimmune diseases as well.\u00a0\u00a0Most of my other symptoms from my research seem to point to Fibromyalgia, but this too doesn't explain the swelling I have.\u00a0\u00a0All I can tell you is be persistant with your doctor, the more persistant you are the more gets done or at least you can rule out what it's not.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck.",

    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I am 35 years old, about 75 pounds overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I had my 4th child via c-section in October.\u00a0\u00a0I developed preeclampsia during the pregnancy and was in the hospital from week 31 to his birth one day short of 36 week's gestation.\u00a0\u00a0No other PE in prior pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0I have had lower leg edema prior to pregnancy, during pregnancy and still have it.\u00a0\u00a0I had blood tests done to check for kidney and liver problems.\u00a0\u00a0My alkaline phosphatase (sp?) was 130, 11 days postpartum.\u00a0\u00a0The tests were repeated in December and my physician's nurse called to say all tests were normal.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my cardiologist for an echo and that was normal.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday I go to my doctor for a standard re-check and am told my alkaline phosphatase was 160, high is 150, on the test I had been told were normal.\u00a0\u00a0He wants to wait 30 days and re-test.\u00a0\u00a0I ate just prior to this test, but the family doctor says that is fine.\u00a0\u00a0I have had re-ocurring digestive and bowel movement problems since December.\u00a0\u00a0I either have diarrhea or I struggle to have a complete bowel movement.\u00a0\u00a0I had my thryoid tested and it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I do have bouts of fatigue as well, but not severe.\u00a0\u00a0Two years ago I had extensive work-ups by a GI, I had a hydra scan, CT, MRI, ultrasound and endoscopy after an ER visit showed \"sludge\" near the pancreas that resolved.\u00a0\u00a0What could be going on now to cause the labs for alkaline phosphatase to increase?\u00a0\u00a0Should I insist on more immediate testing?\u00a0\u00a0I am scare of this being something ominous like cancer or a tumor.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.\u00a0\u00a0My family doctor seems very non-chalant about all of this.",
