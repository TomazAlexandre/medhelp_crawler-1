            "answer": "Mine didn't go to HELLP but I had severe preeclamplsia with my first. Started at 28wks, delivered at 35wks. This pregnancy I was considered high risk from the start and begain aspirin and calcium at 6wks but they found I have mild preeclamplsia again at 15wks. So far we've been managing really well with bp meds but I will be delivering early again just not sure when depends when it stops responding to meds. Currently 24wks and everything is looking good. The downside of having it twice is that I have a 90% chance of it happening again with a third so this will be our last baby and the damage to my kidney and liver will mean I wont be able to go on oestragen nedications such as the contraceptive pill. This is just what my dr has told me tho. What would love to hear what other people in the same boat have been told. Wishing you a happy and healthy pregnancy!",
