            "answer": "This is my 2nd time with preeclamplsia. The swelling sounds like a side effect of the gestational hypertension to me, but my dr didn't start medicating me for my bp until I had a couple of consecutive readings above 140/90 over a week. I would expect your dr to monitor you a bit closer now and maybe check babys growth a little more often. Wishing you all the best!",

    "question": "This is my first baby and I noticed this past Sunday that my feet were really swollen. Whenever I pushed on them, indentations were left. The swelling was still quite bad on Tuesday\u00a0\u00a0so I made an appointment to see my doctor who took my blood pressure and checked my urine. My BP was elevated and I had minor protein in my urine. Of course, my DR. sent me straight to the maternity ward to check for preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0They did blood work and took my BP again (which was lower than it was at the DR) and monitored our little buddy. His movements and heartbeat were excellent. The DR. told me that it wasn't preeclampsia and that the swelling was totally to be expected. Today however,\u00a0\u00a0while the majority of the swelling is gone, my feet are still swollen.\u00a0\u00a0Has this happened to anyone else?",
