    "question": "I am 6 weeks and 2 days and at my appointment today they did a urine and it was positive for protein. They are sending the specimen to the lab and she will call me if it comes back abnormal. Anyone else experience this? Apparently it can be quite common. I don't have any symptoms of a UTI. I'm hoping to wont lead to preeclampsia later on. Thanks!",
