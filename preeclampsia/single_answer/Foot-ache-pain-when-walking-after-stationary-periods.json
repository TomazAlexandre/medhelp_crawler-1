    "question": "Hello - 4 months ago i gave birth to twins - as a result of IVF i am 40.\u00a0\u00a0I had preeclampsia and ended up having an emergency c sections.\u00a0\u00a0Babies are well.\u00a0\u00a0I had loads of pregnancy symptons but have developed a new issue since they were born - although i dont know whether it is connected.\u00a0\u00a0When i wake in the morning i have quite alot of trouble walking its like a painful ache in my feet, also happens when i have been stationary for a long period.\u00a0\u00a0Disappears after about 10 minutes and then i am fine.\u00a0\u00a0Asked my doctor and she didnt really have any ideas however she did send me for some blood tests the only result which came back is that i have a vitamin D deficiency and i received a very standard letter from the doctor saying i should take supplements, have had no further correspondance with the GP.\u00a0\u00a0Have started taking the supplements for last 2 weeks but am not noticing a difference - the letter was standard and hence\u00a0\u00a0dont know whether they are saying this is the reason for the problem although obviously it is something which needs to be addressed.\u00a0\u00a0 i had no problems like this during pregnancy or before.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts much appreciated am a bit concerned about it.",
