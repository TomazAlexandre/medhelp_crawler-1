    "question": "So the other night at work i was experiencing some issues, which i work at a hospital so one of the other nurses sent me to the ER, turns out my blood pressure was high. So i had an appt with my ob yesterday and she admitted me to the hospital since my pressure was still high, 153/89, but since here it has been fine, and i am doing a 24 hr urine sample to rule out preeclampsia. Anyone else experience this? And this is not the first time it has happened at work, just the first time i did something about it.",
