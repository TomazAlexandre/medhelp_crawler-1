    "question": "A year and a half ago I had an emergency induction to deliver my (full term) second child b/c of preeclampsia. Blood pressure did not go down immediately after delivery and medication was not helpful. While in the hospital, I experienced partial vision loss, severe neck and head pain, and a feeling of \"unrealness.\" An MRI revealed PRES. A second MRI 3 days later\u00a0\u00a0indicated that the swelling in the parietal-occipital lobes had decreased dramatically. For weeks during and after this incident, I had the most horrifying sensations that I could not describe adequately, and I now wonder if they were parietal seizures. There was this overwhelming \"feeling\" that started in my stomach and rose rapidly through my chest, kind of like a chill but much much worse. I would have these rhythmic gasping sounds that I could not control. I did have a fever during the first few days of these incidences, but the gasping and weird sensations continued for days after the fever went away. It would ease my mind greatly to know if these were in fact parietal seizures due to PRES, because if they were, then I would never have to worry about it happening again, whereas if they were due to a fever, I am terrified that it might happen if I ever get the flu or something! Thanks so much!",
