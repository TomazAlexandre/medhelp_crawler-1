            "answer": "You should have your dr check for causes. It may be nothing, or it may be something like preeclampsia. In my 7th month of my last pregnancy, I had only gained 12 lbs total, but in that month alone I gained 18. Turns out I had preeclampsia. But, if you have had dietary changes or decrease in exercise it could be that too. It's just always better to get checked out by your dr though :)",
