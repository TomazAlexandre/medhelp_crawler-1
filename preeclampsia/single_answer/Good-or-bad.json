            "answer": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is alright.\u00a0\u00a0Especially since you've yet to gain any weight.\u00a0\u00a0They (the doctors) do typically have a formula but all women are different.\u00a0\u00a0I gained a good deal of weight during my pregnancies but I was under weight to begin with.I also had high blood pressure with my first pregnancy. They check urine ever visit for protein which is a sign of preeclampsia so they are watching that, I'm sure.\u00a0\u00a0If your blood pressure climbs and you have pitting of the skin (you push into an area that has swelled with your finger, take it out and the imprint stays there for a while), they'll put you on bed rest.Hang in there.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",

    "question": "I'm 24+1 and since last week I've gained 4-6lbs. Up until then I hadn't gained a single pound. I'm just curious to know if that's okay or maybe too much weight in such a short period of time? I have high blood pressure and I'm worried about developing preeclampsia.",
