    "question": "Posted By Esther on March 07, 1999 at 22:18:13:I am 34 yrs old and have had migraine headaches since I was 19 yrs old.\u00a0\u00a0Until right before my pregnancy in 1995, the only medication I took was Fiorinal (plain and with codeine).During my first pregnancy, my headaches worsened, especially in my first trimester.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that I took for them was two Aspirin-Free Excedrin...and that did not help.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that a max of 300 mg of caffeine daily is safe during pregnancy (Excedrin has 65 mg per caplet).\u00a0\u00a0Is that true?\u00a0\u00a0I have also tried Tylenol, Advil, and Alleve to no avail.\u00a0\u00a0I had preeclampsia and delivered my first child at 32 weeks. Now, I have begun taking Prometrium because I recently had a miscarriage at 7 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Since we are planning on a pregnancy my question is: Could you give any recommendations on migraine headache medications and/or prophylactic medications that are safe to take during pregnancy?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for any suggestions that you may have for me.",
