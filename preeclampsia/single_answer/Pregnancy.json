I got pregnant with my first child and everything was good with my pregnancy then towards the end of my pregnancy I got preeclampsia at 37 weeks and had a emergency C-section. and then I found out three months later I was pregnant again. so now im 16 weeks pregnant. and its been a healthy pregnancy so far, but now over the past two weeks I been very dizzy to the point where I cant walk and if I do I feel like im going to fall over. and I just feel very sick like as if something is wrong with me. not in a way im going to vomit just a ill feeling. I been to the hospitial twice and they didn't care. they said everything is fine they did blood work and a ultrasound and everything is normal. but I just don't feel right at all, like something is very wrong. I don't know what to do I never felt this way with my last pregnancy. and my blood pressure is kinda high to its around 135 over 76 and goes up to 150 over 95. and im taking blood pressure meds but they seem to be not working well.. and I have not went to any baby apps yet cause of money reasons, so im just starting to go now that I have the money. please help. and thank you",
