            "answer": "_Dear Esther:Migraine headaches are associated with contractions of blood vessels. They are highly variable in their frequency and quite unpredictable in pregnancy: some women get better and some worsen.Migraine headaches may respond to non-medical therapies: lying down in a dark room; ice or warmth applied to the temple or neck areas.Most medications, including pain medications, have not been scientifically evaluated during pregnancy. Hence, they do not carry a label of safety: rather, there are simply no reports of harm and the decision to use the medications is based on need.Tylenol with codeine is a very common prescription because we have a lot of experience with the agent; it seems to work against a lot of pain types; other than constipation and drowsiness, the agent is well tolerated.A few agents used in the treatment of migraine headaches (ergot compounds) are known to be harmful to pregnancy.Progesterone has a quieting effect on blood vessels and may be helpful to migraine headaches.300 mg of caffeine represents 3 cups of coffee and there are studies that suggest up to 3 cups of coffee had no influence on the outcome of pregnancy.Keywords: migraine headache, pregnancyThis information isprovided for medical education and is not a consultation.

    "question": "I am 34 yrs old and have had migraine headaches since I was 19 yrs old.\u00a0\u00a0Until right before my pregnancy in 1995, the only medication I took was Fiorinal (plain and with codeine).During my first pregnancy, my headaches worsened, especially in my first trimester.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that I took for them was two Aspirin-Free Excedrin...and that did not help.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that a max of 300 mg of caffeine daily is safe during pregnancy (Excedrin has 65 mg per caplet).\u00a0\u00a0Is that true?\u00a0\u00a0I have also tried Tylenol, Advil, and Alleve to no avail.\u00a0\u00a0I had preeclampsia and delivered my first child at 32 weeks. Now, I have begun taking Prometrium because I recently had a miscarriage at 7 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Since we are planning on a pregnancy my question is: Could you give any recommendations on migraine headache medications and/or prophylactic medications that are safe to take during pregnancy?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for any suggestions that you may have for me.",
