    "question": "I had my son in august 2010 the pregnency was fine up until birth. I had to have an emergency sesection. Ended up having Preeclampsia. I have had an on again off again period since then. Somes been alot of brown discharge and then sometimes alot of blood but always something. I went to my obgyn and got put on birth control a month ago. Nothing yet has changed. I don't feel tired. Just some cramping in my back now and then. My sister suggested it might be that my walls aren't able to build up the blood for a period to start it just keeps crumbling you could say. Does anyone have an idea what it may be or should i take a certain vitamin?????",
