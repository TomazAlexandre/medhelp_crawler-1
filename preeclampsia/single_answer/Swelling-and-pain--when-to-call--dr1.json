    "question": "I know this question has been asked a lot in some way or another but it's different when it is you lol.The past few days I have had BAD swelling all the way up to my knees and my hands are SUPER puffy as well. Along with the swelling my legs are soooo sore, they feel like I ran a marathon (I've never done that lol). They are also kinda tingly and I am loosing color in spots, like there is no circulation. The swelling finally went down over night but now I have only been up for an hour and my feet have been elevated the whole time and I can already see them swelling again. I had bad swelling at this point with Noah and it never escalated into anything bad (if that matters)I HATE calling the Dr. for silly little things so I am wondering if this is ok or if I should give him a ring. I wouldn't be able to get there today since Joe has the car so would it really even be worth calling him?Also, yesterday I was sitting down and I looked up and it was like someone had just taken a picture, I saw flashes everywhere. I have not been loosing any protein in my urine and my BP has been good so I feel like I really shouldn't be worried about preeclampsia but I saw my sister go through it so I am pretty scared as I saw what it did to her.",
