    "question": "My 15-month-old daughter had an MRI done last Wednesday of her brain. Since around birth, she has been behind in her motor development, has been diagnosed first with torticollis, then with brachial plexus palsy, and then with left-sided hemiparesis. She has had trouble with eating and was unable to eat even mashed foods until 12 months old. Her oral speech is behind. She is just starting to babble, but is very good with gestures. She also has a lot of problems with balance. Her doctor thinks she may have cerebral palsy now which is why he ordered the MRI. We got the results today and they show white spots on her brain. The doctor is sending us to a development specialist next month and said that he would explain it better to us then, but I am pretty worried now and would really appreciate a better explanation of what white spots on the brain means and how they got there in the first place? Do white spots occur on MRI results in people with cerebral palsy or could this mean something else? Could this happen if she had a stroke? (She did not show any weakness at birth and was moving her left side in video taken right after she was born and her head was straight. By the next day, her head was tilted to the left and no longer moving her left arm. This is something that I have been worried about because the nurse from the WIC office made a comment a while back that she walks like she had a stroke. I did have preeclampsia with her.) Any information would be greatly appreciated.",
