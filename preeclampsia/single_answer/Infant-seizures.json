            "answer": "Hi there. A family history of neonatal convulsions may suggest that the infant has a genetic syndrome usually these are benign and disappear within the neonatal period. Your doctor should check your pregnancy history in detail. a positive history of TORCH infections, history of fetal distress, preeclampsia, maternal infection, the type of delivery and antecedent events, APGAR scores, postnatal history including neonatal hypocalcemia, sepsis suggested by temperature and blood pressure instability, rubella and absence of immunization can provide insight into the cause. The seizures need to be checked if focal or generalized, clonic, tonic or generalized tonic seizures, myoclonic seizures or infantile spasms. You need to get your daughters checked up in detail by a pediatric neurologist. Hope this helps. Take care.",

    "question": "I have 2 daughters who both had seizures when they were babies.... Jo, my almost 3 year old, had seizures 5 minutes after being born and then had them off and on til she was 6 months old.. she underwent every test the docs at Loyola could think of and they never found a reason for them. And so they said that no more of my babies should have seizures. 19 months later I had another baby, Belle who is now 15 months old, she had seizures 15 mintues after being born until she was 3 months old and they ran every test they could think of too; still no answers for their seizures. Any ideas?",
