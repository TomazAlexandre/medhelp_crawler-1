    "question": "My son is 3 years, 3 months old.My son was born 2 months premature due to Preeclampsia (toxemia) his urethra never fully developed. My son had surgery in July of 2010 for Hypospadias, the surgery went great, and only took a month and a half to fully heal. I was told by his pediatrician and urologist not to even attempt to potty train him until he was fully healed, because he would have to learn everything all over again. I started potty training in the beginning of September of 2010, he is now three years old..and still not remotely interested in using the potty. I've tried everything I can think of including rewards, taking things away (toys & Tv privileges) and acting not interested in him using the potty. I've tried letting him sit on the potty until he does his business, but it makes him not want to do it even more.A lot like the other stories on here, my son loves telling me \"No\" he's not going to use the potty, and doesn't want to.I guess what I'm asking is for some new suggestions, I've read many books, and got movies for him, he just doesn't seem to be grasping the idea.\u00a0\u00a0I really appreciate it!",
