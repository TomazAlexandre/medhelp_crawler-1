    "question": "I'm 37 weeks and 3 days today. When I went in for my weekly appointment yesterday, my bp was 150/70 and the nurse gave me the urine cup and said she was going to retake my bp when she came back. Well, 5 min later, she checked and my bp was 130/90. And my urine came back with protein plus 1. I've had severe swelling in mostly my right calf, ankle and foot. But my left calf, ankle and foot have been swelling as Well. I've also had a severe headache, light anomalies in my vision as well as more blurry than usual. (I have an astigmatism in both eyes, prior to becoming pregnant). I also gained 12lbs in the last week. My doctor ordered me to do the 24 hour urine test. I have to be at L&D at 9am Wednesday.My question is if anyone else has had these issues, done the 24 hour urine test and had your results come back normal?I've had a very difficult pregnancy this time around. This is my second child. My first son was breached and I had my appendix removed when I was 18 weeks with him because it nearly ruptured. But other than that, I only had bad indigestion. This time around, I have had severe congestion, so I can't sleep in my bed because one nostril always stuffs up. I've developed an explosion of rashes all over my body (not puppps or anything because it's not on my belly). I've got indigestion as well. So I would LOVE to be delivered on Wednesday!I'm just wondering what to expect on Wednesday when I go in to L&D to turn in my urine jug. Would they possibly keep me overnight for monitoring and schedule a c-section a couple days later (I had a c-section with my son, so they will not induce me because of the risk of tearing scar tissue) or would they do an emergency c-section? I'm thinking that with my symptoms, I'm definitely preeclamptic.Anyone know what might be in store for me?",
