    "question": "Hi ladies. I'm 36 weeks 1 day and I went to the doctors today and I had high blood pressure. I had to go to the hospital for more tests. My blood pressure went back down a little and now I have to be monitored ever 2 days. I am just wondering if any other woman on here have had blood pressure problems. Does it go up slowly or did it just randomly go up? And if so how are you doing ?thank you!",
