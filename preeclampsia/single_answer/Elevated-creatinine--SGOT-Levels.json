            "answer": "If that is indeed your creatinine level, you should have an urgent visit with an internal medicine physician. You are correct. Normal levels are in the 0.5-1.0 range. Levels over 3 need to be verified, but usually go along with long term diabetes or chronic hypertension and kidney failure. I am not an internal medicine physician, but 4.7 is quite abnormal. Please get it checked out without delay.",
