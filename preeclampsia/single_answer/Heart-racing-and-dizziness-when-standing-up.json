            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A high blood pressure in pregnancy can be harmful both to mother and to the baby. Your gynecologist is right. Ideally the pressure should fall while standing up. This could be due to the pregnancy itself (blood pressure rises in pregnancy and then goes back to normal) or it could be due to preeclampsia. Presence of a high blood sugar in pregnancy associated with a higher blood pressure can cause further problem. Please go back to the gynecologist or seek another opinion regarding this. Both the high BP and high sugar will have to be managed in order to avoid complications in future. Take care!",
