    "question": "HI Everyone -I've always posted in the thyroid forum, never here -but I wasn't getting any answers, so I hope it's ok to post here.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have experience with thyroid issues and pregnancy?\u00a0\u00a0I have recently been diagnosed with graves disease and am 6 weeks pregnant with my second child.\u00a0\u00a0I had the thyroid problem with my first -just didn't have a name for it then.\u00a0\u00a0Everything I've read and am told, is that I'm at a much higher risk for miscarriage, preeclampsia and stillborn babies.\u00a0\u00a0The reason I'm worried is because with my daughter, I was already SO SICK by now, my boobs were soar, I KNEW I was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0But with this one? Nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I have some mild lower abdominal cramping on top of it so I'm wondering if I'm going to miscarry?\u00a0\u00a0IS it something that you can \"feel\" coming?\u00a0\u00a0And when do miscarriages generally occur?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much, I'm just kind of a nervous wreck right now.",
