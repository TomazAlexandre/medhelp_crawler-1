    "question": "Anyone been induced due to Gestational hypertension? I was diagnosed at 28 weeks and Dr has been freaking out and is stressing that she only wants me to make it to 37 weeks at this point. I'm currently 35 weeks tomorrow. Anyone else been through this or something like it? I know she is trying to get him full-term before possibly turns to preeclampsia and the chances go up the farther you get.",
