            "answer": "I snore and have swollen feet and ankles but haven't been diagnosed with preeclampsia. My doc says the swollen feet n ankles is just from working and being on them too much and I attribute the snoring to the season and sinuses. From what I've read preeclampsia also causes swelling in the hands and face which I don't have and my bp has been normal. When in doubt ask your doc to check on it. Can't be too careful!!",
