    "question": "Hi,I am in need of some information. I have seen doctors and specialists and all are coming up with something different. My last appt, my gastro looked at me (I'm overweight) and said that I probably have fatty liver but decided to order an ultrasound along with some blood work. I will provide you with some background on abnormal test results from my recent last 2 visits:Alkaline Phosphatas 111GFR >60Iron 19TIBC 484Iron Saturation 4%Hemoglobin 10.4Hematocrit 32.8MCV 67.2MCH 21.3RDW 20.8RDW:Moderate AnisocytosisModerate MicrocytosisModerate PolychromasisSlight Target CellsAlso, all of my Liver Enzymes are all elevated. Heps and auto-immune came back negative.My Radiologist letter from the doctor states that the findings were limited due to body habitus but here are the findings:There was a slight increased liver echotexture may be due to hepatocellular disease, including steatosis.Borderline spleen size (12.7cm) indicates portal venous hypertension, amongst other causes. Please clincally correlate.A hypoechoic structure seen near the porta hepatis could represent a small lymph node.My doctor just did a gastroscopy and found that I have asophogus inflammation. I asked about my ultrasound results and he looked confused when I questioned the letter and said that I have fatty liver disease, he doesn't know anything about what letter I was talking about.Please help. Should I be demanding more tests incase this is more serious, is there something else that I may have? My symptoms all correlate with fatty liver (hair loss, headaches, stomach pain, mood changes, forgetfullness, fatique, trouble waking up, lower back pain) but the letter concerned me. Any help or suggestions is really appreciated. Thanks.P.S. On another note, I'm not sure if any of this relates but in the last year and a half I have had:Preeclampsia, Pregnancy Induced Hypertension, C-Section, Pancreatitis, Gallstones, Gall Bladder extraction, I retained my placenta for half a year and had a D&C, Bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infections, gastroternitis x2, H. Pylori x2, Insulin Resistance post-pregnancy, Severe anemia post-pregnancy",
