    "question": "Hi ladies, im currently 17 weeks pregnant and was diagnosed with high blood pressure a month ago after going to the doctors with severe migraines that lasted for 3 weeks! I had no swelling or protein in my urine when I was last tested but have just noticed swelling in my ankles last night its not alot but I have been having these occasional headaches aldo. My questions is for any one who's had pre eclampsia how much swelling did you get? I know you generally dont get pre eclampsia until after week 20 onwards but im just concerned because I already have pregnancy induced high blood pressure.",
