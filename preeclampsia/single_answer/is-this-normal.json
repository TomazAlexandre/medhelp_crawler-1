            "answer": "Ask for a pulmonologist...I have asthma too, and it got worse with the pregnancy, and it can be a fairly serious complication if it's not monitored and controlled correctly. They've told me that it's possible I may even be bedrested in the third trimester, and sometimes they have to induce early if the baby's not getting enough oxygen...again, you're going to need a specialist's care for that in particular to make sure the medical treatment you get is the best for you and the baby. My pulmonologist confers with my regular OB for my treatment. Don't try to tough it out while you're pregnant, that's what I normally do but this is a whole different ballgame.",

    "question": "I am 8wks pregnant with my fourth child, i have asthma and allergies.I am wondering about some weird symptoms i have been having.My mood levels are out of control, it doesnt take much to either make me amd or cry and i have moderate to severe swelling in my legs mostly at my ankles, my kidneys even hurt but my guess is maybe a kidney infection!? Also i am feeling very congested in my chest where i cant breathe good or feels like i cant get rid of the wheezies. Any advice or info would be greatly appreciated!! Also i hav had preeclampsia with my first where i was inducer at 38wks and my third i was already at 41wks and was induced immediately .
