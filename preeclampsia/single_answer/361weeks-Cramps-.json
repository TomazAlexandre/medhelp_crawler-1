    "question": "I woke up at 6am with a cramping feeling. I'm not sure why but its been going on for 7 hours now... I dont believe they're contractions because they don't come and go. They've been steady, same way it would feel if you were to get your period and also my legs are sore and in pain. Not sure what this is?",
