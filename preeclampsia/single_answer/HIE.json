            "answer": "Hi. Paralysis and dysarthria can develop with severe neurologic injury, most especially when the brain is poorly oxygenated during prolonged ventilation assistance and cardiac resuscitation. Various forms of therapy like occupational, physical, speech and nutritional therapies may help strengthen muscle tone, mental activity and immunity. However, it might be best that you discuss these options to your doctor for further medical advice. Hope this helps.",
