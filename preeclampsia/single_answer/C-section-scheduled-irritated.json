    "question": "So I am having my third c-section after my first was preemie twins, then my last daughter had to come in spite of my wanting a vbac by c-section, I had preeclampsia and they won't induce vbac. So now I'm stuck with another c-section...My irritation is that my Doc can't perform them at my hospital but can assist the docs on the hospital payroll. Plus... They scheduled my c-section for when I am 40 weeks and it happens to be the first day of school. I teach (not that I will start my class this year), plus my daughters will be at school. I want to send my kids off to school and plus I don't want my newest addition to have to have a birthday on the first day of school. Have any other ladies had success with requesting a different date for c-section? The damn hospital docs look at pregnant ladies as an endless line of money on a conveyor belt... My Doc is awesome but it ***** I have to go through these other docs for having my baby too...",
