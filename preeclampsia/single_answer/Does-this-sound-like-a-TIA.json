    "question": "First of all i'm only 20, so already experiencing a lot of doubt from others that i have had a TIA. I am also 37 weeks pregnant with my second child. Last thursday i got what i thought was a regular migraine, i get them every now and then. They start with visual disturbances and then the head pain sets in. This started the same way, and i felt very drowsy.\u00a0\u00a0Soon i started to get tingling in my hands and my face, like just above my lip and my speech was making less and less sense.My partner decided to take me to the hospital, by the time we got there i could not recall my full name, my sons name, my address, where i was.. I was very confused and couldn't put words together. The doctor apparently asked me to put my arm in the air, squeeze his fingers, and other various simple tasks but at the time i could not understand or register what he was asking me to do whatsoever. It was like i couldn't hear him or he was speaking another language. this all happened for about an hour, then gradually things started to come back to me, when the doctor repeated all his questions i could now answer them. He was baffled. I can recall almost the entire event, although it's a big blur.Since i am pregnant they were concerned i had preeclampsia and so i was kept in hospital overnight and the following day for mutliple tests. It was not preeclampsia. I was sent home without any answers. TIA seems to be what fits my symptoms most, but again i am doing my own research here since they were happy to send me home and say it was just a migraine.It's been 5 days, i have very slight head pain still, especially with abrupt head movement and it's mostly on my left side, a feeling of pressure beside my temples. Very slight.I also feel extremely fatigued, i have had naps every day since and i find myself feeling kind of airy in the head as though my thoughts are slightly slower or i forget what i'm going to do sometimes. I'm curious if anyone thats had mini strokes have had similar experiences or different. I will be seeing another doctor but i am fully expecting to be shut down about TIA. I just don't want to miss a warning sign if this is it.Thanks",
