            "answer": "During pregnancy your TSH should be target between 1-2. As I know hypothyroidism in pregnancy can affect the neural development of the fetus. If hypothyroidism isn't treated it can be responsible for elevation of prolactin and that can be responsible for infertility...., but I think there is more miscarrieges the first 3 months (because of the neural development of the fetus that is affected) with not treated Hypothyroidism\u00a0\u00a0but if you control it before pregnancy it isn't a problem...TSH of 5 is a subclinical hypothyroidism and I think it should be treated (as you have been doing) if you want to get pregnan (must target your TSH to 1 -2 ) . May be some people overhere have practical expierence about this and can give you some more advices.",
