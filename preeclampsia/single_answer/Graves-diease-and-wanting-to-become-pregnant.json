            "answer": "Hi there,1.\tIn women with Graves\u2019s disease the disease should be well controlled before pregnancy is planned. Poorly treated or uncontrolled Graves can lead to problems like preeclampsia, placental abruption, and miscarriage in the mother. It can cause problems for the baby like prematurity, stillbirth, low birth weight etc. During pregnancy, you will need to see both your obstetrician and an endocrinologist.2.\tRadioactive thyroid is used to treat an over-active thyroid gland, to reduce thyroid activity caused by nodules and as an alternative to surgery. A woman should avoid conceiving for six months, after radioactive iodine treatment. A woman who had radioactive iodine to treat Graves' disease in the past should tell her\u00a0\u00a0doctor since your baby will need careful watch for thyroid-related problems which may occur in the later stages of pregnancy.It is best to discuss all your doubts with your doctor before taking any decision. Do keep me posted with more queries. Best luck and regards!",

    "question": "I\u2019ve just been diagnosed with graves disease and started taking\u00a0\u00a0Neomercazole. Thing is I\u2019ll be 42 soon and have been trying to get pregnant the last 6months.I\u2019m supposed to be having RAI but I\u2019m reluctant as then I\u2019ll have to wait a year before I can start trying again .My big fear is not been able to get pregnant after as that will throw me into 43 to 44 bracket and the fear of become infertile all together. My gut feeling is to put of the RAI and just see if the meds get me up to speed to help me fall pregnant and then just put the RAI on hold altogether. So I\u2019m just wondering1.Has anyone found it easier or is it possible to fall pregga\u2019s whilst on meds with graves disease!!!2.Or does RAI increase my chances of been able to conceive and I\u2019m better of putting bubba on hold!!!Please some advice anyone=)",
