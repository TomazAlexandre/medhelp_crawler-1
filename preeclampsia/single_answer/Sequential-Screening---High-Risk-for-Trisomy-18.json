    "question": "Good morning... I am 19w5d with my third child - first was a graduate of a NICU in PA... labor started at 19w.. at 26 hard labor with mag to slow - daily shots of turb and she finally came after a nasty UTI I had went undetected as I was on bedrest the entire time at the hosptial and she devloped e-coli.. she only spent 10 days there... Son was full term with dialation and contractions starting at 20 weeks, but had a cerclage.\u00a0\u00a0This pregnancy - clerclage in place at 12weeks.. but this time I did the bloodwork which for downs came back at 1/10000 trisomy 18 was 1/78.. PAPP-A and HCG were low and something else was high.\u00a0\u00a0The company that does the test does not factor a good level2 US in to play or the fact I occasionally smoke ( I have cut back and am trying to quit.. did not smoke with the other two) - my question is those levels... can they be seen in a mother with a risk of preterm labor and or preeclampsia.. from medical journals that I have read I see a corrlation between those levels and preterm labor and preeclampsia occuring.... I understand taht Trisomy 18 is \"not compatiable to life\" and understand that if the baby has it and makes it to live birth I can expect a passing within the first week so I am opting not to get the amnio as with my history of preterm labor I see the amnio as an unneeded risk to the baby for my own knowledge... nothing to help her... The genetic counsler I was assigned is a paid employee of the company that conducts the testing so I feel her feedback/information is a little .... well lets just say a conflict of interest.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time...\u00a0\u00a0Melanie",
