    "question": "I had an induction date set for next week on Wednesday, but due to symptoms of preeclampsia and my GD I am now getting induced tomorrow morning. I am fully effaced and 3cm, so Dr said he will try to kick start labour by just breaking my waters. He did a membrane sweep today and because my blood pressure has settled he has sent me home until tomorrow morning on strict bedrest and that I come in immediately should anything feel diff!!It's all very overwhelming, as my first was a natural labour. It just seems that now I have the opportunity to over think everything... Guess I won't be sleeping tonight. I have to be at the hospital at 6.45 am....Excited and nervouse as all get out.",
