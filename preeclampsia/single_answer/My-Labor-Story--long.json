    "question": "She's Here !!! \u266118 years old, FTM to a beautiful baby girl! She was born 8 lbs. 5 oz. on April 7th (:I was having contractions ALL day (April 6th) and they were kind of painful, but not unbearable, I didnt know they were real contactions, and i didnt want to go to hospital on the off chance that it was B.H., but at around 8:30 pm, my fianc\u00e9, his mother and I ended up going to the hospital because the pain just wasn't going away. Then, when the nurse checked me, I was already 7-8 cm. dialated. My heart dropped because I knew that the moment was finally here. They thankfully were able to still give me the epidural! (I have a very low pain tolerance, so I wasn't even going to try to go all natural,\u00a0\u00a0haha) and that epidural helped me SO much. I didnt feel the contactions anymore, and I only felt pressure for the pushing.They needed to use a vacuum to get her out, and I found out afterward that I shouldve had a c-section because of how big she was compared to my body.. so, needless to say, I tore REALLY bad. And they knocked me out to stitch me back up because the epidural had worn off by then. I also found out afterward that I was borderline preeclampsia, and was having some blood pressure issues...but my baby is COMPLETELY healthy, and im recovering quite nicely. \u2665",
