    "question": "Posted By Eliz on August 14, 1998 at 18:44:23:I am a 38 years old and it has been 17 months since I was diagnosed withperinatal cardiomyopathy (nullipara). I was three months post-partum at dx.My first echo demonstrated an ejection fraction of 35% coupled with mitraland tricuspid regurge & an O2 sat rate of 98 %( I had preeclampsia &tachycardia during pregnancy, and the baby was delivered a month earlyby emergency c-section). I was placed on 12.5 mg lopressor bid ( not carvedilol- though it is being investegated @ the teaching hospital where I am followed).My last echo in June was termed \"nl\" with an ejection fraction of 60% andcontinued regurge..My exercize tolerance has always proved to be excellent( I passed theupper levels of the stress test early on, and I have been on a progressiveexcersize & diet program ( I had gained 125 lbs due to the preeclampsia)to the point where I can now jog for 30 mins at the gym along with therest of the aerobic portion of my program ( I average 2.5 hours @ the gymthree times a wk, -\u00a0\u00a02 of which is spent on aerobics - I still have a heartrate restriction of no > 140 bpm - I wear a monitor at the gym), and allsymptoms of CHF that I originally presented with ( SOB, chest pain,passing out, lethargy)have vanished, - except for the tachycardia-resting hr is ~ 70's, - walking down a hall is ~109-116).I have occasionalrebounds after I finish sometimes where my pulse will jump up 10 or sopoints, - stay there, - and then down.Throughout the course of this illness, I have recieved differing opinionsre: recovery and the prospect of future pregnancies. The literature is notfull of outcome studies ( though I understand one is underway here inBoston) re: women who have had perinatal cardiomyopathy and attempted asecond pregnancy. Trivia: when I was initially dx'd my materials weresent from my Internist to Dr. Young's attn @ Cleveland, yet neither shenor I recieved a response despite her phone contact & letter and ourconfirmation that my materials were recieved (I had planned to travel toCleveland for evaluation, - but since we never heard anything - ? ).I continue to be treated at a major Boston teaching hospital where theopinion is that 2nd pregnancies are possible, and at the institution whereI am being followed, - it has been done.I would be interested in anyone's take on this, and anyone's experienceor ideas re: this illness.I would also appreciate any studies/journal articles that you ( whoever )could steer my way re: recovery and outcome. The 1970's African studies aretoo old.Many Thanks,Eliz",
