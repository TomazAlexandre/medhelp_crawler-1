    "question": "I am a 37 year old white female.\u00a0\u00a0I had a baby almost 6 months ago (July 2010).\u00a0\u00a0During my pregnancy I felt fine (I do have chronic hypertension which was well treated during my second pregnancy, although I did have preeclampsia with my first in Set 2008).\u00a0\u00a0About 2 months after my son was born I started feeling \"not right\".\u00a0\u00a0Muscle cramps, what felt like bone pain, back pain, fatigue, stomach aches, daily headaches. I thought it was just the stresses of having a newborn and a 2 year old but I decided to go to my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0She ran several labs and my liver enzymes came back elevated - twice as high as they should be.\u00a0\u00a0During my pregnancy they were lower and normal.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I have had a barrage of lab tests - all normal but the abnormal LFT's and elevated ANA. a liver biopsy was ordered due to the ANA being elevated and that only showed \"mildly dilated sinusoids\".\u00a0\u00a0My GE doc ordered an echocardiogram looking for portal hypertension but it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a normal US, MRCP, abdominal CT scan with contrast and venogram.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a lupus scare in the past but my nephrologist (who is treating me for the hypertension) did a renal lupus blood test and \"no news is good news\".\u00a0\u00a0I have also been diagnosied with sjogren's syndrome in the past but the things it can cause to the liver was ruled out with the biopsy (so my GE doc said).\u00a0\u00a0I have seemed to have gotten a little better but my enzymes were still twice the normal limit in December (it had gone to TRIPLE in October).\u00a0\u00a0I still have extreme fatigue (my baby has been sleeping through the night since 3 mos of age so that isn't it) and stomach discomfort.What I am wondering is what other tests could possibly be ordered, if any?\u00a0\u00a0Is there something I just haven't been screened for?\u00a0\u00a0This is frustrating me and with 2 small boys - the oldest only 2, I want to get this resolved and treated if it needs to be!",
