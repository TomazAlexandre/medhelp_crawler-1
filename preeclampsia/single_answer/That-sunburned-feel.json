    "question": "Around my 34th week of pregnancy I began to swell all over, mainly my feet. Within a 2 week period I had gained 15 pounds of water weight. This concerned my caregiver so I was given a 24 hour urine test and blood test to see if I might have preeclampsia. Everything checked out fine and my blood pressure is still within normal levels, but I continue to swell (hands, face, feet, and especially my left foot) and gain about a pound every other day. I also feel like I've been sunburned. My whole body is red, tender, and I feel feverish (exactly like I had stayed in the sun too long). The areas include my scalp, my hands, the soles of my feet, and my eyelids. I don't go out in the sun and have been slathering on the sunscreen. When I asked my nurse about this 'sunburned' feel, she says it's probably just my skin stretching. Do you have any suggestions as to what might be going on?",
