    "question": "To sum up my backround, I have had two miscarriages and two extremely premature babies who lived 3 weeks and 1 day (different pregnancies) due to severe preeclampsia. I found out I was pregnant pretty early on...about 3 weeks. I was put on prometrium and baby asprin immediately due to blood test results. Progesterone levels were low and I had an abnormal anticardiolipin results. I have had moderate to severe cramping in my left lower quadrant since I found out I was pregnant and spotted 2 days the day after I found out....being that I was on birth control when I found out and have endometriosis, the doctor chalked it up as that. I continue to have the left lower pain and when I went for an ultrasound Monday (5 weeks 2 days) only the gest sac was found, which I realize is quite normal. There was a large amount of fluid on my left ovary too. I was given another quants test. The next day I went to urinate (after orgasm, no intercourse) and there was bright red blood as though I was having my period. I stayed off my feet the remainder of the day and the bleeding immediately turned into moderate brown flaky spotting. I went back yesterday two days after the first ultrasound to redo the quants and the doctor order another ultrasound because of the bleeding. They found the same thing...gest sac only, and most of the fluid on the ovary was gone. I asked the doctor if the bleeding could be from that and he said no. He suggested I am either too early to see the baby because I have an inverted uterus, or it could possibly be a blighted ovum. The results of the quants went from 9900 to 1800, so they put me on pelvic rest and not much physical activity until next week Wednesday for another ultrasound. I am still spotting brown flaky blood. The waiting game ***** I know, but I am wondering about other women's stories similar to mine. Oh also, the gestational sac measured 5 weeks 3 days so it was really right on target with the previous ultrasound. And going through my previous four pregnancy ultrasounds I have never been given one before 6 weeks 5 days. I know there is more than one possibility. Just wondering what other women had for outcomes in similar situations.",
