            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear that you had two miscarriages. You have to identify the time during which you had these miscarriages. Usually they occur during the first three months. A miscarriage can be very traumatic and I can understand your apprehensions. Each pregnancy behaves separately. Also some causes of miscarriage are related to that pregnancy alone. Some causes tend to recur and you must be careful about these. Generally first trimester abortions or abortions occurring in first three months are due to fetal abnormality, genetic causes, Rh blood group incompatibility and low progesterone hormone. Infection of the uterus, endometriosis, fibroids, etc\u00a0\u00a0are some other causes for early abortion. Diabetes, eclampsia, preeclampsia, infection, Rh incompatibility, cord accident, placental insufficiency, small for age baby etc are the various causes that should be looked into if miscarriages happened after three months. You need to consult your gynecologist and run some tests to rule out these causes.Eliminating these causes will increase the chances of carrying the pregnancy forward.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",
