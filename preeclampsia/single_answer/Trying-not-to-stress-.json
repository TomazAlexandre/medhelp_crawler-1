    "question": "I'm 20 weeks today Yay! I have my ultra sound tomorrow double YAY! The thing I'm trying not to stress about though is the fact that my baby could possibly be here in the next 15-16 weeks. The problem is I developed preeclampsia with both of my other two kids and I'm so worried in going to have it with this one and this time my uterus is tipped backwards and I'm worried I'm going to have to hVe a c-section. I just want this pregnancy at the end to be normal routine be miserable and the whole deal and over due and complaining about it and deliver when this baby says it's time and not cause my BP is way high. I'm also worried I'm not going to know when I go into labor if I do make it full term as I've only ever been induced. Ugh pregnancy issues i know",
