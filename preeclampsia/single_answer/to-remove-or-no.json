    "question": "I have been having bouts of nausea, pain in shoulders, neck, back ,right rib area diarrhea after some meals wt gain, dizziness off balance feeling, ect. since 2009. I have even had chills.\u00a0\u00a0I just thought it was a flu bug or stomach bug and then at 18 wks preg it got worse. Dr thought I had inner ear, and then was sent to hosp for increased heartrate and dx with POTS. I also had preeclampsia during the end of preg so that's why my ob doesn't agree with the POTS dx.\u00a0\u00a0Dr claims this is the answer. I wasn't convinced so my OB sent me for HIDA and came back at 8% functioning. They sent me to surgeon and he did colonoscopy and endoscopy to rule anything else out since I wasn't having the regular bouts of pain like gallbladder does. HE put me on omeprazole and sent me to GI DR and he said I had IBS and no to surgery. Still having issues. I have hypothyroid but is under control with meds. what are your thoughts?",
