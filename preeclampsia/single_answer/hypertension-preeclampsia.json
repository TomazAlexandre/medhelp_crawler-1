    "question": "I'm 34 weeks and 4 days. I've been on bedrest for about a week now for high blood pressure. But at my last appointment (Thursday) my blood pressure was stable. I have another appointment Monday to get the results of my 24 hour urine test. My doctor said he's likely to induce me between 37-39 weeks. Has anyone else had to deal with this? Did you make it to full term?",
