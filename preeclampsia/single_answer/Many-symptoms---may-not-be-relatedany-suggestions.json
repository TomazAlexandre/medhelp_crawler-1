    "question": "I am a 31 year old female with a very clean medical history,\u00a0\u00a0I have only had 2 stays in the hospital..one to deliver my son ( I spent 5 days in for preeclampsia), and one to remove my gallbladder which was diseased.I have recently noticed a group of symptoms that I cannot seem to control on my own.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a fever off and on for the past 2 weeks reaching no more than 102F.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a sinus problems, which is not uncommon for me, I fight with my sinuses constantly and have for years.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a dry cough for about 10 days which wakes me up at night.\u00a0\u00a0I cant expel anything from my chest, but I can't stop coughing to the point of triggering my gag reflex.\u00a0\u00a0My airway feels very tight and restricted in my chest and the coughing seems to \"stretch\" it out, if you will.\u00a0\u00a0I have had around 6 straight days with a severe headache that comes back each day.\u00a0\u00a0Tylenol barely takes the edge off.\u00a0\u00a0I also have bouts of dizziness and blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0It actually feels as though my eyes can't keep up with my head movement. If that makes any sense.\u00a0\u00a0I turn my head and it looks as though every thing in the room is spinning in circles trying to catch up to the position of my head.\u00a0\u00a0This even occurs when I lay down and close my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0The blackness that you see when your eyes are closed seems to spin and swirl around.\u00a0\u00a0This is very nauseating.\u00a0\u00a0I have pain in my eye sockets when I move my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I just attributed that to eye strain because of the vision issue.Also, over the last week or so, I have noticed that when I sit down, I feel a pulsating vibration in my left leg.\u00a0\u00a0I first noticed it when I was sitting outside and I thought that someone had a vehicle running and that I was feeling vibrations through the gound up into my leg.\u00a0\u00a0But this continued in the house and has lasted for days.\u00a0\u00a0It still hasn't gone away.I have been noticing that I am having some memory problems too.\u00a0\u00a0I don't remember things as well as I could 1 year ago.\u00a0\u00a0I can't seem to put my words together properly when making a sentance.\u00a0\u00a0It takes me a while to actually get out what I need to say.\u00a0\u00a0If I am reading something out loud to someone, I usually read quite fast - language has always been my strong suit - but now when trying to read I run words together slurring my speech and making absolutely no sence.\u00a0\u00a0This is very frustrating to me because I have always been very proficient in this area.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't happen all the time, but my husband and I do notice the change.Also, possibly not related to the other symptoms, I have had an irregular heartbeat since I was a teenager.\u00a0\u00a0It got much worse when I was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0It improved after the baby was born, but 13 months later, the palpatations and skipped heartbeats are happening again very regularly (2 or 3 times a day).\u00a0\u00a0Just makes me nervous to have my heart feel as though it stops beating, I lose my breath, and then my heart beats 2 or 3 times very hard and fast seeming to be trying to catch up the beats it lost.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what is going on with me, if anything at all.\u00a0\u00a0It may all just be in my head, as they say.\u00a0\u00a0I do have some hypochondriacs in my family and I don't want to be making a mountain out of a molehill, but I would like some answers or at least some advice.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance.",
