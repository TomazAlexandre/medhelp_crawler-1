            "answer": "While you may have an increased risk of developing preeclampsia, if you're blood pressure is under control and you are followed closely by your OB or high risk OB, you are creating the best chances for yourself for a good outcome. Your medical condition including your kidney condition should be evaluated completely before getting pregnant. I wish you success.",

    "question": "How exciting...we finally decided we are going to try to conceive...no more \"it isn't the right time\"!\u00a0\u00a0We tried last month and while we didn't think we would get pregnant right away, my period started 5 days late...YIKES.\u00a0\u00a0I guess that is when it hit me that I need to get my own health under control in case we do end up getting pregnant right away.\u00a0\u00a0Here's my problems:1)\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with HTN (I'm only 25) and am currently taking metoprolol (which is a class C drug).\u00a0\u00a0I have an appointment with the doctor next Thursday and plan on switching to Methyldopa (maybe a CCB later in the pregnancy).2)\u00a0\u00a0I had kidney stones at the beginning of this year.\u00a0\u00a0I had laser lithotripsy and they were removed (calcium oxalate), but I did have protein in my urine (I can't tell you exactly how much).\u00a0\u00a0I noticed it was cloudy, but didn't think anything about it until the UA came back positive for protein.3)\u00a0\u00a0With the two aforementioned problems, I am concerned about developing pre-eclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Is it a definate?\u00a0\u00a0I really don't want to have to deliver prematurely at 28 weeks!So I guess I am just unsure about what this means for us since we want to have up to 4 children.\u00a0\u00a0Will I never be able to carry full term?\u00a0\u00a0Let me know if you have any tips!Thanks!",
