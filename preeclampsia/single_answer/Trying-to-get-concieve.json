            "answer": "I think you're at a higher risk than someone who's had a normal pregnancy prior; but from what I've read, it depends on the severity of the preeclampsia you had in your previous pregnancy. I would probably discuss this further with your doctor.Either way, most doctors recommend waiting a little longer before trying for a second child, so your body has a chance to fully recover from your previous pregnancy before starting a new one. I think they usually recommend 12-18 months in between.Good luck with everything!",
