            "answer": "What about using an excercise bike or swimming? It might be more comfortable, although I am no expert. I do know there is a lot of salt in random processed foods (look at the ingredient label under the nutrition facts) Fresh is best. If it came from the ground or an animal it is good.You might be doing this already, but frequent, little sips of water is better than chugging a bunch at once.I hope you do better.One last thing, I dont know if you are religious at all, but Our Lady of Guadalupe is patroness of the unborn. My extreme morning sickness lessened after I asked her to pray for me. Just throwing it out there, with no intent to insult in any way. :)",

    "question": "I went to the doctor last Wednesday and she doubled my blood pressure meds and told me I needed to come back once a week so she could monitor me because she is afraid that I am developing preeclampsia. I'm only 30 wks and terrified that something is going to go wrong! I'm already high risk and the doctor refuses to listen to me. Every time I try to explain how I'm feeling or what is happening she says the same thing every single time. Drink more water, eat less salt, walk more. I don't eat salt, I can't stand the way it tastes, if I drink any more water I think I might drown, and walking is hard considering all this medication leaves me feeling lathargic and weak. Any advice or reassurance would be fantastic. <3",
