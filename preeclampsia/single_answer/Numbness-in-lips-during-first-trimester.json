    "question": "Late last night the right half of my lips became numb. They felt like I had just been to the dentist. It lasted for about 10 minutes and then slowly went away. Everything I've seen online has talked about this happening in the third trimester as preeclampsia or bells palsy, etc. But I'm only 9 weeks pregnant. Does anyone know if this is something I should be concerned about?",
