    "question": "Hello Everyone!I am very happy to have found this forum.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a lifetime of weird syndromes and disorders.\u00a0\u00a0My husband jokingly refers to my condition as the 2% Syndrome, because it seemed like everytime I was diagnosed with something new the Dr. would say that only 2% (or 5%, or 10%) of the population have it.\u00a0\u00a0I have been telling my husband for years that they have to all be related.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody gets several rare conditions independently.\u00a0\u00a0It just doesn't happen.\u00a0\u00a0But, no Dr. I've seen has ever been able to put the pieces together.In 2005, I was diagnosed with Anti-phospholipid Syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0My Doc suspected it because of a previous unexplained miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr. put me on aspirin therapy.\u00a0\u00a0However, he didn't know that you shouldn't give asthmatics aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up in the hospital with only 73% of my oxygen intake making it into my veins.\u00a0\u00a0IF YOU ARE ASTHMATIC, ASPIRIN CAN BE DEADLY.\u00a0\u00a0Okay, moving on.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up moving to another Dr. because my original said that he didn't know enough about it to help me.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciated that.In 2006, I started fertility treatments.\u00a0\u00a0I have PCOS and do not ovulate regularly.\u00a0\u00a0I started Clomid and did three months before stopping.\u00a0\u00a0It made me crazy.\u00a0\u00a0Seriously.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, while I was seeing this Dr. he ran another anti-phospholipid panel and I came up clean.\u00a0\u00a0We put the pregnancy in God's hands and moved on.Nov 2009 - \"Honey, aren't you glad we never had kids.\u00a0\u00a0It's just the two of us.\u00a0\u00a0Let's go on a diet and get into shape and start really enjoying life\"Day after Thanksgiving - start Atkins DietDecember 2009 - I get pregnant - haha I jinxed myself.\u00a0\u00a0All those years of crying and being jealous of those mothers who reproduce like rabbits, and I get prego one month after I decide I don't want to anymore.\u00a0\u00a0Go figure.Jan 10 - I find out I'm pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Wow.Jan 11 - I leave work early because I almost faint at work.\u00a0\u00a0I immediately schedule an appt with my Dr.\u00a0\u00a0and she puts me on light activity and I go on short-term disability.Later in the Spring, my OB retests me for APS and again it turns out negative.\u00a0\u00a0I start really studying up on it.\u00a0\u00a0I find that there is something called Seronegative APS.\u00a0\u00a0You can have it and not test positive for it.\u00a0\u00a0I do this big presentation for my OB and she refers me to a hemotologist (sp?).\u00a0\u00a0I have MS like symptoms, but no MS.\u00a0\u00a0The Blood Doc is very rude and insists that I don't have APS, but since I've paid for the appt., she says that she will run some blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0Some.\u00a0\u00a0They pulled 12 vials of blood.\u00a0\u00a0I think she overtested me out of spite.\u00a0\u00a0I return two weeks later and she is singing a very different tune.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have APS, she says, but I do have Multiple Thrombophilia.\u00a0\u00a0I have MTHFR and Prothrombin gene mutations.\u00a0\u00a0I also have low protein S.\u00a0\u00a0She says that these increase my clotting factors, but otherwise should not impact me.\u00a0\u00a0I have found out since then, that is not true.August, I am induced at 37 weeks because of preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I have a very hard time and end up having an emergency c-section.\u00a0\u00a0My Little Man was fine except for a little jaundice and a shortened neck muscle.\u00a0\u00a0I, however, was not.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up spending a total of 10 days in the hospital because of dangerously high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0We finally got that under control.\u00a0\u00a0I had a tough recovery, but Little Man is seven months old and very healthy.\u00a0\u00a0He is showing signs of having Livido Reticularis, but Doc says he looks normal.\u00a0\u00a0I am having him tested this weekend for the mutations.This week, I finally listed out all the conditions that I have (off the top of my head) to see what are the common denominators.ScoliosisMetabolic SyndromePCOSMultiple ThrombophiliaMTHFRProthrombin gene mutationBasilar MigrainesSeronegative Antiphospholip ?ArthritisEczemaLivido ReticularisDermatographiaAsthmaAllergiesBack PainSciaticaI started cross-referencing all of these and came up with a common thread.\u00a0\u00a0Homocysteine.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone of these problems can be attributed to high levels of homocysteine.\u00a0\u00a0Then I remembered that MTHFR can cause high levels of homocysteine.\u00a0\u00a0Wow.\u00a0\u00a0I am on fire to learn all I can about this.\u00a0\u00a0I downloaded both \"The H Factor\" and \"Could it be B12?\"\u00a0\u00a0I highly recommend both of these books for anyone dealing with this.",
