    "question": "Posted By Kristen on March 16, 1999 at 14:52:35:I am 29 years old and 26 weeks pregnant with my second child.This pregnancy has been uneventful so far.However, with my first child, I had an emergencyc-section (due to preeclampsia) in December of 1997.\u00a0\u00a0The babywas born about three weeks early, had been diagnosed with IUGR,and was a frank breech.\u00a0\u00a0I was also put on bedrest at 28 weeksdue to low amniotic fluid, which resumed a normal level almostimmediately.I am wondering how likely each of these elements is likely torepeat with this second baby (i.e. preeclampsia, breech position,IUGR, low fluid), and whether or not such a likelihood will reduce mychances for VBAC, which I'd like to try.Thanks for your help!",
