    "question": "Hi I am 26 weeks with my second girl. This evening I started to have really Sharp pains in my side and lower belly. no matter if I sit on my yoga ball or lay on a pillow it still hurts. I don't want to make a trip to the hospital and they tell me it's nothing. Should I be worried? With my first I had preeclampsia so I kind of freak out when anything happens.",
