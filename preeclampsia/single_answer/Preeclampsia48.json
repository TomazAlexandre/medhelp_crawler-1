    "question": "I'm doing well with my increased water intake (I'm up to 120oz a day), I'm just struggling with food. I don't understand how to get the extra calories that are recommended for third trimester, plus stay under 1000mg of sodium everyday (that was my diet recommendation). Any suggestions?",
