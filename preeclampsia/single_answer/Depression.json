            "answer": "I'm really sorry you are having all these problems. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety myself. I know it is hard to deal with but you should never give up. You've come this far already. Maybe you just need someone to talk to? I know it has helped me to talk about what bothers me. Maybe this is all brought about from your image issues? I had preeclampsia with my first child and gained over 70 pounds in the last months of my pregnancy. I now how flabby arms and stomach (not the same as you, i know) but I have had image issues ever since. Maybe after resolving some of your image issues, you will feel better about yourself and life. Just think of how much you have accomplished already and when you hit the bottom there is nowhere to go but up.",
