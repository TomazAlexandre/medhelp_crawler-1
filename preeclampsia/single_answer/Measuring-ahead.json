    "question": "I am pregnant with my third son. My other two boys have been 8pounders, no complications with pregnancy at all.I switched doctors when I was about 15 weeks pregnant. I had my first sonogram with the new doctor at 19 weeks.At this point, I was told I was measuring ahead. I had a sonogram with my first doctor early on, and I know they gave me a due date at that point of Dec 14th. My new (the doctor I am still seeing) changed it back to the 17th of Dec as of the very first appt with her. Because she went by my period.Background on me getting pregnant, this pregnancy WAS planned, and we were somewhat tracking. I was tracking my periods and had actually used Fertility Friend to track my periods and how they were. When I got my positive, I was \"according to what was my last period, and what was labeled (and still is) as spotting\". I was 4 weeks pregnant when I got my positive, and so my first sonogram was when I was roughly 8 weeks pregnant.So back to my current position. Every single appt, sonogram and regular appt I had been measuring the 3 weeks and some days ahead. My doctor keeps telling me she is not going to change my due date. I am a scheduled c-section for dec 12th. I have been going in for sonograms roughly every two weeks and every time still measuring ahead.I do not have Gestational diabetes, or preeclampsia or anything, other than a \"big baby\".As of today, he is I 38 weeks and 4 days. And I am supposed to be 34 weeks nearing 35 weeks.I do not have a history of going into labor, my older boys were scheduled c-sections, I had my second son a day before his scheduled date, because I went into the hospital and was having BH, well they went ahead and took him that day.This past monday was my actual appt with my doctor, and I was still measuring ahead by uterus, but I had also gained from the last appt, which was two weeks prior, 7 pounds.She has also had me coming in every two weeks for appts since I Was 28 weeks along.Am I not asking my doctor the right questions, is there anything that I should be worried about, should I be worried about being overdue? My doctor has told me everytime I bring it up that she will let me go if I go into labor, but what if I dont, and he is overdue?",
