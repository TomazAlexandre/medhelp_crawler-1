You may get thru the rough patch of pain and decide you're able to go full term, or you could get into even more pain. With what you're experiencing I don't think it'd be a bad thing to do.",

            "answer": "I really empathise with you. I'm 32wks and have been on bedrest most of this pregnancy, I'm very uncomfortable with battling preterm labour, and we were never expected to get past 24wks after I developed preeclamplsia at just 15wks but meds and rest has got us this far. If baby can stay in for another 4wks my dr is doing a csection at right on 36wks because he doesn't want my bp rising any further. He's doing it for baby's sake not mine tho and we will need our peadiatrician and nicu team there at delivery as lungs are still under developed at 36wks but my first was born at 35wks for the same reasons and only needed 1wk nicu so I'm hoping it will be about the same if not less at 36wks. I believe statistics for survival and long term outcomes are better at/after the 37wk milestone. Maybe your dr would be more willing to consider 37wks? I guess you can only ask. I hope the rest of your pregnancy goes smoothly.",
