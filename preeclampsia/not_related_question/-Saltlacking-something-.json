            "answer": "I've read that in pregnancy, women need to retain more water than normal and craving salt is your body's way of helping that process along. In early pregnancy it can be due to progesterone levels or morning sickness as your body's way of replacing sodium levels. I think as long as your Dr doesn't tell you to avoid salt, you shouldn't deprive yourself. Just in moderation.I'm also craving salt on things I wouldn't normally bother. And i never added salt to cooking pre-pregnancy so I'm curious if the gender theory will be correct with me... :)",

And have been eating a lot of soups with saltine crackers.I will def right this down and take it with me to ask my doc when I see him on Oct. 2",
