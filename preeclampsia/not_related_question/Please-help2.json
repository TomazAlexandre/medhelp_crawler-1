    "question": "Hi ladies! Im currently 26 weeks and 4 days pregnant. I feel terrible. Last night i started having a terrible pain in my chest like a wind thats stuck with a huge headache. So we took my blood pressure and it was 160/137. I really had a rough night and struggle breathing. This morning we took my blood pressure again and it is 128/56. I phoned the docitrs rooms and was told it must be my imagination even though I am in agony! Any idea what it could be and how to stop this feeling?",
