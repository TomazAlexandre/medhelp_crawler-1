A NICU nurse told me recently that when your body is under stress such as hypertension that it makes the baby develop quicker and that is why DD did not have any problems. Are you on any meds? Last time, my dr put me on meds when my bp got high and I stayed on them until I delivered. I was in the hospital a week before she was born. The meds help keep the bp in ck for a while then I went into full blown preeclampsia and was induced. Maybe your bp isn't high enough yet to warrant meds? I don't know, but yes if you can make it 34 -35 weeks the baby's lungs will be more developed. You never know my sister develpoed hypertension way before me and made it longer till 36 weeks, guess it depends on your body. Good luck and rest...as long as I was down my bp stayed down.",
