Just make sure you get it at your doctor's office because they have the preservative free shots. The regular dose you get from your employer or quick clinic has small amount of mercury in it and is NOT recommended for pregnant women. It can be quite dangerous if you get a high fever while pregnant. It's really a personal choice that should be discussed with your OB. It was my first flu shot ever and no side effects- just a little red bump at the injection site.",

It also helps your kidneys efficiently eliminate waste products and fluids from your body, which in turn reduces swelling in your ankles, feet, and hands., my 1st couple of weeks I was so tired but couldnt sleep for Restless Leg Syndrome. but now its getting better, and Im finding myself sleeping more on my left sideBig hugs x",

Sometimes I even sit up! lol That's exciting!Being this early in the pregnancy, it is not unsafe to lay on your back, but Scottishmummy is right, your left side is the best side to lay on for those exact reasons. They recommend beginning to lay on your side by the 20th week of pregnancy, but since I am a back sleeper, I have been working on it. It's hard to sleep on your side when you are not used to it!!",

It doesn't have whole protein I don't think, but I get my veggies in. I'm also big on V8s. I have cravings for those. Actually this morning I woke up at 4 am and couldn't beat a craving for a melted cheese and tomato sandwich. I've never even made one before! I got out of bed, ate one, and then back to bed it was! Oh, what stomach support did you end up getting. is it good?Thosenewmans- Congrats on getting off bed rest!Jennie and Everyone- I have trouble with sleep, too. I just read to put a pillow behind your back, between your knees, under your stomach and under your head.

            "answer": "Yesterday the cramps was all day...very dull and light. And then I went to the supermarket and was standing a lot and it got intense. I felt wet, and I was sure I was bleeding, but I wasn't. I wasn't even wet like I thought. Ugh, the tricks of the mind! It wasn't twangy\u00a0\u00a0painful cramps, it was achey cramps, but they got strong until I sat. I actually think they get worse when I put my Cabea stomach support belt on! I think it's happened a few times with that belt.Anyway, I think 15 weeks + (maybe especially for twins) there's a lot more stretching going on. For obvious reasons, I hate the period cramp ones, but I read it is totally normal.I tried on my Babyhugger, and although it isn't fashionable, I think it's the best and will be GREAT in about 4 weeks. I haven't worn it out yet because It's\u00a0\u00a0like a\u00a0\u00a0maternal- teddy- straight- jacket, and maybe I don't really need it yet. But sometimes I think I should get a head start on keeping the babies off my pelvis and cervix.To Everyone: I'm going to post my belly soon (and I'm not that type of girl), but I think it would be fun to compare bellies since many of us our so close in gestational age. Plus Im really curious about other people's sizes. My face will not be part of the pic. It's just not me. What do you think? Too shy? Not interested?",

            "answer": "Ligament Stretching\"During the second trimester, which begins with the 14th week, the muscles and ligaments that support the uterus begin stretching. Around the 15th week a woman will begin to have a belly bump. This is due to the uterus growing enough to extend from its normal position. The ligaments, or tough bands of tissue, have to stretch to accommodate the growing. This can cause pain in the abdomen and pelvic region. Some women may recognize this as muscle pain, but to other women it may feel like menstrual cramping. The pain may be more frequent on one side of the body over the other. Moving, such as getting out of bed or coughing, can activate the pain. Resting and moving more slowly are the best ways to relieve the discomfort.\"Read more: http://www.livestrong.com/article/123182-causes-mild-cramps-weeks-pregnant/#ixzz1eEt8R881",

BUT...,once I got into the \"pregnant, not fat,\" stage of showing, it all changed. I could embrace my new body, and was proud. I love my bigger body now! Im having twins so the showing part happened quickly. In one week ( by 15 weeks), I looked more\u00a0\u00a0pregnant than fat and acquaintances started asking.It also helped that I\u00a0\u00a0was out of the first trimester and could get the gray out of my hair and have my nails done.Personally I think my problem\u00a0\u00a0was also about how society and/or family conditions me into believing that having a few extra pounds is wrong. Because of it, I\u00a0\u00a0was slightly embarrassed, and couldn't wait to look pregnant not fat so I would \"feel\" more accepted. But that's just me. Im not saying this is you at all, your thoughts just got me thinking.I hope that this will help me after the pregnancy while losing weight or even if I gain. Maybe I wont come down on myself for not being the \"ideal\" that is stuck in my head. Anyway... sorry...I'm getting off track.... I think you'll feel great when you have a good bump going. I felt better!",

My husband bought me something specifically for stretch marks but it has vitamin A, which I hear is a \"no\". Strange for a pregnancy stretch mark cream! Anyway, I heard either you get them or you don't and that if you are prone, nothing will really work to prevent them. Did your mother get them? That's a predictor I hear. I just heard to moisturize moisturize moisturize to prevent itching, and if you do get them maybe they wont look as bad???",

This dangerous complication of pregnancy is more common among women pregnant for the first time as well as those who are expecting multiples.Magnesium helps to prevent premature labor by minimizing uterine contractions. It also lowers the baby's risk of cerebral palsy or other developmental disabilities because it protects the developing nervous system, even if the baby is born early.Zinc is vital for the healthy development of the baby's nervous system. Plus, it reduces the risk of infection-whether or not a woman is pregnant. All three of these minerals also help with the common complaints of heartburn, leg cramps, and insomnia.Nature Made Brand makes a Calcium and Magnesium with Zinc supplement which contains, per tablet, 333 mg of calcium, 133 mg of magnesium, and 5 mg of zinc. For nonpregnant women, the daily dose is three tablets. For women pregnant with singletons, the dose is six tablets.For women pregnant with multiples, the dose is nine tablets (sorry-minerals are bulky). I began taking this wonderful supplement many years ago for migraine headaches-and I haven't had a recurrence in years. If possible, take the larger amounts (six-nine tablets) in divided doses.\"",
