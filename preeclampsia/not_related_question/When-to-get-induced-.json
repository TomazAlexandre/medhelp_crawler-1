            "answer": "I was induced at 39 weeks because of preeclampsia. I pray I can be induced again because idk what naturally induced labor is! Ahh! Weirdly enough because of my heart problems I was bedridden the entire labor and delivery so I couldn't leave my bed or adjust to relieve pain. I'd rather be induced because I know what to expect. I'm not sure what to expect with a broken water or plug. I'd probably think my dog peed! Push it out to 41.weeks I'd say. Maybe you'll have a fast natural non induced delivery!",
