            "answer": "I'm not pregnant, but just stopped to give my advice. Number one, first and foremost...you do need to calm down, don't worry so much. You're putting unneeded stress on your body by worrying so much. I was scared SH*Tless when I was pregnant, because I was so worried about miscarriage, still birth, preeclampsia, and all the things that could go wrong...it did me no good to worry, and I'm sure everything will be fine for you. It's not much longer until you have your u/s and I'm sure some of your worries will go away once you have had it, but for now just try to relax and enjoy having just the one baby to worry about...cause pretty soon you'll have twice the stress, crying, diapers (if DD isn't potty trained)...so enjoy your daughter, and giving her all of your attention. And IF there's a need for worry, take it one day at a time...look at the worries you have for just today, and don't think about the future just yet, you're living today right now, not tomorrow, and not yesterday. So enjoy today.",

            "answer": "I can remember going into my pregnancy with my son I was having very similar fears, but Ihad miscarried only once and that was at 4 weeks. I got pregnant the following month after and was really not prepared for the worry and stress! You have a right to worry and I dontthink you are overreacting considering what you have been through, but you do need to try to relax due to the stress you are putting on your body and more importantly on the baby!You said you have an ultrasound next week on the 17th right? Please keep me posted and if you need to chat you can always PM me just totalk or vent! I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers! God Bless!",

            "answer": "It's normal to worry, especially when you've been through the devastation of a miscarriage. Every worst-case scenario runs through your mind. My only advice is to enjoy every single moment you are blessed to be pregnant with this little one. It's all you can do because everything else is out of your hands.Even once you get that first sonogram report that all is well you'll probably find something else to worry about. You're not innocent to the problems that can arise during pregnancy, so that makes it all the more difficult. That's why I encourage you to enjoy every moment and milestone of your pregnancy! Better to look back and say, \"I had a great attitude\" then to look back and say \"I regret not enjoying it more\".And just because your last pregnancy was full of so many issues--- it does NOT mean you'll have those same issues. Each pregnancy is unique and different. Take it easy and sending some e-Hugs your way!",
