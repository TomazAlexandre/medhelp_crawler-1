            "answer": "I'm also taking aspirin every day - but regular dose, to prevent the risk of preeclampsia that I had with my first child.I'm 15 weeks now and been having headaches almost every day lately. Even went to see a doctor once. He recommended 'Tylenol (acetaminophen)' - 1000mg at a time, can take no more then 3 times a day (3000mg max per day). Here in US it comes in 325mg tablets so he said to take 3 tablets at a time, said its safe for the baby.Also for migraines he recommended 'Excedrin Migraine' - it contains same acetaminophen, caffeine, and aspirin. So its safe too.Hope it helps. Does help me with my headaches.",

            "answer": "I developed HELLP while in labor with my first (now 21 months). My ob advised the low dose every day. I was also looking on pinterest about Calmag,which is designed to prevent pre-eclampsia. But again, my midwife said there is a maximum of 1000 MG of calcium a day.To prevent it from happening again, I'm also on a low sodium, low carb, no caffeine, and no sugar (I use Splenda or truvia).\u00a0\u00a0All of which is OB approved. **",
