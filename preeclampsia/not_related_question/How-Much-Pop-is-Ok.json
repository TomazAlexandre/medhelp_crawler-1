            "answer": "The caffeine and sugar aren't good and pop can dehydrate you. Also the caffeine and sugar can raise the babies heart rate. Anything you eat or drink directly links to the baby. I still drink pop but not as much as I used to, try a glass or two of water for each pop",

            "answer": "Skip the coke, Mountain Dew or anything with caffeine as much as possible. No artificial sweeteners, they aren't good for the baby. (No diet pop.) Too much sugar isn't good for the baby either, so try to mix in sips of unsweetened tea or chew on ice\u00a0\u00a0now and then (you can get ice pops or freeze juices or soup broth in ice cube trays). Peppermint, ginger and lemon are all natural anti-nausea ingredients to look for in teas, and they are all caffeine-free and safe for pregnancy.Yogurt contains probiotics that help your digestive system and a ton of calcium; even if you can only get a couple bites in it will help.If soda's the only thing helping your nausea, which it pretty much was for me the first couple weeks, get one with natural ingredients and no caffeine. 7-Up is pretty much all natural these days; some health food stores sell specialty soda brands with natural ingredients.Canada Dry ginger ale is the best soda I've found for pregnancy nausea. It contains real ginger, a natural anti-nausea aid, as well as zero caffeine and less sugar than a lot of competitors.",

            "answer": "I sucked down Canada Dry ginger ale through all of my first trimester like it was water, and my morning sickness wasn't even as bad as some women. The baby is fine, and my health is fine. By the second trimester, the nausea had settled down, and now I rarely drink soda, mostly water and milk.I would say do whatever gets you through, and as soon as things settle work on being as healthy as you can. I would guess if you have a nutritionist and are worried about your soda consumption, you probably live a healthier lifestyle than 90% of pregnant women in America. Your baby will be fine.",

            "answer": "Agree on the saccharin. Aspertame is also dangerous. It is linked to phenylketonuria, a serious genetic disease. It should definitely be avoided in pregnancy. Some doctors will say diet pop is OK because they want the moms to avoid sugar, usually because of gestational diabetes risk, but most contain aspertame and it really is not a safe substitute. As far as I know stevia is OK but I'm not aware of any sodas in the US made with it.I've heard the Mio tastes good but personally I wouldn't recommend it for pregnant moms; took one look at the bottle when it first came out and it's chock full of artifical dyes and chemicals. I'm no health nut but honestly I wouldn't drink it even if I wasn't pregnant. Juice, lemonade, tea, cocoa, vitamin waters, Capri-Sun, even Kool-Aid mixes are all better for you.",

I'll have some every once in awhile and not worry about it, but otherwise just try not to overdose on the sugar (first trimester ginger ale to be excepted). I've found the more the pregnancy progresses the more I just want water, and a lot of it, and the baby's been very demanding for milk lately. That makes sense, since I'm 15 weeks and this is the stage where he's forming his little bones.",
