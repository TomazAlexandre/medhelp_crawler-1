I delivered Marcus at 39 weeks and 5 days. I notice something at 3am (no pain just felt like a feather touching at the bottom of my belly) and by 3:45am couldn't walk. Was at hospital 4:10am and was 6cm dialated at 4:20am. He was born at 5:39am, 3 pushes and he was out. And this was my first pregnancy and had no drugs.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just praying to be that lucky next time.Good luck and don't worry too much.",

    "question": "Hello Ladies,I am 37.6 weeks along so pretty much 38 weeks and am not dialated a darn bitt. With my last pregnancy I was barely dialted to 1 at 39.3 weeks along. Here is my question.....in your experience, if a woman is not dialated by 38 weeks does that mean that she'll go overdue or is more likey to go overdue or does it not matter because someone can be at 0 and dialate to 3 or 4 within a couple hours....just as an example?Also, what were some of your experiences like? I am really hoping that I won't go over 40 weeks because I am not at all dialated now.Thank you for sharing ladies!!!! Have a great day!",
