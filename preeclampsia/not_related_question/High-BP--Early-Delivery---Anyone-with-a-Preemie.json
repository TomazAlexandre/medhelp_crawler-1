            "answer": "Thanks for yoru reply..I am aware of the survival cut off. I was just seeking information if anyone has experience with this. Just wondering about hospital time for the baby, if any. My sister had a baby at 25wks but 3 weeks later the baby passed away. Survival is 50/50 at that age.I am worried that I might develop Pre-eclampsia. I guess we'll find out when I get further along. I'm hoping not. I am seeing an MFM specialist every 5-6 weeks for u/s. So far, the pregnancy is going great. Baby is measuring perfectly. My blood pressure is ok. The last time I went it was 162/88.I am not on bed rest, thankfully. I hope I never have to be. We'll find out in a few weeks.Lisa",

            "answer": "my first was delivered 4 weeks early by c-section due to preeclampsia. While she was able to go home with me, she was tiny! Only 4 lbs 6 oz when we went home. In addition, she had feeding issues due to her prematurity that not only prevented us from nursing, but made bottle feeding a nightmare for the first 4 months as well. However, we overcame these issues and she is a very healthy, extremely bright 2 1/2 year old now.",

            "answer": "I have had all 4 premature, first at 36 weeks weighing 6lbs13oz and he came home in 24 hours with no compilations, second she was 5lbs 5oz and came home in 24 hours with no complications and the third was born at 30 weeks and weighed 3lbs 8oz and came home in 14 days weighing 3lbs 15oz. She only lost an oz and she was on a partial resperator called \"C-pap\" for the forst 10 hours then went to an open crib by 12 hours, SHe nursed the next day before 24 hours and did fine. Girls do better then boys do, babies have a good sucess rate if they can make it to 32 weeks. She was not but did real well. Breasfeeding is best and pumping to help give them the best start. Lots of NICU's actually perscrib it and if you don't pump they will use milk from a milk bank if available. Babies at 34 weeks their brains are only 50% developed so it is the cordination they ahve to learn and regulating body temperature. THey have to be able to breath suck and swallow with out of course forgetting to breath. Most do real well and it is just giving them time to learn. They sleep alot and do better with kangaroo care where you put them skin to skin. It helps get their temps regulated and breathing regulated too. Best of luck to you!!! It is very scary to see tiny babies and espesically ones that are ahving trouble but they are so precious and know your voice and smell!",

    "question": "Hey all.I am now 22w with a boy. I have high blood pressure. I am taking labetalol 200mg daily. I saw my regular OB dr last week. She informed me that I will be delivering 2-4 weeks early. So my Aug. 10th due date will most likely be in July sometime.I'm just wondering if anyone here has a baby that was born up to 8 weeks early. Just wondering if your baby required a hospital stay after birth.\u00a0\u00a0From what I gather, most babies during the last 4-6 weeks are just putting on fat anyhow.I'm just wondering how the baby did after birth? Thanks all :)Lisa",
