Of course I want him to stay in until he's completely developed but I can barely do anything right now due to this pregnancy.",

A friend of mine had preeclampsia and some people get put on bed rest at 28 weeks so yes for those women i can understand. For me however i try not to complain when i have back pain just because i know things could be worse.",

However,\u00a0\u00a0now I was diagnosed with cholestasis that can harm the babies (I'm having 2) if they stay there too long, I just want to have them now!!!! It is horrible 24/7 itching that comes with it. I have bumps all over my body except my face. I never knew itchy could be so horrible!!! Also, my knees hurt so much from all the weight. I basically can not go out anymore and I am on bed rest. If someone could take at least those two symptoms away them I would want to be pregnant for longer!!!I used to feel the same way as this post, but a few things have changed that",

I have been hospitalised a few times with HG for dehydration and starvation and prior to pregnancy I was already disabled with ehler danlos syndrome and PoTS.\u00a0\u00a0I knew the EDS would get bad but at 15 weeks I am already on crutches for my pelvis which is separating.\u00a0\u00a0It is absolute agony and I've been told I'll be in a wheel chair before 30 weeks. I am also doing my PhD at the minute and the HG has affected it. HOWEVER I do not wish this pregnancy to hurry. I already am feeling the baby move and I can't wait to feel the same things I felt with my first. When the baby is out that feeling of just you and her/he is gone and I really missed that. So every day when I feel crap I remember how lucky I am that the baby seems healthy and happy. I went over with my first and she ended up 9lb 3 and I felt heavy and uncomfortable but I never wished her out. I understand the frustration but at the same time when the baby is born most mothers miss that connection.Mums just can't win! lol.",

            "answer": "yes, i totally understand where y'all are coming from. Not everyone has been blessed with a smooth pregnancy and easy going for 9 months.I have indeed had a pretty comfortable and relatively easy pregnancy so far. No morning sickness, no GD, not too much of back pain, and no other major complications. In fact, the pain and sleepless nights are just starting to begin now. My main difficulties in the past 8 months have mainly been emotional and to deal with family members (husband, in-laws, parents, and the death of my dog, etc.), but none of that really had anything to do with my pregnancy.In the end, nothing compares to the joy i feel over every moment and how i like feeling my belly and knowing my baby girl is growing in there. I love being pregnant, and am enjoying this time. And maybe i'm just a lil scared of what's to come after she's born, because i'm used to the current state of things, and parenting will be a totally new experience for me. And i want to do it right!I salute all you women, for overcoming high risk situations, emotional turmoils, medical complications, pains and discomforts during your pregnancies. I know you all are strong and doing the best you can for your babies to be born healthy and happy. We are all blessed with the gift of life, and there's no greater power than the ability to give life to another soul!Wishing you smooth pregnancies and healthy babies!God bless you all!",

    "question": "I see many women who are so done with their pregnancy that they want their baby out already.I'm in week 35, and I'm quite comfortable having my baby girl in my tummy. despite the occasional pain or discomfort, I find it convenient that I can go wherever I want, do what I want, eat what I want.I find it scary to think that after her birth I'll probably be home bound, busy changing her, feeding her, always be around her, handle her carefully and delicately.I'm dying to see her, but I'm also nervous about her birth and life after.looks like pregnancy is the easy part, and the hardest part is yet to come.any thoughts ladies?",
