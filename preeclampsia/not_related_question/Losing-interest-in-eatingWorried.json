            "answer": "My son did lose interest in eating from a bottle, but it was when he started teething and eating solid foods.\u00a0\u00a0From about 5 months old we were struggling to get him to eat from a bottle.\u00a0\u00a0He just liked his solid foods better and still does.\u00a0\u00a0He's 13 mo. old now and we too struggled to get just 20 oz of liquid in him per day.\u00a0\u00a0He's just not a big drinker.But your baby is too young to be teething, and I'm assuming you're not giving her solid foods yet.Has she been pooping and peeing the normal amounts?This would concern me also and it's good you didn't ignore it.\u00a0\u00a0I think you definitely need to call her pediatrician and inform him of this.\u00a0\u00a0(I cannot stress highly enough how important it is to have a pediatrician versus a regular family doctor!!).\u00a0\u00a0This should definitely be brought to his attention.\u00a0\u00a0He will check for reasons she won't eat (sore throat, etc) and go from there.",

            "answer": "I would definitely contact your pediatrician asap as there could be a multitude of reasons your baby's not that enthusiastic about eating- most of them I'm sure not serious. Could be that she's congested, has a sore throat, gas, etc. Best to check it out now and it's very good that you're aware of the situation. My dd only lost interest in nursing; as the other poster said, when she was teething and onto solids.",

The Dr. noticed that her throat looked a little red, so that fact combined with the early morning snotty nose led her to diagnose that Anna caught \"something\", but appears to be getting over it.\u00a0\u00a0She asked us to come back in 2 weeks for another weight check and throat exam.\u00a0\u00a0Her weight gain from last month's appt to this one was very good, thank goodness.I know what you mean about not taking your preemie ANYWHERE.\u00a0\u00a0Anna showed up June 20, with a due date of Sept 6.\u00a0\u00a0She came home Aug 15th, and we didn't take her anywhere until late Sept.\u00a0\u00a0It worked very well for us to hole up in the house and let her get adjusted to everything.\u00a0\u00a0I can't imagine how she caught anything now, since neither my husband or I have anything, and we are basically shut-ins since she showed up.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this is all it is.Everything has been so crazy since she was born.\u00a0\u00a0I had a placental abruption in Blockbuster Video, for God's sake.\u00a0\u00a0(Never going there again) I am just now getting to where I don't constantly worry that she's going to stop breathing.\u00a0\u00a0It's never happened since she's been home, but I do worry about everything little thing.We just need to get through this RSV season and we'll both feel better about our babies.\u00a0\u00a0We did not opt for the RSV vaccine.\u00a0\u00a0We talked it over with our pedi who also has 30 week preemie twins, and she felt that our risk factors were such that we did not have to do it.\u00a0\u00a0I hope she is right about this.\u00a0\u00a0It had alot to do with Anna being born in June and her not going into day care.I agree, it is nice to talk to another preemie mom.\u00a0\u00a0Hope to talk to you again, and good luck to you and your family.-Julie in TexasPS- Anna was diagnosed with mild Torticollis, which is basically a stiff neck/shortened muscle from looking to the right all the time.\u00a0\u00a0If you notice your baby always leaning/looking in one direction, start trying to encourage looking in the other direction.\u00a0\u00a0She is going to have to go to physical therapy for this.",

He has had only a few episodes of stop breathing but many where his heart rates slows which I don't quite understand How can they be breathing and there heart rate slows?\u00a0\u00a0It still freaks me out he'll turn this dusty gray and sometimes get blusih around his mouth.\u00a0\u00a0While we in the hospital they said that they wanted him to go without an episode for 5 days before he come home.\u00a0\u00a0My response was why is 5 days the magical number?\u00a0\u00a0What says that they wont have an episode on the sixth day.The RSV shots are very expensive, $1500.00\u00a0\u00a0here in In. and they are given once a month.\u00a0\u00a0We have 2 kids in school and a 3 yo at home and my husband had just quit smoking the day Joshua was born.\u00a0\u00a0They figure in the relapse possibility, but to his credit he hasn't had a cig since.I had severe preeclampsia and then developed pulmonary edema.\u00a0\u00a0I was on a vent longer than Joshua so I didn't have to see tha on him.\u00a0\u00a0It was 5 days later before I got to see him and he was on just a nasal canon.\u00a0\u00a0One of the NICU nursed brought him to me and held him on my chest but I was still out and have no reculation of it which makes me sick because I can remember my sister being there.They warned me in the NICU that he may have trouble with his neck.\u00a0\u00a0He does like to hold his head just to the right and I have been trying to encourage him to hold it the other way.\u00a0\u00a0His legs are still so stiff.\u00a0\u00a0It amazes me how hard his legs feel at times but I was told that this is also something that preemies do.",

The attending Ped. informed us that it was herniated,but said nothing could be done for it at this time, only to keep a close watch on it? we are worried sick, and could sure use some comments on the herniated navel, other wise she is doing great, she is 3 months old now, and weighs almost 10 lbs,she weighed 4.5 lbs at birth. thanks for this opportunity, and we will appreciate any suggestions.
