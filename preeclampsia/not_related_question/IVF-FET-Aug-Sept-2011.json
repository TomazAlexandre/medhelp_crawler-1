I did a donor route with a known donor 2hers ago. We were successful on the first transfer, but I m/c'd.\u00a0\u00a0We then found out that the re didn't retrieve the eggs as soon as he should have, then he froze them on day2, and then we pretty much had poor quality embryos that didn't work....long story.\u00a0\u00a0We are now using donor embryos that someone on this site donated to us.\u00a0\u00a0We have 10 very high quality embryos, and are very hopeful that they will be successful for us.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm sure you'll have some girls in there! Then you can freeze the boys for use later :). Let us know tomorrow what happens ok?? I will be watching for your update!",

(it has cost us under $3,000 for legal fees and transfering them to OH, and storage at the clinic here).Once a female donates eggs, they have relequished any rights to them, so you do not need anything from the donor... they do have to have blood work done before, and after, but I am almost positive that is FDA standards anyway.\u00a0\u00a0You could ask your clinic about that.\u00a0\u00a0I can tell you from one very grateful person... donating your embryos is a wonderful wonderful thing!!!!My hubby and I do not have children.\u00a0\u00a0We have been trying for about 8 years now, but only 2 yrs w/ RE's.\u00a0\u00a0We were \"older\" when we got married, and are going to be anchient by the time they arrive! haha! : )Our embryos were in TX, and we had them transported to OH.No, our RE did nothing to compensate us... he just \"wished me luck\" as I hung up the phone with him the last time, when he refused to thaw our embryos and see if they could get to day 5.\u00a0\u00a0It was a hard lesson learned on our part for sure!We were going to do a 100% percent $ back shared risk program with donor eggs before our lovely angel donated her embryos to us.We are fortunate enough to have fertility coverage right now, so our transfer is covered.\u00a0\u00a0That has been a blessing!\u00a0\u00a0We have 10 day 5blast embryos (all high quality).\u00a0\u00a0The person that donated to us, has twins.\u00a0\u00a0She got pregnant on the first round.Well, let us know how it goes today!!!!!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0Fingers and toes are crossed!!!! : )",

I got there on my transfer day and they told me they didn't know if the incubators were working properly and there may be a chance that my embies didn't stay good...I was soooo frustrated, but I decided to go through with ivf anyway (dr. even told us we could stop the process now and they would pay for my next cycle) ...it worked and we now have twin girls....anyway--- just want you to know that we are here to listen and support you. Keep your head up. :)also, where is A2 Michigan? I am in Michigan (Grand Rapids) as well and my dr. office is the cheapest around. I LOVE my dr.\u00a0\u00a0At my office the cost of basic IVF is $5879 not including any ICSI, assisted hatching, meds. You can check out their website for more info... www.michiganivf.comThe office also has a donor program.My total cost was very close to that when I did my fresh cycle but I had to add on assisted hatching and ICSI.This time around with a FET the cost is around $1800 (not including meds).I picked up my meds today. I am especially thankful for my rx insurance... only had to pay $39. Makes me super excited to get started! Hope I remember how to give myself injections! Its been a while! Just glad I don't have to take as many this time because of it being a FET.Hope everyone is doing well.Ladydi- let us know what happened with the transfer!",

I'm still nervous, I don't like the thought of going under for egg retrieval I'm scared.I can't believe how much it cost for meds and IVF and that it differs all over.I want to share with you how much the cost is for me, I'm so thankful.doctor's visit only or IUI only - $15sperm wash - $15meds-covered by insurancedoctor's visit with u/s $15 + $11vitamins - less than $201 IVF is covered per policy per lifetime, so if you use your policy (but must be married) it's $2000 for IVF if you have dual coverage only $500-$600......me too I'm tired of taking shots but I do it myself, just poke and press .. LOLGood Luck everyone .... baby dust to you .....",

Bromelain is a proteolytic enzyme that breaks up proteins that inhibit embryo implantation. Consuming a whole pineapple (focusing on the core as it has the highest concentration of Bromelain) during a fertility cycle can be beneficial.*****Note: Be careful not to start consuming pineapple core too early in the cycle. Beginning to consume pineapple core BEFORE the recommended days above can actually affect your vaginal and cervical mucus PH, making it more acidic.",

Taking a couple of days off right at the beginning of school (especially with 5 yr olds who have never been to school before) is definitely not ideal...its actually not good at all.

Its your personal life an others don't have to know if u don't want them to.Just my opinion :)Or maybe just tell him/her that u have a lot of stuff going on in your personal life and leave it at that if you don't feel comfortable telling him.

            "answer": "Alot of RE's do natural cycles, and do not put their patients on bcp/or lupron.\u00a0\u00a0They call it a natural cycle.\u00a0\u00a0My old RE did those.\u00a0\u00a0It was when I first started the fertility journey.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't understand either.\u00a0\u00a0But, what they are doing is trying to \"catch\" your normal ovulation cycle.\u00a0\u00a0That way, your body will be \"expecting\" the embryo, if that makes sense?\u00a0\u00a0The estrace can delay but not prevent your ovulation.\u00a0\u00a0They are probably checking your bloodwork alot to make sure you haven't ovulated correct? You lining will thicken on it's own just like it normally would every month on its own... and that's what the estrace is for also... to help the lining thickness. This gives them a certain window to work with, and if things don't look picture perfect, they may decide to delay transfer until next month.\u00a0\u00a0But, if you don't usually have an issue with your lining, this most likely won't happen.Other RE's like to have a \"controlled\" enviroment.\u00a0\u00a0They like to have control over the cycle, and mimic ovulation.\u00a0\u00a0They want to make sure everything is \"perfect\" before transfer, ie: lining thickness.\u00a0\u00a0That's why the lupron.\u00a0\u00a0They shut down your ovaries so there is no chance of ovulation.\u00a0\u00a0They want to create their own cycle.\u00a0\u00a0It gives them more flexibility on the transfer date and the conditions of transfer (ie again lining.)Anyway, Good News!\u00a0\u00a0I did get pregnant on my first natural cycle fet.. but unfortunately m/c'd, so they do work!!!\u00a0\u00a0: )",
