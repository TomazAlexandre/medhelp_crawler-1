Yay! :)\u00a0\u00a0I certainly hope I'll be able to tackle being a new mom! I know one thing for sure.....I'm ready to quite alternating the same 3 pairs of jeans!!! lol I told dh I will feel like I hit the lotto when I get to unpack all my prepregnancy clothes!\u00a0\u00a0I've only gained 18 pounds so far...but I have 6 weeks to go so I'm sure I'll be gaining more! As for the energy level and sex drive...I think they go hand in hand! When I have energy all day long I'm at work and by the time I get home at 5 I'm so drained that I couldn't possibly have sex if I wanted to! lolFunny story....I turned sweet 25 today (ugh) and had to go get my driver's license renewed. Welllll...I forgot about it needing done this morning when I was getting dressed. So I'm wearing a cute tank top...it's lower cut, but cute and simple. Soooo I get the pic taken on my license and I look like a total big boobed s.l.u.t. with NO shirt on! HAHAHA! I told dh that maybe this way I'll luck out the next time I get pulled over because the trooper will think I he's really sneaking a peek at something in the license picture! lol *sigh* The little things that amuse me.........",

I waited for an hour to see him for 5 minutes if that.\u00a0\u00a0He listened to her hb and measured my fundus.\u00a0\u00a0I told him I lost my mucus plug while he was on vacay and he said he hoped to see 3 more weeks out of me but things would be ok if I went sooner.\u00a0\u00a0And that was about that.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my doc wont do an ultrasound this late unless it looks like there is a reason to and he thinks I'm like the most perfect pregnancy ever or something.\u00a0\u00a0I only gained 2 pounds since a month ago so I'm right at 21 pounds as I suspected.Immortal One, my dad grew up in Mt. Gilead so I used to visit my grandparents there a lot when I was a kid.\u00a0\u00a0They lived on 5 acres of wooded land where my grandfather built two log cabins, one as their house and theother as their antique shop.\u00a0\u00a0It was gorgeous and very remote but my grandma moved away after grandpa passed.\u00a0\u00a0That's funny about the Velcro.\u00a0\u00a0When my brother was a teenager at home he used to velcro stuff in his room so he could find it, including his remotes!\u00a0\u00a0Makes sense!\u00a0\u00a0It prob wouldnt help me because I'd just never stick them back on there lol.",

They like to check your belly measurement to make sure all is well there, and get the baby's heartbeat and definately check your blood pressure!! My best friend's pregnancy went perfect til 36 weeks when she went for her check up and her bp was super high.... she had preclampsia setting in FAST! They ended up taking her right then and there!I dunno...maybe the appointments aren't that big of a deal. I just think it helps time pass when I go now every 2 weeks! lol Maybe you'll go next time and you'll just be all set to have her right then!",
