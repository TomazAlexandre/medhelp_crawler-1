Our little Baby Ohz is a BOY!!!\u00a0\u00a0=D\u00a0\u00a0His name will be Jaiden Thomas ... we've had our names picked out for forever.\u00a0\u00a0=D\u00a0\u00a0It's great to be able to definitively call the baby HE, HIM, and by his name.\u00a0\u00a0=D\u00a0\u00a0And now we get to be all decked out in blue!!\u00a0\u00a0=D\u00a0\u00a0Yay!!!I posted pictures on my profile, and I also wrote about my appointment on my blog:\u00a0\u00a0jessaknight.blogspot.comYay for Boys!!!!",
