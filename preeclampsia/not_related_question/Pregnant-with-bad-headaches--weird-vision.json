            "answer": "Hi,Have you sought consult with your OB?I suggest you seek immediate consult with your OB for proper assessment and evaluation on what causes your headaches.How is your current blood pressure?Any rapid gain in weight?Swelling of lower extremities?One thing to exclude in pregnancy with associated headaches is preeclampsia which may be associated with urinary protein, headaches and visual symptoms. Do stay calm and have all these checked by your OB so that your pregnancy will be closely supervised.Take care and do keep us posted for anything.",
