After that, walking and staying active, staying calm and staying distracted generally works just fine. I was out shoveling snow the day before I went into labor at 40 weeks on the dot - because it needed to be done, not because I thought it would get things started. But I never took epo or castor oil, never had my membranes stripped, never bounced on a yoga ball. Just let it happen and it'll happen - nobody's ever been pregnant forever.",
