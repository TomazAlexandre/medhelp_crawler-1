            "answer": "I have PIH (pregnancy induced hypertension) & also had it with my previous pregnancy. I'm taking Methyldopa & it works very well at keeping my bp under control. Did your doctor suggest another medicine or did s/he just tell you to stop your previous med? Keeping your bp at a normal level is essential during pregnancy because higher pressure can lead to preeclampsia or even scarier, eclampsia which can cause seizures, coma, or even death. Please ask your dr if there is a med you can be prescribed & if they say no, I'd recommend finding another dr because there are options for pregnant women with high bp. Good luck, hope you have a happy, healthy pregnancy!!!",

            "answer": "I had gestational hypertension and then severe preeclamplsia with my first and preeclamplsia with this one. Your dr will be keeping an eye on you and probably already considers you high risk (just meaning you need extra monitoring). I've been on labetalol both pregnancies. I was told there are only two bp meds safe where I am during pregnancy and the other one makea me sick. Talk to your dr about your concerns and his plan for you.",

When I was pregnant with my first son over 5 years ago they put me on Labetalol.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure was actually better while I was pregnant.
