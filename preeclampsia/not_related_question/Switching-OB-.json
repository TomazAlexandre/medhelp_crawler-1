            "answer": "I had to move to a different state right near the end of my pregnancy so i had to switch at 32 weeks! It was hard to find another midwife that i liked but after i did it went really smooth. All my previous information and test records were either faxed or emailed to my new midwife and i only had to take a few new blood tests that were required by the new state i moved to. I'm on my second pregnancy and still with the same midwife. If you decide to switch, it should go even easier for you!",

            "answer": "I did switch back to the OB that delivered my daughter. Its not that I didnt like the midwives I was seeing, but I just didnt trust them to manage my blood pressure and didn't trust them to take care of me the correct way if I were to get preeclampsia. plus being seen at an Army hospital, I was seeing a different person every appointment and I'd rather just have one person managing my medical care. But I did switch. Had my first appt on Friday with her and am glad I did.\u00a0\u00a0She remembered me like I have been seeing her for a long time.",
