    "question": "So Me And My Bf Had A Pretty Big Spat The Other Night And It Was Because I Failed The Glucose Test And My Sugar Was Too High. He Got So Mad And Was Like \"Do You Even Care About Our Baby? You Need To Start Eating Healthy Or Your Going To Hurt Her!\". I Just Felt So Terrible At That Moment. He Also Said I Could Give Our Daughter Diabetes Because Of My \"Thoughtlessness\".On That Note I Want To Say I'm Taking Prenatal Vitamin, 2 Omega's, Two Vitamin C Tablets Each And Every Day. I've Tried Really Hard To Eat Something Healthy Everyday. He Is A Huge Health Nut And Usually He Helps Me Out With Anything I Need. I Want To Know, Can I Give My Daughter Diabetes? And Is It My Fault I Failed The Test?",
