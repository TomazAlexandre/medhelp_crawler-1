            "answer": "Im a short girl and im 31 weeks today im due january 18th. And i currently 170 and i gained so much but it does not mean your over weight or your baby will be huge. I just went to the doctors today and my baby boy is not big and i look like im having twins. It all just depends on the individual person, my sister just had a baby last month and through out her pregnancy no one knew she was pregnant and she had a huge baby. So it just depends on yourself. Just ask your doctor, your doctor should tell you how big your baby is right now.",
