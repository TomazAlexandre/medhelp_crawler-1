            "answer": "well, IUGR is Intrauterine Growth Restriction......Intrauterine growth restriction refers to the poor growth of a baby while in the womb. Specifically, it refers to a fetus whose weight is below the 10th percentile for its gestational age.SymptomsCurrently pregnant with a feeling that the baby is not as big as it should beUterine fundal height less than expected for gestational ageTreatmentIUGR increases the risk for intrauterine death. If this condition is suspected, the pregnant woman will be closely monitored with several pregnancy ultrasounds to measure the baby's growth, movements, blood flow, and fluid around the baby. Non-stress testing will also be done. Depending on the results of these tests, delivery may be necessary.CausesMany different things can lead to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). An unborn baby may not get enough nutrition because of:Heart disease in the motherHigh altitudesMultiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.)Placenta problemsPreeclampsia or eclampsiaCongenital or chromosomal abnormalities are often associated with below-normal weight. Infections during pregnancy that affect the fetus, such as rubella, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis may also affect the weight of the developing baby.Risk factors in the mother that may contribute to IUGR include:Alcohol abuseDrug addictionHigh blood pressure or heart diseasePoor nutritionSmokingIf the mother is small, it may be normal for her to have a small fetus, but this is not due to IUGR.Depending on the cause of IUGR, the fetus may be symmetrically small, or have a head that is normal size for gestational age, while the remainder of the fetus is growth restricted.Tests & diagnosisIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) may be suspected if the size of the pregnant woman's uterus is small. The condition is usually confirmed by ultrasound.Further tests may be needed to screen for infection or genetic problems if IUGR is suspected.PrognosisThe prognosis for normal newborn growth and development varies by the degree and cause of IUGR. Prognosis should be discussed with your obstetrician and pediatrician.PreventionControl risk factors during pregnancy, when possible. Avoid alcohol, smoking, and drug use, and get regular prenatal care.ComplicationsDepending on the specific cause, IUGR increases the risk for a variety of pregnancy and newborn complications. Infants may have a non-reassuring fetal heart rate during labor, requiring delivery by c-section.When to contact a doctorContact your provider right away if you are pregnant and notice that the baby is moving less than usual.Also call your health care provider if your infant or child does not seem to be growing or developing normally.I am sure they are taking this very serious and will get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "question": "My wife is pregnant and is in her early seventh month.she reported no discomfort,neither bleeding nor spotting of any kind.today she had her ultrasound as a routine checkup along with doppler scan.every thing came out to be normal except the following highligted in the results:- Fetal Growth : findings suggest IUGR,when compared with LMP.- Placenta : position posterior, maturity grade 0- Doppler of umbilical artery : a large sub-chorionic hematoma is noted.indicates increased flow resistance (RI=0.78)Comments By Doctor :A large hematoma is present in one sub-chorionic region of placenta,measuring 12.9x 3.1 cm; indicating placental abruption.it appears responsible for increased resistive index and IUGR.Now what medication or supplement should be taken to avoid any damage to baby,also does this leads to premature birth and is it safe?waiting for response in antisipationregardsRaja",
