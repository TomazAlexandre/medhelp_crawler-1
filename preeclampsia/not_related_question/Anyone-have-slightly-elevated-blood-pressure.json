            "answer": "my BP was slightly higher than my normal for most of my last pregnancy, but my BP is generally low. prior to my previous pregnancy, i was usually 110/68. with this pregnancy it's too early to tell what my BP will do. Hopefully it will behave because the last time i ended up with preeclampsia in the third trimester.i wouldn't stress about it yet... they will continue to monitor you at each visit. if you feel ill, you can always go to one of those machines and have it taken. I ended up buying a BP monitor when i started to get really sick last time.",

            "answer": "I would say it's pretty normal for it to go up slightly during your first visit. Anxiety or nervousness can elevate it...and being slightly up one time isn't cause for alarm. They usually look at the pattern...like if it is high in subsequent visits, they may start having you take it a few times a day at home, then address the issue.My blood pressure was high due to birth control back during the summer, which is why I stopped taking the pill and DH and I were forced to make the \"baby decision.\" Since I quit taking BC, it has come down and been kind of borderline. I had my first OB appt yesterday, and my BP was actually normal! I was surprised. I'm kind of expecting it to be an issue later in my pregnancy.Tricia",

    "question": "I've been meaning to ask if anyone has had elevated/high blood pressure during any of their early doctor visits? I've NEVER had EVEN SLIGHTLY HIGH blood pressure and when I went for my first appt, the nurse told me \"it was slightly elevated/high.\" She said that perhaps it was because I was so excited or a little nervous even, but that it shouldn't stay high. Is this something normal? It kind of worries me. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",
