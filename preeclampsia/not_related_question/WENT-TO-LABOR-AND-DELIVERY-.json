            "answer": "Jasmin_mom, that same thing happen to me\u00a0\u00a02 weeks ago. They kept me in the hospital for 4 hours gave me fluid and the shot to stop the contractions. And then I had to call my doctors office and complain about getting an appointment within 3 days since I was in the hospital, the nurse is going to tell me drink fluids and rest. Its my first child and I dont think that is a really good explanation that they should have given.I went to the doctor they ran all these test and could not come up with a reason why I am contracting when my cervix is long and close, and my blood pressure is normal and all the urine test came back negative. If I was not this far along I would have switched OB I dont think mine is doing a great job with my concerns.\u00a0\u00a0Any way I wish you luck and my prayers are with you, I talk to her everyday telling her she is not allowed to come out before January 11th.",
