            "answer": "I have been having some early swelling. I have had to really watch my sodium intake. Doc says no gatorade or other sports drink, they may keep you hydrated but they have alot of electrolytes and salt in them that just aren't good while preggo. Watching my salt intake has helped considerably for now. Alot of stuff has sodium in it like canned veggies, sodas, etc. Just check the label before consuming.",

    "question": "Ughhh... I'm 28 weeks and over the past week my ankles/feet have really swollen up. My left is WAY more swollen than my right (is that normal?)... it's big enough to be obvious to others now. My blood pressure and everything else is totally fine, and I don't have any swelling of hands or face.... it's just uncomfortable & makes me self-concious, and I can't fit into most of my shoes anymore. Any suggestions on how to get the swelling down?? I'm trying to drink more water. I try to elevate my legs/feet but it doesn't seem to do much. Thought I'd see if any of you gals had some suggestions I haven't thought of...??",
