            "answer": "Im attempting a vbac with this pregnancy. Im 38weeks. There is only a less than 1percent chance of a uterine rupture during a vbac. There are more risks associated with a normal c section than a vbac is what i was told. Vbac success rate depends on why you had a section in the first place. I never went into labor with my first. I had him by emergency section at 35weeks due to preeclampsia so Im a great candidate. I can't get pitocin though since the rupture rate goes up and Im opting out of getting an epi because of the chance it slows or stops my labor.",

I had to end up having a c-section b/c I was induced on that Monday, was in labor from Monday-Wednesday and only dilated to 4cm. His heart rate started to drop so they decided to take him",

I had a c-section with my 1st baby and was wondering if I would have to have another c-section.\u00a0\u00a0After delivering my first child,\u00a0\u00a0the Dr told me that I could have a VBAC if we ever decided to have another one. I would like to have a VBAC but I was told that it's very risky. Can anyone relate?",
