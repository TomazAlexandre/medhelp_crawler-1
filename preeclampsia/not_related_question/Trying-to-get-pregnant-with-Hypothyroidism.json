            "answer": "I have hypothyroidism and have 4 chidren. Lost several but they also didn't know I had it until after the birth of my 2nd. So take comfort in the fact that they are working to regulate the hormones, and a little tip: stressing too severely will keep the hormones messed up, and wou'll have a problem getting them regulated! Also, there is a woman on this forum that is in , I believe, her 2nd trimester now, who has hypothroidism. I am almost certain that she will respond to you. Good luck, you will suceed at this, I'm sure! Just take the meds,and try not to stress too much!",

I got pg with this one and it was noticed and treated ASAP!\u00a0\u00a0I am now on med's for it and my preg has progressed beautifully.Just be sure to let your OB know when you go in for your first OB visit that you do have it so that your levels can be monitered regularly. My OB tests me every 4-6 wks. He said that during pregnancy, thye fluctuate alot.Good luck and don't stress!",

Once the 6 weeks is up and my levels are ok We will begin trying and I will have less stress with the time off and all. This is our 1st and we have been married for 1 year this June 14 so we are looking forward to starting our family.I have another question. Have you been extremely tired during your pregnancy? I have been reading that you can have some side effects during the pregnancy. I cannot wait for the OK.Actually, I have another question. Since you were Hypothyroid and didnt know it, were you missing your periods? or did you not have that symptom? I went off the pill last Septemeber and have had only 2 periods since. Since I have been on meds for 6 weeks I still have not had one so I am getting worried.",

As soon as I knew I was started on thryroxine as advised by my GP and an endocrinologist and this was gradually increased until my TSH was around 2 and well within the normal range (this took over a year). I was then given the go ahead to get pregnant but it took over 10 months. I was also anxious that I may not be able to get pregnant.Since being pregnant my Thyroxine has been increased from 200 to 225 mcg daily and I have regular blood tests. I am now about 33 wks and I am hoping for a normal? birth! I have not had any pregnancy problems related to the hypothyroidism although this has been a more uncomfortable pregnancy than the last and I have developed fairly extensive excema.I have recently moved house and my new Local Health Authority does not deem it necessary to see an endocrinologist while pregant so a midwife does the blood tests.",

I know a lot of lab reports will say that 5.3 is OK, but I guess some Drs. think that is still too high. On another note, she did tell me that she has had patients who accidentally got pregnant with VERY high TSH levels (above 100) - which of course is not idea.

The American Thyroid Assoication has come out with a new \"high \" TSH range. Anything above a 3 is too high and needs treatment, or med re-adjustment. Most endo's want your levels to be between .2 and 2, but no higher than 2. Most endo's now want you as close to the .2 as you can get without going hyper.I'm 34 and have hypothyroid. Mine was diagnosed 1 yr after the birth of my son. (normal pregnancy, and delievery, however i was unable to maintain a milk supply and had to stop Breastfeeding. it was determined that i probably had undiagnosed hypothyroidism soon after his birth, thus the reason for the lower milk supply.) I have been on meds for the last 2 yrs, and it took almost that long for me to get properly adjusted. I'm seen every 6 months now for blood draws to make sure that my levels stay at a good range. ON my last draw, my TSH were 0.4, and my GP was estatic with that. so, i was given the green light to start TTC again ( I had to stop for about 3 months when my TSH levels rose and my meds had to be re-adjusted) I take synthroid 112 mcg daily. I'm hoping to get pregnant again soon and hope to not have many problems during the pregnancy due to my hypothyroid.I would urge you to get your levels re-tested. take this information with you to your doctors http://thyroid.about.com/cs/testsforthyroid/a/labs2003.htmHTH",

I've had the symptoms of subclinical hypothyroidism for years at TSH 5-10 and have always had very heavy and painful periods, but they are regular as clockwork. My Mother also has the disease for 5 years.It wasn't until my after firstborn was 9 months old that my TSH levels were high enough to treat (TSH 30). Doctors initially put me on levothyroxine 50ug then it was increased to 75ug. I breast fed my son until he was 1 year\u00a0\u00a0and at that point got pregnant. (1st time try) with my second pregnancy. During my pregnancy I was refered to an endocrinologist, and they managed my medication throughout. My TSH levels were managed to below 2, and my thyroxine dose put up to 150 ug. My pregnancy was uncomplicated, and thankfully, my daughter was born at 41 weeks healthy, and naturally without complications.When she was 6 months, we tried for a third child but have had two consecutive miscarriages. I was still breast feeding at the time.The hospital has told me that although statistics say 1 in 5 pregnancies end in miscarriage, they see 1 in 3 and that it was just bad luck that I had two in a row. They didn't seem to think that there was any reason that the Hypothyroidism would be a reason why I had miscarried. My TSH is now 0.30. Medically they will not investigate until there has been 3 consecutive miscarrages. Doctors have advised that I have two menstrual cycles before we try again. Lifestyle wise, I don't have any other medical complications, try to look after myself as best as possible, keep stress to a minimum, don't drink alchohol or smoke, avoid too much soya (connection to endocrine complications) try to eat a healthy diet and excersize when I can. Take multi vitamins, I'm slightly overweight (definately due to overconsumption of ice creams!!) but am otherwise fit and healthy. I hope something in the above helps someone somewhere!!

In May of 2006 the doctors found cancer cells and a goiter on the left side of my thyroid. This was treated with surgery to remove the left side. I have been on several different medications with lots of various dosages and doctors. I started seeing a endocrinologist in Jan. of 2007. He put me on a mixture of Synthroid and Cytomel and within that year my levels were normal and have remained normal.I only have to see my doctor once every six months for my labs and follow up now. My husband and I will have been married 1 year in Aug. and we are starting now to try to have a baby. We pray the Lord will bless us with no complications but I will have to see my endo. every month to have my levels checked once I get pregnant. Pray we dont have problems! I also heard women with hypothyroidism cannot breast feed because the baby will not get the hormones it needs and will develope hypothyroidism. Does anyone know if this is true?",

I was diagonsed with PCOS years ago and my chances of getting pregnant when I found it basically crushed me. Now I'm 28 years old and just got married last year. Was also diagonosed with Hypothyroidism last year when I went in for my yearly woman check up. The husband and I are trying sometime to get pregnant this year even though there is a certain person I won't say who right now who doesn't want me to get pregnant but rather adopt a kid. Anyways so if its not that difficult getting pregnant then why am I not already? My doctor has up the dose on my Levothryoxine medication from 25 mcg to 75 mcg. My levels are still a little to low which honestly doesn't make any sense. So I was just wondering how many tries or whatever is it going to take to get me pregnant with my husband and I's first child?",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism when I was 23 weeks pregnant with my son. My doctor did not explain to me the effects it could have on a baby. All he said was take your medicine. Since that was all he said I did not take it seriously enough meaning that I did not take my medicine every day like I was told to. My son was born at 38wks and 1 day...beautiful, healthy baby boy there were no problems with my pregnancy or delivery. He passed away when he was fifteen days old. That was on December 25, 2009 and today is May 22, 2010. The autopsy could not find a cause of death. He was being held and went into respiratory distress. He had no symptoms that anything was wrong during his two weeks of life. I did not have a period the first two months after he was born and since then they have been far a part and short..nothing like before he was conceived. I had a positive pregnancy test and then five days later got what I think to be my period. I think it was an early miscarriage. I have done so much research on hypothyroidism over the past few days and I think that I might still have it. (I was tested for it when I was pregnant with my daughter, she is now 2, and did not have it.) Hypothyroidism can cause anovulation-failure to ovulate meaning that a follicle on your ovary does not mature and release an egg! No egg=No period if it is treated correctly you should ovulate like normal and have no fertility problems that are a result of hypothyroidism. If untreated it can cause lower I.Q. scores in your child in the future and developmental problems. I will never know if an early diagnosis of this disorder and taking my meds correctly would have saved my son all I can say is please take your medicine the DR.s know what they are talking about.",

            "answer": "For anyone wanting to get pregnant that has been unable to, run to a RE (reproductive endocrinologist)!!! Your primary care doctor is only casually versed on the reproductive systems and an problems associated with them. An OB is more suited to once a woman is already pregnant. An RE is what is needed for anything having to do with infertility. I also recommend a book called \"A Few Good Eggs\" by Julie Vargo and Maureen Regan.Had I learned this lesson when I was younger, I may have already had the child I have so long been dreaming of.History of me; I was 20 when I got married and my DH (dear husband) and I decided to wait till we were older and better prepared before we had children. I have always been heavy set and have never had the greatest insurance, if I had any at all. So, the few doctors I'd seen when I was young had always told me to eat less and exercise more and my other problems would disappear! Yeah, right.At 24 I was diagnosed with depression right in the middle of my DH and deciding to start trying for a baby. At this point I was just going off of the pill and starting medication for depression, but still not losing weight despite best efforts on my part.At 27 I start going to OB's because we've been unable to get pregnant and are becoming concerned. At this point my periods have become increasingly erratic and I'm told (again) that I just need to lose weight. One OB even told me she wouldn't even see me until I'd lost weight. I was also told that my DH and I hadn't been \"actively trying to get pregnant\". Meaning at 27 I was dumb and didn't know as much as I thought I did about ovulation cycles and when a woman can actually conceive. Thank goodness for the internet, because I started to educate myself.I am now 32 and I still do not have a baby. A lot of this has had to do with my life being turned upside down a few times over the last few years and me going without a job and insurance from either myself or my hubby. But, as of yesterday I was (finally) diagnosed with hypothyroidism and told that it is likely I have had this for many years and doctors brushed it aside. The problem with that is, that it allowed it to continue and get worse. The new PCP I have has also gone through a lot of what I have herself and understands so much of what I'm going through. She has started me on thyroid medication and given me a plan. I go back in 6 weeks to get my numbers checked. Once those are normalized I can hopefully actually start losing weight instead of only holding steady or actually gaining weight! And, I can start trying to conceive again. If after 3 months of actively trying to conceive I am not pregnant then I will be going to an RE.I hope that by sharing a little bit of my story you'll know that you're not alone in your journey. There are many other women who are also struggling. Some with maintaining pregnancies, others with getting pregnant in the first place. It doesn't matter... We all have this little gland in our bodies that want to try and take control of our lives. Forget that buster, I'm in charge here!Also, please remember to never be ashamed of what you're going through. I remember when I was younger not wanting to tell anyone about my problems getting pregnant or with my body. I was embarrassed and ashamed. Now, I have spoken with other female friends and found that so many of them are also struggling with health issues and also felt as I did. We now have each other to lean on and to ask questions of. Build your network of support and don't be afraid to use it!Best of luck to all of you out there who are struggling with their thyroid condition and with trying to have a baby!!!",

'10 at 10weeks due to Blighted Ovium.I first got tested with thyroid problems when i was about 17 yrs old. I took medication for a year but i cant seem to remember what was it and how much. After a year i stopped taking it as my levels supposedly regulated. I did get checked at least once a year. My husband and I TTC for a year back in 2008 but nothing happened.Last year in may 2010 my levels got a bit off when i went for my thyroid check. I took medication for a month or so and then in September '10 found out i was pregnant out of nowhere. Could me taking the meds help get me pg?\u00a0\u00a0We were not even trying. I stopped taking thyroid med not knowing that i should have been taking them all along. NO ONE not even OBGYN said anything because when they checked me the levels looked fine. Im no doctor i didnt know. My first reaction was to not taking anything since i found out i was pregnant.After my second visit to OBGYN she told me she saw the g sac but that was it. Week after week she kept checking me and nothing was changing. Meanwhile i was going through all the pregnancy symptoms. The OBGYN gave me two options. She told me it was a Blighted Ovium and i was going to MC. She said to either let it happen naturally or do DC. I waited and MC naturally at 10 weeks.Now we want to have a baby since we felt how wonderful it would be to be parents. We waited two cycles for my body to heal and started trying again. It has been three months and nothing.I read a lot about thyroid having an affect on you TTC. My last thyroid test from November said my TSH level was 1.902 and T4 was .73I called my endocronologist today to discuss if i should go back on my meds again since my levels can go up and down as they wish. My next appt is May 12 and i do feel like my result could be not leveled because i feel tired a lot. No one can tell me if my MC happened because of disregulated thyroid or something else. Im starting to believe it has to do with it because until i started taking my meds last year i never got pregnant. My period is regular and i can definitely can tell i ovulate. I used ovulation tests as well and they become positive right about when they should.",

Thankfully, my levels remained stable so far without having to increase my meds. I am 15 weeks pregnant and baby is measuring big and doing well. I definitely recommend regulating your levels and then getting them checked the moment you become pregnant and every 6 weeks after. If you stay medicated your pregnancy will progress fine.",

            "answer": "I have Hashimoto's and am 27. I was diagnosed 11 years ago at 16. I have had two children and actually had to decrease my synthroid with the first pregnancy so I stopped taking it. After my first child, my periods were irregular, not breastfeeding, and had about 4 in 9 months when I got pregnant with number two. Had a normal pregnancy off of meds but about 2 months after I had number two I crashed. My tsh was 97 and I couldn't keep my eyes open. I started taking the synthroid again. My youngest is now 6. I had one mc about 4 years ago and have been ttc for over a year this time. I found a pcp who lets me adjust my meds by my levels and how I feel. She let me start taking cytomel along with synthroid and feel better then ever. Except my cycles kept getting longer, between 33-45 days between periods. I adjusted my meds after having labs drawn last month and this cycle was actually 31 days!!! I'm so excited, I was able to take my thyroid into my own hands and adjust meds based on what I think my levels should be and it worked!!! I can't wait to see how long it takes to get preggo now that my levels are better. Do your research, join a thyroid forum and find a doctor who is willing to work with you. Of course I am a RN so that might be why my doctor lets me change doses when I ask!!! I'm so proud of myself though!!!",

You will need to have your levels checked every 4-6 weeks and 4 weeks after any adjustment to your dose. During your first trimester your dose may increase by about 25% to 30% or about 2 extra doses a week. And here's a tip, the morning that you get your Big Fat Positive pregnancy test, double your dose and take 2 pills and call your doctor to have blood work done. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 4 years ago, but I'm also a pharmacist so I've done the research too! I'm now pregnant again and keeping my fingers crossed....I hope this helps you and I'm wishing you so much luck!\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

Went to the doctor to find out that my thyroid levels were very low. He doubled the dose of my medication and and within a month and a half I was pregnant. Not sure if that had anything to do with it but possibly. My periods are pretty regular, between 24-28 days never late. So the one day I was late, woke up extremely early to check and had a bright positive. I was only 4 weeks at the time. I was high risk during pregnancy and my doctors were all very worried for me and my baby cause I got hypertension and gestational diabetes. They didn&#39;t think I&#39;d make it past 30 weeks but I delivered a beautiful healthy baby boy naturally and am so blessed! All I can say is, don&#39;t give up hope! Miracles do happen!",

I am waiting for my levels to come down before I start trying however I dont want to get my nerves in a tizzy about this before I know more about it. I just found out about this 6 weeks ago and have been on meds. The doctor just increased my meds to help bring the levels down even more. I wanted to start trying this month but need to wait 6 more weeks. Let me know of any stories (good or bad) with anyone with hypothyroid. Thanks",
