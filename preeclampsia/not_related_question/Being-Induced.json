            "answer": "I was induced 1 day past my due date with my first son. I have heard som babd stories about being induced, but mine went really well, besides the fact that I threw up water all over my husband about an hour and a hal before I my son was delivered. The nurse said that was nature's way of saying that I was fully dilated.Don't stress, everything will be okay. I am due 1/31 with my second and there is a chance my doctor is going to induce me early since my first was 9lbs 3oz.",

            "answer": "Just make sure your body is really ready for this.Is is for a medical reason? My cousin got induced three weeks early, just for the reason she was excited to have the baby.She had alot of problems with the induction. They could not get her cervix to dilate and basically had to rip it open. The baby was small and got terrible jaundice. She didn't even look completely developed--her eyes were kind of sealed shut.I personally think she was just not ready to be born yet. This child now has learning disabilities too---I know I can't prove it was caused by the induction but you never know.I'm sure that most Dr's would make sure your cervix is \"ripe\" before even attempting an induction. But if your due date is Jan 21, this seems way to early to induce unless there is a medical reason.Usually inductions aren't done unless you are withing a week of your due date.Hope I am not scaring you or offending you.Just sharing a story with you so you know of another's experience.",

            "answer": "I was induced on my due date for practical reasons (my doc was going out of town for 5 days, my parents came from France and were leaving a week after my EDD) and the placenta was getting a bit calcified.It was long, I got there the night before, they put the cevidil in (a little strip thing to soften the cervix) but it didn't do anything, at 6am the doc broke my water, then I got the pitocin and I was dilating really slowly, by 5pm I was only 4-5 so the doc said that he'll be back at 10 and if I wasn't ready to push I'll get a c-section but at 10 I was ready and I pushed for 19 minutes and out came baby!an induction can fail, the less dilated you are the more chances of getting a c-section you get (I was only a finger tip but my water was broken a long time before so I had an anti biotic drip to prevent infection).I know you can't wait to have your baby, but if there is no medical reason for an induction, I would suggest that you wait until at least your EDD, you will have more chances to have a successfull induction (mostly if you are dilated a few cm)",

I am a little scared, this is my first. I have also been getting more cramps lately, so I mentioned it to my doctor and he said it was my uterus getting ready for labot. I had them last night I was so scared. Any one out there have a bicornial uterus ( I hope I spelled that right) ?? What was your labor and delivery like?",

            "answer": "I had my daughter at 3:55pm after 15 minutes of pushing. I was induced at 38.6 weeks and I had a high risk pregnancy. They didnt want me to go into labor because of the bloodthiners that i was on. I needed to be off them for at least 36 hours before i delivered.\u00a0\u00a0I do agree that the heavy contractions do come all at once when you're being induced. I also think, as a few others said, maybe you should wait until you're a little further along. Atleast until you're considered full term. Can you get a ultrasound to measure the babys growth, or find out if the babys lungs are mature enough first??? I had a ultrasound measuring my babys growth 4 days before i had her and they told me that she was 6lbs 3oz, well 4 days later when I had her she was lbs 8oz, so they were pretty acurate!!!(oh, the sono was in\u00a0\u00a0fetal maternal medicine, you may need a refferal if you are not high risk!) But try it if you can to help ease your mind.Best of luck and keep us posted!Tiffany",

            "answer": "My sister was induced four weeks early with the first due to medical issues but was unable to dialate past 4. They finally took my nephew by c-section. At a month early, he was still 7.5 pounds.She was induced two weeks early with her second and had a normal, fine vaginal delivery. At two weeks early, he was over 8.5 pounds.With her third, my sister was induced two weeks early but opted for a c-section because the baby was already 9.5 pounds.As you can see, my sister also was prone to having larger children. She was very happy to be induced all three times. She was so upset when she had to have the first c-section, and she cried when she knew she had to go with it for the third. Now, a year and a half later, she looks back saying she wishes she would have gone with a c-section for all three! ;0)Inductions have become so common that the negative stigma is not as attached to them anymore. My personal preference is to be induced a couple of weeks early with this one (I am only 7.5 weeks right now) because I plan to take the Bar Exam the end of July and cannot be in labor while taking the exam! ;0) However, we won't be able to know for sure until I am much further along so we can assess the baby's development, etc.I wish you the best. 2-3 weeks early is not a big deal at all, especially if the baby is already measuring large. The baby my husband and I care for was an induction baby, and she was born a couple of weeks early as well because her birth mother failed to eat adequately during the pregnancy, and the baby was at a high risk of being still born due to the malnutrition. The first day of induction via pit didn't take, so the dr turned the pit off after about twelve hours. The next day started very slowly also, but things progressed very quickly after the first seven slow hours, and only seven hours later, the baby was born ... a beautiful and healthy 4pd, 15oz.I wish you the best!
