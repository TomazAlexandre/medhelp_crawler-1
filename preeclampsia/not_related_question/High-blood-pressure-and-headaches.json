            "answer": "Wow..are you writing about me. This actually happened to me with my first child. I actually started to get the headaches in the hospital and it was awful but since this was my first child, I thought it was normal for me to feel this bad. I was home with him for two days when I collapsed in the bedroom with him in my arms onto the bed. See it hurt like hell to sit up..he had started cryn and I went to pick him up and fell out. I remember praying please let my husband come home cause I dont want to die cause than my baby would be by himself. Thank God he came home early. God id good. I was rushed to the Er and had a crazy high BP as well. I was hospitalized for over a week until they could regulate my BP..some said it was preeclampsia but after birth..some said they dont know. With my second child, my BP started to raise at a doc appt, they decided to induce me, knowing what happened last time, and I was given magensium sulfate and continued to recieve it after birth for 24 hrs. I couldnt have any visitors beside husband, no lights on in the room, I was like on a24hr ICU status. I felt much better this time around. Now with third kid, I was home two weeks and got so sick and feverish, put in hospital for 4 weeks..later determined I had lupus. Dont know if the lupus was the reason for the pregnancy. Hope this helps. This is over a six year time peiod. I now have a 10, 8 and 4 year old.",
