I also found out I am anemic which probably didn't help.",

    "question": "So for the last week or so I've been experiencing weird dizzy spells, but they even happen when I am sitting down. Its not like the room is spinning... more like when ur tipsy and just beginning to feel the buzz. But it's happening more frequent and stronger. Yesterday I was making dinner and i had to sit down because I felt like I was going to pass out. And after I ate it happened again. At first this is what happens... it feels like someone pushes on my throat and shuts off blood to my head. Then I am obviously light headed. It lasts forever it seems. I am NOT diabetic or have prego diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible that my baby is lying on a vein or something? Is this an emergency?",
