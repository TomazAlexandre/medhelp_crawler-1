He did my first pap smear, my first annual gynecological exams, my first breast exams. He was an amazing doctor and I trusted him wholeheartedly. He no longer practices in my area and I'm really bummed about that. Haven't found a GP I like half as much.I have not received prenatal care from any men, however - I've never met a male midwife - though if there was a man in practice with my chosen team of midwives I would certainly welcome care from anyone as well trained and well informed and caring and courteous as the women I receive care from now. What genitals my caregiver has doesnt affect me - how they treat me does.",
