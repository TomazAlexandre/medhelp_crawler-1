            "answer": "I have to say I do not follow restrictions really. I definitely try to eat as healthy as possible though when I'm pregnant or not, but, personally, I don't change much from when I'm not preggo to when I am preggo. I still eat seafood and lunch meats on occasion, I eat red meat that is still pink on the inside, and I have a small cup of coffee almost everyday. I also drink raw cow's milk (when I have the rare bowl of cereal) and eat raw goat's yogurt. Some doctors and even people would think I am crazy, but these foods, particularly the raw foods, as long as they are from a good, reliable source, are very beneficial to your body. I have an imbalance of good bacteria to bad bacteria, so eating raw yogurt (since it has no sugars) is a very good way to try to balance that out. Anyway, my midwife is aware of everything I eat and I always run something by her if I think it may not be a good idea. But this is what I believe and live by, everything in moderation! :)",

            "answer": "I did and didn't follow it. I don't like any form of drink other than water so caffeine wasn't an issue with me. I also dislike seafood so that was easy as well. As for meats, I still had my steaks medium rare, and ate them cold. By the end of my pregnancy though my dietary consultant was telling me to anything that would stay down and that diet didn't matter anymore. (As long as it was in reasonable guidelines) I don't think you're being too strict with yourself. You can have up to 300mg of caffeine a day. Tea is fine, it just depends on what kind it is. Herbal teas are the big issue, just due to certain problems during production. Non-herbal are fine, beyond the caffeine issue.",

            "answer": "In the beginning I was RELIGIOUS about following pregnancy diet restrictions. No cold lunchmeat, hot dogs with NO nitrates, completely caffine free, limited fish and so on. Now, at the end of my pregnancy, I do eat cold lunchmeat, I just stay away from smoked or cured lunchmeat as it is not cooked. I usually go with cooked ham or oven roasted turkey breast. I do drink 1-2 cups of tea each week. The rest of the guidelines I do follow. For me, it wasn't a difficult change, like the other women it was already a part of my natural diet.I always suggest following your doctor's instructions, especially if you really trust and like your dr. For me, a few food restrictions were worth the cause. :) But I don't think you will spontaniously combust if you eat a hot dog with some nitrates in it. LOL",

Caffeine I stayed away from for about the first 22wks (I was so sick and could hardly keep anything down), but lately I've been having a can of soda a day then mostly water. Lunch meat I eat occasionally, maybe once every 2 wks or so. BUT hot dogs...wow that's another story! I crave them from the gas station! It's just not the same if I make them at home! I try to just have them once a week, maybe twice! ;) I think the key is moderation, like someone else said. I have a friend who is 30 wks pregnant (I'm 28wks!) and all she drinks is Coke & Mt Dew, no water, no milk, no juice, nothing else. She has told me that she drinks probably close to 8 cans or more a day! Constantly is eating sushi too! I've asked her if she is worried about her eating habits and she just says \"nope.\", as she ***** down a Mt Dew! It's crazy!",

I had zero caffiene, fish, lunch meats, soft cheese, yogurt, etc. Then with my second I continued to have ice tea a few times a week or a coke at the movie theater. In the third trimester after the suggestions of the L&D nurses I had a glass of wine.This time around the only thing I'm sticking too is to take it easy on the caffeine (no more than 1 per day) and to avoid soft cheese other than cream cheese. I even had sushi last week. Some soft cheeses have a bacteria that can cause still birth thus why I avoid it. Like someone else said every state, dr, and pregnancy is different. For me having things in moderation is my guideline. I don't think a coke and a hotdog at a baseball game are that big of a deal.",

            "answer": "I voted other because the diet restrictions didn't cover cultural meals. I'm Samoan(Polynesian) and I ate boiled plantains, baked Taro root, and I eat raw fish.The caffeine, I drink 7up, ginger ale or sierra mist whenever I get the chance. :) I have at least half a pot of coffee through out the day if I have no pop. I went into a withdrawal that was more dangerous for my baby and me because I had cut out caffeine completely and the doc was like ok you can have your caffeine. ;)The whole warm your lunch meat thing made it taste funny to me afterwards, so I just started making my lunch meats from scratch. It was cheaper especially since I have so many leftovers from the holidays when I was really chowing down. My husband likes his meat to \"still have a pulse\", so he says, so every now and then I will steal a piece of two from his plate, especially when my meat tastes a little dry. I crave nothing but BBQ slathered Ribs from anywhere as long as it was drenched in BBQ sauce.Seafood, I eat it all, except the ones with high mercury content. I don't eat the local seafood raw because the water has such a high Mercury content on its own. But eating oysters raw is a risk everyone, pregnant or not, takes. I just so happen to really like my seafood and sushi. You can't tell an Islander, much less a pregnant one with cravings that she can't have her fish. LOL I even had octopus sushi with tune shashimi.Just so everyone doesn't freak out at my diet, I have only gained 12 lbs being considered obese pre-pregnancy(254lbs 5'8\" I threw up 14 lbs during my 1st trimester so 240 if you count that). I have no signs of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia or toxemia. I had a whole bag of twizzlers 30 minutes before my glucose test and passed with a 98. If anything I was almost considered anemic. The only weight issue i have had is due to stress and by the time my next appointment comes around, everything has resolved itself and I am at a normal weight gain. Anyway I pretty much did and eat whatever I want, just in proportion.",

So drinking caffeine, eating cold meats, raw fish, shellfish & oysters (i love miss them so much) and cooking meats to well-done etc.On one hand, i think women have been having babies since the dawn of time and these restrictions are recent and children have, in the most cases, been born fine.\u00a0\u00a0For example, my mother would have drank 10+ cups of tea a day and both me and my sister are fine. Allergies in children are increasing, is this because the are not introduced to small amount of bacteria in the womb so they have immunity to it???????On the other hand, I'm not a doctor and don't feel qualified allow myself to eat some of these things out of fear of what I may do to my baby.This is my first pregnancy. I have been limiting tea to 2 cups a day and following all the other diet restrictions exactly.
