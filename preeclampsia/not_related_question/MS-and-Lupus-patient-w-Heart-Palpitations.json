            "answer": "Hi and sorry you are going through all this.\u00a0\u00a0I would get a 24 hour halter monitor and see if you have PAC's or PVC's causing the symptoms but also a stress echocardiogram and a regular one since you have a lot of family history. I'm not sure what the blood pressure changes mean. Hopefully, someone here will be able to explain that more. I would explain the same things to the doctor you talked about here, family history, and your symptoms and the other health problems you are dealing with and the blood pressure results. I have PAC's and have symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath and tiredness, lately dizzy but it may be my toe infection. The PAC's and PVC's are benign but I'm getting an echo tomorrow to rule out mitral value prolapse or other value problems. I think you should get these things checked out tootake care,mkh9.",

Thanks again for the advice.\u00a0\u00a0Take care yourself...",

            "answer": "Wow, you are dealing with a LOT.First I am wondering if you are on any meds that may cause the heart issues. If you ask the dr, most likely they wont know...you need to google the name of the drug ...do something like this... tylonal effects on heart rythm.Just to look up the meds....If you have regurgitaion, the degree is what matters. Mild is usually considered benign...but you have cardiomyopathy, so most likely its no benign....I hope you have a good cardiologist, because thats who you need.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you are feeling better soon.",

            "answer": "The meds I take are all prescription and vitamins.\u00a0\u00a0They were actually the first route I considered.\u00a0\u00a0One medication in particular I started a month ago (two weeks later the palps were worse, but mind you... I had mild palps for months before this).\u00a0\u00a0I called my rheumy and told him about the palps, stopped the med and saw him the following Monday.\u00a0\u00a0I was still having the palps in his office, and that's when he took my pressure that I posted above.\u00a0\u00a0After checking that, he had me call my PCP to tell her.\u00a0\u00a0I saw her Tuesday, and the rest is what I posted earlier.Honestly, in the back of my head, I always knew that I would probably have to deal with the heart issues since it was in my family.... I just didn't expect to get them so early - but having an autoimmune disease can do that, I guess.\u00a0\u00a0I'm really nervous of the prospect of surgery since I don't have very good luck at all when it comes to that (I had an emergency c-section back in '97 that had severe complications, blood loss and two severe infections, that I believe started my road of illness that I'm on now).Thanks for listening and responding to my post...\u00a0\u00a0I really appreciate it! :)",
