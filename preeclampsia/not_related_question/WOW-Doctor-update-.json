I have a 5 year d as well that will be with me as well. I need to have a reason to have my surgery on a thu or friday so my husband only takes off one day and then has the whole weekend off to help me while i am in recovery. Its all very technical. The 15th is a friday, but doc has board meetings all that day, the 14th is thu which i dont mind it being valentines day but ill be 38 weeks and 6 days and they cant scehdule a csection until exactly 39 weeks. So if i can do something that makes it legally okay for her to do my csection on thursday she will.",
