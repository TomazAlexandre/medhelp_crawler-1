I think it only worked for my DH because he was able to read the monitor and helped me out TREMENDOUSLY through all of my contractions since I did it without the epidural. Just take the epidural and you will not feel any pain and will not have any use for the breathing they teach you in the class. (Just kidding) if you can do it without meds great but if not go for it. You have seen the breathing in the movies it is pretty much like that I think. Good Luck and you'll do just fine I promise. Take care. How much longer do you have??? I am sure you have said but I do not get on here much anymore. Bye",

Maybe he will always be this good!! **crosses fingers** As for myself im doing better... Breastfeeding is better now.. A little stressed about some things going on with my dad and family.. ((my parents are going through a divorce settlement/lawsuit that should have been taken care of at the time of their divorce 5 years ago)) And my mother no longer talks to me now because I told her I would not lie for her so she could take my dad for all he had... My dad took care of me when she walked out on me.. and when she left she LEFT.. She didnt come see me.. she choose her friends over me.. just didnt care... She had me fooled once again.. I actually thought that she was being nice to me because she cared.. turns out she just wanted to use me to get what she wanted from my dad.. just like shes used everyone else.. Oh well.. Im not gonna stress over her anymore.. Im tired of the games she keeps playing with me.. And I cant wait for her to lose in court.. All the things my dad has that shes trying to get he OWNED BEFORE THEY GOT MARRIED!! So i just dont see her winning this one.. Anyways.. im off to bed.. big day shopping tommorow!!
