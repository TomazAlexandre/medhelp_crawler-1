With IVF everything is timed, there is no guesstimating, lol.They count from the day her eggs were removed, 02/06. 5 days later they transferred to me, then 6 days later blood HCG was 19.i was told the eggs hatch anywhere from 24 hours to 5 days but the date doesn't change, because it goes by retrieval date.\u00a0\u00a0It's a lot different than when I had my five thats for certain. IVF is a whole new world ! We're just praying for 1 good healthy baby, 2 would be a bonus !",

            "answer": "Fraternal twin pregnancies are much less risky to the babies than placental and/or sack sharing pregnancies, however risks for preeclampsia, preterm labor, and gestational diabetes all go up with any multiple pregnancies.I am 32 weeks with identical twin girls. Am currently measuring 42 centimeters, so just know u are going to get huge, sore, and tired much more quickly with a twin pregnancy. Be prepared to stop working earlier (if you do), taking it easy, and drink tons and tons of water! First and foremost goal for any multiple pregnancy is keeping those babies in as long as u can :) Your doctor may induce you earlier than 40 weeks, my doctor Is inducing me at 37 weeks. Twins tend to kind of stop growing at a certain point because of space restrictions, they also tend to develop a little faster so are more ready for birth by 37 weeks.I'm a FTM so have not had a singleton pregnancy to compare it to.Amazing your providing these little ones for someone, very selfless thing to do. My pregnancy has been an especially amazing experience, and both my girls are doing wonderfully, I feel very blessed.Any questions, feel free to ask!",
