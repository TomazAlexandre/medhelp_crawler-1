            "answer": "From what I've read about low dose asprin therepy you should start taking them before conception to increase the thickness of the uterine lining and prevent clotting once implantation occurs. I guess asprin crosses the placenta easily so I would assume you wouldn't take it long after your pregnancy is confirmed.The only other time I've heard of it being used in pregnancy is in the treatment of preeclampsia. I'd check with your doctor because you're taking it in conjunction with the clomid to make sure you're getting the desired effects of the two together. Good luck to you!",

            "answer": "Hi hon, first I would really talk to your doctor about this. Taking asprin as a regiment is always followed up with monitoring from your doctor. That is anytime you do it. And especially while TTC. That being said I took it for the first three months of my pregnanct due to clotting issues. I had had two miscarriages and doctor wanted to make sure that the baby implanted correctly.Again please call your doctor before you start taking this especially with a fertility drug that thins your lining anyway.I pray you get your miracle soon. Sending you lots of baby dust.Christine",

    "question": "When should you take baby asprin? Among helping w/ the blood flow, its also helps w/ the uterus lining and I'll be on clomid, so I was advised that baby asprin can help in case clomid causes any problems w/ my lining. (I guess that's one side effect of it)Do you take baby asprin through-out your cycle? Or just AFTER ovulation? I've heard of AFTER ovulation, but why? wouldn't you want it in your system to help before conception?Thanks.BTW- I can't believe I was able to open my own post this late in the day!!!! sorry, if any of you mind.\u00a0\u00a0I could have posted in the forum, but this way I may get more responses.HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL!",
