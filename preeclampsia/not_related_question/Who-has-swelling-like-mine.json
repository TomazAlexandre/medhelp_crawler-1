It's caused by swelling - the carpel tunnel in your wrist, which houses the nerves to your thumb, index, and middle finger gets pinched because of it. Pain, burning, tingling, and aching in those fingers and halfway up your arm - right? I had it BAD... but mine started later. It was awful, and got really bad towards the end to where I couldn't sleep, type, etc.... Wrist braces do help a lot. You can buy them at any major store (I got mine at walmart) or have your doctor write a prescription for you for wrist braces and your insurance may cover the cost. My carpel tunnel, and the rest of my swelling, completely went away about a week after the birth. (By the way, I had awful swelling in my feet/ankles/calves too - my left one especially.)",
