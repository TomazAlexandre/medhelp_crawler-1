            "answer": "VERY interesting question...My mother is allergic to sulfa medications. While it is supposedly an entirely different compound, she also has reactions to food products containing anything with \"sulf-\" One sip of a red wine has her entire face glowing from the sulfites. Preserved foods have a similar effect. Even things like frozen potatoes often have preservatives that make her glow.This summer she started to get terrible rashes so they did skin tests for chemical compounds. They showed she's allergic to many things, including cinnamon. But her rashes did not subside despite treatment.They are currently in the process of diagnosing her with an autoimmune disorder. She has many of the classic signs of lupus, including rashes, sores in her mouth, joint pain, leg pain, light sensitivity, fatigue etc... She also has arthritis.What concerns me (in addition to worrying about my miserable mother) is that i have the same exact reaction to red wine. literally only 1 sip can make my face break out. I've never been on a sulfa medication and hope to avoid it, since it was that severe reaction that started all of her other problems. (and is the fact that I had preeclampsia just a coincidence? I read it occurs more frequently in people with autoimmune disorders). I am also very concerned because my 16 yr old sister often has rashes, and she reacts to similar foods my mom does. Basically, she gets hives from anything with preservatives- chips, boston market food, chinese food, frozen potato products, etc... She has been tested for food allergies and it came up negative, but she still always gets rashes. She also frequently has \"growing pains\" (she's 16). I have read that the younger a person is diagnosed with autoimmune disorders, the worse the symptoms get. I pray that all of this is just coincidental.",
