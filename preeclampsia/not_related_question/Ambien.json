            "answer": "To be honest- this question is great for the pharmacist. Double-check with the pharmacist and ask what class the drug is. In fact I'll do a quick search right now to see if I can find out the \"class\" of the drug.Do not increase your dose, take it more frequently or use it for a longer period of time than prescribed because this drug can be habit-forming. If this drug is used for an extended period of time, do not suddenly stop using it without your doctor's approval. Some conditions may become worse when the drug is abruptly stopped. Your dose may need to be gradually decreased.This medication should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.Use of AMBIEN during pregnancy is not recommended and should be considered only if your physician determines it is needed. Sleep medicines may cause sedation of the unborn baby when used during the last weeks of pregnancy.And finally I found this link:http://insomnia.emedtv.com/ambien/ambien-during-pregnancy.htmlIt is a Class C drug, meaning it has not been tested on humans. But during animal clinical trials the drug did cause problems with the animals' unborn babies.",

            "answer": "Oh and I want to add this quote from the link I gave you:None of the animal studies suggested that Ambien caused birth defects.It is important to note that animals do not always respond to medicines the same way that humans do. Therefore, a pregnancy Category C medicine may be given to a pregnant woman if the healthcare provider believes that the benefits to the woman outweigh any possible risks to the unborn child.",

            "answer": "Hi, I just wanted to drop a little note to you.\u00a0\u00a0I have taken this medication before.\u00a0\u00a0It worked pretty well, as regular Ambien is formulated only to put you in the deep stages of sleep for about 4 hours, so usually (not all the time becuase of course everyone is defferent and responds differently) when you wake up in the morning you aren't all hung over like you are sometimes when you take like Benedryl or something.\u00a0\u00a0I was on it for a while, and then I changed doctors and he changed me to Trazodone.\u00a0\u00a0I do not take any of those anymore since I found out that I was pregnant, but I do know that Trazodone is usually ok to take when you are pregnant, or so I have read.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diagnosed with horrible insomnia, so that's how I know these things.\u00a0\u00a0My opinion would be that if your doctor gave you the perscription knowing that you are pregnant, than it should be alright.\u00a0\u00a0The reason why it has not been tested in pregnancy is because they do not approve medication trials on pregnant women....The only bad side effect that I can say that I experienced and also have heard from other people who have been on this medication is that it sometimes will cause abnesia (or amnesia, I am not sure of the spelling, lol)\u00a0\u00a0in some cases.\u00a0\u00a0There was one case that I heard of from a lady that was on the Army base here next to me that she actually got up and went out to her car and began driving around on base, and had no idea!\u00a0\u00a0That was kind of scary, but hwat I experienced was definately not that extreme.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that happened to me would be when I took it, and I started to get really sleepy, I would wake up the next morning and not remember going to bed, or anything, I would actually have conversations with my husband and not remember a thing about it!\u00a0\u00a0My best advice would be if you have a strong negative feeling about it, then don't take it.\u00a0\u00a0And when you go to your doctor's appointment next, dicuss your concerns with him, and make sure that he understands that it's not the fact of insomnia that's bothering you but it's the pain, and you would like him to give you something to manage that.\u00a0\u00a0I know that taking pain medication during pregnancy is usually safe, as long as you don't take it like the whole time you are pregnant, and it won't do anything to the baby if you take it for a long period of time, it's just that when you have the baby it will go through withdrawls after birth...that's why they don't like you to take it for extended periods of time.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you, and remember, in the end it's ultimately your decision, and gut feelings are always right.Tara",

            "answer": "Well, good luck!\u00a0\u00a0That is probably most definately why they didn't want to give you anything for the pain!\u00a0\u00a0I had PIH with my 3rd son and got induced 3 weeks early with him as well, so I know kind of what you are going through, but I know when you have the baby it will be a marveloous feeling!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!Tara",
