    "question": "So I turned 19 on the 10th and for a late bday present my best friend took me to see the battle of the five armies. I have been in for contractions before but wasn't dialated above a 1 but everyone teased me I would go into labor at the movies since I've waited so long. As soon as it starts I started having contractions 5 mins apart and lasting 1 min immediately so I called my midwife after 40 mins and she told me to wait an hour before coming in if they didn't stop since I was 35 weeks 3 days. So they didn't and I went in and wasn't dilating so I was going to get sent home except I had slightly high blood pressure. I also had a very mild uti I caught the day before and had been taking meds for. Every time they came back my blood pressure was higher and higher which had never been a problem for me. They kept me over night and gave me meds to slow down my blood pressure and started a 24 hour urine test. Even with the meds my blood pressure reached 180/110 and they gave me meds to help prevent seizures and told me they were going to induce me in the morning since it was the middle of the night and they wanted the blood pressure meds in my system. But my blood pressure never went down and am ultrasound showed the baby (he's been head down since 27 weeks) turned sideways and was transversal so they couldn't induce or try to turn him because of the already rick of high pressure. So at 8:45 am on 12/18 I was told I was having a c section at 4 pm. It wasn't too bad but he is in the nicu for his lungs and they want to make sure he can regulate temp and breathe on his own. I didn't get to hold him but got to spend 5 mins with him before he went to nicu and I can't see him until 5 pm tomorrow, 24 hours after my c section because of me being carefully watched and on bed rest for at least 24 hours because of preclampsia that I discovered I had the night before. I can't even go to the nicu and see him until tomorrow so I've only seen pictures that have been taken of him by my friend and mom who go to see him in the nicu. I can't wait to hold him tomorrow and imbso glad nothing happened to my little beautiful boy!! Sorry this was soo long",
