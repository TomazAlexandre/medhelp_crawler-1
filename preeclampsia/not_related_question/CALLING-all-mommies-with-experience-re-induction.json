            "answer": "I was induced both times for preeclampsia and eclampsia. The pitosin is pretty rough, although, I don't know any different. It's pretty much just tons of prep and needles and the prep is pretty exhausting itself. My son got stuck and it took 2 hours to push him out and the nurse said that he was on the edge of c-section. With my daughter, they acted like I went to fast and refused to believe that I needed to push until she was crowning 3 seconds later and with my son they acted like I took too long and kept trying to make me race the other laboring moms, so don't pay attention if they act like your timing is too fast or too slow...",

Friday I saw my Dr and she said I was 2 cm dilated. This is my second one and I.was induced with my first one I.went.over two weeks. Everything went fine. So this tome around I might get induced too. Since I haven't had any contractions or anything at all. I have another Dr appointment on Friday and if..still the same I have to go.back the 29 for.a no stress test and if everything is fine I will be scheduled for induction on January 1st. So am excited I.want.to meet my baby already but nervous at the same time. I been bouncing on a ball, walking, and nothing. So I guess is until baby boy is ready. Congrats tapas and hope everything goes well for you.",

Induced me a week before my due date. Both deliveries were a breeze and quick. I know it's not always like that for everyone. My first pregnancy had a few issues like my son's head wasn't passing my pelvic bone so he had to be suctioned out and I threw up right after delivery but that was it. That one took a total of 6 hours from start to finish. My second wasn't waiting for anything. That one was a total of 2 hours from start to finish and it was a perfect delivery. I haven't heard of very many close to me having to have c sections because of induction, but it's completely different for everyone. Good luck.",

Have already been in false labor 2x with this one.\u00a0\u00a0If u get the induction get the epidural,\u00a0\u00a0I could still feel everything just at lower intensity,\u00a0\u00a0no reason to be a hero just pushing the baby out makes you a hero.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your dr and the anesthesiologist to answer ALL of your questions.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you are comfortable and you know your body if there is adr on call that is on the phone calling the shots just remember is your body and you have the right to question and deny all of their actions.\u00a0\u00a02nd pregnancy they tried to induce me in the middle of the night while I was sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0I said why can't I wait for my dr? My dr did induce me that day after we talked about it.\u00a0\u00a0 False labor last week.\u00a0\u00a0Tried to induce dr on call wanted to induce at 7am. I again asked to wait for my dr. My dr said since u are on your 3rd and 3cm 70% effaced and soft but no longer labor contacting us rather send you home and cook as long as we can.\u00a0\u00a0No need to risk A NICU visit our stressing your body before is time. Go home rest put your feet up and don't do anything let's cook some more.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and Good Bless.\u00a0\u00a0Ps some Dr's like csection since it pays more.\u00a0\u00a0If they decide to do it make sure you question it and make sure it's the right decision for you.",

My ob says that if baby isn't here by Christmas eve then baby and I will be scheduled to be induced on Dec 29th. How many of you ladies have gotten induced and if so what were your experiences? My ob also voiced his concern that with being induced it increases my chances of a csection from 15-45%. I'm kinda bummed bc I'd rather not get induced but I don't want any complications with baby either.",
