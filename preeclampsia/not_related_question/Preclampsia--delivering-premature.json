    "question": "Each appt my dr has been expressing the babys chances to live outside the womb and im starting to feel like he doesnt think I'll make it to 38 weeks before developing preclampsia. Im wondering if anyone had to deliver premature due to preclampsia and also if you had to get a csection...my dr is very busy these days due to taking on another drs patients and I just havent had the one on one time that I need lately. I know if I sat down and started with questions he'd give me all the time in the world but I feel quilty bc I know he's so busy and exhausted.... what signs should I be looking for to be concerned? Swelling, fever, jump in bp??",
