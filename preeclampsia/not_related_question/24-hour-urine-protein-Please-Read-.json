Although you may not be diabetic, they want to do a 24 hr .urine protein level because high bp can also cause diabetes... If you have protein in your urine, that mean's you are possibly diabetic.. I know this because my husband is, and he has to do 24 hr urine's all the time...",

            "answer": "I'm sorry you are having to go through this.. my sister who had her baby two years ago this April had to do the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0They noticed her blood pressure rising and the put her on limited activity and had her checking her bp very often, if it got over a certain point they wanted her to call bc they would talk about inducing.. they also had her do the 24 hour urine specimen, this was to see if there was any protein in her urine, there was a small amount in that but they did another urine sample at the ob's office and there was even more so they induced her labor at 39 weeks, they'll watch you very closely because preeclampsia can be serious.\u00a0\u00a0Luckily they watched her so carefully and took the baby when they did because her placenta had started to fail and Alysia's skin was sagging from that, she wasn't getting all her nutrients and such..I'm not trying to scare you I'm just letting you know what I know.. Goodluck and keep us updated!",

    "question": "Well I went for my doctors appointment today. I am 32 weeks. I came in with high blood pressure and after a retry it was down a little bit. I got a huge lecture from the nurse and it made me feel really stupid for the way Ive been eating! Like really. Now they gave me a jug to put all my urine in for the next 24 hours to see my protein levels. I have NEVER heard of this before.. Has anyone had this done or heard about it?? Also, what are the outcomes of high blood pressure during pregnancy? And if I start eating right can I bring it down quickly? Any answers please?",
