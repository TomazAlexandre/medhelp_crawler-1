I breastfed and I think by the time my daughter was 9 months old I was down to my pre-pregnancy weight. The first 20 or so lbs seem to come off quickly, but after that it's more like 1-2 lbs a week. When my daughter was 1 yr old, I was a few lbs below my prepregnancy weight, and when my daughter turned 2, I was 10 lbs below my prepregnancy wt. Now my daughter it almost 2 1/2 and I'm pregnant again, so I'm trying not to gain 50 this time!",

I looked like hell after having CJ, depsite being thinner than I was starting my pregnancy. I have to agree with the docs, it was too rapid and my body was weak.Don't fret too much, losing 35 lbs is great, don't stress if it takes a few months to lose the rest.",
