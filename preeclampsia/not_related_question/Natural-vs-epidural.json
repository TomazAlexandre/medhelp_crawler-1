            "answer": "Honestly I hated the epidural. I couldn't walk around or do what I wanted. When I finally made it home my spine hurt so bad in that spot and it made it hard for me to carry my little boy around. It took a while for it to stop hurting so bad. I want to go natural this time with a water birth. I heard they are so relaxing and help to keep you from be as uncomfortable with the contractions and also most of the time women don't rip or tear or gave the eposctocpy lol I know it's not spelled right.I was forced to have the epidural because of the preeclampsia my blood pressure went up too much with contractions. This time I hope my blood pressure stays good and I don't have to be induced at 35 weeks I want to go to full term and push this baby out pain and all that way I don't have to sit around waiting on the rest of the pitocin bag to finish up. I was so ready to go see my baby in the special care unit.",

    "question": "So when I had my son he came so quickly I didn't have time to get an epidural. Pushing him out didn't really hurt it was the contractions that kicked my ***. Lol. This time around I'm wondering if I should just go for natural again... Im terrified of the epidural because i have scoliosis and i dont want it to make my back pain worse in the long run since im already in alot of pain everyday. Has anybody had a natural and epidural and preferred one to the other.? And moms who've had an epidural do you notice back pain now after having it.?",
