My oldest son I had to be induced with because I was really young and he was a big baby and they didn't want me to be forced into a csection which would have had to happen if he got any bigger since I have a tiny frame to begin with and at that time my pelvic bone wasn't mature enough to spread. With my second son they induced me because they predicted he was going to be just as big as my first one and they had a fear he was going to have a BM inside me which could cause a lung infection for him or if its not caught it could kill both of us. With this pregnancy I want to experience everything I didn't get to with my others because this will probably be my last...so I want to avoid being induced at almost any cost for the simple fact that I want to know what its like to have my water break at home or while walking through walmart lol I want that story to tell. However both of my inductions went great so if it unfortunately comes down to needing one the only reason ill be upset is because I didn't get to experience natural labor. But I just want to make it known that there is a point where the baby can be in moms belly too long, hence so many fatalities during/because of child birth back in the day...and I'm not saying all of those are because the baby was in there too long but some are",
