    "question": "Went to my doctors appt. on Tuesday and my blood pressure was high again plus I am so swollen! So my doctor sent me to hospital to be monitored and to do a stress test for baby girl and my blood pressure went down but thats because I was laying down. All my test came back normal. Baby girl passed the stress test. I was released but put on bed rest. Had to go see him on Thursday and he's going to induce me next week on the 11th. I'm not due until the 18th. It's a week early but I feel so guilty for having to get induced. I know baby isn't ready to come because if she was she'd be here. I know he's doing it for the best but I can't help but feel bad. Plus my fluid isn't the best. Anyone else having to get induced and feeling guilty?",
