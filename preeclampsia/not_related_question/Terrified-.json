Just know you are not alone in your fears bc I for one am terrified also! I just try to tell myself so many women do this every single day and if they can do it so can we.

The unknown is very scary but I will tell you that once you get there and have it all going on, it does get a little wow, this is happening. But it will be over before you know it. I cannot explain the love I felt for my baby once I laid my eyes on him. It was INSTANT. I loved him before he was born but seeing them for myself was absolutely the best moment of my entire life. I now have two boys and both times I fell in love instantly. It's amazing what women can do.I went through back labor and a few times my babies heart rates dropped on both of the deliveries and that scared me a lot, but I had a great doctor and nurses that helped me stay calm.Just imagine back in the older days. My grandmother said they didn't have epidurals and no one was allowed back in the room while she was giving birth. It's amazing how things have changed.",
