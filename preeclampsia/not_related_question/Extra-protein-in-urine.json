            "answer": "Hmm. I had this happen with my first but I was like 22 wks or so. They sent me down to the er right away and put me on a iv for about 6hrs. I also had a stomach bug though. But they told me it meant my body wasn't breaking down my sugars properly. Just be glad no matter what your 37 wks so if you have the baby it will be ok. :-)",

            "answer": "This happened to me. They had me do a 24 hour urine catch and about two weeks later I had to do another. My levels were so high they wanted to induce me out of fear I was beginning to develop preeclampsia. The only thing that saved me from being diagnosed with it is my blood pressure was never high. I was induced last month at 38+6. Good luck and best wishes!",

            "answer": "Thats kinda what i thought about right away. I dont have the blood pressure issue luckily, but i just don't get how that was overlooked for 3 tests without me knowing and me having brought up how crazy swollen I've been every visit. I have seen different Drs. Most visits(same office) because i moved across country mid pregnancy(husband in military) and needed to meet them all, but yeah luckily this is happening at the end of the pregnancy...as long as it isn't going to affect the baby.",

    "question": "Today the dr told me that apparently for the past 3 weeks i've had extra protein in my urine. This is the 1st time i'm hearing of this for some reason and she pointed out how swollen my feet were, which i usually do every appt because i feel they're too big. She said she would go over it more and didn't and i forgot also. Have you experienced this and was it a major concern? I'm going to call back for more info tomorrow. I'm just about 37 weeks.",
