She had preeclampsia and he was only 10 days old and in the NICCU when we lost him. I am so worried that could happen to us. I am constantly wondering how my little one is doing. I think it's normal when something tragic happens. I hold my breath at each ultrasound and I am 18+1. I just get so nervous because I can't see it everyday on the ultrasound. I definitely understand that worried feeling! I have two dogs both over 65lbs and I get so scared when one accidentally steps on my belly. We should buy portable ultrasound wands that can plug into our phones. Maybe that would help you. I hear they are easy to use. :)",

I was nervous up until I hit my 2nd trimester and then calmed down a bit but I still get nervous. I don't think it will end until I actually deliver! If your nervous about the fall try the ER. That may calm your nerves a bit. After you pass the first trimester your chances of miscarring again are lower significantly...try to calm yourself hun. Stressing doesn't help one bit.",

    "question": "I am a ftm and 22+2 weeks along. I suffered a miscarriage back in February and, unintentionally, got pregnant soon after. This entire pregnancy I've been so nervous for my baby's health. Every little pain is magnified. I'm always fearing that I'll lose my baby. So my question is, should I be worried? I think I've only felt my baby once and I wasn't even sure it was movement. I also fell on my butt pretty hard last night so now my worry has increased. I know my doctor said everything was fine at my last ultrasound but that's what she said the day before I miscarried my first pregnancy. I can't sleep or eat, I am so full of anxiety. And now I keep thinking that falling as hard as I did last night has harmed my baby on top of my other worries. It drove me to a panic attack last night, which I haven't had since high school. I guess I just need reassurance or thoughts.",
