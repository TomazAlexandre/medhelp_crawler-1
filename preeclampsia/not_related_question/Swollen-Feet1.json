Drink water, keep your feet up when you can during the day, have some time at night to put your feet higher up, I use a hot water bottle by my feet at night that has been in the freezer all day it's amazing! Look into some Yoga stretching for your feet/ankles too that helps!",

    "question": "I'm 21w5d and have really started experiencing swollen feet, especially by the end of the day. They ache pretty badly too! With my first, I had severe Edema and it looks like the early arrival of swollen feet now is a sign I will have it again. Anyone else already having this? Anyone have advice as to what helped you keep the swelling down?",
