            "answer": "This is a very tough situation. I don't think anyone here should tell you what to do. But rather, give a 'if it were me\" I guess...So if it were me...I would gather a few opinions from medical professionals. Get a good idea of what the chances are in either direction. If it were not good news.... I probably wouldn't want to go through with the pregnancy only because Id have one child in the world who would still need me should anything go wrong.I don't think a person in the world not even the most pro-life holier than thou could shame you for that.I hope I wasn't too insensitive. Its such a tough situation to be in.\u00a0\u00a0I really hope agood solution presents itself to you and you can have a happy ending <3Thoughts with you <3",

            "answer": "My first pregnancy was an ordeal but not nearly to the extent of yours. I was induced at 36 wks because\u00a0i\u00a0had preeclampsia, cholestasis, jaundice, and some other issues. I was terrified when I became pregnant again 3 yrs later. But none of my other pregnancies were like that. In your situation I would def go to a specialist, but I would think the drs would've warned you after your first baby if it was most likely to happen again, and given you the option of tubal ligation or something if the risk was too high.",

I just wanted time to think about it and then I never went back for it just got on birth control. Now four years later I'm just hoping that I wont have to go through such an ordeal again.

    "question": "I'm 26 years old and just found out I'm 5 weeks pregnant. My first pregnancy was awful. I was sick whole time. Couldn't eat a thing. By the end of pregnancy I was 60lbs lighter. My blood pressure went haywire and at 22 I had not ever had blood pressure issues. I also have Psuedo Tumor Cerebri. My baby came two months early and only weighed 2.4 lbs. I almost died and had to stay in hospital 2 weeks after delivery by C-section because they couldn't get blood pressure down. I also needed a blood transfusion and I had blood clots up under my skin where they put staples in. So I had to be opened back up and cleaned out which was one of the worst pains I've ever had in my life. I also had to wear a stomach vac to heal that for a month and be cleaned every two days. AWFUL!! When I just found out I was pregnant again of course I'm terrified of going through such an ordeal like that again. I Called my obgyn and told them I was pregnant and they told me they could not continue seeing me because I was such a high risk. That really hurt and pissed off all at same time. They made me feel as if this pregnancy would probably be no better and they didn't want my death on their hands. I'm scared and we don't know what to do. Could this get better or is this a chance I should not take? Please only positive feedback. Thanks in advance.",
