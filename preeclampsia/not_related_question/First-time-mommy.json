            "answer": "Protein in your urine can be normal, if you've consumed a lot of protein you will likely spill some into your urine. However, like I said it can be a sign of other problems too. If your Dr is concerned they will usually order other tests and monitor your BP. Problems like preeclampsia are not exceedingly uncommon, but they don't happen to everyone. Preeclampsia needs to be closely watched because if not controlled it can easily develop into eclampsia which can often be fatal.",
