            "answer": "I think its time for you to go beyond your PCP and be referred to a neurologist - they can get your entire history and get a good neurological examination - they will also be able to follow and interpret the results of any testing like MRIThe widespread nature of the tingling in both arms and legs might suggest a problem in the cervical spinal cord, the sneeze worsening it or the electric shock like sensation would support this. One of the possible causes is MS among other things, your age, gender, and family history makes MS a bit more likely. HOwever this post cannot take the place of a complete opinion as I do not know your full story etc.MS is a treatable condition so it should be identifies and looked for along with other possible causes, for example, Vitamin deficiency, sarcoid, syrinx, or growths. Usually to identify MS, and MRI of the brain and cervical spinal cord is done, and also a spinal tap for analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid, and visual evoked potentials (an electrical test of vision). All these can be done through your local neurologist.Good luck",

Regardless, particularly given your mother having ms, it is good to get an mri to make sure that is not a factor. From these forums, you can gather there are a lot of things that cause the sensations you are experiencing, it is important to rule out more serious problems.\u00a0\u00a0I'd be curious to know if c-sections could cause such sensations.\u00a0\u00a0I also know anxiety can make symptoms MUCH worse (as can too much searching on internet!).\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to the doctors and my apologies for intruding on thread!",

Mostly off and on symptoms like face going numb and tingling, different parts of my body going numb etc. But lately getting more and more frequent. At times my legs feel like tree stumps and they just dont want to move. 6 years ago had similar sytoms and Dr's did a series of tests...they thought I had Lupus, but that was negative so they diagnosed me w/ Fibromyalgia & Chronic Fatigue after about 6 months or so the symptoms gradually lessend and for a short time went away...No MRI's were ever done and I am seriously doubting this diagnosis. Within the last year I have been experiencing bouts of forgetfulness and severe fatigue along with numbness in my face and feet that goes away and comes back, Dr. said it was depression and put me on Wellbutrin.(don't know how depression can make the side of your face go numb, but anyways) Not happy with that diagnosis. So have a Dr. appt. this Friday, going to demand he give me a refferal to a Neurologist so that I can try to figure out what is wrong with me. I am so tired of feeling this way. Wish me luck!I'm glad I found this forum...gives me room to vent :o)",

It was sporadic at first happening only a few times per week. then it would go away for a week or so only to return. Now it's\u00a0\u00a0back, off and on for about two weeks until Friday when I had to go to the Dr. because it was so intense. In june my Dr. told me I had one of two rare cancers, which proved to be false after blood work. Then he told me I became allergic to NORVASC which I discontinued and was not releived of the tingling. I switched Drs and the new one told me I was experiencing stress and prescribed something that made me tired. It didn't relieve the tingling. Now I've been refered to a neurologist. I understand the frustration you feel with no real diagnosis and the fear that comes with the unknown.Good luck to you and I hope you find relief.",

Let me first mention that I have been rear ended 6 times, had my head bonked by two very heavy objects, but that was years ago, like over 10 years now. Since then, I have been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and just this year this awful dizzy feeling started to happen. I feel like I'm going to pass out, can't get a grip on myself, my face feels numb and so on. At first I thought it was just anxiety as I have suffered from it in the past, but I've STARTED taking xanax for it and it doesn't go away. So, I don't think it's just anxiety. Sometimes I feel like I'm going mad from this. I dread waking up, because I know what will I start to feel this. I have since seen a neurologist, an ear, nose and throat doctor and have had a CTscan and an MRI. Every test came back normal. My blood tests were normal. I do have a bulging disc right above my neck bone, forgot the numbers. I get migraines and dizzy spells and I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING CRAZY!!! Please know you are not alone.

All of my symptoms started just after the birth of my first child 2 and a half years ago(via section as well). After some severe complications I came home with my baby and thats when the timgling and numb feelings started in left side and face(left side as well). I was also experiencing postpartum and panic brought on by post traumatic stress from the complications in hospital although I did not know this at teh time. Anyhow, I went to the ER whrethey ruled out stroke and saw a neuro who ordered an evoked potential, MRI, etc and ruled out MS. As soon as all teh tests came back clear, my symptoms seemed to subside. Anyhow, during my pregnancy last summer I experienced the same life threatening problem and went thru a great deal of stress but delivered (via section again) my daughter with no complications. Then the say of her first birthday(3 weeks ago) my left eye started to twitch every 10 minutes and continued to do so for 5 days before pain in the eyeball set in. I saw an eye doctor who ruled out optic neuritis and said that teh problem wan't occular. The next day started with the numbless/tingling in left side all over again, although this time worse than last/ As well there was little shock sensations every few seconds all over my body. The tingling moved over to the right side as well and then in teh same week I experienced a \"feeling\" of weakness in my legs when I was walking and my hamds. AlthoughI felt this weakness I could still physically walk and lift things. I went to teh hiospital because my MD has been away for 3 weeks and at first they thought I had a viral nerve infections and said to come back if it got wores. When I went back a few days later they thought I may have Ebstein Barr and did some blood work that is still not back. Then another doctor told me it may be early MS, and that I need to see a neuro, so he made the referral. Anyhow, it semed like new symptoms were popping up each day. First the eyelid, tehn the pain in eye, then the numbness/tingling, then the shock sensations, then the wierd feelings in my head and the fuzzy thinking. My appt. with the neuro is still not for 6 weeks and I am going nuts here scared to death. There were 3 days whenn I felt I couldn't even function but had no choice bacause of teh babies. My symptoms have seemed to lessen in teh past few day although teh tingling in my face and neck are present as I write this. There has beeen a great deal of emotoional stress on mr for many months preceding this and I wonder if it could all be anxiety/stress related as I was trying to rid myself of some stress. And this episode did start(the eye twitching) after an argument with hubby. Anyhow, if anyone wants to chat about all this please feel free to contact me at ***@****\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks and god luck to you all.",

Did you have a rash or other signs of an allergy? Also numbness and tingling can be from a post viral syndrome you are correct. My point in mentioning my infection and my antbx therapy was to show the significance of the infection I was dx with. It is a rare mycobacterial infection 2 of 100,000 people are dx with a yr. that needed long term antbx tx, not that I thought I was having the sensory symptoms from the antbx itself. I would just like to mention that. They used me as a study at a University hospital because they feel I have an underlying autoimmune d/o. I guess, I was questioning has anyone else been in this type of situation from being immunosuppressed after the birth of their child? or Have they been told that birth and labor itself leaves the body in a comprimised state which places you at risk for infection/ virus that could leave you with these types of symptoms. I have been tx with 3 different doctors an Infectious disease Dr., A Rheum, and a Neuro Some things are starting to come together but there are still alot of unanswered questions I wish could be answered. Goodluck again to all of you. I think it can take a long period of time to figure things out.",

            "answer": "Hi everyone. I can sympathize with all of you suffering from all these strange sensations! In November of last year, I started experiencing these electric-like shocks and body twitches all over my body. They were not painful at all, but they just felt very weird. I had them in my legs, arms, back, chest, neck, eyes, and lips. I also had tingling sensations EVERYWHERE, even in the occipital(back) part of my head, my face, just everywhere. My legs and arms felt numbed if I sat still in one place for more that 2 minutes. My toes went numbed all the time (walking, standing or laying down). Other symptoms I experienced were burning sensations e/w but mostly in the shins, thighs, and shoulders. The back of my head (inside) felt very cold at times and in my head I kept having these bizarre nerve/ electric shocks-like pains. I was also very dizzy. In the mornings upon awaking, I felt very stiff (in my joints) and swollen all over. I had ringing in the ears. My throat felt very tight all the time, but it did not make it difficult to eat. All these symptoms appeared after taking amoxicillin on three different occasions (in a period of 4 months) or so to treat a\u00a0\u00a0re-occuring strep throat. I have no idea if the medicine had anything to do with my symptoms, but it was the only thing I could think of. By the way, all of these systemic symptoms I have mentioned continue to this day. All my life I've been a super healthy person; not only physically, but mentally as well. I have never had any episodes of anxiety. No depression what so ever, and no major fears or negative thinking. People know me for the super-happy-go-lucky/positive person I am. So these symptoms have nothing to do w/ anxiety or depression.I went to see my general doctor about a week after I experienced my first symptoms (the tingling and burning all over). The doctor did a physical examination and concluded I must have a viral infection. She told me to go home to rest and return in two weeks if I wasn't better. Then, two weeks later I was feeling worse. Same symptoms, but with a lot more intensity. So the doctor ordered a complete blood count. They also checked for thyroid disease, diabetes, lupus, and even certain types of cancers. The results were ALL normal. No signs of a bacterial infection either. The doctor then prescribed advil for my headache, and diagnosed me with \"atypical migranes\". I was furious because I knew that someone with an atypical migrane would not be experiencing all the systemic sensations I was experiencing. But I went home and took a dose of advil every 6 hours to see if that would help. It did NOTHING. The following week, I consulted with another general doctor and she referred me to a neurologist. The neurologist did conduction nerve tests, an MRI of the head and the neck. Results were again all normal. So the neuro ruled out MS and ordered more blood work. They tested me for Hepatitis B & C, HIV (and all poss. STDs), other types of cancer, more tests for lupus, arthritis, heart-related proteins, and a whole bunch of other things. EVERY single thing came back normal! Now, the doctors had no idea what to tell me. THe neuro prescribed some anti-anxiety medicine to treat restless leg syndrome ( but this would not explain all my other symptoms), I went home and took the med for 10 days anyway. The medicine didnot do anything to treat my symptoms, but it did give me some bad side-effects. So neuro took me off the med. and reffered me to a rheumatologist because he thought I may have an auto-immune disease. The rheumatologist saw me twice and did a WHOLE bunch of more blood tests. They ALL came back normal. Everyone was puzzled. Thankfully, none of the doctors blamed my mind (thought I was crazy) and kept searching for possible explanations. After seeing about 6 different doctors, my rheumatologist finally diagnosed me with fibromalgia, although he did tell me I was a rare case since I did not have those tender spots that people with fibro usually have. I'm afraid now the doctor just wanted to put a name to all of my symptoms, and that I really do not have fibromalgia. I keep reading books about it, and it just doesn't make sense to me that I have fibro. Like I said before, I am a very happy and positive kind of person, and though I know the doctors have not yet found a real explanation to all of my bizarre symptoms, I go about life with a positive attitude and try to enjoy and make the best of every single day. To all of you who are going through a similar situation, please do not dispair! It is very important that you keep searching for possible explanations. But if you do not find them, then try alternative routes. Do yoga, eat healthy, exercise, socialize, try acupuncture, homeopathic remedies, etc. The point is to feel like you are doing something for yourself (when traditional medicine has let you down). Good luck to all of you. I'd love to hear from anyone with similar symptoms. Thank you!",

            "answer": "In August we were in Lk. George NY when we returned I became very ill with a high fever, weakness and sore throat. A few weeks later I did not feel better. In the middle of September one of my son's had a high fever, weak, sore throat. I took him to the doctor, he did a strep test, it was negative. He said it was viral. He continued to feel worst. The week after he was sick, I got very weak, couldn't walk, tired etc. I went to my doctor he said it was also viral. One day after that we both took Echinechea to maybe speed up the immune system. The day after that we both got weak, tired, sore muscles, headaches, tingling sensations all over, numbness, uncoordinated, lower back pain, joint pain all over, stiff neck and daily dizziness. I took both of us to infectious disease doctors. Both doctors ran many, many tests, all tests came of negative. We were told if the symptoms get worst to see a Neurologist. (I did see one earlier for a quickie reflex test, doctor said he didn't believe it to be neurological in origin. My son's doctor did many relfex tests also and he passed. We were told if the symptoms are slowly leaving the body no need to see a neurologist. If the symptoms are getting worst definately investigate further. The symptoms have subsided we are left with occasional symptoms. However, both of us have just been diagnosed with sinus infections. We are both on Biaxin. I feel 100% better since the antibiotics. My son feels better too. I wonder if what wwe had was not viral at all and maybe a bacteria which started all this. Also, both doctors said there are thousands of viruses that there are no tests for and no names for. We were diagnosed with post viral syndrome which could last a few months or years. I no longer believe that doctors are using a cop out when they say it's a virus. But I do believe that our virus was bacterial in nature and we should have been given antibiotics. Unfortunately, we may never really know what caused this, that is the frustrating part for us. Also, I highly doubt both of us came down with MS at the same time. I no longer worry about it, I take life as it comes. Many not so bad illnesses can cause tingling and numbness such as Hashimotos Thyroiditis, Viruses, Flus, Sinusitis, Back and Neck problems, Stress, Migraines, Lyme Diease, even too many of a certain vitamin like B6 or selenium can cause these symptoms, diabetes too. Zinc and herbs can do things too. We try not to pay so much attention to the symptoms unless they get worst. Good luck to all. Feel free to comment.",

My biggest symptom was SEVERE fatigue, could not get out of bed for a week.

I did for a week and now I have this tingling and numbness and the fatigue has returned. The whole time no one has even suggested a MRI and Im so scared that I could have MS.But, my only symptom that makes me think MS is the numbness/tingling. I only have slight visual disturbances which manifest themselves as eye discomfort (not focussing issues)and sometimes when I go out grocery shopping my legs get heavy and I feel tired.

I've seen a neuro for a quickie reflex test, watched me walk, talked to me and said he did not believe the problem was neurological in origin. We have joint pain all over, tingling or what you would call quick starburst type of sensations all over even on the back of our heads. We had headaches, fatigue, low grade fevers from time to time. We were tested for Lyme among many other tests, all negative. Both my infectious disease doctor and mine said as long as the symptoms are not getting worst and they are slowly leaving the body they beleive it to be post viral syndrome. If the symptoms get worst or plateau they suggest seeing a neuro. Slowly we are getting energy back. We were told that it could take two months or maybe a year. I also have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis which could cause these symptoms, my son however, does not. Our symptoms came on around the same time. We both noticed that when we are active we don't notice them as much. In fact I wonder sometimes are we concentrating on them? Both of us were sick for a while with a virus prior to these symptoms. The majority of symptoms came two weeks after being sick and have lingered till today. After all these symptoms I did much research on MS and it is not the death sentence I made it out to be. Of course we don't want MS however, I don't believe I am as scared as I once was. Over 70% of people never need a wheelchair. Many times patients use canes, braces and chairs to battle fatigue and help them get around. Don't be so afraid, we are all going throught he same thing. We are here for each other.

Its interesting that some days I feel great and people tell me how well I look and then I have these days where it is a struggle just to get out of bed and no one understands, people think im lazy. I live with my parents and they are always worried about me, especially when I get home from work at 5.00 and then im in bed by 7pm. I keep thinking that the worse thing I ever did was google my symptoms, for several weeks I was CONVINCED 100% that I had a brain tumor and now I am convinced that i have MS. Its funny you seem to look at the symptoms and then say to yourself, \"well two weeks ago I noticed that I had this, and this and this\" and you convince yourself that you are sicker than you probably are. I have now convinced myself that i have urinary frequency and urgency (another symptom of MS) becuase I go to the toilet about every 2 hours during the day, but then I realise that I have done this my whole life!!!!I guess my only worry is that having a tingling sensation in the extremeties is NOT normal and that it indicates something no matter how minor or major is wrong.

            "answer": "Hi everyone;I am going through the same thing! But mine has been going on for TEN YEARS. It all started in 1996 with slight tingling in my fingers, and some numbness in 2 fingertips. I was just out of college, starting my new job, etc, and didn't even know about MS. I blew it off, but when the tingling and numbness recurred over the years in my feet, toes, hands, and legs, I picked a nuero out of the yelow pages in 1999 (big mistake!). First he told me I had \"female hysteria\" (ya gotta love that), and then he called me THREE MONTHS LATER, at work nonetheless, and said \"I reviewed your MRI again and actually think you have MS. We need to start you on medication right away.\" This was over the phone, at my job. He was a real winner.I immediately sought a second opinion--and saw a specialist at the Cleveland Clinic's Mellen Center. He was wonderful--and also said \"absolutely NOT MS.\" At that point, according to the Cleveland Clinic, I had a very normal MRI (brain and spine), borderline VEPs (108 and 112), and normal evoked potentials. They explained the VEPs as possibly caused by my astigmatism, and said they weren't delayed enough to be concerning.Over the years, my sx continued to wax and wane: a small spot of numbness on the bottom of my foot would last a month, then disappear. My palm would burn for a few weeks. A small tingle in my face. I live in Seattle, where the MS Centers are excellent, and have been seeing the Director of an MS Center here since 2001. I have had 3 more MRIs of brain and spine, all clear. My VEPs remain mildly abnormal, though I have never had optic neuritis. This summer, I had what seems to be my first real exacerbation--it all started in August, and is STILL going on--lots of patchy numbness, tingling, in feet, legs, hands and face, mostly on the right side of my body-- and this time, fatigue that feels like 10 trucks hit me and then backed up to park on me. I repeated all tests (normal), including b12, lyme, thyroid, and now I have my first LP scheduled in a few weeks.My neuro is evasive about answering me directly. She calls this \"very possibly MS,\" but when I asked what this could be if NOT MS, she had no answer. With clear and stable MRIs of brain and spine over 10 years, I am somewhat reassured, yet my symptoms are classic MS and can be explained by nothing else. Grrrr. So frustrated, so hard to live with such uncertainty. I am female, 31, about to get married. I like my job, eat well, exercise, take supplements, and do everything I can to minimize stress in my life. I am doing acupuncture, yoga, gentle chiropractic work, and meditation. What else can I do???Is anyone else in a similar situation? Sorry this post is so long--I am just tired of living with this \"probably MS but we may not know until it gets really bad and shows up\" condition.",

            "answer": "Hi,I'm new here and I can't beleive there's others like me! I thought that I was going crazy! My Symptoms started 4 years ago.I started having slight numbness in my arms and legs. I freaked and thought I was having a stroke so I went to the ER. All test came back ok. I felt like a jerk for going. As the years went by I still got my 2 or 3 migraines a year. This feeling would not go away. I just got worse. I have suffered from Vertigo since 1992 and would get attacks about 1 time a year lasting 1 day to a week. I also had hearing loss over the years. I started having severe back pain in 2002 and taking alot of pain meds. I decided in 2004 to have my back fused in July. Everything went great. My symptoms seem to be gone while I was on pain meds. By August I was off all meds except for Birth control. I got severe vertigo that lasted for 1 month. I also lost 80% of hearing in my right ear and 25% in my left. So I now at 40 were hearing aids in both ears. The numbness and tingle has spread to my face and seems to move around. I have felt so sick and tired for a year I can't stand it. I have had several MRI's in the past 3 years of my brain I glow! I went to my Neurolgist, he just scratched his head. All MRIs and test came back negative. Then I started having weird feeling in my eyes. Eye Dr. said things look good.I went back to my Neuro, he sent me to the Cleveland Clinic.Went through more test. All came back NEGATIVE! That was in March of this year, so I gave up and am coping with whatever this is. The Cleveland Clinc said it's probably stress. STRESS!I have no stress. I have an easy life! Now what? I am so tired of feeling the Numbness, Tingles, Severe Fatigue, Tightness in my muscles, Sick feeling, Eyeballs feeling weird, Shoulders and neck hurting and tension headaches.I'm so glad I found you guys. Hopefully someone will give us an answer.Thanx 4 listining,Neen2",

A few weeks ago I started to have a tingling sensation in my right hand and right side of my neck and face. I also am starting to have headaches at times, although not severe. I do have a few tender spots on my lower right leg down by the ankle area. I am wondering if I should see a neurologist, an internist or a orthopod. Could this perhaps be MS? And if so just how bad is MS and can it be controlled? Anyone out there have any suggestions to offer up?Dave in WV",
