That doctor or midwife have not evaluated you to be able to tell you if the instructions are right for you ad your baby.There is absolutely NOTHING that will start your labor with out your body already starting the process. Your baby is still developing and will be born when he or she is ready. Stop trying to force it to happen. Be a mother and let her finish developing. Trust your body.",
