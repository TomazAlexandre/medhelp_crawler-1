It not about our convienince but future generation (I know many wont like this concept).we will be happy if we have a healthy baby from body n mind... doest matter if we have to bear or sacrifice things.

If you have a 33 day cycle you probably conceived 5 days after a 28 day cycle. That means your due date is really 5 days later. It's crazy to be so strict on 40 weeks as a deadline.",
