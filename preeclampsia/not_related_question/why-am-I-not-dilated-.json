I am sick of the test they are running on me, the finger pricking, the headaches that never go away and being in labor and delivery every time I go to my appointments which last week I went every single day and they kept sending me home after 4 hours.",

            "answer": "High blood pressure is extremely dangerous when pregnant. It can so many problems from seizures to even the baby dying. Has your doctor set an induction date or is he just planning on waiting for you to go into labor? Since he seems to be ignoring the headaches and you've had bad tests, I personally would wait until you have a headache and go to the ER. If you have any vision loss (blurry vision, fainting, dizziness) make sure to mention that too (they'd probably induce right then and there since it's signs of preeclampsia) Also, 6 Tylenol in a day sounds like a lot. I'm not a doctor and I know Tylenol is safe but 6 seems like a lot. As for dilating, try an exercise/birthing ball. You can get them cheap at Walmart. Just sit on the ball and lightly bounce on it and move your hips in circles. You can also do squats or try walking up and down stairs. You could also try making yourself naturally go into labor. Here's some ways: sex (the sperm helps you go into labor so don't use a condom), nipple stimulation (read up on it before you do it, I read it can cause longer and more painful labor and you also have to do it for like an hour), evening primrose oil, castor oil (keep in mind that it can also cause diahrea), raspberry leaf tea, walking (from everything I've read walking up and down stairs seemed to work best), eating FRESH (not canned) pineapple/kiwi/mango. You can google other exercises and ways to induce but those are the most common. Good luck!!!",
