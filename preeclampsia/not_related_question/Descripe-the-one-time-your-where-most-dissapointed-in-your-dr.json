            "answer": "I had had ulcerative colitis for 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0It had gotten progressively worse in that time.\u00a0\u00a0My gastro doc was older and near retirement.\u00a0\u00a0When it got real bad I would call into his office and his secretary would not give me appointments and just tell me to increase my meds which I had already done.\u00a0\u00a0In the last few years I ended up in the hospital several times due to dehydration.It was during one of my hospitalizations that I was in a private room when I got the most awful pain in my abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0It was different than anything else I'd ever experienced and was excrutiating.\u00a0\u00a0I called the nurse and she told me that after all the years I'd been sick that I should be able to handle the pain better and left.\u00a0\u00a0I tried calling the doctor's office but it was night time.\u00a0\u00a0I screamed for help and nothing came.In the morning I woke to a group of people hovering around my bed with an x-ray machine.\u00a0\u00a0When the nurses changed shifts the new nurse found me in my bed with practically no blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0My bowel had perforated and the poison was throughout my body.\u00a0\u00a0They rushed me into surgery where my entire large colon was removed.\u00a0\u00a0I was in intensive care for 4 weeks and lucky to be alive.My family told me that when the surgeon came out in the hall after the operation that my gastro doc was there.\u00a0\u00a0The surgeon pushed him up against the wall and put his fist in his face.\u00a0\u00a0He told him that he had never seen a colon is such bad shape and that if he ever saw another of that gastro doctor's patients in such bad shape that he'd kill him.\u00a0\u00a0Amazing!As well, the chest tube I had that delivered pain meds and nutrition to me wasn't put in properly.\u00a0\u00a0I had a breathing tube in and could not talk and was in such pain.\u00a0\u00a0My SIL noticed that I was jumping every time someone touched the bed and got them to look at it.\u00a0\u00a0They fixed it and then gave me a morphine pump that I could press when I needed it\u00a0\u00a0It was pure joy to be able to hit that button.This was 16 years ago and feels like it happened to a different person at this point.",

At the end I started loosing fluid with her and new I was because I had gone through it with my son. I tried telling my OB and he kept telling me that I was peeing on myself and all was fine. I told him no I am not I am loosing my water I know I am. I begged him to do a sonogram and refused saying its against hospital policies to perform more than two and I had already had two sonograms.Finally two weeks after I told him I was loosing water I went into labor with my daughter and sure enough I had a dry labor due to not having any fluid and she ingested her own muconium.(sp) and was very sick at birth. They sent her cord off for testing and everything because of her illness. She had to have her lungs sucked out and scrapped at birth and before she could take her first breathe. Now she has asthma and develops upper respitory illnesses easily. I was once told by a repitory therapist that her delivery is the reason for her staying sick.All this could have been avoided if he would have just listened to me!",

Can't believe how many medicos can get it so wrong!I have a list a mile long of my problems of misdiagnosis, but here is a Readar's Digest version.Mole on my leg at age 17 was 'nothing to worry about' and simply vanity on my behalf to want it removed and checked for melanoma, which runs in my family. 5 years later different doc, 1st stage cancer...thanks!Constant tooth abscess due to my inappropriate oral hygiene. Even though not one ever had a source of entry for infection. Over time I have had almost all my molars bar 2 removed and numerous fillings.\u00a0\u00a0 Discovered it is an auto-immune thing due to my Hashimoto's attacking my teeth.Told when having one molar removed, when I said I could feel the pain of it, that I was being too focused on the pain itself. Told them I have weird nerves due to my un-noticeable deformity on one side of my face. The nerves are not were everyone else has them. Needless to say after they held me down with me screaming and they took the tooth out and me in total shock of low blood pressure, shaking etc, they said, Oh, you weren't making it up!Left knee with severe pain for 3 years put down to my leg being slightly shorter than the other., lack of exercise ( I am a walking nut!) or something else I choose to forget. Bone pain up to hip so severe I would cry in my sleep and have to sleep with legs up like a frog. Change of doctor says you have chronic chrondomalacia patallae. Surgery should severe damage due to other dumb doctors ignoring it.Same knee surgery. Told nurse that the pethidine every 4 hours was making me feel funny and it would make me knock out as I felt it going up my arm...she said I was just tired after the surgery. Different nurse walks past at one point and sees my I/V machine oxygen levels down to 40 %, my blood pressure almost non existant and my body with hives all over it and my lips swelling up...me unconscious. True Allergy to Pethidine nearly killed me.Moving along...my severe depression put down to my being abused as a child.....PTSD, hubby leaving me, and having 3 young kiddies with medical problems.\u00a0\u00a015 years of me saying something is very wrong....fast foward after numerous anti-deprresants (one which I had a severe reaction to after telling doctor I should not be on it so soon after coming off a different one, his response? \"I just love arm-chair doctors and those who peruse the net for their information\" Again, I nearly died.....sigh....) to discovering I have Hashimoto's disease and then found a pre-cancer in my thyroid...Yet again, thanks guys!So, I do have many other stories but I think that will do for the moment....The moral of the story? I think I have more than the lives of 15 cats!",

            "answer": "I'd say two stand out. The first was a dentist I had who was going to drill two cavities. He put Novacaine on one side of my gums and waited for it to get numb then came back and drilled on the wrong side. Painful to say the least (lol but not funny). I ended up going to another dentist and no reason to bump the other thread but I did recently get my teeth cleaned with the accomodations I needed for my physical disability and it was fine.As for the second it was a specialist I was referred to by my psychiatrist (can't be more detailed as I made a complaint about it). I was mailed over 50 pages asking very personal questions about my mental health history including explicit questions and if I had ever been on the wrong side of the law (which of course I haven't). I decided I'd fill out the questions that weren't too personal but his secretary said I had to fill out the whole form. I then told her I would cancel the appointment (as I could see that wasn't a person I could deal with, plus it wasn't covered under my insurance). She requested the forms back and I had no problem mailing them but then I was told I had to pay for the forms because I had marked them which cost $50. I made a formal complaint and since it was just procedural they said they couldn't process it. However because I c.c.'d the letter to the doctor to that agency (within the system, OPMC) they mailed back the check for the initial co payment as well as the payment they requested for the completed forms without further explanation. I always respect doctor's needs to complete forms beforehand but questions that personal are best asked in office.",

When I went to that appointment, my OB asked me what the specialist said. I explained that the specialist told me that I was guarenteed to develop high blood pressure, probably preeclampsia, and go into preterm labor. The doctor looked at me, laughed, and with a huge smile on his face said, \"If you had preeclampsia, we would be terminating the pregnancy\" I do not think that was funny, or a reason to smile, and I did go into preterm labor 5 weeks after his conversation at 27 weeks with very high blood pressure!",

It's like they hear a few symptoms and say yeah its ?, but don't listen to the rest. I was taken to ER by ambulance Aug 8th. Started with trouble breathing, stood up and blacked out for second, laid down still trouble breathing, started to hyperventilate. My muscles contracted. Everyone thought I was having a stroke. ER can't explain what happened. Follow up with Family DR. Went to him Monday. He says inner ear problem, because I've had diziness since the incident, and pressure in my head that gives me headaches. He gives me prescription, and thats it. Doesn't tell me I can't go to work, or not to drive. I could barely walk. Stopped taking meds as prescribed because it wasn't helping. Took nausea away but I was still dizzy. He agreed to send my to Ear Nose and Throat Spec. Drove over an hour to see this doctor. To sit in his office for 10 minutes, and have him tell me he can't help me. By listening to me explain what happened he didn't believe my problem is inner ear. Called my Family Dr. They said they were sorry, but what did I want to do now. I'm the patient, shouldn't the doctor be telling me where I should go from here. So we pushed for an MRI, I just had it done on Monday, so now I wait to see if anything is on there.I'm still dizzy and still have pressure in my head. I can't seem to believe I had a panic attack that led to this.",
