Let them know, so they know you're in pain.\u00a0\u00a0It really sucked but with my first I had to quit my job halfway through my pregnancy because I was so sick I could rarely make it in (I ended up having preeclampsia). Talk to your doctor too, but I feel like they will probably just tell you to listen to your body and take frequent breaks.",

            "answer": "I'd recommend calling your labor board to see what your rights are before talking to your boss. It's best to know your rights going into the situation because it is illegal to fire a pregnant person. It would also help your case if heaven forbid you do get fired, that there is a written record in place with the labor board about your pregnancy concerns.",
