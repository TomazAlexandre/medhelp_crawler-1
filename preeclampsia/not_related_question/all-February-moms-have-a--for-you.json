    "question": "So our time is coming ... Seems like its flying by and I love that but I have a ? For the moms to be that are due around Valentine's day with girls.. so my bday is 2/24 and my bf has tried to celebrate my bday and valentines day together before and its TEN days apart.. well I'm due 2/22 with a girl and I am having a csection so she will be here most likely the 16th.. I'm upset though because I feel as if once she gets older and gets a bf that he will try to celebrate them together and its unfair to her.. it takes away from her having two special days lol my bf tells me its not important but he's a guy so he doesn't get it ... Anyone else thought about this or am I over thinking it like my bf says...",
