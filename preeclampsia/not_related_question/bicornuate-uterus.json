I felt uncomfortable from the beginning, turning to pain, and even having difficulties walking.\u00a0\u00a0After this discovery, I obviously underwent several ultrasounds and tests to find that the reason for the pain was because I am missing my right kidney and this pregnancy is occuring in the right uterine horn where my older daughter we have discovered was in my left. (Which I was aware I was born with a solitary left kidney).\u00a0\u00a0In a \"normal pregnancy\" the uterus is supprted by the kidneys however in my case since I don't have a kidney on the right side to support it it is tilting back and laying on the nerve cord controling the bottom half of my body, my bladder, and the Vena Cava artery... which of course was causing my pain...unfortunately nothing they can do about it.\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the discovery of the bicornuate uterus, it was found that the uterine wall of the horn my current pregnancy is in is extremely thin.. that of a 36 week pregnancy... Making me a High Risk Mom...\u00a0\u00a0The docs are hopeful that I should be able to carry her to a viable point but know that it will not be to term due to concern of the uterus rupturing....\u00a0\u00a0I have thankfully made it to 20weeks with no change in thinning so hopefully my body can hang on for atleast another 8-10 weeks... that would be great!\u00a0\u00a0The pain I can live with if it means I get a healthy baby girl in return!\u00a0\u00a0If anyone else has had a similalr situation please inform me... I can't find a whole lot on someone in my case... one kidney, pregnant in opposite uterine horn then previous pregnancy as well as side with no kidney, and thin uterine wall of pregnant uterus.\u00a0\u00a0 But to those who are concerned with getting pregnant and carrying to term, its not unheard of I did the first time and had no Idea of the current situation.\u00a0\u00a0I also have never had any miscarriages, spotting, or trouble getting pregnant, Including this one!\u00a0\u00a0 Good luck to you all!Uterus-ly surprised!\u00a0\u00a0:)",

            "answer": "Well where do I begin? I am on my 3rd pregnancy and the first 2 I miscarried.. The first pregnancy was 2 1/2 years ago, and I lost it right at 3 months along. When I had went to the hospital they kept askin me if I had already lost the pregnancy and didn't know it.. Well I hadn't passed anything and I knew that wasn't possible. I went through about 12-14 hours of contractions or labor and none of the doctors could understand why I was in so much pain! Nothing helped! So after that pregnancy I went through about a year of depression.. I was so disappointed and wanted to know what had gone wrong.. I had followed the books to the \"T\". Then this past June 2010, I discovered I was pregnant again! I was both thrilled and terrified.. I didn't connect with the thought of being pregnant because the first pregnancy. Just like the first pregnancy I experienced pains from the start- spotting- and then I experienced blood clots and they were not in the 1st pregnancy.It wasn't until I began to struggle through the end of my 2nd month and around 3-4 days before my 3rd month checkup- I started to experience severe lower back pain-and I knew what it meant.. When I arrived at the hospital and the ultra sound tech began doing ultrasounds- I was told I had a bicornate uterus.. I was shocked and concerned. It explained why in the first pregnancy they couldn't find the baby and thought I had already lost it- I had been sent home after a while- only to lose that pregnancy at home.\u00a0\u00a0And from experience let me tell you... You KNOW when your miscarrying! You will pass stuff- and if they ask and every make you feel like you wouldn't know- I can tell you that is not true!\u00a0\u00a0 -- So anyways I lost my second pregnancy in around August 18 2010. It is now November 8 2010 and in all my experiences with pregnancy- I have discovered that I am about 8 weeks pregnant and I have to be honest.. Once again I am not allowing myself the comfort to get excited. All of my friends are having babies and I can't seem to relax or be happy. Its so stressful knowing what could happen. But I want to say this-- I'm 28 yrs old and not until the last few years have I ever gotten pregnant. So I do think God works in mysterious ways! I am hoping for a baby eventually- but am hoping that by not being too attached I won't get hurt again. I can't say its easy- cause its not. Having a B/U means alot of risk,, Not to mention finding a doctor now who will take a High Risk Mommy.. As well I have an incompetent cervix. So I am sure this will be interesting! Good luck to everyone..",

I had no idea that it was something to be overly concerned about. She made it seem like no big deal. When I actually miscarried, I went straight to my doctor. However, she had left for the day and I was seen by another doctor. I was completely heartbroken. My new doctor said his wife had the same exact thing. She too miscarried her first child, but went on to have two healthy children with a heart-shaped uterus. He told me to keep trying and that it wasn't impossible. I'm going to have an HSG test done to see the true shape of my uterus. I'm just waiting to have my first period after the mc. I'm still sad but hopeful that I will one day be able to have a baby.",

This is Very rare but it never hurts to check.. My right Fallopian tube was hypoplastic and didnt enter the uterus at all.. but my kidneys are normal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Keep hope.. You can get pregnant and stay pregnant (even if you need help from a doctor sometimes) with bicornuate uterus and only one tube!",

I've been told that sometimes in women with a bicornuate uterus that the cervix can be weekend and you can dilate early. My obgyn was saying that some women get a stitch put in to prevent this but that this can be risky because of infection. It can be very helpful though in preventing premature delivery. I'm trying to decide if I should just put one in for piece of mind or not. I am constantly worried about the situation. Has anyone heard of this and what are your thoughts?",
