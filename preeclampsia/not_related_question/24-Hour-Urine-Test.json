            "answer": "This is my second time with preeclamplsia.\u00a0\u00a0First time it started at 28wks and the plan was to manage it until 36wks then induce me but even with meds my bp kept rising and baby stopped growing so I had a csection at 35wks because my bp was 170/140 and protein very high. This time it started at 15wks and the highest my bp has got is 160/90 but I'm 27wks nd babys growth has slowed and i have been admitted 4 times already so dr thinks I've got about 5-6wks to go before it stops responding to meds and I'll need a csection. My understanding is after 37wks, if your healthy enough and babys growth isnt too effected, they will try to induce you.",
