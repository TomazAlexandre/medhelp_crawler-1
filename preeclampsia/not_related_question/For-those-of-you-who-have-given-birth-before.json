            "answer": "I really am no help here because I had my first little boy at 36.5 weeks and my last little boy at 38 weeks. I am afraid that I am going to go overdue this time but I walked a TON and cleaned like crazy... I stayed as active as I possibly could. I hope that you feel better soon and your little boy doesn't drive you too crazy. I know that you have minor pre-e and can't get up and walk or anything like that so I guess that waiting is going the only thing you can do =(",

            "answer": "Have you tried journal writing? Start at the beginning of your pregnancy how you felt, and work your way up to where you are now. I didn't do it with Elijah and I wish I had just for reference as to how I may feel for the next pregnancy, it's amazing how much you forget!!! Try online shopping, you don't have to buy anything but you can look at winter clothes, and look at sizes and what's out there, or baby toys, I love looking for \"learning\" toys. He won't be big enough to play with them for a while, but it's always good to get a head start looking. I've never been on bed rest so I can't imagine how you feel, or how bored you are...but I can to a degree. I was resting a lot after 23 weeks because I kept having preterm contractions, so I'd lay down and start poking on my belly, I could watch Elijah moving forever! If you have any baby books read them to him, if anything you're getting practice for Dr. Seuss's tongue twisters.If it's only 17 days until your due date why do they still want you on bed rest? I was told after 36 weeks that they wouldn't stop my contractions if I was having them, I mean I know the longer they're in the better, but still...it's only 17 days early...I had a c-section at exactly 39 weeks, planned, with Elijah, he came out just fine and no steroid shots, or anything.",

I cant go shopping, i cant do chores, i cant bounce on a birthing ball, i cant sleep because i cant get comfortable....im in pain because of contractions (that i cant get to be not irregular because i cant get out of bed to help them along!) and im not supposed to do anything to raise my blood pressure (even watching really intense movies is supposedly a bad idea) So obviously BD'ing is out the window.Dont get me wrong ladies...i want my little boy to enter this world as healthy as he can possibly be and when HE is ready ...i just cant handle the waiting...its agonizing! especially the not knowing when its gonna happen and all i do is lay in bed all day and think about him! I didnt even get to do any of the fun last minute shopping because im stuck in bed :( i wrote a list and my mom and gramma went and got everything off of it. I have everything i need and we're all ready (minus some last minute touches on the nursery) but im just sad that all i get to do is sit here and it seems everytime i go to the doctors something else happens...a new complication...i just dont know how much more i can take.I will take any and allllll suggestions! i just feel like im stuck in limbo and i'll never get to meet my boy :(",
