            "answer": "I TOTALLY AGREE! I was 24 when I had my daughter. I had no pregnancy symptoms til I was SIX MONTHS. With this pregnancy it was immediate. I notice my body changing from day one and all the text book symptoms. I'm due at the end of Jan also and feel like I'm only gonna make it til Dec. I developed preeclampsia with my first and was in labor at 35 weeks. So hopefully that won't happen with this pregnancy. But who knows. I hope the time speeds up for both of us. And best wishes.",

With my first it felt like I went through my pregnancy like nothing and this one I was sick in the beginning my body is constantly aching and I feel so tired and miserable all the time. But like the commwnt said above me maybe its because I was 23 when I had my first and now I'm 28 lol.",
