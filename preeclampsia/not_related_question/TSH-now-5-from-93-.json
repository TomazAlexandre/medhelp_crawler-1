            "answer": "If it were me, Id wait till your TSH is in range. I know FT3 and FT4 are more important, but if your TSH is still high, then your body clearly wants your FT3 and FT4 levels tweaked some more. In just 4 months you've had 2 miscarriages. I'd say that you should wait a while for your body to recuperate from THAT, which may take longer than other people since you're still hypo.You want the optimum environment for your future child to grow in. Even if this one survives, growing up in utero without the necessary amount of thyroid hormones he or she needs could result in serious developmental problems. If something like this could be avoided, why wouldn't you?Anyway, I'd say to wait a few months after your TSH is in range (though you should probably wait longer if you're still showing symptoms). During those couple of months, you're body should be recuperating from the miscarriages and whatever other damage was done while you were hypo.",

            "answer": "Thanks for that yeh. I don't know wat my T4 and T3 are to be honest all I know is that they are Normal :-/ my doctor told me to carry on trying even when I was first diagnosed with a TSH of 93. Just confused cos yes I want the best don't get me wrong but iv seen people with a high TSH and been ok through pregnancy. Yeah I miscarried with it at 12. And now it is 5 and iv already started the higher dose of 125mcg levothyroxine it really should be in the right range for trying again this month. Call me impatient I dunno just so hard to hold off when uv been trying for soooo long.",

            "answer": "Be sure to request copies of all you're blood work. Only recently have I done this. I collected records from as far back as early 2011. When I went in for testing due to my symptoms, and my husband's concern that I might be diabetic, they mentioned my cholesterol was a little high (classic sign) but not to worry about it. They decided instead to treat vitamin D deficiency (common for hypo), and yes, I felt a bit better taking it, but after the prescription ran out I stopped.After reviewing the test in 2013,\u00a0\u00a0my cholesterol was higher than I thought (I assumed borderline) 231 with a 100-199 range. They did test for TSH, but that was all they tested in the thyroid panel, so 2.53 with a .35-5.5 range, looked pretty darn good, so why bother looking into that further? Turns out my glucose level was also out of range, but only 102 with a 65-99 range, but considering that my concern was diabetes, Im surprised that they didnt mention this at all! My LY% (no idea what that is) in the CBC was also out of range, but just barely.Point is, I had a lot of things going on that I was not informed of. This was when I got off birth control and started to see if I could have children. Two months later I stopped having a period. Two store bought pregnancy tests came up negative, so I saw my gynecologist. I was given a prescription and after three months of no period, I was normal again. When asked what would cause me to stop (I was 29 then) they told me stress. I live probably the most unstressful life ever! But I believed them.Later that year, 11 months after my first blood test, I went back to the gynecologist for a regular annual visit. She knew we were trying to have kids, but my periods were irregular, meaning they weren't always 4 weeks apart. Sometimes 5, sometimes 6. I told her about my extreme fatigue and asked if she could run some tests. This time my TSH was 2.08 (.4-4.5) Again, only this was tested as far as thyroid goes, but as it turns out, my vitamin D was low, my red blood count was low, and my MCH was high...http://www.medicalhealthtests.com/articles/325/blood-tests/high-mch-blood-test.html\"There are many conditions that can cause high MCH blood test levels. These include vitamin B12 deficiency and thyroid malfunction.\"So there was the very first actual data that I might actually have a thyroid disorder, only it all went ignored. All of it was. I wasn't treated for vitamin D or iron deficiency. To make matters worse, I was also a week or two pregnant and didnt even know it. I actually didnt know until two months later because it took so long for the results and me calling!These were the only times, other than last June, that my TSH was ever looked at, even when they knew I was pregnant. After 38 weeks I was hospitalized for preeclampsia which only recently has been tied to hypothyroidism. This is very stressful on both the mother and fetus, and the only cure is to have a cesarean. Thankfully my daughter was all healthy and not premature. She'll be one year old next Thursday.I am thankful that I have her and that she's healthy, but if I knew then what I know now, I would've waited. I was unable to produce much milk, so if you're interested in breast feeding that's one reason to wait. I also am just too tired to do anything with her. I end up laying on the couch while she does her own thing. Holding her and carrying her is a huge chore, and I can't do it very long.So my advice:1) get copies of everything. There may be something they've overlooked. Plus now you've got medical history that you can show any other future doctor you go to.2) take prenatal vitamins BEFORE you get pregnant, if you're not already doing so. That way, whatever the baby needs, the baby will have3) wait until not only your TSH is normal, but your Free T3 and Free T4. Make sure you ask for these test. My doctor was not going to test for these, or even for the antibodies that might have caused my hypothyroidism. Thankfully goolarra here found me the exact test codes for the company that my doctor uses so that I could hand those over to the nurse to add without any issue.",

    "question": "I got diagnosed with an under active thyroid 4 months ago after not been able to conceive for a year! Once starting the meds i got pregnant with a TSH of 30 but miscarried at around 4 weeks. Got pregnant again two month later in July with a TSH of 12 but again miscarried at around 4 weeks. Iv now got a TSH of 5 (levels should be 0.5 -4.5 so I'm now been on a higher dose of levithyroxine the last week just to bring it down that bit more. Just wondering weather to try again this month? Seen as tho I'm soo close. T3 & T4 are normal. Any advice thanks",
