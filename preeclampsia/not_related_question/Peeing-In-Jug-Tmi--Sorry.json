My dr said if results came out positive he would have to deliver me that day, which they did come out positive and i am now 38 weeks and he still didnt deliver me. I guess it depends on what your dr wants to do",

And they'll probably have you do a few more before but if your protein keeps going up you'll be induced early but probably not until full term at 37 weeks unless it's super life threatening. I did a ton of these because I only have 1 kidney so I always had protein in my urine but it kept increasing and my blood pressure would rise in minutes so my dr didn't like it.",
