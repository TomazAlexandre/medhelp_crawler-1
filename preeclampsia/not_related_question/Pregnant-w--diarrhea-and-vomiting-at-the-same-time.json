I think i had the pain coz i was constipated . But when i visited the dctor she told me the pain is there since the abdomen starts stretching. So i think u might have some of this problem.

In a little more than 24 hours I lost half the weight that I have gained since being pregnant. Normally that would make me happy, but not now. If you do not have a fever and are not seeing blood in your stool or vomit, then the best thing to do is to just stay hydrated with clear fluids and broth and rest a lot. Do not overdo it on sugary drinks, though, because that could irritate your system. Fruit juice mixed with water is ok. Once you can keep the fluids down, eat a little plain white rice or some white bread. Nothing with much fiber. I managed to keep rice and Eggo waffles down. But definitely keep the fluids coming. The baby should be just fine.",

I am recently pregnant with my 3rd child and have had many complications and have lost a baby that was full term. During my 2nd pregnancy I had the same symptoms and one of the conclusions was that I had really low potassium. This caused me to camp out in the bathroom for days..and finally I went to the ER..first they came back to tell me it was a stomach flu..and I disagreed..I didn't have anyone around me at all with a stomach virus...after all said and done..I was filled with fluids for 24 hrs. My doctor told me the number one sign of low potassuim is that your bowl movements smell deadly..and believe me you'll know..I understand everyone gets diarrhea here and there during pregnancy but it should not last more then 3 days and it should not be liquid. Some other things that I experienced with the same symptoms where preeclampsia which my doctors did not catch and the result was my still born baby..also kindey failure, hyperemesis, and complications with your liver or gallbladder. I think if anyone has persistant symptoms you should seek a 2nd opion.",

            "answer": "Every pregnancy is different. Morning sickness can be horrible in early pregnancy - I went off meat and sweet foods completely and couldn't keep hardly anything down but it settled after a few months. the trick is to find things that you can keep down and stick with them. Try and eat sensibly and avoid grease and acidic foods. Diarrheoa in late pregnancy is also normal - your body will begin to regularly clear out the digestive system as it prepares for labour - some women will find that bouts of loose motions are accompanied by sickness. this can even be caused by that baby beginning to engage. As the baby is fully grown at this late stage of pregnancy their movements apply pressure to organs. If they are beginning to engage sometimes this applies pressure to the bowels causing a flush out. Similarly women may find that the loose motions are accompanied by the loss of the mucus plug - maybe later on in the day or a few days later. If there are other symptoms like loss of the mucus plug then the loose motions are most likely the body preparing for labour. In first time mums the body can begin to prepare as early as 35 weeks - it takes time and doesn't all happen fast like on the TV. As constipation is common in pregnancy a sudden flush out is often the body's way of regaining the balance. If however the diarrheoa is very severe and lasts for several days without stopping it is only sensible to contact your GP or midwife. If it comes and goes and you can still get some food down then take it as a sign of things progressing. Braxton Hicks can also set off loose bowel movements so if you have any tightening of the abdomen try and walk about, empty your bladder and drink water - the Braxton Hicks should subside and this should help the bowel movements. Unfortunately pregnancy does have some nasty aspects but just remember that however grim you feel the baby is hanging on in there - your body will deal with them first so if you are dehydrated and havent eaten for a while the body will take your reserves (fat stores etc) and ensure the baby is nourished - its you that will suffer not them! Good luck to all who are suffering the dodgy stuff and congratulations to all expectant mums!",

Being that you are pregnant you probably over indulge and thats ok. Through the day watch what you eat. This happens to me and unfortunately my kids too. Until we clear it all out of our digestive system, then we feel better. We get bad stomach cramps, and almost like contraction feelings and after that, pain starts, the hard stools pass then flows the diarrhea. It last for an hour almost everytime. Your body is cleaning the food you ate that didn't agree with your tummy. No medicine can calm it( seems like it too me and my kids) your body has to get rid of it.",

    "question": "I am Pregnant with my second child. I never had morning sickness with the first and with this one, still not too morning sickness but for the third time now I have had vomiting and diarrhea at the same time happening. I thought it had to do with what I was eating, because the first 2 times it happened after having fast food (which I rarely do anyways), but this last time it happened shortly after eating eggs, toast and fruit. I told my doctor after the first 2 times and she agreed that maybe it was just too much grease, but now that theory is thrown out the window. It comes on very quickly, with a starting feeling like I just have to go to the bathroom and then followed with severe stomch pain and vomiting & diarrhea. Then sweating and chills, leaving my skin extremely itchy, but everything is usually gone within 1 hour just leaving me feeling weak. Has anymore ever heard of this before? I appreaciate any suggestions or recommendations. Thanks!",
