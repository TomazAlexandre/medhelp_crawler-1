            "answer": "Wait a bit longer if you want to. I was about to have to decide on being induced but I went into labor three night before I was 42 wks. If you need to be induced you can try to be sure he had tried natural options first like sweeping your membranes and/or breaking your water. Have you tried nipple stimulation at all? Or sex? Good luck! I hope you go into labor on your own!",

I'm just trusting my Dr, but my sister suggested the same which made me second guess my Dr. I've actually worked out my entire pregnancy and live a pretty healthy lifestyle, and have tried sex a couple of times. I just think my baby likes my womb. Thank you, and good luck to you too. I really hope he comes on his own as well.",

            "answer": "Cervidil is inserted to thin and dialate your cervix more then pitocin is administered to start contractions. I was induced with my first for going over my due date and will be induced with this one due to preeclampsia. Since I was not thinned or dialated at all with my first the entire process took about 23 hrs from start to finish. I opted for an epidural but it wore off at the last minute so I had to push without it. Overall the process wasn't that painful and I might try without any drugs thus time around. Vaginally delivered a healthy 7lb baby boy, with no complications or c section required. Some women have horror stories from.being induced but mine was not that bad. Every woman is different.",

            "answer": "This is our first and I was induced 3 weeks ago with our son due to medical reasons. I wanted to go into labor on my own so bad and cried when I found out they wanted to induce me. It ended up being the best solution, but at that time I didn't see it that way. They started me on cervidil (which reminds me of a tampon) the night before to help my cervix thin more. I was able to take a sleeping pill and that was great. You do not feel the cervidil and I honestly forgot it was in there. The next morning the nurse took it out and started me on pitocin to get me to dilate. From the beginning of pitocin to the arrival of our 8 pounds and 15 ounces baby boy, it took 13 hours and 24 mins. I pushed for 2.5 hours and my epidural ran out halfway in labor and the nurse never refilled it like she was supposed to. So yes ma'am, I felt it all! What's meant to be will be and hopefully your little one will come on his own. Good luck and best wishes!",

I was induce with my 3rd and was glad I did because at the last min her hart rate drop and I ended up getting a emergency cseaction and after 2 natural births no pain meds ummmm honestly my cseaction was bad at all. I'm really confused on what woman mean when they say the recovery process is longer? I was in the hospital 3 days I think just like with my other 2. I walked around the next day breast feed my baby like I did with the others. Now I'm 4 months and my dr says I will be having another cseaction I'm a lil upset just because I want my man to enjoy and see a natural birth. But he said today as long as the baby healthy and me he's happy with the cseaction. Hope this make you feel comfortable but do what you feel is right!!",

            "answer": "Thank you ladies for your feedback and well wishes. I've never had to be induced and a good amount of people informed me that chances are higher of having a c-section when getting induced. So far only one person,\u00a0\u00a0other than MrsAmos, has told me that c-section recovery isn't that bad. I guess I'm just nervous. This is my third pregnancy and it's been completely different then my other two and I've never made it to 40 weeks, let alone 41. My Dr also informed me that sometimes women end up giving birth with just the cervidil and no pitocin. I'm hoping to be one of those women. Best wishes to you all.",

I have not progressed in the last 3 weeks and have stayed at 1cm 50% thinned. My Dr wants to start me on cervidil and I would like to know if any women have been induced with cervidil and if you could please share your story? I'm really nervous and scared of having to have a c-section.",
