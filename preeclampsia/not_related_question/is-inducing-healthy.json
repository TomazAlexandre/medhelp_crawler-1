            "answer": "If you go over your due date by too far that could be a reasonable cause for induction. After about 40 weeks the placebta doesn't work as efficiently and can start to die off, causing lack of nutrients and oxygen to the baby, ultimately putting baby at risk. Since due dates are estimated most drs let you go about 2 weeks past before inducing for this reason. Other reasons for induction may be fetal distress or preeclampsia. Just remember you have the right as a patient to ask questions and have a thorough understanding of any procedure or intervention offered to you. They cannot force you to do anything you don't want to.",

No problems with labor or baby. My next two were inductions by Dr at my request because I feared a c section due to large babies. They were large and very healthy with uncomplicated labor's. I was very lucky that everything went so well all three times, it went so well the first that I had my younger kids with me in the delivery room with the next two.Drs will try to convince you to agree with their choices that are for their convenience. They will try to act like they have a good reason and you have to know well enough if it is the right decision for you and your baby or you will just be going with the flow instead of giving your baby the best chance and you the labor you really want.
