            "answer": "High risk pregnancies are categorized by a number of things. For example, I have a pre-existing kidney disease, so that made me high risk from the get-go, and then yesterday I found out that I have preeclampsia, so now I'm extremely high risk. You usually have to see your OB more, get more ultrasounds, and be watched more carefully than normal patients.",
