I'm going for a vbac, but I was progressing fine with my first. The c section was due other reasons. Will your doctor let you try a vbac knowing it may result in a c section?",

    "question": "wondering should I fight the idea of csec. again? I had a csec With my twins almost 3 years ago. I want a vbac this time but I am measuring so large it shocks my dr. Each time he sees me,he has been an obgyn for 30 years. He was fine with vbac at first , the more he sees me ,more he is getting worried i will have over 9lb baby and stresses how tiny i am. He is scared the baby will do alot damage to me naturally birthing,there's a risk of uterine rupture. Your thoughts?\u00a0\u00a0vbac anyway so no regret not having the experience or do csec. and lower risk for me?",
