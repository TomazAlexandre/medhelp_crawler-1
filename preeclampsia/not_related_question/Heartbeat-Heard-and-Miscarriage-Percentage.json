We checked the heartbeat with u/s when I was almost 7 weeks and there was a good heart beat. I had an appointment last week which in the past was usually scheduled around 3 months but they told me to go ahead and go in earlier to get all the paper work filled out. This is the appointment they usually like to give you a pap smear well with 2 of my last 3 miscarriages I started to spot pink after the pap so with my fourth pregnacy I told the doctor I'd rather not have one and do it after I deliver and they let me and I had a healthy baby girl so this time around I opted for the same think - I know it probably doesn't mean anything but it was in my head so she didn't do the doppler because I was only 8 weeks so now I will have to wait until July 19 to do the doppler!

Sonia I am so sorry to hear about your lose. Did they tell you at the time of the u/s that the heart beat was low and that it wasn't a good sign? See I had no idea they could tell that from the heart beat until I started reading some of the comments here.... It makes me very nervous not being able to hear the heart beat again until july 19th I'd just like to have some reassureance. The last time we heard it was at 6 1/2 weeks.

The doctor told me that my body didn't produce enough on it's on so it was not nourshing the fetus and that is why I would miscarry....So far it seems to be working.The only thing is that I thought my doctor said that around 11-12 weeks they usually stop giving the hormone injections because the placenta starts to take over nourshing the fetus and it produces the progesterone. You were right at the 11 week mark....maybe there was something wrong with the fetus and not you???? I would ask your doctor to see what he thinks...My miscarriages without the progesterone were all early on like between 6-8 weeks....I don't know if the fetus could make it to 11weeks without the right hormones????But look into it!

When I went to the doctor it was actually my second appointment so I went in and the doctore gave me my due date and then prepped me for an ultrasound so ew could hear a heartbeat. Unfortunatly we never heard the heartbeat, so he did a transadominal ultrasound but he didn't see anything. So he sent me for a vaginal ultrasound and still nothing. The news came back that I had miscarried. I'm now pregnant again. i'm about 4 and a half weeks and everyday anything that i'm feeling I worry that it's bad. everyone says i'm setting myself up for disappointment which I kind of am just because I want to be ready this time if the doctor tells me somethin bad. I haven't had the chance to be excited about this pregnancy yet even though my husband and I have been trying for 2 years to get pregnant. I'm just too worried.. and i'm not feeling ANYTHING at all.

    "question": "I read on one of the forums that once a heart beat is dedected you have only a 5% change of miscarriage is that pretty much a true statistic? I know I have read that some mom's have miscarried up to twelve weeks but sometimes I think the fetus dies early on but it's not detected until later. I think I miscarriaged at 10weeks one time and 12weeks a seperate time but when the doctor did the ultra sound they were only the size of 6 weeks which meant the pregnancy hadn't been viable since 6 weeks. Does that make sense? I'm just so nervous I am started my 9 week this week and we have seen the heart beat and I just want everything to be okay....I just thought the 5% was a good statistic and wanted to know if anyone else heard that..thank you, Niki",
