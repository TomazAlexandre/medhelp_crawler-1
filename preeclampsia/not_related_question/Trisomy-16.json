            "answer": "I had a Trisomy 13 baby in April of 2002 which I delivered at 34 weeks gestation.\u00a0\u00a0We didn't know we were going to have a Trisomy 13 baby until I was actually going in to the delivery room, due to my water breaking early.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up with preeclampsia and we had to deliver for my safety and the baby's.\u00a0\u00a0Our baby girl had a lot of complications and only lived 25 days after she was born.\u00a0\u00a0We had genitic couseling afterwards, and they told us it was a fluke that it happened, and that we would be able to conceive again, that there was nothing wrong with my husband or I genetically. Since then I got pregnant and delivered a perfectly heathly baby in March of 2004.\u00a0\u00a0No complications what so ever, and now my daughter is 2 years old, healthy as can be.\u00a0\u00a0However, I just recently became pregnant again in August 2006 and lost my baby at 12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I had a d&c in October and had the contents of that tested.\u00a0\u00a0It came back with a Trisomy 16 abnormality.\u00a0\u00a0Although it said that Trisomy 16 was one of\u00a0\u00a0the common problem of miscarriages in most women, I can't help but think we are back to square one.\u00a0\u00a0I am beside myself and very upset with the findings because of already having a Trisomy 13 baby.\u00a0\u00a0We can try again, but I am now more afraid than ever of going through this again.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure what the future holds yet, but I do know that we have a perfect little girl and are blessed to just have her in our lives.\u00a0\u00a0So if there is anyone out there going through this or has gone through this, I would like to hear your story.\u00a0\u00a0It helps to know we're not alone.

            "answer": "Dear Rednmoo,Trisomy disorders such as Trisomy 13, 16, 18 and 21 are almost always random occurrences, one of those tricks of nature. This is to say that the chance that you or your husband carry it is very very minimal. I am not very well informed about Trisomy 16, but I recently had an abortion due to Trisomy 18 which was found in my fetus. This was a first baby for us and we went through very tough times, and hey, I am 33. Full trisomy 18 is again a random condition, thus we could have healthy babies. The chance of getting these kind of disorders grows with maternal age, especially after 35, so you have nothing to worry. Apparently Trisomy 16 is the main cause for miscariage in the first trimester. So many women who miscarry may have had it without knowing.You are very, very young and have plenty of time to get 5 kids if you wish. So I wouldn't worry too much. It is unfortunate and emotionally tough time, I know that, but you will get pregnant again.",

            "answer": "My wife had 3 miscarriages. For all 3 there was no heart beat, no fetal pole.Miscarriages were happened within 1 to 2 months. Last time we checked kareotyping for product & it was found that trisomy 16 caused this.\u00a0\u00a0We did kareotyping 2 times for ourseves . In one time tests showed normal count but\u00a0\u00a0telometrric association on multiple cromosomes for my wife. I am very confused as doctors have different views. Someone is saying that it might repeat & so you should try with ivf with donor egg.\u00a0\u00a0Someone is saying you should try normally & it has a chance of normal pregnancy. Can anyone suggest what should I do now. .",
