            "answer": "There is nothing you have done to cause a miscarriage. I want you to understand that and not feel guilty!!! Also, it is not uncommon to miscarry twice in your lifetime (not saying that makes it any easier or better... but at least you can understand you're not a freak).Has your doctor checked your HCG and progesterone levels?! You may have a problem with your progesterone. If that is the case, next time around, they can give you supplements that will protect the pregnancy.I have just read a few articles on antiphospholipid antibodies and they've said that miscarriages are common but there are treatment options. Your doctor should be made aware of this so that next time you'll hopefully have success!\"The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is also associated with miscarriages as well as other complications of pregnancy including preterm labor and preeclampsia. An association with thrombocytopenia (low platelets) has also been established. This occurs in 20-40% of patients with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.\" http://www.med.uiuc.edu/hematology/PtAPS.htmAnd yes, many women have lost babies who've they've seen on ultrasound, alive and well. It's very sad and I'm so sorry for your loss.",

With my first pregnancy, It wasn't good from the beginning.\u00a0\u00a0This time around, my hcg level was doubling (I didn't do the progesterone level test though) and heartrate was 125bpm at 6 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I work at a retail store and my job requires lots of physical activities - on foot almost 9hrs, carrying things, and the store has mutiple floors... Perhaps I made myself too tired...I know I couldn't have done anything to prevent this, but this is just shocking and sad...",

    "question": "I am supposedly 9wks 4days pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I had an ultrasound today and there was no heartbeat AGAIN!! (I miscarried last May)\u00a0\u00a0I had my first ultrasound at 6wks due to spotting and everything looked great then, so I was very optimistic this time. The reason I had one today was that my morning sickness has been a bit better lately.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said that she'd do some investigation this time since this is my second miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I will know better in a couple of weeks but I just wanted to share with anyone who's had similar experience. Is it common to miscarry even though it started normal with good size and heartrate? or Is it me doing something wrong this timeI have read that some women take baby aspirin to prevent miscarriage. Of course I asked my dr. today and she wants to run some test on me before okaying it.\u00a0\u00a0My menstrual flow is thick and filled with clots.\u00a0\u00a0Can it be the symptom of antiphospholipid antibodies?\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone knows about that?\u00a0\u00a0Any advise will help now...\u00a0\u00a0I feel very alone..\u00a0\u00a0I hope everyone's holiday's as happy as it can be ...",
