I had to turn it in today and i asked if i can get seen because i was still leaking and the nurses at my clinic didn't even listen. All they did was take my blood pressure and send me home, I'm still pretty upset. I'm in pain and i want my son to be here already: /",

    "question": "Hi, ftm here. So I've been leaking since Saturday, i thought my water broke but when i went to the hospital they told me that it didn't break and i have no idea what it could be if it wasn't my water breaking? I'm still leaking, not a whole lot but enough for me to put a pad down and when i check the pad it's got light pink blood on it. The nurses at the hospital said that was normal but i didn't expect to still be leaking. I'm 40+1 and i could really use all the help i can get before my next appointment on Wednesday. Please and thank you! (:",
