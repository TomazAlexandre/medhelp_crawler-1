I was full of energy the whole 9 months and worked two jobs until the second trimester and just one until I was 39.5 weeks even though I wasn't allowed to go into labor due to placenta previa. I had a tad bit of swelling in my feet at the end of the last trimester and that was about it. This time, (I'm just at 16 weeks) I am still feeling nauseated, but getting a little better. Nothing really ever sounds good enough to eat, I have the absolute worst dry mouth & throat that makes waking up in the morning miserable and I just want to trow up because of it, my eyesight is actually getting really bad, I can barely sleep at night, and feel tired all of the time... So, this time is completely different than the last time!!",
