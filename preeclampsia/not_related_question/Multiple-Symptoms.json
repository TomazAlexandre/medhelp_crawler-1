With so many normal tests, you should be fine. Your BP and HR issues may truly be idiopathic or without a know cause.I would talk to my doctor about trying other BP meds. There are many options and they just may need to find one that works for you. I wish I had more to offer, perhaps you could post in the Expert Forum where one of the cardiologists can respond to your question.Jon",

            "answer": "I am sorry to hear of your troubles. I am experiencing similar symptoms, have received many of the same tests, all have came back normal as well. Doctors are stumped as to why my BP is high and my heart rate is so rapid even when I'm resting/completely calm. I was given samples of Bystolic today but haven't started them yet. Currently I am taking 5-10 mg of Valium when the symptoms occur at a high intensity- this takes the edge off but heart rate still remains higher than 110. Doctors are convinced more than just stress/anxiety is to blame, but they just don't know what. I am 26 years old and am a healthy weight so it is quite a mystery- I'm ready for some answers and am sure you are too! Don't give up and keep searching. One piece of advice is to try to remain calm when symptoms occur and act as an analytic observer rather than panicking/reacting to the symptoms. Accept the symptoms rather than trying to fight it. It took me a while to master this approach but it has proved helpful. Best of luck, keep us posted!",

            "answer": "Hi, Thanks for your comment. Makes me feel better that I'm not alone but I really do feel for you or for that matter anyone who has to go through this. It's weird how the body works. I still have episodes here and there but as long as I take the Bystolic I'm ok. It does get hard at times when all you do is think about your BP and HR but I try to take my mind off it and go on with what I'm doing. I know there's got to be a reason for it and at times I still think it's hormonal. I just wished I could find a Dr that would think outside the box instead of going by textbook. Until then I guess I will just have to deal with it. Wish you the best and please keep posted. Thanks",

So strange how we can be healthy our whole lives and then one day things are all upside down. Well all I can say is I've tried a few different types of meds...some made me feel strange and some made me feel normal. the hard part is when you build a tolerance to them.Rita",

            "answer": "Didn't you say that you had just had a baby? Did the doctor's mention anything about preeclampsia?I have experienced quite a few different symptoms over the years that I believed had to do with my heart and having high BP. I was diagnosed with high BP when I was 15. However, my doctor's have run all kinds of tests and the results are always normal. They seem to believe that my symptoms are caused by anxiety and depression. Which I do not entirely agree with. I feel that my anxiety is caused by my symptoms. I sometimes think that there is something more serious going on inside my body.I do not smoke. I was exercising 3-4 days a week. I eat VERY healthy 9 times out of 10. I rarely drink alcohol. My family medical history is pretty good. My mother (56) and father (71) are still alive and healthy.I may be salt sensitive or have food allergies. I can feel my BP rise with the intake of foods that contain too much sodium (which I try to stay away from; but occassionally i do give in to indulgence).",

            "answer": "I have very similar symptoms. I have had them for a year and had about every test under the sun. They ruled out a pheo recently, but my symptoms are very similar to what you have with a pheo. I am on Metropol and Cardura. These BP meds do seem to help some, but I now get high and low blood pressure. I avoid doing things so I do not have too high of a spike. Some doctors think it could be related to a form of POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia).If you notice your symptoms and bp change with position (lying, sitting, standing), this could be a possibilty. I also wonder if hormones play a part of it too, although doctors say no.\u00a0\u00a0It scares me because I still get symptoms, just not as bad even when bp is not too high.During these tests, I have found out about vitamin deficiencies (B12 and D), neck problems, and osteoprosis and I am only 45! Do you have any of these issues?",

            "answer": "I was never tested for vitamin deficiency, but I believe that I probably had a vit b12 and D deficiency. As soon as I started taking these vitamins on a daily basis; my anxiety, depression, and other symptoms went away. I wasn't experiencing any neck or chest pain of any kind for the first few months that I started taking the vitamins. Then my chest pain and neck pain came back. I believe that is a nerve related issue and separate from the high bp. I take diovan hct 160/25mg and my bp has been 125-129/80-89 and then will go down to 120/80. Rarely has it been below 120/80, except for when I am sleeping. I awoke in the middle of the night and checked it 100/70.I've also noticed when I stray from my healthy diet of pure organic foods, fruits, veggies and little to no red meat, my BP rises. My BP had been reading 117/70 a few months ago. I am wondering how my BP can be above 120/80 even after I take my medication? I am wondering if I should take an additional BP pill to lower it further. I dont think I would become hypotensive, since my BP seems to rise just by walking around.",

    "question": "Hello, I'm a 37 yr old female. I started out around January 2010 feeling pressure in my head and having a overall feeling of just not feeling like myself. At the time I associated it with stress. I just had a baby and tubal a year earlier, my brother passed away 4 months after I gave birth, I was in the middle of final exams and my mom had been hospitalized with strokes and congestive heart failure. Two weeks after I started feeling bad I decided to go to the doctor. My blood pressure was 200/100 and heart rate was 120. the nurse freaked out and retook it several times and then ran a EKG. The EKG was normal so the doctor had them do blood tests and then put me on a BP med then sent me home. A few weeks later went back to doctor and he said my thyroid and glucose tests were normal and he didn't see any reason for having that high of bp or heart rate but to continue on the meds. Over the next few weeks I would have periodic episodes of high bp and hr so I went to the ER and they did a EKG which was normal, chest x-ray which was normal, blood work and kept me over night then sent me home with a different bp med. I read upon a condition called Pheochromocytoma and when I went back to my doctor for a follow up I had him do a24 hr urine and plasma test. A week later the results came back normal and so he changed my bp med to Bystolic 10 mg. It was like a miracle drug. My episodes became far and few in between but my bp was staying real low so I would have to skip a few days meds and take them every two to three days. This worked for awhile but around the time I changed primary doctors it started back but heart rate was more of an issue than theblood pressure. The new doctor ran several EKG's all normal then decided to send me to a cardioligist. I went to see one of the top cardios around here and they did Blood work including D-dimer, EKG's, Holter monitor, Echo, and Stress test with Nuclear dye. While there I had a episode of high bp and fast hr and thought for sure they would have a answer. Well when I went for follow up they said all my tests were normal. He suggestedit could be hormonal. So I had my primary do a hormone test well what I expected it was normal. So I'm thinking this just doesn't happen for no reason. There's a problem somewhere. I went for a six month check up at cardio and they wanted to do a chest CT to check for calcium build up but thats been 6 months ago so if there was a problem with that I think I would know by now. Now when I get these episodes I get a intense hot flush and then Ifreak out check my bp and of course its highish last episode was 166/96 and heart rate was 140. As soon as I take bp pill it starts to lower instantly (which is odd) and then I get a intense cold flush. All this takes place within 30 minutes then I'm fine. My bp still flucutaes widely. Sometimes low, then normal, then high as well as my heart rate. Also, since I been on Bystolic ( this could or couldn't be related) I've had a sensation of pins and needles all over, pains all over body (different spot on different day) mostly in shoulders, arms, back and sometimes muscle weakness that comes and goes. Sprodiac left arm pain that comes and goes. Once in awhile a chest pain that lasts maybe a minute or two. Muscle spasms. Does anyone have a clue as to what could be going on or what direction I should take?? Something has to give I want my life back. Thanks in advance!",
