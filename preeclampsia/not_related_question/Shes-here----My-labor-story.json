    "question": "I had my routine 40 week appt on Monday at 9am. I knew there was a possibility of discussing induction because of issues I'd been having with possible preeclampsia.When I saw my Dr she sent me straight over to the hospital to be admitted to L&D for induction, and I wasn't at all prepared! I hadn't eaten anything yet or brought anything with me because I figured I'd be coming back home, even just for a little. I called my husband and told him everything to grab (luckily the bags were already packed, just not with me) and he came over.They checked me and because I was only 1 cm and my cervix was still long and thick they started my induction with cervidil. They started the cervidil at 1:30 Monday afternoon and by 3:00 I was having contractions that were 2-3 minutes apart lasting about 90 seconds each. They checked me at 7:30 and I only dilated to 2 and wasn't really that effaced yet, but they told me it could take the full 12 hrs and some women need multiple doses. I still hasn't eaten anything all day (couldn't eat anything but clear fluids once they start induction) and at that point my contractions were intolerable! At 11:30 I finally caved and got the epidural because I could no longer tolerate the pain, I needed some rest, and I was not making any progress.The cervidil finally came out at 1:30 Tuesday morning and I was still contracting every 2-3 minutes but not making any progress. Since my body was contracting on its own though they held off on any other meds for a while.The epidural was wonderful....while it worked. I am apparently one in very few women who it doesn't really work for. I would have about 2 hrs of relief at a time and then for whatever reason it would atop having any effect.My contractions and everything continued through Tuesday morning and afternoon. By 4pm on Tuesday afternoon I was finally dilated to 4 cm and 100% effaced. At that point I had my epidural placed again because the line had actually snapped on my other one.I got relief for about an hr. They came back up at about 5 pm to increase the dose for me since I still thought I had a while to go. By 6 pm I was dilated to 6cm and finally felt like things were moving along. At 6:45 pm I was in such unbearable pain and getting no relief from the epidural. The anesthesiologist had an emergency to take care of but said he'd be right back up to place it again. By the time he came back up at about 7pm the drs sent him away because I was already at 10 cm! Baby was still high, at stage 0. My nurses were just changing shifts and my new nurse didn't understand why my previous nurse had me start pushing when I felt contractions. I told her that pushing actually gave me such relief from the contractions. I was using the squat bar at the end of the bed so as I got a contractions I'd sit up and push and then I'd rest in between. After about 5 rounds of pushing (with breaks in between) my nurse said she'd check to see if baby had come down anymore... She turned to my husband and said \"ooooh you want to see the baby's head?!?\" LolShe told me to stop pushing until everyone else got in the room. About 2 minutes later everyone was back in and at 8:07 pm my little Zaira Victoria was born! 8lbs 5oz and 19.5 inches long. I had to be cut because she was kind of twisted the wrong way and didn't want to fit but I needed only a couple stitches. She is the most gorgeous little girl I've ever seen and looks just like my husband, complete with a full head of dark wavy hair. :)",
