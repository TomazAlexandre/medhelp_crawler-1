This didn't bother me at the beginning but now that I know my baby can hear...Well I think it's gotta be really loud and scary for the baby. I know people get them all the time. I'm just feeling bad, oh God, mom guilt already?! :)",

            "answer": "My Papp-a also came back low so i did an amnio and all was fine as well. I think it is extremely important to monitor my baby though b/c low Papp-a may also be a sign of other issues, such as preeclampsia or premature labor later on. I'm definitely not taking any risks and I'm seeing a fetal specialist in addition to my dr to make sure it's all ok. U/s have been performed for decades and are perfectly safe for the baby.\u00a0\u00a0I've had numerous u/s already and I love watching my baby grow! :)",

    "question": "Hi! I'm 35 years old and will be 36 by the time my baby is born. I am 20 weeks pregnant. I generally feel great. Early in my pregnancy I had some blood work done, which had screening for d/s etc.. My blood work came back with low PAP-A. (I can't remember the number.) Anyway I ended up having CVS and the baby is fine. PHEW! I eat well and am active and in good health. I haven't had an u/s since the CVS. I have a referral for one but and having conflicting feelings about going for it.\u00a0\u00a0First of all even if they determine the baby is small, what options will I have to 'fix' that? (In total I've already had 4 u/s.) My other concern is how the u/s themselves affect the baby or too many u/s.Thanks so much in advance for any advice. xx",
