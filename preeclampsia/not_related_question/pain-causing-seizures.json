To appease them I suggested that pain can be exhausting on the body and exhaustion causes seizures.\u00a0\u00a0They are more agreeable to that.\u00a0\u00a0I have a very minor heart condition and and sciolosis.After car accidents and returning to work...that is grossly hard on my back, my siezures return.\u00a0\u00a0I fell at work a few months ago and my seizures returned and became uncontrolled.\u00a0\u00a0If I control my back pain I seem to control my siesures.I am wondering if you have made any head way with your doctors in having them open their eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure there are more of us out there.I wnat more than anything to get my life back, maybe we can show the medical community we are the precedent setting cases.\u00a0\u00a0After all we are the experts on our own bodies, they have just never came across cases like us or have never given others a serious listen.I am going to a world reknowned pain doctor and epilepsy clinic in the winter, they are going to work together to figure this out.\u00a0\u00a0Please contact me if you suffer pain and seizures.\u00a0\u00a0Strength in numbers...maybe they will listen.",

            "answer": "Reading these posts makes me feel good and bad, my husband is 27 in good health and very active he started having seizures after hurting himself within the past few years but it has started to happen more and more. He had surgery a little over a year ago because he had sleep apnea, they drilled out his sinuses and removed his tonsils, adenoids, uvula and scrapped down his tongue. He is now able to sleep without snoring and he can breathe through his nose. Since the surgery his seizures have been more often and worse each time. He just had one today because he hit his arm, it was painful but not that bad. I said that it seems to me an adrenaline rush from the pain causes the seizure its his bodies way of dealing with the pain. I really think that all the Dr.s who say this is normal or say there is nothing wrong are crazy. It is not safe or healthy to have seizures for any reason. I was wanting to know if anyone else has more than one seizure caused by pain? I ask because my husband always has one small one then he will come to then within a minute or so he will have one that is worse and lasts at least a minute or more and he always wets himself, which is the worst for him. I hope and pray someone finds an answer to this. It took me 6 years and 10 Dr.s to find out that I had Sinus Tachycardia and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome Type 3 or Hyermobility type, I don't produce Collagen or Protein so my joints are deteriorating and there is no cure or real treatment. I have been dealing with it for my whole life without knowing until I was 22 I am now 30 and still hold out hope for a cure. I hope that I can find an answer for my husbands seizures soon it is a scary thing. Good luck to all of you and never give up hope!",

            "answer": "The following posts are very interesting. I am a neurologist and currently subspecialty training in pain management.\u00a0\u00a0After reading the above posts I would like to clarify a few points. Technically, pain is not a \"cause\" of seizures. Seizures are caused by both structural abnormalities in the brain, which can usually be seen on neuroimaging, or physiologic abnormalities which can not. Some people will have a lower threshold for having a seizure. For example, lack of sleep will lower your seizure threshold. This is why they do sleep deprived EEGs. It is very reasonable to presume that pain can be a \"trigger\" for a seizure in a person who has a lower seizure threshold. In fact pain can induce a vasovagal response that can also cause a loss of consciousness and subsequent seizure. So pain, albeit uncommon, can be a trigger for a seizure.\u00a0\u00a0Did you hear about all the people who had seizures when the Pokemon cartoon first came out? The flashing lights \"triggered\" a seizure in some people who were predisposed to them. In the end, antiepileptic medication treats both neuropathic pain and seziures.",

(2005)\u00a0\u00a0i am now 23 and currently working on a master\u2019s degree in mental health counseling with a goal of earning a phd in counseling psychology.\u00a0\u00a0however since my car accident, the seizures have worsened.\u00a0\u00a0before the surgery, the seizures averaged out to around one every 3.5 weeks. in 2009, the doctors performed an operation called a temporal lobectomy where a golf ball sized portion of my skull was removed to allow the surgeon access the scar tissue\u2026the scared tissue was then removed\u2026.my skull was stapled back into place via titanium staples. this is now, the second winter i have experienced since the surgery, although the pain of \u201910 \u2013 \u201811 has been much worse than the \u201909 \u2013 \u201910.\u00a0\u00a0 the cold temperatures in the single digits have taken a toll and come with severe headaches.\u00a0\u00a0the headaches are so strong, i can check my pulse by simply counting the pain sensations for ten seconds and multiplying by 6.\u00a0\u00a0with every heartbeat comes a throbbing pain. since the first of december, i have experienced three (the last two being less than 3 weeks apart).\u00a0\u00a0every day i had a seizure, i had been outside for some part of the day long enough to allow the cold to screw with the staples and develop severe headaches.\u00a0\u00a0i do not believe that is a coincidence and pain can and are causing my seizures to worsen\u2026..although some say i am only looking for a good reason to move to florida.\u00a0\u00a0hahaha\u00a0\u00a0seriously though, if you do not live in a cold climate to be bothered by the metal, you may want to look into the surgery and to see if it may be an option.\u00a0\u00a0dr. william bingaman was my surgeon at the cleveland clinic. the clinic has a very helpful staff and i recommend the click to anyone.\u00a0\u00a0i hope this was helpful to anyone curious about the subject.....\u00a0\u00a0: )",

These \"episodes\" which I firmly believe are seizures seem to come in clusters and all happen when pain is introduced. He does not have them everytime he is hurt which makes it hard to know when to expect it. He has had approx. 10 total. Each one seems to be different in nature....today while at the hospital getting his cast off (I need to say when he broke his arm at school he had no issues) he was complaining it hurt when he tried to move his wrist because it was stiff. Well, the dr. felt his arm and he stated he was dizzy. I told him to breath and then he went into a full tremor and his eyes were really funny and in two different directions but he has never wet himself. The Dr. stated it was a seizure and needed to see a neurologist. I explained our whole story and how we have and even been in hospital and the MRI and EEG are always fine so the local dr. is sending us to a pediatric neuro for a second opinion. He ask to have that Dr. call him so he could explain to him what he witnessed. I am a nervous wreck always worried he will do this when I am not there and get hurt. PLEASE if anyone gets any answers update so we can get some relief from this unknown condition!!",

It is reassuring to see that there are more people out there with this same problem. Hopefully, someday soon, we can get some answers. My son is 5, and has had two siezures in three weeks. We have never noticed him having a siezure before, but he just gets stiff and collapses with his eyes rolled back and is non-responsive for about thirty seconds. The last siezure he had was at the hospital to get his MRI. They had just put in his i.v., we were walking back to the room and he started having a siezure, but the time before that he was watching cartoons. There have been several times that he has had a blood draw or slammed his finger in the door, etc... where he got all pale and collapsed, but we didn't realize that this could have been him having a siezure.

(24years old at the moment) during my testing they have tried to trigger epileptic seizures with no luck but have narrowed it down by a cardiologist to be my heart. as the pain causes shock in my body that then the drop in my blood pressure stops/slows my heart which no longer sends blood to my brain creating the Grand mal seizure trying to bring oxygen up to my brain\u2026 the best test I have had to prove this is a tilt table test, it might help you, as they stick you with a needle first which then triggered my seizure as the table was being raised to a 90 degree angle\u2026 once doctors had my heart flat lining and coming back on screen (and not just stories myself or others had told them)\u2026 they could finally do something about it! I\u2019ve been on medication and seizure free for 2 years\u2026. A pace maker later in life maybe an option but because of my age they are not wanting to do anything to drastic just yet!

            "answer": "I don't have an answer as to why your son only had them while getting a hair cut.But I have had a seizure when i was about 8 or 9 years old while my aunt was combing my hair after a bath. I remember it feeling as though the comb dug in a little to hard, there was no\u00a0\u00a0mark, no nothing.According to my mother I've had these episodes since i was very young, I was put onto tegretal but taken off it after only a short time. I was referred to a pediatric neuroligist at the time and all he said was that I wasn't epileptic. End of story for the doctors. I don't remember much of the ones from that age, the first ones I do remember I must have been about 6 or 7, they would be caused by something as simple as hitting my elbow, my tail bone, scraping my back, etc. I would get tingly, tunnel vision, then wake up feeling like I had a deep sleep with a really in depth dream and sometimes I would lose control of my bladder. When I wake up I would feel disoriented not quite sure where I was, then it would click that I had had an episode. I would only have a couple a year some I would be able to \"make go away\". I would just focus on one spot on the wall, floor whatever I could see and the tunnel vision would subside and I would be fine. Then suddenly nothing for quite a few years, thought that I had grown out of it. Then when I was 15 turning 16 I had one at a restaurant, my boyfriend and I were playing a video game waiting for our food and I was really hungry. No pain triggered this one, same as before I got tingly & tunnel vision woke up on the floor. Since I was becoming of age to get my drivers license I had to wait until after the 2nd neurologist visit. They did 1 EEG and after they told me I was just a \"delicate\" flower\" and not to worry about it all neurology signs were normal. Then I didn't have one until I was 19 (2 months before my 20th b-day) I stabbed my hand with a knife while working at a bakery, same signs as before but this time i was able to make it go away. A few months later I smashed my hand between a bread rack and the bread slicer, sat down on the floor because I knew I wouldn't be able to fight this one, woke up staring at the ceiling a few minutes later. A few more months later I was working at a vet clinic and I was assisting the vet holding a patient, I got really hot and blacked out then as I was falling I hit my head on a cement wall and had an episode, woke up on the floor had urinated myself. Once again the doctor has sent me to a neurologist, I've had a CT scan - normal, regular EEG - normal, sleep deprived EEG - normal, EKG - normal. Now I'm now 21, went 8 months without an episode then just last night I had abdominal pain that woke me out of a deep sleep, thought I had to go to the bathroom, got really hot blacked out and woke up stuck between the toilet & the wall. I have no idea how long I was out for this time since I was alone. I think it was around 2am.Now the doctor told me that he thinks its vasovagal syncope (Vasovagal syncope (vay-zo-VAY-gul SING-cuh-pee) is the most common cause of fainting. Vasovagal syncope occurs when your body overreacts to triggers, such as the sight of blood or extreme emotional distress. The trigger results in vasovagal syncope \u2014 a brief loss of consciousness caused by a sudden drop in your heart rate and blood pressure, which reduces blood flow to your brain. Vasovagal syncope is usually harmless and requires no treatment. However, you can injure yourself during a vasovagal syncope episode - Mayo Clinic website) This last episode I wound up with a cut on my upper back and a very sore neck, I am re-starting my physio treatment since my last episode 8 months ago for whip lash from hitting the cement wall.Hope you have better luck than the rest of us.I hope this provides some answers, although I hope that this is not where the doctor draws the line on the investigation. I go back to my neurologist in october to see if she has any other ideas.",

            "answer": "My wife has had a Migraine since Easter Sunday and was admitted to the hospital after the ER depts had no luck relieving her pain....she has suffered with migraines since she was 16 and she is 45 now. While in the hospital she began having seizures as many as 7-8 per day in some cases. They last between 5 & 6 minutes...they all start and end the same way. The first sign that one is coming is her left hand starts to shake...as soon as that happens she is non-responsive, her right side (leg and arm) become rigid, her left side (leg and arm) become very active kicking and grabbing, her eyes dart around but are non responsive to snapping my fingers in front of them, she also drools and blows spit bubbles. I can tell when the seizure is going to end because her right hand and arm start to move and she always reaches for her head ...because now her head is throbbing. As I am holding her down she will try to bite me as if she is protecting herself.....if she is alone when the seizure happens she ends up wandering as if sleep walking (this happened in the hospital) and the nurses thought she was trying to be difficult. She has anxiety and depression issues and well as migraines and they are trying to tell us there is nothing medically wrong.....it has to do with her being stressed, depressed...etc...She has had sleep walking episodes in the past, but they did not present the same as these seizures. There have been times when I thought she was alseep watching TV and I have seen her left hand shaking..I always assumed she was dreaming and never worried about it. Most times she would wake up in a panic, but now I wonder if it was just a less violent seizure....they did EEG's and MRI's wit contrast and said it was all negative with the exception of an area of the brain on the MRI that has to do with memory..there is a follow up MRI in June.....They also did a Lumbar Puncture to check for a virus or infection....they tried 5 times over 2 days before they got it right....the Dr. who finally got it said they first Dr.'s were too low on her back (in the wrong spot)....now since then she has had no control or strength in her right leg. They sent her home with a walker and are going to do a Visiting Nurse /Physical therapy......what the hell !!!!Does this sound familiar to anyone.....and btw they say the leg problem is also in her head.",

Cataplexy looks exactly like epilepsy, even a grand mal seizure but is brought on by emotions, fatigue, heightened emotions. It is common for cataplexy to be paired with Narcolepsy, but not always. I feel I have a minor case of Cataplexy and was told by my sleep doc after a sleep study that my test looked as if I am actually a narcoleptic but because of the meds I am on and must be on, he can't formally diagnose it. The good thing about cataplexy is that it can be treated, but very differently than epilepsy and one is not the other. Good luck to you all!",

They had seemed to have stopped after the 5th grade but after about 4-5 years I started having them again. The doctors have done tests and redone some of them and found nothing wrong that they can tell. So far the triggers\u00a0have been sever pain, stress, or\u00a0\u00a0illness like the flu. The last couple of times I've had a seizure I have actually stopped breathing. I do not think the doctors even believed I had them until I got sick and had one in the doctors office while the were checking my blood pressure. I can usually tell a couple of second (long enough to notify someone nearby) before I have one. Before I have one I usually get a funny feeling similar to the kind of feeling you get by standing up to fast. Then I black out and according to my parents and sister who have been present during most of these 'episodes' I start twitching and lose bladder control, and stop breathing. When I come to Its as if I am waking up from a dream I slowly become aware of the world getting hearing back first then vision and controlled movement of my arms, legs, and head. Afterwards I am exhausted for hours and sometimes its even days before I feel like myself again. I would like to know if anyone with a similar condition has found a way to completely prevent them so that I can have a normal life. I would also like to know if it would be safe to have children or if it would be to great of a risk for both myself and the child. Also to those who say it is impossible for pain to be the trigger that is because you have not experienced it. People also used to say it was impossible to land on the moon yet we have. Think about all the deseases that have gone undiagnosed for years until resent advances in medicine.",

Never thought about it again. Then Years later im 16 I started smoking cigs and one day my boyfriend barley hit me in my side, just enough to hurt a little and knock the air out of me. I went down to my knees and dreamed I got up but I really woke up in his arms and he said I looked like I just had a seizure. I fell out of a lifted truck one night lol and twisted my ankle a little and I got really hot and dizzy and I could tell I was about to go into a seizure so I told my sister see you in a minute lol, i shook just a little they said and Woke up and was a little tired but I was fine. I walked around in the tx heat trying to find this place and it was like 5 in the afternoon and i hadnt eaten a single thing all day but i was smoking a cig while in the heat, got to where i was suppose to be and then had this pain in my stomache and then all the sudden i got dizzy and hot like always grabbed my sister and crouched down and had one for no damn reason. Had a few more incidents but only one with pain not being involved. I thought the cigarettes triggered this weird pain seizure thing when i was 16 so after 3 years I'm now 19 and I quit smoking finally, I recently cut my foot and started to get really hot and dizzy and felt like I was going to go into one but my adrenaline just rushed and made me feel kinda sick and eventually I cooled down and could aid my foot which wasn't that bad. I have not had one lately but I also have not been hurt badly. I've never urinated on myself or had violent or long seizures, but pain definitely is the cause no doubt! Maybe my head injury when I was younger and the cigarettes triggered it or maybe I was bound to get them when I got older because of the head injury, idk. But yall are not alone and im glad to know im not either, But I'd like help so these can end, it is embarrassing and scary to be alone.",

            "answer": "Maybe this reasoning would help.\u00a0\u00a0I know that pain medications - narcotics - mimic the same endorphins released naturally in fight or flight cycles AND narcotics LOWER the seziure threshold -- meaning it is more likely that one would experiance a seziure while taking pain medications, possibly the same is true when a situation is first presented in childhood where the child feels like they have no control and no information to resolve an incoming threat -- especially a painful one.When we perceive a significant threat to us, then our bodies get ready either for a fight to the death or a desperate flight from certain defeat by a clearly superior adversary.Endorphins, which are the body's natural pain killers, are released (when you are fighting, you do not want be bothered with pain\u2013-that can be put off until later.)Physical changesFight or flight effects include:\u2022Our senses sharpening. Pupils dilate (open out) so we can see more clearly, even in darkness. Our hairs stand on end, making us more sensitive to our environment (and also making us appear larger, hopefully intimidating our opponent).\u2022The cardio-vascular system leaping into action, with the heart pump rate going from one up to five gallons per minutes and our arteries constricting to maximize pressure around the system whilst the veins open out to ease return of blood to the heart.\u2022The respiratory system joining in as the lungs, throat and nostrils open up and breathing speeding up to get more air in the system so the increased blood flow can be re-oxygenated. The blood carries oxygen to the muscles, allowing them to work harder. Deeper breathing also helps us to scream more loudly!\u2022Fat from fatty cells and glucose from the liver being metabolized to create instant energy.\u2022Blood vessels to the kidney and digestive system being constricted, effectively shutting down systems that are not essential. A part of this effect is reduction of saliva in the mouth. The bowels and bladder may also open out to reduce the need for other internal actions (this might also dissuade our attackers!).\u2022Blood vessels to the skin being constricted reducing any potential blood loss. Sweat glands also open, providing an external cooling liquid to our over-worked system. (this makes the skin look pale and clammy).\u2022Endorphins, which are the body's natural pain killers, are released (when you are fighting, you do not want be bothered with pain\u2013-that can be put off until later.)\u2022The natural judgment system is also turned down and more primitive responses take over\u2013this is a time for action rather than deep thought.Might be a starting point to research anyway, hope it helps : )",

I have bad memory as well no matter what I do. Including before childhood memories have started inching ever slowly back.) recently I've had three seizures and have had back pain all my life that when I was 15/16 only got worse when I got into it with someone about three of me together. And at 19 I got busted up in the head pretty good.and had one around then.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway after my seizures I feel numbness and tingling and I shake everywhere slightly, sometimes it's jerks, long before I even go into a seizure it's like my body knows it's happening and doesn't want to do anything to make it worse so it stays seated for as long as possible and then I get up and move to be comfortable when I know I need to get comfy. I lose consciousness, get worse pain in all my joints, sustain a slowly worsening irrational heart beat from beginning to long after its stopped, I can't remember anything I blank out and stare at nothing when my body starts getting ready I guess? And some other things a bit worse; my dad has seizures for a couple years now and idk if that's in the family. Mental illness is and addiction and other things.

Only half-3/4 of the 1 month supply is gone.
