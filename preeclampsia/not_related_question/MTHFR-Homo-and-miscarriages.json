            "answer": "The literature on homozygous MTHFR A1298C mutation is not clear. Some studies show a link between that mutations and recurrent miscarriage, others do not.\u00a0\u00a0There seems to be a link to higher incidence of neural tube defects (like Spina Bifida).We do not know for sure that this is the cause of your miscarriages since there are so many other defects too that you mention but the risk of taking heparin, baby aspirin, vit B, prednisone must be weighed against the benefits. I would think that most people are willing t0 take the small risks because they are concerned that indeed the MTHFR mutation or some other defect may be causing or contributing to the miscarriages.This is a discussion which you must have with your doctor.Here is a good article on line from Circulation which is a reputable journal:http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/111/19/e289?etoc\"Studies have been conducted to investigate whether having 2 MTHFR mutations increases the risk of blood clots in the arteries, blood clots in the veins, or CAD.9,10 Overall, evidence from these studies indicates that, so long as the homocysteine level is normal, MTHFR mutations do not significantly increase the risk of heart attack or stroke. Studies investigating the association of MTHFR mutations and venous blood clots have been inconsistent, with some studies showing a slight association, but most studies have not shown any association. Although a few studies have suggested that MTHFR mutations may interact with other inherited risk factors for clotting disorders (such as a gene mutation called factor V Leiden; see also Cardiology Patient Page11), most studies show that the MTHFR mutations do not further increase the clotting risk associated with factor V Leiden.MTHFR mutations have been linked in some studies to an increased chance of having a baby with a neural tube defect (spina bifida).8 One study suggested that mothers with 2 MTHFR mutations were twice as likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect, whereas other studies have not supported this finding. Recent research has implied that risks vary, based on the nutritional status of the mother (ie, folate levels, vitamin intake) and whether or not she has an elevated homocysteine level.12 Because of this controversy, some practitioners may recommend extra folate supplementation (usually 4 mg) for women with 2 MTHFR mutations, whereas other practitioners will recommend normal use of prenatal vitamins containing folic acid for a woman who does not have an elevated homocysteine level.There is also conflicting evidence about the relation between homozygous MTHFR mutations and pregnancy complications (including preeclampsia, placental abruption, recurrent pregnancy loss, and intrauterine growth restriction, as described earlier). A recent meta-analysis, which combined all of the data from these studies, found that there was not an association between MTHFR and recurrent pregnancy loss.13 It seems that homozygous MTHFR may moderately increase the risk of preeclampsia and placental abruption, but more research in this area is necessary. Although it is not standard medical practice to test for MTHFR mutations when a woman has a history of these complications, some practitioners may order this testing.\"",

    "question": "I am homozygous MTHFR A1298C, and have had 4 miscarriages: the first at 5 W; the second was a twin pregnancy (miscarriages at 9 W and 12 W); the last at 7 W. Now I take baby aspirin, folic acid and vitamin B, but when I will be prengant I must take eparin. I have many others mutations: Pai I 5g/5g; HPA 1 1a/1a; ACE del/del;F XIII homo V34L; Beta Fibr. Hetero 455G>A. Fibrinogen (now): 11,8. I 'm a little positive to ASMA (1:40), and I have, sometimes, erythema, so i take also prednisone. I'm sure that I find causes of my miscarriages, but I'm searching for studies or news/statistics about my situation, specially about mthfr homo A1298C, because there are many confusion ...So I ask: Is my condition actually miscarriage's cause? There are riscks for my health when I will be pregnant again?Thank you",
