After we had her, I had the mirena put in in Dec. 04. Had it taken out oct 07, so it was in for about 3 years. No period whatsoever the entire time (thank god). After I had it removed, I had a period the following month, and have had a regular one since. My husband and I have done nothing to prevent pregnancy, both secretly wanting another, but have had no luck. Period still comes like normal. I am now starting to worry that I won't be able to have another? And with my track record, maybe even if I do become pregnant, will I miscarry? I desperately want my daughter to have a sibling close in age, and had I known this would happen, I never would've gotten it in the first place. Any advice, words of wisdom, would be highly appreciated. Thank you",

I know your period is the lining in your uterus which the mirena keeps it thin so obviously keeps mine to nothing since i dont bleed.

            "answer": "I recently had my IUD removed, and started to get discouraged after several negative tests. I did a little bit of research, since my doctor never told me what to expect afterwards. It is normal to bleed heavy clumps after it is removed. The IUD works a couple different ways. It does reduce your uterine lining, blocking fertilized eggs from implanting on the uterus, or by creating a mild inflammation which prevents sperm from fertilizing eggs. Some women can get pregnant right after having it removed, but there is a good chance that it wont implant properly, and you will miscarriage. You have a much better chance if you wait a cycle or two, and by your third cycle, your lining should be back to normal. (Not that it hurts to try from day 1!)I read somewhere that several women got pregnant right away, but it wouldn't show up on the pregnancy tests until they were about 3 months pregnant. I asked my doctor about that and she said the IUD didn't have anything to do with the false negatives. Sometimes I feel like maybe they don't really know that much about the IUD, and how it affects a person once it is removed. It does appear to be common to have pregnancy symptoms once it is removed, but I feel (in my case) that it may be due to my lining still too thin, and the pregnancy doesn't last long. Hopefully in another month or so, I'll get my positive sign. =)To all of you out there in \"pregnancy limbo\", it will happen when it happens, and it's best not to stress about it. Just pay attention to your body signs, and keep trying!",

Even though they say that you can become pregnant fast right after removal thats for women who has had it in less then a year. Here what i found out the longer you had the IUD in the longer it can take to become pregnant it can take anywhere from 18-39months to conceive. 90% of women conceived by the 39month just so you know this can be a long waiting game. Because I just found this website and may not beable to find it again you can e-mail at ***@**** with any questions please put IUD in the your subject line .",

DH hates condoms, we have no ins at this point and hormonal BC and i dont get along... the iud was really perfect. but my OB wont give me another one. she said that once one falls out you stand a much higher risk of another one falling out and thats risking too much damage...",

She hates Mirena! When she got it removed she bled so much she had to be taken to the ER. They gave her pills to stop the bleeding & said if the bleeding didn't stop within 36 hours to come in & perhaps get a blood transfusion. Her periods are so messed up right now- she's had to resort to an ovulation kit.I can't believe this thread/post/blog has been going for almost 2 years! Good luck ttc peeps",

I called my dr and talked to her about getting it removed and she told me i needed to take some hormone pills to thin the lining and the bleeding should stop, so i tried it for 30 days and it worked. I had occasional spotting and never knew when it was going to happen. My periods pretty much stopped all together. I did get the acne after it was inserted also but its managed. As for weight gain, I was able to lose the weight from the pregnancy. I currently have a little girl that will be 4 in november and a little boy that will be 2 in november and I want 1 more baby and finally got my hubby to want one more.",

Since then I decided I want another child, hopefully another boy because I have 3 girls and 2 boys and haven't had any luck. I somewhat feel like the mirena plays a big part in this because conceiving has never been a issue for me. Hearing some people have actually conceived since the mirena I think it's the insertion of it, because some people I noticed said it didn't hurt much. Mine hurt not much but it hurt for about 3-4 days and I bleed. After having it removed my period is actually more regular than it was before I got it. Before it came on anytime and stayed on for 10-13 days. Now 5-6 days,but I haven't seem to be able to get pregnant. I'm puzzled.",

OPK was positive 18th and 19th of this month, did have unprotected intercourse with DH on the 17th and on the 19th, so now the waiting game. Each person is different, some people do have decreased fertility after the Mirena, and I have always been a\"fertile Myrtle\" my other 3 children were concieved without trying. Hopefully....BTW, Kudos on keeping this thread going for so long- years even!just shows we women have longer attention spans LOL!!",

I did not have much bleeding at all more like very lightspots for maybe 3 days.The first week was painfull cramping and extreme headaches.(much the same as when mirena was still in) Extreme mood swings. Extreme backache.Kept waiting for AF to start as many others have but still show.Week 2 :I was so bloated that honestly you would think i was 4 months preg. I really lived in track pants as that was all that would fit.The pressure in my lower stomach from this was terrible.Still very moody(like when i first quit smoking) very agitated.still no bleeding.Took a HPT but showed a neg. bummer. I was waiting for the CRASH that you hear about and for me it was about day 10 and 11. wow was this horrible. lasted probably 2 days(most of the above mentioned but x10) and then my head was clear like it hasn't been in years.I had mirena in for 2 1/2 years and NEVER had bleeding or spotting from day 1.Week 3 :Visited my doc today, had pap smear,When i had my last visit he said i had signs of \"fibroids\" (which is also a direct link from mirena's hormones)Fingers crossed they are small with no harm to conceiving.He thinks AF should arrive in the next 2 weeks. So i am playing the waiting game.On a brighter note this week I feel more like my old bubbly self.which is a huge positive.I will update regulary as I am trying to get pregnant like most of us.A big thank you to all ladies who have posted previously I have read all the stories about 5 times. It gives me comfort to know I am not alone.Good luck ladies and baby dust to all.",

I had been on the Mirena from Jan. 02- Dec. 07. I had minimal cramping after insertion but no major issues. Throughout the entire time of being on Mirena I had very light spotting about every 3 months. I did have headaches, fatigue, acne and some moodiness but will not say that they were caused by Mirena. I was very satisfied with this form of BC. I had it reinserted in Feb. 08 after deciding that I wasn't quite ready for another child\u00a0\u00a0and I had enjoyed not having to experience my monthly visits from AF. My children are currently 10 and 7. Once again I didn't experience any problems and had pretty much the same response as previously. I removed it on Nov. 18 in hopes of ttc soon. I had very light brown spotting on the day of removal but nothing since. The week prior to removal I believe that I may have begun ovulating due to slight cramping but it is hard to tell with not getting a regular period throughout the use of Mirena. We have not used any protection thus far and are hopeful. I have to admit thought that I am a little nervous now about having trouble with conceiving and miscarriage. I will keep you posted of our journey.",

I couldnt take all of the sypmtoms (sore boobs, moodiness, headaches, ACNE, the list goes on and on) as it was and then when the bleeding after sex happened I was just like \"get this thing out\". The nurse at my OB said to go to an urgent care because the IUD could have punctured my uterus... no puncture, just annoying messy bleeding they all said would stop, but didn't.Has anyone experianced heavy period like bleeding immediately after sex with the mirena iud in?So here I am 2 days after removal and feel a little better already. I started bleeding a deep red/ brownish color discharge this am and have had a very bloated stomach, no gas, just bloated =].\u00a0\u00a0My fiance is away for work so no worries on getting pregnant now, but we would like to ttc when he gets home in 2 weeks. I dont want to go all crazy with ovulation kits or anything... if it happens it happens, I'll just take care of myself and avoid anything that wouldn't be \"pregnacy kosher\",lol.

No one told me that I had to wait to get pregnant. I had a 7 year old when I had my second baby and had basically no problems with my IUD when I had it. This was a fcouple of decades ago! So I am rooting for you all. I reeeeally do think that getting an IUD out makes you more fertile than if you had never had one. I don't know how scientific that is or how it would hold up in the medical community but it is my belief and I am sticking to it! :) I am blowing more pregnancy dust out there to you all. I think that all of you here are really one step ahead of your normal gal trying to get pregnant out there because I think that there really is something to the post IUD pregnancy, fertile theory!",

I have read most of them but still have a question that I don't think has been answered.I had my Mirena in March 05 just 6 weeks after our 4th baby died of Sids. At the time we were unable to make any permanent decision and were advised this was our best option. Up until this time I had not had any other forms of contraception so unable to compare coming off them. Prior to this I also did not have any regular AF's so unsure of cycle, and have had no spotting or bleeding since the day it went in.Today I finally made the decision to have the mirena removed and wait and see what happens, deep down I REALLY want a baby but keep saying that what will be will be.Anyway back to my question/query I am currently 35years old, with no idea as to my cycle and trying to act all blase but am wondering if there is something/anything I can do that might help to see if this will happen sooner or never. I don't want to hang around for the next 12 months to two years wondering and waiting only to admit that I am too old.Is it worth asking for fertility treatments? Can this help? At my age is there any hope?",

I would have maybe 2 days of very light brown spotting every few months at most. Never had any difficulty with it. I did begin to have the brown tinged jelly like discharge in 9/08, the docs said it was just d/c that accumulated around the strings and eventually it gets heavy enough to fall off. No biggie. I had it removed 2/9/09. Next two days had moderate spotting, but not enough to be considered a full on period. Nothing since...am waiting 4 months to ttc. will post again when there is a change. :)",

NOW I'M PREGNANT!As the vendor and doctors say, you can get pregnant immediately, so be careful because you should take the precaution of waiting a month or two rather than taking on the risk of miscarriage.Don't be niave either, you potentially could take several cycles to conceive.\u00a0\u00a0There is such a thing as trying, that's why it's called trying... no one can guarantee success on the first, second, third, forth or even tenth try.\u00a0\u00a0Everybody is different and if you're not in a condition to conceive, you won't.\u00a0\u00a0Take immaculate care of yourself pre- and post-mirena removal with exercise and a healthy diet.\u00a0\u00a0And by all means if you're overweight, lose some weight.\u00a0\u00a0Fat cells (generally storage fat cells- adipose and visceral fat) release estrogen which in excess can prevent you from conceiving for several reasons.\u00a0\u00a0Take care of youself and listen to your doctor... in time it will happen.",

When my second son was just 3 months old my husband left for iraq so i went off birth control. He was scheldualed to come back for two weeks on leave. so idecided to have the mirena fitted. We recently decided we were ready for a third.I personally would not have it placed again. I broke out all the time, and had severe headaches. Mirena was tolerable.\u00a0\u00a0 just had it removed March 24, had what I think was a normal period for 7 days normal bleeding normal cramps. I have been very tired, and smells are stronger but nothing else. hopefully at the end of this week the test is positive.My main concern is not waiting long enough. I just started to research and I am reading alot of stories about women who having misscarriages. My doctor, the most wonderful woman, told me otherwise.I am hoping that I can bring good news to all, and maybe give hope that we can have a successful pregnancy after the iud is removed.GOOD LUCK TO ALL!!!!!",

This could be pms symptoms as well, but I am getting anxious to see if my husband and I were successful. Part of me wants to be prego now, but part of me feels that waiting one more month would be better in the long run.\u00a0\u00a0I am due to get aunt flo thurs. so we will see if she is absent. I will keep you posted.I want to give you both some advice. This is something I read. If you are trying to get prego start taking prenatal vitamins asap. Do not quote me on this, but I believe I read it on the mirena website.\u00a0\u00a0Mirena thins the lining of your uterus, but if you take baby asprin it will help to build it back up faster. Like I said don't quote me on that and google it if u have to.",
