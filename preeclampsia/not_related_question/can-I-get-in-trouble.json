Everything like the blod work tests results and all that. My previous doctor haf to be contacted so they can fax my info to them and all. But i got induced due to me being overdue.",

I was pregnant at 16 and 17 when my daughter was born and even on the labour ward the midwives and nurses were demeaning and rude. Nothing I could've done though, it was better for my daughters health to attend my appointments and ensure everything was going ok. My partner and I are in a long term relationship and now we're pregnant again only this time I'm 22. I have noticed a huuuuge difference in people's attitudes and my midwife is at the same office and I'll be giving birth at the same hospital. My obstetrician is the same and I even said to her - \"oh I remember you! You told me that all women felt pain giving birth and I should stop feeling sorry for myself when I was having a placental abruption\". She is so nice to me now lol",
