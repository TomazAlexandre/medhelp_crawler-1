    "question": "So I'm 26 weeks and for the past week or so I've been having problems seeing and stuff like it will be blurry I have to blink a lot to fix it and the other day I walked in a different room and closed my eyes for something and when I opened them I was seeing sort of gray squiggly lines all over and it didn't go away for like 30 seconds.. Does anyone know what this might be? I go to the doctor tomorrow just wanted to know something before hand. This is my first baby.",
