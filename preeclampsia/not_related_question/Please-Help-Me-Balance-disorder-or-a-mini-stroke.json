Again she checked my ear and it was clear, She advised to get intouch with Neurologist today. I totally broke down and was so upset, because i so really feel its a inner ear infection and that a course of antibiotics would help couldnt stop crying because i felt no one was listening to me and that i was feeling stressed about having to leave baby and kids to go back into hospital....I have not gotten any worse since yesterday so i will wait till later before calling the GP to get in touch with Hospital. As i keep thinking it will get better...Thank you again for your repliesZoe",

And whatever it is, it's not something that you can just take some antibiotics and will be all better. Follow up with neurology and get a second opinion if they cannot figure things out. Sometimes it takes a long time to get to the bottom of neurological problems. You need to stay closely under a doctor's care and report any new symptoms, no matter how odd or unrelated they seem.

    "question": "Hi there.. I am a 29 year old female. I Gave birth to my 3rd child 8 weeks ago. I developed severe high blood pressure 2 days before giving birth and was put on labetalol after giving birth, my BP continued to rise average reading was 200/115 I was also given Nifedipine for 5 days ( was stopped due to breast feeding). Continued on labetalol 300mg 3times a day until baby was 4 weeks old as BP stabilized.So 4 weeks of no problems...Until Monday. Woke in morning felt fine, come early afternoon while hanging out washing my Right ear became muffled and i started to feel like i was going to fall over i also had a tingling feeling down the right side of my face and my speech seemed a little funny. I went to my GP straight away who took my BP which was raised again 160/96 he seemed very concerended as i was very unsteady and sent me to the hospital. The neurologists done a CTscan and MRI scan both came back clear. They also said my right ear is clear and blood tests all normal also. I got home tuesday tea time. and recieved a call from hospital as the proffesor wanted me to go back so he could examine me. I said i was unable to due to having baby and 2 other kids and i would come as a out patient. He advised if i got any worse to go back to GP.things have stayed the same balance and ear wise until today when i was in the car (hubby driving) I kept having somersault feeling in my stomach like when u go fast over a dip in the road. When we got home i decided to hoover the house on doing so my ear got really bad again and my balance really bad again also. I have also developed the tingling in my face again. I did noticed yest i had a few sharp pains in the right side and left side of my head above my eyes in my forehead.I am feeling terrible again. i feel so confused and spaced out like u get when you are on morphine ( only way i can explain it)....i really think there something not quite right deep inside my right ear but the doctors had a look inside and said its clear. i go back to see Neurologist in 2 weeks timeOnly other medical problems i have. Is a Thyroid Nodule which i am due to have surgery next week to removed as had 2 inconclusive biopsys.. All thyroid bloods are fine..Can anyone help me figure out what might be wrong with me. I am feeling really down in the dumps at the moment i cant hold my baby without being seated incase i fall while holding him... I hope all this post makes sense i have read over it a few times. If there anything else you would like to know or i have missed please let me know.Thanks for taking the time to read my problem",
