            "answer": "I hear ya!!My little lad has been moving non stop for 3 days now! I am almost 32 weeks and I'm putting it down to lack of space! He probably isn't moving anymore than usual but just feeling it more because of his increase in size. I'm estimating that he is already close to 5lbs.......I never felt this big with DD and she was 8lbs 3oz at birth. I wouldnt worry about it.......lots of movement has got to be better than no movement.......speak to your health professional if you still feel unsure.Hayley xx",

            "answer": "First of all, thank you for all your responses. I was a little worried simply because it was just this whole sudden increase. I've been lacking sleep now because of it and according to the OB, last week he told me the baby was about 3.5 lbs and that I wanted to keep it as a small baby so who knows... With this being all new I've been so worried lol but thank you so much for your posts",

    "question": "Okay so throughout my whole pregnancy my baby hasn't been too active however now at 34 weeks, for the past 2 days he has been OVERLY active. I mean to the point that I can barely tell when he is sleeping or awake. I thought there was less room in there as the weeks went on and so the baby would move less but go figure he is moving like a tropper in there-should I be worried?",
