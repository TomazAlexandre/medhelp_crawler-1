The drs told me he had less than a 50% chance of survival and be prepared for him not to make it and if he did survive then he would have major complications physically and mentally. It was the scariest time in my life!! He is now 12 yrs old and perfectly healthy normal boy! He is smaller than most kids his age but my husband and I r not very big tho. It took us this long to even consider having another child cuz we were so afraid of having another premie. I'm now 28 wks and high risk and no matter what the drs will only let me go as far as 36-37 wks so I will for sure have another small baby and she's measuring small too. I just hope that she is healthy and does not have to stay very long in the hospital. Good luck to all u ladies!",
