They said when your nails, hands or toes, go blue/purple it could be a sign of hypertension or preeclampsia. Not saying that's what's happening, but just a side note. Other than that, it's never happened to me, so I wouldn't really know personally. But I would just run that past your doctor.",

I do have protein in my urine which could also be an impending sign of preclampsia. My OB didn't say much in the write back I think she just passes things off because she knows that this is my 5th pregnancy. She said they can turn colors from them growing...Right ha.
