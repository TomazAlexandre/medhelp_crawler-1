    "question": "Im going to have a scheduled c section first thing Thursday morning. She is already measuring over 8lbs and has gained a lb a week for the last 3 weeks, so my doctor said at 37 weeks I would either have to be induced or have a c section, and he recommened the c section to lower the risk that she would get stuck in the birth canal. He told us the chance was higher for her to have permanent nerve damage or even death if she got stuck and since this is my first baby and i have preeclampsia/high blood pressure, he recommended that i have a c section. SO thats what were going to do. I have to go in June 18th at 530am and my baby will be born shortly after that! Wish me luck...Im super nervous.",
