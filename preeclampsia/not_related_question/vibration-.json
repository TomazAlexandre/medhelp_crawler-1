Just because your baby is born healthy doesn't mean he won't experience asthma or other health conditions due to forced termination of pregnancy (induction), malnourishment, etc. Maybe we just want the best for your little one and wish you knew what we did. There is a lot of research on this, time even had a great article on nourishment (or lack of) effecting people later on in thier 50's. One of the best things you can do for your little one is give them all the time they need in the womb for nourishment and protection and breastfeeding.",

After arguments they told me I had no option and I was getting induced... apparently they do this to 1 in 5 women. I get its uncomfortable, it just bothered me so much how my own doctors were feeding me bad science and info just Bc it was convenient for them. I don't want anyone treated or misled the way they do at my hospital. They treat women like cattle where I delivered with my first.

It has been nearly a year since guidelines were updated to reflect enormous amounts of research proving that babies born BEFORE 39 WEEKS are at significantly increased risk of possibly major complications. Therefore 37 weeks is no longer \"full term\". 37-38 weeks is \"early term\", 39-41 weeks is \"full term\" and 42+ is \"post-term\". Induction of labor before 39 weeks without medical reasons (like IUGR, severe gestational diabetes, or life-threatening preeclampsia - not like \"I'm tired of being pregnant\" or \"eight pounds is too big\" or \"but my ankles hurt\") is irresponsible and unsafe. Period.Oh, and \"my baby was preterm but is totally fine\" doesn't mean everyone will be so lucky. That's what we call a logical fallacy and it's not a good way to make a point.",

Not anywhere in my post did I say I was trying to bring on labor, I asked a simple question to see the answers n comments to this theory. I had my 1st child at 36 weeks n she was perfectly healthy in every way, she's 4 today n still no major complications, n I have God to thank for that. I look at it like no matter how early or late our babies come into this world, something is bound to happen regardless if they're ready to come out naturally or we give them that extra push to help, that's life. So like I said earlier, THANK YOU for your insight and God Bless you. NO I WAS NEVER TRYING TO BRING ON LABOR IT WAS A SIMPLE QUESTION!!",
