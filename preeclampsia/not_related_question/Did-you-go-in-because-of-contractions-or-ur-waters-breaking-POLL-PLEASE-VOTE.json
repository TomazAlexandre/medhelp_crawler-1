My mother had 4 children and her water never broke with any of us. They always broke it at the hospital. I try to labor as much as possible at home before heading to the birth center.

They take a crochey (sp) needle with a small hook on the end and snag the bag. It sounds worse than it really is though. I dont remember even feeling it, it was like an exam, I was just uncomfortable with that, lol:)",
