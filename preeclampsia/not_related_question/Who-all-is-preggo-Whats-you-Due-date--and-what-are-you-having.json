She said since im so small framed shes afraid he may not fit through the birth canal. So she has talked about possible c section. I got this wed for an u/s to see how big he is. She said i have to make it to 36 weeks i will be 35 on monday. Im thinking they may induce me at 38 weeks. I will find out the details on Wed! I had my baby shower today and it was great i got lots of awesome things! I also have pics posted of Jamins room! It turned out sooo cute!",
