            "answer": "I was just tested for infections and everything came back normal? I just went in yesterday for a check up he looked at me and \"said\" that it was normal to have increase discharge but didn't do a strip or anything to see if it was fluid. He just tells me everything is ok with the way i feel and the weight thing is normal too? I dont feel like it is:( Ive always had low blood pressure it still is but when I went into labor (6yrs ago) with my daughter I got Preeclampsia right before labor. So far no sign of it with this one. Ik I only have a few weeks I just wanted to know other peoples thoughts and maybe some answers? I had a GREAT pregnancy besides the weight thing all the way up to 32wks then I went into prelabor at 33-34wks they stopped it both times the last time I had problems and started hemorrhaging\u00a0\u00a0(they never figured out why) and refused any other treatment. Luckily we have held off this long I'm just worried that there might be something else going on. Sorry so long and thanks for feedback:)",
