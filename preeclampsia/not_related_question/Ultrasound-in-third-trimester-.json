Also if youre high risk, somethings wrong with you, youve had fluid issues, and it also varies by state/location, you get a 3rd trimester one here generally. And you can also pay privately if you just wanna see your lil one :))I'm unfortunately high risk I had placenta privia, my 2.5 yr old is perfect, but i get many more ultrasounds than most so i get to see my baby monthly and the weekly eventually once I get to my last 8 weeks because my placenta isnt where its supposed to be it sits almost at the opening of my cervix instead i guess and can cause pre term labor,\u00a0\u00a0actually went overdue w my first, but they'd rather be sure than sorry so I have lots of OB appts and USs, it actually gets very stressful :/",
