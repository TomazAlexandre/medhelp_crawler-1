            "answer": "I think it all sounds normal, but if you are having swelling issues along with the headaches, it *can* be a sign of preeclampsia. I would probably AT LEAST get a call in to your Dr. before the weekend to ask his/her opinion of the headache.. Every time I have an appointment my Dr. asks if I have been experiencing headaches and or swelling..I have been experiencing nausea and belly aches.. I think it's normal. I am 35 weeks.Good luck and keep us posted!",

I was going to bring this up next Wednesday at my appointment to see what he thought. I figure it is cause space is at a premium in there now.",

            "answer": "I called my doctors to get my doctors opinion. The receptionist took the msg and told me that if the headaches are unbearable then to go to the hospital on the weekend. I didn't get the feeling that she thought it was anything major. That's the thing, I can handle all of these negitive side effects but I like to know they are normal and not a cause for concern. I read up on preeclampsia and am confused as to whether or not regular blood pressure would rule it out? My blood pressure was normal at the last appointment..\u00a0\u00a0If the headaches persist, then I will go to the hospital over the weekend to ease my mind.Thanks for letting me know that you guys are experiencing the sore tummy and nausia too. It makes me feel more relaxed about it.\u00a0\u00a0Have a good weekend everybody!!",

    "question": "Is anyone experiencing any headaches, nausia, or a \"sore\" belly in this 3rd trimester?I've had a headache since Saturday. (It's been 6 days now). On Tues I had went to the doctors for a regular appt and my blood pressure was fine. I started to have bouts of nausia too, but not once have I been sick. In addition to this, if I put any type of pressure on my belly, it kinda \"hurts\". Not sure if this is cuz my bladder is always full and if it putting too much pressure on it or what..I am hoping these headaches/symptoms are not part of a larger problem. I have another doc appt this Tues. I will be 37 weeks then. Wow! I can't believe my time is almost here!!\u00a0\u00a0:)",
