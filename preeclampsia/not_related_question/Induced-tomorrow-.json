They gave me pain medicine through iv last night to help with contractions and it was wonderful to relax and sleep for awhile. At non they took out the pill and checked me I still only dilated a half a cm. So they let me shower and then they started pitocin. Oh my. The contractions starting coming frequent and very strong. A few hours later I was at 2cm and they broke my water. About an hour later I got my epidural. Wouldn't be able to type this if I didn't get the epidural. It was less painful than the contractions I was having and well worth it. They just came and checked me and I am 5cm! Making slow progress which makes me very happy. Going to try and relax for awhile since I'm able. Will update when more happens!",
