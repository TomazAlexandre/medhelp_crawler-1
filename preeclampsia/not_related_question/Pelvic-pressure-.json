But my sister just called to see what my Dr said and my Dr said to come in and be monitored so I told my sister that and then told her I didn't want to go and she said \"well what if you don't go and something bad happens\" now I feel like I need to go! I had a normal pregnancy with my son until the end and then went to the hospital one day because I wasn't feeling right and ended up being taking to l&d immediatly to start inducing me because I had preeclampsia to the max, the nurse said she was shocked that I hadn't had a seizure yet because my b.p was so high... I just got out the shower, my bf just got in, he thinks I'm over reacting and its making me feel bad to drag him up there but I guess I need to make sure everything's ok!",
