We went to eat first at Arby's & as soon as we finished eating I stood up & my water broke. No noise, feeling, or sign. Just right in the middle of Arby's for all to see! It's funny now but was hilarious then I thought.",

And not even 10 min after she laft the room my water broke...all I felt was a gush. When my nurse came in she said she thought it would break bc my water bag felt really tight. My son had went to the bathroom and yes this may be gross but I made my hubby look at it lol he said it was green and laughing he said that was the grossest thing I ever told him to do.",
