    "question": "having horrible lower back cramps, was up all night with what at first seemed like severe heartburn.\u00a0\u00a0I took my prescribed dosage of Prevacid.\u00a0\u00a0Vomiting on and off and constant nausea and gets worse anytime I drink or eat anything, even water or ice. Horrible sharp pains in my stomach the last time I tried drinking some ice water.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I'm not sure what to do. I googled my symptoms and some came up with preclamsyia.\u00a0\u00a0Debating on whether I should go to the ER and get on an iv just so I don't risk dehydrating or if I should just tough it out and see if it improves.\u00a0\u00a0 Been going on for about 24 hours now.",
