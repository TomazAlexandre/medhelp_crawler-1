            "answer": "I agree with the others. He's probably just waiting for baby to be able to breath. Once you reach 34 weeks they are probably going to start serious talk about induction. I know it's really hard but try to be as calm as you can. Stress raises your blood pressure and the last thing I'm sure you want to do is add high blood pressure to everything. Good luck with everything",

            "answer": "Wow sounds just like what I went through in my last pregnancy. Start drinking at least 64ozs of water a day to help get your fluid up and keep a good eye on your blood pressure. I had preeclampsia and all of the things you mentioned are a sign of preeclampsia. They induced me at 35 weeks my little one was 4lbs 12ozs and 18in long and very healthy. From what the doctor told me there is a defense mechanism with babies in the womb when they are under stress their lungs develop quicker. They do want to keep baby in there as long as possible we made it to the 35th week instead of the doctors plans of 37\u00a0\u00a0just don't stress and kick your feet back and relax right now would be the best time for bed rest.",
