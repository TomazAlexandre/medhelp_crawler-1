            "answer": "The baby's lungs when fully ready to breathe air gives off a protein that tells the brain it's time for your baby to be born. Just trust that when your baby is ready it will come. Your due date is not an exact science, it's just an estimate. I'm 36 weeks with my second and I was induced at 37 weeks 5 days due to preeclampsia so I don't know what to expect. At least you are already dilated which means baby is ready and will be there soon. Try not to dwell on it so much, you just have more time with your first born. I'm still throwing up and in a lot of pain but I'm not in a rush so let us both just be patient together:-)",

    "question": "Im due tomorrow. Extremely bored/anxious/nervous i cant sit still. Im extremely uncomfortable. It hurts to stand up or sit down. Hubby tries to comfort me but is terrible at it. Im just so annoyed with everything. Im 2.5 centimeters for 2 weeks now and dont feel like anything has changed. Braxton hicks contractions and back ache for two weeks also. Very freaking annoying. Im literally going stir crazy not working.This is all new to me. My 1st i had no signs or symptoms until i woke up one day with contractions and went to the hospital. She was born within 12 hrs and was 13 daya early. So this two plus weeks of prelabor is really tiring. Sorry for the rant just needed to get it out. No support at home and im feeling really alone.",
