            "answer": "I'm sorry that you are going thru the worry about it being MS. There are soo many things that mimic this disease, it's hard to know from what you're describing. A lot of the symptoms could be attributed to being as far along as you are..I am agreeing with your father that you should follow up with tests once you have the baby. A lot of times, after a woman has a baby, the hormone changes can cause her to have a relapse (if diagnosed) or symptoms to start up.I would mention it at your next Dr appt. One of the most important things about MS is to have things documented. That way you can show a neurologist how long symptoms have gone on, what they were etc.Good luck with your baby and keep us posted on what you find out.HugsKristi",

            "answer": "Welcome, GTob.Wow, it sounds as if you're a bit overwhelmed with symptoms. I do think you need to discuss them with your OB next visit. I know every pregnancy is different, and maybe you've gained more weight this time. You also have to take care of another child, which has to be very tiring. And so on, so please don't think of MS right away.I hope it will help you to learn that MS is nearly always quiet during pregnancy. That's because your body is now dealing with 2 sets of genes, yours and your husband's, and so the immune response has to dial down to accommodate this temporary change. Pregnant women with MS often have a flare of symptoms a few months after delivery, but this seldom happens during pregnancy.You're right that MS is often diagnosed in the 20-40 year old range, but some much younger and many older are diagnosed. And although you do have a greater than average chance of developing it, it really isn't much greater.Please take it easy as much as you can, and talk to your OB.Best wishes,ess",

            "answer": "I would have to lean towards it being more pregnancy related but only a dr could say for sure of course.I have 4 babies and each pregnancy was different. The leg problems you're having could EASILY be associated with the baby's position, the shift in weight/balance of your body. I would bring this up with your OB.As for the vision changes, have you had your blood pressure checked? Preeclampsia can cause vision changes. I would w/o a doubt call your doctor today and let him/her know about the visual changes your are experiencing.Also, my vision changed when I was pregnant with my second child, they said all the extra fluid in your body can change the curvature of your eyes.You are best to check with your doctor and follow-up with a neurologist if you're still having these concerns after your little one is born.Congratulations!!!-Kelly",

    "question": "I'm 24 years old & my father has had MS for years now. I am now just about 36 weeks pregnant and haven't been feeling very well, this is my 2nd child & haven't had any of these symptoms before. My vision is starting to get a bit bad, my back has been hurting more than usual, my legs & feet get the tingly asleep feeling sometimes (when I'm not laying on them) and what's concerning me most is my legs. I'll get shooting pains from my lower beack and it goes straight down either one or both legs and it brings me to the floor & it's so painful sometimes I cry. It'll happen when I'm walking, sitting or just changing positions when I'm sitting/laying down. I spoke to my father & he told me when I have the baby to go get tested. But I wanted to know if I should be concerned? I am going to the doctors this week for just a check up, should I mention this? I know this is just about the age when if you do have MS it will start to show the signs of it. Anything would help. Thank you",
