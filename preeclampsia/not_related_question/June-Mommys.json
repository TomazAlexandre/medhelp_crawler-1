            "answer": "Hey everyone - I live in rural South Dakota and this is my first baby. Iam about 11 weeks 3 days (I think but have not had a u/s). I am due June 22nd. I'm kind of frustrated because since I live in a rural area I attend a clinic for my prenatals and then only go to the hospital for the month before and during delivery and once for an u/s. The clinic doesn't have an ultrasound, so I won't have my first ultrasound until 18wks. My doctor tried to find the heartbeat at 10wks, but their old doppler was broken, so I currently have no idea if everythings OK, except that I have had no bleeding etc and urine/blood owork was fine. I'm not sure I should wait until 18wks to have my first u/s - is this too late??. Anyways, I've had quite a few symptoms already,\u00a0\u00a0but they only started around 8wks and are still going strong - nausea and throwing up, dizziness, fatique, seeing stars (especially after I throw up - please reference my other question on this forum), constipation and bloating etc etc etc. I hope it all diminishes soon!! I am very excited about being pregnant but I'm also pretty scared because I knew very little about pregnancy itself when I got pregnant and when I read about preeclampsia, HELLP and all the other possible complications it kind of freaked me out big time. Any advice to calm down? Thanks and congrats!!",

Can't wait for my u/s which will be in about 5 weeks. Only thing that is worrying me is I went to a doctor for something unrelated and my blood pressure was up around 140/86 (norm is 120/78) but I was kind of feeling anxious that day. She took it again about five mins later and it was 136/84 so it was falling but it kind of freaked me out cause I really don't want to deal with high b/p this early in the game! Anyone else had an isolated elevated b/p reading? Should I be worried? Thanks and glad to hear everyone is hearing the heartbeat - what little miracles inside of us!!",
