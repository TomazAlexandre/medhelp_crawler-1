    "question": "I thought I'd share the good news! I made a post last month about vanishing twin syndrome and how I was afraid that I'd lose one of my babies before the visit. Well I went for my visit today and they confirmed I am 11W4D with twins! My little munchkins are growing healthy and developing right on track. One twin however was very feisty moving all over the place. The other twin was very laid back lol. Unfortunately though, I lost 10 pounds and was told I had to gain AT LEAST 40 throughout the pregnancy. They also told me that it is a possibility that I may or may not be put on bed rest in May, which ***** because my college graduation is in May, please pray for me ladies. I just wanted to share the news. Now off to FINALLY tell my mom I'm pregnant lol",
