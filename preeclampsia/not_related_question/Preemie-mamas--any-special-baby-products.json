Now she is 31 weeks and weights 2lbs (920 grams).There are small problems that come up here and there but nothing that she cant overcome. Thank God!! She is eating breastmilk through the tube, breezing on her own but they still have her on additional oxygen. Moving legs, hands, and opening her eyes to look around. She is a strong girl and Im very proud of her progress!!",
