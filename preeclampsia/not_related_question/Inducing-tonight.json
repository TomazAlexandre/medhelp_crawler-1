            "answer": "Good luck to you and may God bless you with an easy and fast delivery. Did you find out about your bp at the doctor's office? I had preeclampsia with my previous and this time around I have had a few readings with a little high bp, but nothing alarming. Sorry to ask now, but were you having any symptoms that let you know your bp was high? I have been waking up with swollen hands and I get light headed from time to time but then it goes away. Last time I got checked my BP was 126, but the doctor wasn't concerned and I haven't gone to check it again. Anyway, any answer would be great. And congrats!",

Today the did labs again and an ultrasound. They said everything looks good but I'm home now with a high reading and very swollen feet and it just concerns me. How high was your BP to make them induce?",

I'm 37 weeks 3 days.My past 3 visits my BP was high so they checked my blood and urine and did the non stress test and they said I have hypertension so I need to be induced. I'm scared and anxious!",

I know they are doctors and know what's best but I can't help but think that's not good for me or the baby. I guess they are waiting to let me be further along. I'm just concerned but they tell me everything is fine. Good luck!",

            "answer": "Babybolen:\u00a0\u00a0As far as I know, My urine and my blood came back normal. Which made me wonder why I was getting induced. They told me that my high BP will turn into preeclampsia so they wanted to prevent that and since I'm 37 weeks my baby is considered full term so it would be better for me and her to have her out of me. So if your BP has been high these past few visits, you should tell your doctor that concerns you and then they should monitor you for an hour and see if it continues.",
