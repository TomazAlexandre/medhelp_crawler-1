    "question": "I have an appointmennt today but maybe someone can give me some insite before then as to what this may be? I tried looking it up on google and had not a lot of luck due to different answered. For the past feew (maybe 4) days I've have back aches, stomach cramping, (both semi normal. every now and then a little stronger than usual, not much i was worried about though) and blurred vision. I didn't think much of any of these symptoms until last night when i almost fell over bevause I was dizzy. I couldn't focus my head/eyes on anything, even setting down my head was spinning and I was dizzy. I am 38 weeks and 5 days and have no idea what could be wrong. I've never felt this way my whole pregnancy. I can't even get up to go to the bathroom without getting dizzy/light headed. Am I just over reacting or should I bring this up with my doctor today?",
