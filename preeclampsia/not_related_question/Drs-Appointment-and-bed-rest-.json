    "question": "I am 35 weeks today and had my weekly check-up and my BP was going wonky like always. It will be higher than they want it and they will make me lay on my left side for like 5 mins and it will be great when they recheck it. Well today they decided to put me on strict bed rest and have me do a 24hr urine collection. I have to drop it off tomorrow and then they will let me know tomorrow around 4 what the results are and where we go from there. They said if they don't like the results we may have to start talking induction and I really don't want to have to go that route but if it's what's best for my Little Man then I guess I will have my baby before his due date.",
