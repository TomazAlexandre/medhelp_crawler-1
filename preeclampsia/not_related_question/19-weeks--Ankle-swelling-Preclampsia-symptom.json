            "answer": "Lots of water! And avoid salt. It could indicate preeclampsia but my midwife said don't worry too much if it's just in your feet. Once it goes to your hands and face she starts to worry. Check your blood pressure if you're worried about it. You should know from your visits what your normal reading is. If you check it and it's much higher than usual, call your doctor asap. Most drug stores have free checks fyi.",
