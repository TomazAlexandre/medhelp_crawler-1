            "answer": "Hi,How is your friend? There are two forms of polycystic kidney disease (PKD): the\u00a0\u00a0autosomal dominant PKD and the autosomal recessive PKD. The dominant type usually causes symptoms in adulthood while the recessive PKD usually causes symptoms in infancy and early childhood. The phrase \u201cautosomal dominant\u201d means that if one parent has the disease, there is a 50 percent chance that it will pass to a child. In some cases, it can occur spontaneously in patients. In these cases, neither of the parents carries a copy of the disease gene. It is best that a nephrologist is consulted for proper management. PKD has no cure but it can be managed with medicine to control high blood pressure; medicine and surgery to reduce pain; antibiotics to resolve infections; dialysis to replace functions of failed kidneys and even kidney transplantation. Take care and do keep us posted with your friend's condition.",
