            "answer": "As the first two posts say, sex is recommended by many and seems to help ripen the cervix for some women.\u00a0\u00a0One thing that worked for me was to have the doctor strip membranes.\u00a0\u00a0For both babies I was getting preeclampsia and it was going to be time to induce soon.\u00a0\u00a0With my second I was only at a 2 so she could only do just a little, but by the next day I was a 6 and my baby had dropped WAY down.\u00a0\u00a0That was without anything more then what felt like some braxton hicks contractions that stalled.\u00a0\u00a0They stripped again the next day when I was a 6 and I was in labor within an hour.\u00a0\u00a0Although you need a doctor to do this, and there is always the risk of infection/rupture of membranes, it is one of the methods that is used a lot by midwives since from what I\"ve read if you aren't ready it won't do anything, but if you are it can give you the little push that you need.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck! Let us know if anything works!",
