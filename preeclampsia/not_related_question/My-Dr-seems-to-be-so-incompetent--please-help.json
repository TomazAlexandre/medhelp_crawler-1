I had a PA the last two times and the first one ran a culture test and it has no growth at 48 hrs. I'm just wondering what this could be? I see my Dr the 14th if she's actually in this time to talk to about it. But I've noticed discharge this morning of a greenish color looks like snot kind of (tmi, even for me lol) I've always had the discharge but lately it's been having a bit of color. It never smells and I have no itching or burning so idk wtf is going on. Just need some help since my Dr is either gone or just doesn't pay attention.",
