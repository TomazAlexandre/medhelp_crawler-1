            "answer": "I don't know what HELLP syndrome is, but your other symptoms sound very much like Cushing's syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0It takes an ACTH test to confirm it and usually ultrasound of the adrenal glands.\u00a0\u00a0Basically the adrenal gland is producing too much cortisol which leads to the weight gain, usually elevated alkaline phosphatase, often elevated glucose, and often elevated liver enzymes and very very often fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like time to see an endocrinologist to me",

I have seen 3 Endos to test for Cushing's.\u00a0\u00a0None of them did the ACTH test.\u00a0\u00a02 of them told me not to come back, that nothing is wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0One of them even yelled at me and told me that I just need to go home and be happy. But then she marked Pituitary Neoplasia on my paper.\u00a0\u00a0She won't respond to my questions about that.The other made me stop taking my Hormone Replacement Therapy and told me I couldn't come back for help until I stopped taking that because he said the doctor that gave it to me was stupid and that I didn't need it, even though all of my hormones are way low.I'm so tired of being dismissed and talked down to by doctors. I know something is wrong.",

    "question": "Well, to start I was always healthy and in shape. When I was pregnant I ended up with Severe-preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome. Ever since then I have been in horrible health. I have gained over 100 lbs since 2006 despite good diet and exercise, and I just feel horrible everyday. It took 13 doctors to get one to finally check my hormones, the others just treated me bad and told me to diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I now have pages and pages of abnormal lab work but noone can tell me exactly what is wrong. Here are a few quick examples.\u00a0\u00a0Oh.. all of this started when I was 26... I'm 30 now and still sick.I have Vit B12, Vit D, Magnesium, Ferriten defeciencies.Was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism at one appointment, then told the next appointment I don't have thyroid issue by the same doctor. Was told to stop going to McDonalds.............which I don't eat fast food anyway.IGF-1\u00a0\u00a0 (growth hormone)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LowEstrogen\u00a0\u00a0LowProgesterone\u00a0\u00a0LowTestosterone\u00a0\u00a0 LowFSH\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LowCortisol\u00a0\u00a0 Low and High.. results are varied even though done at same time of day.Triglycerides\u00a0\u00a0 HighHLD\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LowFatty LiverThere are so many other things but I just can't remember them all.Does anyone at all have these same problems?\u00a0\u00a0What could be causing all of this?\u00a0\u00a0I'm feeling so bad these days but none of my doctors can explain why or do anything to help me.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor said she has never had anyone respond to hormone replacement like me and that she can't explain it.",
