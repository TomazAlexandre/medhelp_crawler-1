I have tried to explain it to him but he still doesnt understand, Even though these babies are from being raped they are my babies and will always be and nothing can change that. The bible says God never puts more on you than you can handle so obviously he though i could handle loosing my lil girl and then being raped and now pregnant with twins. It has been hard but i am trying to stay strong.",

            "answer": "Man, I don't know exactly what to say to all of this....i can honestly say that I understand the part about losing your daughter. My son was stillborn when I was 8.5 months & in the hospital for 9 days with preeclampsia & dangerously high bp. I think I shouldve died to. I'm surprised I don't have any organ damage although I have other serious health problems. My baby would be 4 now& nothing ever fills that hole in my heart. When I see a story like this it really grabs my heart because i feel like mothers of lost angel babies have some kindof invisible unspoken bonds between hearts. I know everything you felt from it because I felt the same things. I dnt know about the rape part. I hope your able to defeat that whole trauma from that & I do believe that god took a tragedy from a stupid man using his free will & selfishness to hurt someone else & he turned it around and now gave you 2 miracle babies. That's exactly what the are. Because inception, pregnancy & birth are literally a miracle. That our bodies receive this foreign object that our immune system is designed to kill off but yet they grow & develop & are born anyways is the first miracle. The miracle of life. This miracles can shine light in the darkest corners of our lives& they will help bring healing to your heart for everything uve been through. They are your angels& have come into your life to teach you things. No matter what happens just know that& I will light a candle & pray for you& the babies. I really hope things start to get better for you& please keep us updated no matter what happens.",
