            "answer": "Hi there!\u00a0\u00a0Have you had any digestive issues lately?\u00a0\u00a0It could be gas pain... it could also be muscle pain.\u00a0\u00a0One thing though - did you have your blood pressure checked lately?\u00a0\u00a0I just wanted to mention because I know pain high up (under the right-side ribs) is sometimes a sign of preeclampsia... here is a paragraph from the website:Stomach and/or Right Shoulder PainThis type of stomach pain, called epigastric pain by the medical profession, is usually under the right-side ribs. It can be confused with heartburn, gallbladder problems, flu, indigestion or pain from the baby kicking. Shoulder pain is often called referral pain because it radiates from the liver under the right ribs. Lower back pain is different from muscle strain common to pregnancy. It is usually more acute and specific. All may be a sign of HELLP Syndrome or a related problem in the liver. Shoulder pain can feel like someone is deeply pinching you along the bra strap, or it can be painful to lie on your right side.What you can do...Pain in this area should be taken very seriously; do not dismiss it and go to bed. Call your health professional immediately.From: http://www.preeclampsia.org/symptoms.asp#painJust thought I'd mention this... I just happened to come across it earlier this week.",

            "answer": "Thats good to know. I had preaclamsia w/ my second two years ago and was in complete denial! Now I'm 21 weeks and have felt what I discribed as gas pains under my left rib (Bebe is really pushing everything high) I dunno, It's weird, everyonce in a while I can't take a deep breath or straighten my back until it passes, but it only lasts a few seconds. I'll be paying more attention now.",

    "question": "I am wondering if anyone has ever had a pain in their side that lasted all day. I work up yesterday and had it and it was on the right side of my stomach sotr of up by my ribs and it streched down about 4 or 5 inches from there. I called the nurse line and she said it was probably ligament pain but she kept sayingt it would be low and mine was kind of high up just wondering and it lasted all day it finally went away this morning. Also when I have had the round ligament pain it only lasts a minute then it subsides. Any info would be greatly appericate thanks!",
