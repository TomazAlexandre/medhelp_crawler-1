            "answer": "Have you been tested for preeclampsia? That's how it sounds to me, if so, they are keeping track of you to make sure it is or isn't preeclampsia, if it is, and it's bad enough they'll induce labor pretty quickly, it's dangerous to the mother and baby, but it's very common, and you're far enough along to where delivering should not be a major issue at this point, if they do have to deliver you early, they'll probably give you steroids to strengthen the babys lungs. I'm sorry you're having to go through it alone, but I wouldn't worry unless you have a reason to, good luck hun!",

            "answer": "Thanks guys. I was tested last week for preeclampsia an they said everything came back fine but I am concerned because this is 3 times in a matter o a week. It took my husband and I 4 years to get pregnant and now tht I have made it this far I don't want it to be bad. We went through a trisomy 18 scare and now all of this is happening It started with fertility treatment and 2 IUI's before I finally gave up thinking I would never get pregnant and god blessed me with this precious baby boy. I am so thankful for that I just can't bare to go through all of this anymore.",

    "question": "So I am 37 weeks pregnant and the past week I had 3 appointments and 3 nst I am currently sitting at the hospital now awaiting an ultrasound when I just got one yesterday. Apparently my bp is too high and my fluid is too high and yesterday he wasn't showing the breathing cycle which they don't do all the time inutero. An now today he isn't moving as much as they like so I have to have another ultrasound and I still have my doctor appointment today. My husban is home sleeping due to working night shift. I am scared,lonely and going through all of this alone. Can anyone give me some advice? I want my little boy to be fine.",
