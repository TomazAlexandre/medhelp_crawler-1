            "answer": "Aaaaaahhhh..... I know exactly how you feel! After 31hrs in labour and slow dilation(even after inducing) my dr decided to rather do a c-section before things get too complicated. I had bad cry sessions because I was reading about successful labour stories and how I wasn't able to experience it myself. This only eased up about 2-3 mths after, I started convincing myself it was for the best, my baby is finally safe in my arms and that with next baby we could plan on when he/she will arrive. It got me all excited, especially now that we're pregnant again. Keep your head held up high momma and enjoy your precious bundle of joy*",
