Someone should clarify that for me, though, because I'm having a hard time finding my resource for that info.Don't give up hope but do prepare yourself for what may or may not happen. Don't stress and just take things one day at a time!At 5 weeks you probably won't see anything just yet. If you were to miscarry, let them know you'd like to naturally instead of getting a D&C or taking the pill.",

Because if i'm 5 weeks, i think thats early to see something but 9000 seems high to NOT see anything. the only thing that keeps me hopeful is that last week i got an u/s and there was nothing at all. but this week there was a gestational sac. so hopefully a little while longer and there will be a yolk sac. the waiting is that hardest part. if it is going to miscarry i wish i just knew and started the process. i havent had any bleeding or anything yet though. so i guess thats good.",

I only had one baby in there and she was super healthy. I know a whole lot of people who higher then average levels at this point in pregnancy and went on to have healthy pregnancies. Something to remember when thinking about levels is that the range for 5 weeks is 5weeks0days so every day after that can be higher and closer to the average range for 6weeks0days. I wouldn't stress too much at this point since levels can be SO different from person to person. What really matters is that they double in the 48-72 hour time frame. :)",

Now granted high numbers don't gaurntee multiples but since they saw a sac you have to remain hopeful - you could be one of those women with crazy high numbers and only one baby plus if there is any chance you ovulated later this cycle then technically you wouldn't be five weeks yet even and it would take longer to see the sac ect.., Don't give up and be firm about it and like Joy said if they start talking miscarriage let them know you want to give it time to go naturally and you can always ask for another u/s later on to be sure.

Which you saw, so that is positive!\u00a0\u00a0This is seen before a recognizable embryo can be seen. Within this week, at about week 5 \u00bd to the beginning of the 6th week, a yolk sac can be seen inside the gestational sac. The yolk sac will be the earliest source of nutrients for the developing fetus.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps it is too earlier to have seen the yolk sac?\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "Its a long story but any input would be great! I got a negative preg test on a thursday. that sunday i got a positive. i went to the doctor tuesday and they saw nothing on ultrasound. my count was at 770. they told me to come back in a week. i came back the following week and my count was at 9000. they only saw a gestational sac but no yolk sac. the first doctor i had was nice and hopeful thinking it was too early. this last doctor i had was doom and gloom saying my count was too high and i should have seen a yolk sac. she wants to me to come back monday (which would be another week) to get another ultrasound. she said if we dont see anything that we will consider \"options\". I think i'm still early though. its only been a week and two days since i even got a positive! which just a few days before that i got a negative showing how new i was! do you think its still possible and theres time to see a yolk sac appear? i just dont feel ready to give up already. is 9000 too high though? i read that that can be bad too. any feedback would be awesome. thank you in advance!!",
