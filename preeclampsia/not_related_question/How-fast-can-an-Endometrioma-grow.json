I also have fibro,cfs,ibs, and diverticulitis throughout my whole colon. He mentioned I had a lot of adhesions that he removed. sooo painful! I had 2 c-sections over 20 years ago. Anyway, I was wondering is there a differance between endo and adhesions. Especially to that magnitude. I've been bounced from dr to dr for a long time. I've thought that I,ve had endo before, but my dr says no. I'm very depressed and confused. I live a life of pain. If anyone has a comment on this I would so appreciate it. Thanx, Cornpatch",

            "answer": "Hello All,I found this forum while I was searching for information on colorectal surgery. Here's my story:I'm 48 (my birthday was Tuesday while in hospital) and have two wonderful daughters.I knew I had fibroids and assumed that was causing my abdominal pain, discomfort, bowel changes,etc. I went to an interventional radiologist to see if I was a candidate for fibroid embolization. They did an MRI and found that I had an ovarian cyst 7cm. I contacted a GYN-ONC (my research told me if I was going to have it taken out get a gyn/onc because if it's cancer, they know what else to look for)After doing a CA-125 blood test (slightly elevated at 107-endometriosis can cause this) and after a transvaginal ultrasound he told me he wanted to \"get it out of there.\" 1 1/2 weeks later I had surgery(Jan.25)When he opened me up according to him--he saw a \"big mess.\" The cyst turned out to be an endometrioma. It , and I suppose the related endometriosis ,was attached to my left ureter, and the upper part of my rectum (sigmoid/colon) He ended up calling in a colorectal surgeon to assist and they did a resection with re-enastamosas of the rectum. My surgeons expressed to my family that I must have a very high pain tolerance(I do) to not have been in greater pain/discomfort. I'm not saying I wasn't hurting........All in all things seem to have gone well. They also did a cystoscopy since at one point in the 3-4 hour surgery my urine output decreased. All my female organs were taken out, I am on the mend and taking ibuprofen during the day for pain and percocet at night.I think a few things have helped me with all this: a. I discussed with anesthesia my postop pain control and told them I wanted an epidural. It worked beautifully, and I wasn't gorked out on the morphine pump.b. I'm a nurse and have good connections so I was able to ask for recommendations from friendsc. education/research--find out as much as you can about what you haved..prayer and support from friends and familyI hope this has helped some of you in some small way.

            "answer": "I just had my endometrioma removed last week. You have to be proactive about watching your symptoms. I had noticed mine around Christmas. It felt to me like a bladder infection, and we had been tryign to get pregnant. This wasn't working, so I became suspicious. I went into the doctor on Jan.11th because of lower abdominal pain. He said it felt like my uterus was enlarged, but pregnancy tests came back negative. He just sent me home with an antibiotic. i took it for two weeksand the pain subsided. But it gradually came back. The pain increased, and I started to feel the mass in my lower abdomin. By the first week in march when i went back in because I knew somethign wasn't right..... it had grown to 16cm x 15cm. And could be seen and pushed on. It was found on a Friday and I saw a specialist on Tuesday and had laparoscopy preformed wednesday morning. It had grownso fast that it had crushed\u00a0\u00a0my left ovary and falopian tube and attached itself to multiple places. it had also parcially crushed my right side. They had to reconstruct and shoot dy through to see if it was still open, and then wrap my ovary in a protective coating. Thank goodness, as I am only 28 years old, and was just married 6 months ago. We really want more children, and by waiting so long letting it grow, I almost ruined my chances. They said that the mass was the size of large cantalope. My best advice is to stay on top of your symptoms!!!! they can cause other problems!",

            "answer": "Ive had endometriosis since i was 16. I am now 39 and had to go through surgical cleanup before getting pregnant with both of my kids. Which, by the way, the drs say they are miracle babies. Both were born early but are 13 and 15 now. I had my uterus removed when i was 26 because it was diseased and connected to my bowel and bladderNow i still get endometriomas on my ovaries after all these years. One even ruptured and hemmoraged and had to be repaired. I have a 3 cm one encompassing my right ovary. I have one on my left ovary that was 3 cm but now has leaked onto my bowel and is growing adhesions. The pain at times is unbearable. Yet, i really dread another surgery. It always comes back and i am so tired of dealing with it. I wouldnt mind losing the ovaries but dr says im too young for that. What should i do?",
