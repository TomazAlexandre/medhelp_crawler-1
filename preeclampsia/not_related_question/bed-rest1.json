            "answer": "I had high blood pressure with my daughter, my dr took me out of work and put me on modified bed rest for the third trimester,meaning that I was able to be up and about for a total of 4 hours a day. It worked wonders, I wasn't as stressed, and my blood pressure went down a little wich prevented me from having to go on medication or getting preeclampsia. With this pregnancy my blood pressure seems to be fine, and I just entered my third trimester. Good luck. If the dr says to do it then do it.",

            "answer": "I was on strict bed rest with my first due to preeclamplsia and strongly believe the meds and bed rest helped get my baby to 35wks. This time I've just come home from 2wks strict hospital bedrest after going into preterm labour at 27wks for an unknown reason. I'm supposed to be on bedrest at home but am going slightly nuts as there's a lot I wanted to do before baby arrives. Dr just keeps saying there will be plenty of time for that later, need to focus on getting this one further along. Wishing you lots of luck!",
