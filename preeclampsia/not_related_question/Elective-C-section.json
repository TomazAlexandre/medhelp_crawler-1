            "answer": "I am totally for a natural, vaginal delivery. That is what I did with my son, and I was very happy with my decision. I don't really like hospitals (I know that may sound crazy) So I went to a birthing center instead. I enjoyed every minute and was happy! Now, if I needed to go to the hospital to have a c-section because the baby was is trouble or something like that, I would totally understand. The baby's safety comes first!But (and nothing against women who opt to have a c-section) I just wouldn't be comfortable with it, especially if there is a chance I can deliver vaginally. I mean it is surgery, and there are risks with both c-sections and vaginally deliveries, I just wouldn't choose it \"just because\". I would try everything I could first, and then have that as a last resort. Birth is such a miracle and a beautiful thing! Nothing disgusting about it! (okay so there is some blood and stuff, but it's all a part of the beautiful process) It's the way God intended us to come into this world. But it is great how technology has grown! So many more babies are surviving better now if born too early, than they were years and years ago. Basically for me, it would have to be a last resort, but it's a personal decision.",

            "answer": "I had my son vaginally and while I did recieve an epidural I had the best expierance! I would choose to get cut open to deliver my child! In earlier years c sections were a form of an emergancy surgery because there was something wron or the baby in is a breech or transverse position! Why would you choose that? Plus I have heard it is harder on the baby, because amnoitic fluid is squeezed out when delivered naturally. My point with all this rambling is that I dont understand why you would choose a major surgery????",

            "answer": "I had to have a c-sec at 36 weeks due to preeclampsia. I hated it, and wish i didn't have to go through that again. I would much prefer 24 hours of labor to the WEEKS of recovery. Being unable to care for myself or my newborn was upsetting. I dread not being able to get on the floor and play with my toddler, etc... with the next one. I personally cannot relate to anyone who would elect to have a c-section. The idea that i was cut open still upsets me.as for leighanne- in your case, i probably would have opted for the c-sec the 1st time around, so I am not referring to you in my post. If i was given a 50% chance of being able to have a vaginal, and the symptoms of preeclampsia, i would've opted for the c-sec. I wasn't given the option. I was very very sick, and my dr thought we would most likely end up with a c-sec anyways, which is why i wasn't given the option. Thank goodness too, because by the time I made it to the OR i was so sick I could barely stay awake. For #2, I have no option because my dr doesn't do vbac. He fears the risk of rupture since my uterus never stretched fully the 1st time. I'm glad you had a good experience the last time- gives me hope that this one will be better.",

            "answer": "I had a c-section nine months ago yesterday. My son was breech, and although they can now do an external version (trying to flip the baby) I found out he was breech at 33 weeks, and was delivered at 39. I must say that I did opt for the c-section, I wanted as little medical intervention as possible when I found out I was pregnant, a water birth with no pain meds. I started having contractions at 23 weeks, and at 25 had to be given a shot to stop them, they were five min apart. I did my own research and talked to my doctor and found out only a small percent of the external versions work, and can cause you to immediately go into labor. My cousin had one with her son and went right into labor. I told the doc that I wouldn't do it because he would have been 7 weeks early, he respected my decision and I said also (for any religious ladies) that God made him be breech for a reason and if he didn't flip on his own and I had to have the c-section then maybe that was the way it was meant to be. Who knows, maybe I wouldn't have been able to deliver vaginally...I'll never know, but maybe it was because of my age at the time, 22, that I bounced right back. I was a little tired, but up and walking that same night. My son did have to stay on oxygen over night, but was fine and brought into my room the next day. I do agree with you that if it's \"just because\" c-sections aren't really the way to go. I would have much rather had the natural birth, but I was trying to make the best decision for my first child, and the safest. My choice, in my opinion, kept him in me longer and helped him develop more, instead of coming out early. (the external version, I was told, can only be done up to 36 weeks) By the way, leighanne...my scar is still numb, and my best friend's mom had her by c-section 23 years ago and hers is still numb...",

I think people should do as they feel comfortable- it is afterall THEIR birth experience.I know a woman who just gave birth and elected to go straight to a c-section instead of induction. It was best for her and her unborn baby (she was past due, by the way, and not dilated and has problems with her uterus, so she felt it was the best option).I'm an epidural girl. I want to be able to relax and sleep. I always find I give birth really quickly when I have had an epidural because my body is able to relax. My sister gave birth naturally, without meds, to all of her three daughters.So to each their own! I don't think people should be made to feel badly about their choice... like people telling you that going natural isn't do-able! Going natural is totally do-able and I wish you so much luck!",

            "answer": "I will seem rather harsh but, here it goes....My opinion...I don't agree that anyone should be allowed to have an elective c-section just because of your own petty issues like you think labor is primitive and outdated.\u00a0\u00a0Well there is a major reason why your body delivers naturally and delivering naturally makes for a better recovery and healthier for the baby also, it is a natural process and it works right.\u00a0\u00a0\"If it ain't broke, dont fix it!\" I've even heard that some women want a c-section because they want their baby's head to come out perfectly round instead of pointy (which goes down within a few hours) like during a vaginal delivery.\u00a0\u00a0I've even heard women say that they want to stay \"tight\" down there to please their husbands.\u00a0\u00a0All of these reasons to me seem absolutely ridiculous. And extremely shallow.\u00a0\u00a0Nature is not antiseptic, you are a human being and and belong to the animal kingdom, deal with it.Yes technology has come a long way specially in medicine.\u00a0\u00a0But it has come to this point to prevent complications and even death to the mother or child.\u00a0\u00a0I would gladly go through a c-section if I NEED one, if the baby needs one.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't want to risk my life and the baby's life because I don't believe in it.\u00a0\u00a0However if there's nothing wrong with me or the baby during delivery then I'm pushing him out.C-sections have the potential for some SERIOUS complications, it is a major surgery, they are cutting deep layers into you and moving organs around and putting organs back in and could lead to serious malpractice issues becasue doctors aren't perfect either and sometimes have a bad day.\u00a0\u00a0I woudln't put myself through that if I didn't absolutely have to.Again, my opinion.",

I always throw on a baby story when I fold laundry and I watched one today that featured a woman having her first child who elected for a c-section. She found the act of childbirth to be primative and disgusting. I've seen stories about how this is some new trend, but I was a little shocked.If I need a c-section then so be it I won't be uppset about it. However given the choice I would rather have the non-surgical delivery. I've had surgery on my abdomen 4 times and it hurt for weeks after. The first days after having a baby are so hectic and can be painful as it is without adding to it.As it is now I can't believe the reactions I get from women who think I'm crazy for saying I want to have natural childbirth. The standard is to get an epi, well maybe I don't want one. Pretty soon we might get the same reaction if you tell people you want a vaginal delivery. They'll think you're crazy for not scheduling a c-section.What do you guys think?",
