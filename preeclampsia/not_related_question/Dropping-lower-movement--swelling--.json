            "answer": "I'm 38.5 weeks. My little guy dropped 3 or 4 weeks ago. I honestly haven't noticed any extra swelling. I had some blood pressure problems early and have been working hard to keep both my bp and swelling down. If it's really bothering you, it helps to drink lots of water, avoid sodium and fried foods, and stay active.I also swear by a couple drops of lemon essential oil in a big glass of ice water a couple times a day. If I notice swelling and take lemon oil, it usually disappears completely within an hour or so.",
