            "answer": "My left ankle has always been more swollen that my right. When it gets really hot out, it's almost unrecognizable! ughh.... I have no idea why this is, and it freaked me out at first. My doc said it's nothing to worry about and totally normal. What you want to look out for is severe, sudden swelling of the face or extreme swelling in the hands/feet (like, three times their normal size) because that can signal preeclampsia, etc... Just stay hydrated and try to elevate your feet when you can, and wear comfortable shoes. I've tried ice packs but they didn't do anything, just made me really cold! lol.... staying hydrated is really your best bet. Cankles are unpleasant but there are far worse things, so just keep your eyes on the prize! :)",
