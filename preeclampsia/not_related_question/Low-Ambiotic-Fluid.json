            "answer": "Ok I didn't know anything about this but I just looked it up here's what I got:What causes low amniotic fluid?Birth defects \u2013 Problems with the development of the kidneys or urinary tract which could cause little urine production, leading to low levels of amniotic fluid.Placental problems \u2013 If the placenta is not providing enough blood and nutrients to the baby, then the baby may stop recycling fluid.Leaking or rupture of membranes \u2013This may be a gush of fluid or a slow constant trickle of fluid. This is due to a tear in the membrane. Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) can also result in low amniotic fluid levels.Post Date Pregnancy- A post date pregnancy (one that goes over 42 weeks) can have low levels of amniotic fluid, which could be a result of declining placental function.Maternal Complications- Factors such as maternal dehydration, hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes, and chronic hypoxia can have an effect on amniotic fluid levels.What are the risks of having low amniotic fluid?The risks associated with oligohydramnios often depend on the gestation of the pregnancy. The amniotic fluid is essential for the development of muscles, limbs, lungs, and the digestive system. In the second trimester, the baby begins to breathe and swallow the fluid to help their lungs grow and mature. The amniotic fluid also helps the baby develop muscles and limbs by providing plenty of room to move around. If oligohydramnios is detected in the first half of pregnancy, the complications can be more serious and include:Compression of fetal organs resulting in birth defectsIncreased chance of miscarriage or stillbirthIf oligohydramnios is detected in the second half of pregnancy, complications can include:Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR)Preterm birthLabor complications such as cord compression, meconium stained fluid and cesarean delivery",
