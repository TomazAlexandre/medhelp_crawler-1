            "answer": "I had one pregnancy where I swole so bad it hurt to walk.\u00a0\u00a0I could gently rest my hand anywhere on my leg for a few seconds and i would have a huge impression of my hand.\u00a0\u00a0It didn't matter if I stayed sitting, elevated my legs or walked.\u00a0\u00a0Let me put it this way, after I delivered the doc put me on water pills...in a weeks time I lost over 20 lbs of JUST water weight.\u00a0\u00a0I literally peed like every hour and would wake up numerous times a night to go.\u00a0\u00a0I went from looking plump to looking sickly becuase I lost so much water weight.\u00a0\u00a0So, no, you are NOT alone.\u00a0\u00a0I ALWAYS swell with my pregnancies, but that one was the worst.\u00a0\u00a0I even had to get different shoes becuase my feet were so freakin big.\u00a0\u00a0Is this your first child?\u00a0\u00a0The things I have read sound normal.\u00a0\u00a0Unless you start having swelling in your face and hands and blurred vision there really is no reason to worry.",

            "answer": "Yeah it probably is from extra blood volume and swelling...I never swelled with my daughter, even at the end...but with this one my feet have puffed up and my calves get red and swollen. I went to urgent care the other night for a migraine and my blood pressure was like 150/98..I was freaking out and the doctor was about to admit me for preeclampsia, but then I begged him to take it again because I have NO symptoms and he did and it was 110/62....so it was just a mis-read but I was so freaked out, lol.but GA is right of course, unless your hands and/or face swell and you get blurred vision it's most likely normal, albeit uncomfortable.",

            "answer": "yeah it's very uncomfortable and its' really freaking me out..my inner thighs are so red, sometimes they almost look blue they're that dark.\u00a0\u00a0The swelling is fine as long as i'm not on my feet for long but as soon as i get off work in the evenings it's horrible.\u00a0\u00a0Blood pressure luckily has been fine so far, i'm paranoid and keep checking it though.\u00a0\u00a0Someone else also mentioned it could be a blood clot that's making my innner thighs turn red but it's in both legs so i really doubt that. Anyway ladies thanks for the info. I'm really trying to relax and not worry but when it comes to the health of this baby and me of course (because i have another little girl depending on me)",
