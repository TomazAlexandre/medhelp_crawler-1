            "answer": "Try eating things high in fiber! Idk about anyone else but going to the bathroom gets difficult.\u00a0\u00a0I eat alot of beans which is high in fiber and iron, lentils also high in fiber and iron, I did juices as well which is a great in between meal. Juices with kale, apples blackberries, pineapple, oranges, bananas, and other berries.\u00a0\u00a0Berries are great antioxidants they clean the system very well. My doctor told me not to eat tuna high in mercury and in protein both which is bad for pregnancy if consumed too much. So once a month I make 4 Oz of salmon with brown rice and raw green veggies. I read that salmon has alot of omega 3 which develops the babies brain very well. I'm sorry this is so long, I was a health nut worked for a protein bar company and a gym so I'm into the health and fitness industry! Let me know if u need more food ideas I'll be glad to help!!!",
