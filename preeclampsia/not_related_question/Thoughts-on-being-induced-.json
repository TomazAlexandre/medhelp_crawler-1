            "answer": "Being induced is better to me than an unexpected labor. I was 40.5 wks my last pregnancy, and was induced. I was able to decide if I wanted go natural or take meds. Also, I was able to mentally prepare for the labor, and it wasn't all a rush. It was better to me. Plus my support team had time to call off and make it in time. It took a while for me to dilate, but when I did I had the epidural so not so much pain. It was a nice labor. Good luck! And remember the hard part of pregnancy is the nine months. Labor is the easy part once its over your good!",

            "answer": "I think labor is the hard part (once going into labor myself and once being induced). Yes being pregnant is uncomfortable at times (and almost the whole last tri.) But being induced didn't go well for me. I got my epi and it only eased my contractions....still felt all the back labor (which I didn't have with my first) and all the presure in my pubic area so needless to say after 18hrs I had been in a LOT more pain than my first (and my first I was in labor for two wks) lol. This time I don't want to be induced unless I hv to be (I had to be last time) and I wouldn't recomend it to anyone. To much talk of c-section, bany was under more stress as was I. Its all up to you but I'd research it before hand. Good luck! :)",

Just like labor it's different for everyone.\u00a0\u00a0I am planning v bac this time and refuse to be induced esp since it increases chance of uterine rupture. I would never recommend bEing induced though unless for some reaSon it was deemed medically necessary idk like maybe your 41 weeks + preeclampsia diabetes ect. But not just bc. Babies come out when they are ready.\u00a0\u00a0Our bodies do what they need to usually lol just mean things don't always go our way ;) best of Luck though.",
