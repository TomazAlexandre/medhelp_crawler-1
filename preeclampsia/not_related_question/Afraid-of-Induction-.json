I did get the epidural 7 hours into labor and had my son 2 hours after I got the epidural..",

But the pain is over as soon as you have the baby. That was almost 11 years ago. I'm now 38 weeks with a girl and hoping to go into labor naturally. Good luck. You'll be fine.",

My body could no longer properly nourish my baby and my blood pressure was sky high. That was scary. My Dr said induction was the answer. I went in at 8am and had my son at 3:04pm that same day. It wasn't bad. And my baby was fine. Now he's a perfectly heathy 2 1/2 year old.",

    "question": "I was due on January 21st and I'm a FTM with no signs of labor (dilated to only a 1 for over a month). My doctor says my baby is doing everything she is suppose to but my body isn't responding correctly. Because of this, my doctor has set an induction date of January 28th and I'm terrified! I guess I'm just afraid and hoping someone has a positive story similar to mine. :(",
