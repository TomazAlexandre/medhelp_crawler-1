            "answer": "It can be dangerous to your body to have babies too close together. It can increase your risk of preeclampsia,\u00a0\u00a0gestational diabetes, uterine prolapse,\u00a0\u00a0and other issues - it can also raise the risk of preterm labor and low birth weight in your second baby. These things aren't guaranteed to happen - but the risk factors go way up if you don't wait at least 12-18 months before ttc again.I totally get that your hormones are going WILD right now. Give yourself and your husband a chance to get into a routine, love up on the baby you've just had. Your body needs time to recover. Take your time.Congratulations on your new baby!",

            "answer": "I didnt personally choose to have another baby right away. With my first baby I believe my son was 4mon. When I found out I was expecting our 2nd baby (our daughter). I was definitely excited and filled with joy. My kids are only a yr and wk apart. They are really close, protecting one another, looking for eachother when they dont see thier sibling. They absolutely love eachother and its so darn adorable I love to see them together. I dont know if it smart thing to do we do have our rough days. When one is sick thier both sick. Some days more hectic than others. But definitely worth it all I love my children with everything I have. You will mame the right decision on whatever you choose is best for your family. Good luck hun and just take good care of your body!",

    "question": "I just had my daughter 8 days ago. My husband and I knew we would want 3 or more children, but with this one being out first we figured we would wait until she was 2 or 3 to have another baby. Now that she is here, we desperately want another! She is such a good baby so far and I would love to have another one close in age. We are thinking about trying again in a couple of months. Has anyone else gone through immediate baby fever? Any advice on babies so close in age? Are we crazy?? Thanks in advance.",
