When I get them my stomach gets really hard, like there is a lot of pressure in there, and lasts maybe 30 seconds to a minute and then it eases and goes away. I wasn't sure what they were till my doctor witnessed it! :) But sounds like Braxton Hicks to me, and I am 27w2d.",

I think you are okay, as long as there is no pattern to them or they are not painful. Make sure to drink plenty of fluids too.",
