            "answer": "A few friends of mine have had a miscarriage and a D&C.\u00a0\u00a0They both got pregnant either with the first cycle or the second cycle (depending on when they tried, one tried after\u00a0\u00a0the first and the other after the second).\u00a0\u00a0They both went on to have healthy babies.I was told to wait 3 cycles due to emotional reasons.\u00a0\u00a0After doing a lot of research and talking to friends who've had D&C's found that you really should wait one cycle (although many women have gotten pregnant before the first cycle and have had healthy babies from what I read).From what I read, by giving yourself one cycle that allows your body to make sure it expels anything extra that was in the uterus and also gives you a LMP to help determine due date.\u00a0\u00a0Also I read that fertility monitors aren't accurate before the first cycle because you could still have hormones in your body from the miscarriage.As of now, my husband and I plan on waiting a cycle before trying, because emotionally I couldn't bare not to be pregnant and have another child.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I made an apt to meet with a midwife this time around to see If I want to use her as a dr this next time around, I plan to ask her opinion on when to TTC as well.\u00a0\u00a0That apt is on the 23rd.When I asked my last dr (OB) why 3 cycles and what if we tried before he basically said that if I did for some reason have a miscarriage that I would blame it on not waiting long enough to try.Honestly, if you are healthy and had no other miscarriages (this was your first) then I've heard that it's not as big of a deal, however some women have other health issues and do need to wait longer to try again.\u00a0\u00a0Also if its past the 12 weeks that the baby passes then I've heard you do need to wait longer as well.",

            "answer": "Hi, I had a miscarriage 3 wks ago, they told me to wait until 2 cycles as the 1st one is always not a true period and waiting for the 2nd one can determin the due date better. I had a natural miscarriage and after the scan they told me everything looked bk to norm. I am hoping my period will be here nxt wk and we are not waiting for 2 cycles we are going to try as soon as I\u00a0\u00a0have had my 1st cycle as I know I will only be happy again once I am pregnant. However it is different for each person, it depends on if your miscarriage was natural or not, whether everything has passed and is bk to norm and abut you as awhol i.e. how you are coping etc so I suppose only you know how you feel emotionally but physically is all back tonormal inside after the scan?",

            "answer": "I'm okay I think. I haven't cried in 2 days which seems silly to some people but I have cried so much lately. I feel fine. I am now just spotting. I know I passed the sac on the first day b/c I actually saw it. It was mortifying but then again, I was glad to know that part had passed. The doctor said I needed to come in for weekly HcG tests to make sure my levels are dropping properly & the day after the sac had passed my levels had gone down more than half. I am hoping next Monday when I go in they'll be down even lower. I don't want to wait if it's only due to emotions. I have been more than ready. We weren't actively trying when we last got pregnant but we weren't using precautions either. Now that this has happened, we are more than ready to try again. I was just curious to what others have gone through. Again, this was mt only miscarriage with no warning signs until the ultrasound showed an empty sac. The only thing I worry about it the lasting effect of the Misoprostol that I was prescribed to induce contractions. I didn;t have a D&C so I don;t know how much \"healing\" my body would need.\u00a0\u00a0I;'m so sorry for your loss. I know how hard it is. Most people have been wonderful but I really appreciate hearing from people who actually experienced it as well. I keep trying to tell myself it could be worse but I want so badly to speed up time so we can be pregnant again. Good luck. Keep me posted. And thanks for replying.",

            "answer": "I just thought I would update you on the past week of what I've learned etc.\u00a0\u00a0I meet with a midwife and she said that after a D&C you should wait 2 cycles (I'm sure it's different if you didn't have the D&C since they scrape out the lining during the D&C).\u00a0\u00a0so far I've heard three different stories from three different dr's.\u00a0\u00a0The first said 3 cycles, the second said 2 cycles, and the third said to wait one normal cycle (Told by the dr who did my follow up apt).My husband and I feel comfortable waiting to try once I get my next period as It should be here some time this week due to when I believe I ovulated.\u00a0\u00a0That would put us at one normal cycle.I'm glad your feeling better and I understand the need/want to just try again.\u00a0\u00a0Did you like your dr?\u00a0\u00a0I guess after the past few weeks I think the best advice that I got and took to heart was to talk to a dr (if it's the last one or a new one) and see what they'll do to help me feel better during the next pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Since you had the miscarriage I'm sure you'll be worrying the entire time, try to find a place that helps make you feel more comfortable.\u00a0\u00a0The midwife (A certified nurse midwife) that I meet with I have decided I really like.\u00a0\u00a0Once I find out I'm pregnant I'll be seeing her as soon as they get me in.\u00a0\u00a0She has evening hours so they work with my work schedule.\u00a0\u00a0She also does an ultrasound at every apt if she doesn't hear the heartbeat (that's the gold ticket item for me!).\u00a0\u00a0She also has the first visit an hour, and every other one 30 min so that way she gives you more personal time.\u00a0\u00a0After meeting with her I'm not as scared about the next pregnancy (don't get me wrong, I'm still scared to death, but feel safer I guess).Also, after talking to the dr's it sounds like if you miscarry naturally there really is just an emotional reason to wait.\u00a0\u00a0They give at least a little time due to in a D&C they actually scrape the lining, so after one cycle it flushes out anything left behind as well as starts to give a new plush lining.\u00a0\u00a0After two or three cycles it gets more plush.",

            "answer": "I have gotten the same run around from various people as well. Its so hard to get a straight answer but I guess that's partially due to us all being different. My doctor originally said one cycle. I was okay with that at first because at the time, I felt so overwhelmed. I talked to my sister in-law who happens to be a nurse & she said, with a natural miscarriage or one using the medication to induce labor, they recommend a month but that's usually only to better date the new pregnancy as well as for emotional reasons. I wasn't sure how I felt then. My doctor has been having me come in weekly for HcG blood draws to monitor the levels. The day after the initial passing of the sac (sorry for graphics) my HcG levels was already down to the 2300s, The following Monday, my HcG was already to 36. Last week it was at 6 and then this past Monday, I was finally at 0.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse who called me to give me the final blood results asked if I had had a period yet, which I haven't, and then said I should expect one soon. That was two days ago. I am kind of nervous for my period only because I have heard the 1st one following a miscarriage can be more intense than ones we have become accustomed to having.\u00a0\u00a0But I am excited to have it come so I can feel normal. The nurse also said \"Good luck, you can go ahead & try again!\" knowing that I still haven't had a period. So I don't know. My husband is really nervous & wants to wait until the period because of the medication that I took to induce labor since I was unable to miscarry on my own. He's afraid that there might be lingering effects of the medication in my body that could potentially cause harm to a new baby should be get pregnant again quickly. I have been having my blood monitored so I know there's not but it's hard for us both, emotionally I guess. I don't know what we're going to do. Part of me wants badly to get pregnant again to move on but then part of me is worried & scared. I don't want to get all hyped up & actively start trying only to be disappointed if it doesn't happen right away but it's so hard to not chart my ovulation. I never had trouble conceiving in the past but this time, I'm just more nervous. I don't have an actual appt with my doctor until January 21st so until then, I'm just going to see what happens & hope for my period to come.Keep me posted Cocacolapanda on your progress & success. I wish you the best!!!",

I wondered though, when was your D&C?\u00a0\u00a0I just wondered how long it took before your period came. Still no sign of mine coming even though the nurse said it would be here any day.Hopefully, just like you said, this is bringing you a new beginning. I am always excited to hear peoples success stories so please keep me posted. A woman I work with had a D&C in late October, & is already 6 weeks pregnant so basically, she got pregnant immediately following her D&C. That gives me hope too.I can't believe I am excited for my period as normally I would be dreading it but I just hope it gets here soon!\u00a0\u00a0I will be checking here these next few weeks to see if you've success has progressed.

My miscarriage was on Dec. 6th, so mine\u00a0\u00a0hasn't been a month yet & my cycles are usually around 29-30 days so maybe this next week I'll have one but who knows, it could take weeks. I hope not though!\u00a0\u00a0I tried to track my ovulation after the miscarriage b/c they say you're more fertile after one but then I've also ready that its very decieving b/c the tests might say you are ovulating & your not really. Since I haven't had my period, I might just focus on trying to lose some more weight. That's what I think is most unfair about the miscarriage b/c since it was my 2nd pregnancy (I have a beautiful 5 yr old daughter from a previous marriage) my body took on pregnancy weight real quick. It was hard for me to hide being pregnant b/c as my doctor explained, my uterus went into pregnancy mode from remembering when I was pregnant before so it explanded & I started gaining weight. Now that I have lost the pregnancy, I still have the weight. Not fair at all. So I think I will put all my energies into losing that so I don't drive myself crazy waiting for a period.\u00a0\u00a0How many weeks did it take before your came?\u00a0\u00a06-8?\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering since I'm not as far along in this process as you are.

I want to be a mommy so badly, I didn't want to wait. I've read so much that people actually get pregnant almost straight after a m/c as you are them most fertile and many woman say that they either delivered healthy babies and had normal pregnancies and stuff.Although we started to ttc I am not telling anyone or going to the doc, I would like to just find out by suprise if or when I am pregnant, also staying away from pregnancy test as it feels heavy stressfull to get a negative all the time.I am taking things easy day by day, taking vitamins, cutting out on the caffiene ect.Thanks to all of you!!!xx",

Last time, I went in at 6 weeks for an ultrasound to date the pregnancy (which they can be off by 2 weeks either way because we're all different) and from that point on I felt like I was being jerked around a lot. I had appt. after appt. & test after test & 2 weeks later it was over. I was a wreck after all of that so I figured if I make it to 8-9 weeks w/o any bleeding or abnormalities, I'll then make an appt. to go in. I'm kind of nervous to go in too since they originally recommended that we wait until after 1 cycle to try again & we didn't. Honestly though, we didnt use protection twice. More times we used protection so the fact that we actually got pregnant amazes me.\u00a0\u00a0I want to get excited but I'm afraid to let myself.

I asked to have the scan put off just because I didnt want to go too early & then be told that I have to come back again like last time. So I went in on Monday to have my blood checked & it was 3112 & then Wednesday I went in & it was 5507.\u00a0\u00a0The #'s didnt double. The doctor's office didn;t seem to be concerned wioth it & even said that I don't need to come in for more testing until after my ultrasound on February 3rd. I'm trying hard not to worry but I keep reading that HcG levels need to double & mine rose 76% but then didnt double. Does anyone have any experience with this?",

It was harder for her to see anything considering that I am not very far along but she explained everything she was seeing. I don't know if I heard anything she said until she said \"Oh did you see that flickering? Thats the baby.\"\u00a0\u00a0I think it was the 1st time I took a breath while laying on the table. She told me to empty my bladder & get undressed so she could do the transvaginal ultrsound. There she took a lot more pics, checked my ovaries to ensure there was no eptopic pregnancy & then showed us a more clear picture of the gestational sac, yolk sac & baby. She then turned on the machine & we heard the heartbeat!\u00a0\u00a0It was 161.\u00a0\u00a0I am still very nervous & won't feel better until after I make it past the 13th week.

Nothing could go wrong or I could have those potential problems. That appt was set up back in early January so its been along time coming. 1 m/c in between that time and possible another pregnancy. I feel really lucky to have the OB I have. When I went in for a consultation with him back in Jan he didn't rush me, didn't sugar coat anything, and reassured me of some of my fears about trying again(body going through so many changes in the past 3 yrs with the arthritis, being alittle older approaching 30 and just a feeling like its not going to be as easy as it was the first 2 times)",

I feel like life kinda came up & kicked in the gut out of no where. I never saw it coming. But it did & I poured myself into research. I looked on line at various stories, I wanted to make myself more knowledgeable so I was better prepared the next time around. I decided that doctors are wonderful but its still called a \"practice\" for a reason. I wanted to make sure I knew my body better so when ANYTHING happened, I would be in the best position. And that's the advice I want to extend to you. Its okay to grieve, but try not to let it get the best of you. Once you feel emotionally ready & physically ready then focus on getting your body prepared to handle another pregnancy. Try not to look back at what you did before or didn't so, the past is the past & focus on the future & how to get a healthy baby. It will make the grieving process so much easier.",

We all know how you feel. Since you had a d/c this time it may take your uterus longer to recover since they scrape your uterus. Usually the recovery time before you can start to have sex again is 2weeks. But I'm not a doctor. I always say you know your body better than anyone else. Listen to it. If your ready to have sex again then do it. But as for ttc you should try to wait one cycle to give your uterus a chance to heal. But I know how hard it is to have to wait.

            "answer": "ambercuevas - For most pregnancy tests they require 25-50 levels for hCG, if the test was 25 and you got a very faint test, then after three days they'd be 50, so if you use the same brand (or another that gets levels of 25, you can google it to find the hCG levels for HPT), then you should get a very clear line because you defiantly have the 25 + hCG they'd require.\u00a0\u00a0Also when you see that a test is up to 25 for hCG, they usually detect a lesser amount, but at least 25.\u00a0\u00a0And yes, miscarrying at 3 weeks, there's a good chance your cycle could be back to normal and get pregnant very early.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!\u00a0\u00a0Hope it really is positive!\u00a0\u00a0Let us know how it turns out!ttcagain1977 - yeah, natural is the way to go if your body will do it.\u00a0\u00a0Some dr's will say you need to wait, but since it happened naturally, your body will be ready to get pregnant when ever.\u00a0\u00a0Since you stopped bleeding 2/15 (yesterday) then keep an eye out for ovulation, it can help you know if and when.\u00a0\u00a0Look for Egg White Cervical Mucus, and the like.\u00a0\u00a0If you ovulate, then your levels will be down to where they need to be.I'm feeling OK, I'm finding it hard to eat much early in the day.\u00a0\u00a0I'm dizzy a lot, and very tired.\u00a0\u00a0The cravings have been pretty weird too.\u00a0\u00a0I've been wanting a lot of fried chicken, Well chicken in general, and I\"m not a fried chicken kind of person.\u00a0\u00a0I also can't eat sushi, even the smell of it makes me sick.\u00a0\u00a0Overall It's been a pretty normal pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, the mood swings have been HORRIBLE!I did have a nice relaxing time yesterday after work.\u00a0\u00a0I was going to go to the gym with a friend, but she got sick, and DH and DS were at my mother in law's, so I just stayed home, had a nice healthy supper and went on the treadmill for a little bit.\u00a0\u00a0Not too fast, because I didn't want to get out of breath.\u00a0\u00a0I decided to try walking bare foot because I read it's better for the body (you need to start out slow though).\u00a0\u00a0And it was actually more comfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I got a good workout for my leg mussels, and didn't get too fast.\u00a0\u00a0Also, my knees didn't hurt at all.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway I need to get to work, I'll try to keep an eye on this form, but defiantly post about my next apt on the 3rd!",

I am still peeing like crazy. My breast are bigger and heavier. Not that much tingling in my breast anymore. I still get cramps off and on. I had a b-ball game yesterday and I just felt heavy. I don't feel tired only when I work out I feel alittle exausted and I work out 3-4 times a week. I have lost 1.4lbs which is great for me. I don't want to gain 50+ lbs like I had with my 2 daughters. Even though I lost all that weight with them. I'm older now and I know it would be hard to lose that much. Good luck to the ones that haven't gotten their BFP yet.

I was told it was a normal one and did not require a d&c\u00a0\u00a0because my body will pass it out on its own. I spotted everday with only 4 days of no spotting from the time of the m/c to March 23. each time i didn't m/c hubbie and I had sex and each time i spotted the next day.march 23 i started to clot. i called the doctor and he told me it was normal and I could be exericing my first period. then on March 24-27 the clots were getting bigger and bigger from a peanut size to larger then a plum and i am not kidding. I started to take photos of each clot so when i called on friday March 26 to my doctor he called me in his office. I showed him the photos of the clots and he was just shocked..he did an u/s and there was alot of stuff in there (including one fibriod) he then did an physical exam and pulled out so much clot i almost died looking at it. he said i was hemergin and to get to the ER for an emg. d&c. I was just in shocked.today he called me to make sure i was ok. he said everthing should be in order now. he did a suction d&c and did a scope to see what kind of fibroid i had. he gave me a name for forgot but it was the kind that is between the tissues of my uterious and on the right side.I really wanted to have more kids. i am 35 and i have one son age 17. my hubbie has no children and we both wanted to have at leaset 2 or 3 more...by the looks of things it looks kind of dim... anyone out there in the same boat of heard anything like my situation? I never received an d&c when i m/c back in Feb. so does that mean I will ov or have a period now? anyone know when? I was 7 wks when i m/c and my cycle was always 28 days. as of Monday 22 my HcG was at 7 and I did a test today to see if i am down to 0. I woudn't know until tomorrow for that result. I am so confuse of what to experct anymore!",

            "answer": "I am so sorry to hear about what you had to go through in the past month. I haven't heard of this happening but I'm sur eit probably has. I didn't have a period after the natural miscarriage and I was able to get pregnant right away. You had a d/c so your body needs time to recover and build the lining back up so another pregnancy will stick. Is this your first m/c? I think since you were able to get pregnant before then it shouldn't be an issue again and miscarriages are so common and a lot of times happens one time for many people. I think in your situation your symptoms didn't present as being serious in the beginning of your m/c so your doc thought you would m/c on your own. It's unfortunate that it did linger on for so long which made things more complicated and difficult. Don't give up hope. Listen to your body. When you feel ready then try again. Take care and keep us posted.\u00a0\u00a0SSBD",

    "question": "I recently suffered a miscarriage at 8 weeks. I induced the expelling of the tissue by getting a prescription for Misoprostol to help speed the situation. My body was not recognizing that the pregnancy wasn't viable. I cried for 2 days straight before deciding on taking the medication vs. the D&C. My doctor said we could start trying\u00a0\u00a01 month or after my first AF.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone gotten pregnant before them & had success?\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if they recommend that you wait for medical healing reasons or if it's due to emotional issues.
