            "answer": "Yes, i was able to breastfeed immediately. Tell your OB and the hospital that you want to BF. Normally, they take the baby to the nursery while you're being closed up. As long as the babies are healthy (i guess in your case not too early either), they can keep the babies in the OR and then they can come to recovery with you. Ideally, babies should latch on as soon as possible. With twins, that may not be possible.My first was 4 weeks early. She was brought to the nursery while i was being closed up to make sure that everything was fine. I was very sick due to preeclampsia and HELLP, so i didn't actually try to BF until the next day. My second was a scheduled C-sec because my dr doesn't do vbac. Since the situation was not an emergency, things went smoother. They kept the baby in the OR while i was being closed. My OB told them to. The assisting surgeon was a bit of a d!ck about it, making comments about have a screaming baby in there for so long. But once i was closed up, they put the baby between my legs and wheeled her into recovery with me where we latched her immediately.If your little ones are early, they may have trouble nursing. My first had this problem. It may be a good idea to have the name of a LC or your LLL on hand. While you are in the hospital they should be able to provide you with lactation consultants. It's great to have a good LC on standby for questions once you get home. They may also be able to give you advice in advance to increase your chances of successfully nursing twins, which IS possible despite the fact that i am sure many people will tell you is not. Also, educate yourself in advance by taking a breastfeeding class. If your little guys are early or jaundiced (jaundice is common), the hospital may want to supplement. You do NOT have to let them use a bottle with a nipple! The nurses at my hospital tried to do that but I insisted on finger feeding (with the support of the LC) which helped prevent nipple confusion or bottle preference.",

            "answer": "Thanks for all the info. My cousin's wife lives close by and she went into labor early, so her son was in an incubator in the NICU for 3 weeks. she made an appointment with the LC when she went to take him home from the hospital. While she was waiting for the LC she opened her shirt and opened her nursing bra. She said her son was near the breast and reached up and latched on on his own. When the LC consultant came in she said \"Oh I see you've got it.'I am glad to hear about your situations and how you worked them out. I hope to have a manageable time of it and have even been looking at the twin nursing pillows! My husband is going to take a week off to get the babies to me to BF and my mom is going to help me the week after that and I am hoping to master simotanious nursing which is suposedly the most managable way with twins.",

            "answer": "Just a note...I know its optimal to get to BF within an hour to 90 min after birth. However, I was a high risk c-section (heart condition), so I had to stay in recovery with an external pacemaker and monitors and stuff for about 4 hours. So I didnt' get to see my son until after I left recovery.\u00a0\u00a0And he took to it just fine.\u00a0\u00a0It took a little bit of doing, since he was sleepier at that point, but he's a little over 3 weeks old, and we havent' had any issues since. So, even if you don't get to see the baby right away for some reason, don't think that you wont' be able to breastfeed.\u00a0\u00a0Just be persistant!And if you do end up having the c-section, my recommendation is to get up AS SOON as you are allowed to. I was unhooked from my catheter, and anything else they would let me be unhooked from within around 12 hour, and had my baby in the room with me overnight. That way I was up and moving as much as possible. All of my nurses said they couldn't believe how well I was moving, and they attributed it to the fact that I made sure to move around. Don't overdo it, but don't just lay in bed either. It'll make it much more painful later.",

I will make sure the my dr. and everone giving me anstesia or medication know that I am going to be breastfeeding. And I wiil have my obgyn check the position of my babies on the big day.
