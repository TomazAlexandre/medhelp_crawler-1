            "answer": "Beka,Since no one's answered you yet, I'll put in my two cents worth. First, let me say, that I've not been diagnosed yet. Crohn's is suspected, and on Monday I go in for an endoscopy+colonoscopy where they'll perform a few tissue biopsies of the lining of the colon.What you have _could_ be Crohn's disease. I imagine they'll want to do tests like I just mentioned to determine the cause.You can have arthritic joint pain with Crohn's. Mouth sores are common with Crohn's. The white spots on your skin _may_ be psoriasis (skin rashes are common with Crohn's). Rectal/anal fistulas also occur with Chrohn's when it presents in the lower colon and rectum.I was originally diagnosed with IBS, but when I saw a gastroenterologist last week, she immediately said that this did not sound like IBS.I know its hard to wait on doctor appointments and test results, but I think you're going to have to try and be patient and wait for the gastroenterologist, and see what they say.Hope this helps some.Take care.Mar",

            "answer": "HiI wouldn't like to diagnose you, as i am no doctor, however what you have described is exactly what i have and had when i was rushed to hospital, my doctor rushed me in after i couldn't stop being sick and was complaining of lower right side pain, she thought burst apendix, after 6 days (they thought it was a gynie issue as i had just had a baby), of every other possible cause i was confirmed crohns. apparently pregnancy eases the symptoms, but after you give birth you likely to have a flare up.I hope that helps.",

    "question": "I have always been tagged with \"IBS\".\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms started in my early 20's(pain, sometimes severe, constipation, bloating gas etc...) but late 20's to early 30's I had a lot of relief from symptoms while having my three children. (all c sections because of PIH/preeclampsia in my first...which led to a crash c-section.)Here I am two years out from having my third and last child and the last year has been miserable.\u00a0\u00a0I started having diarrhea about 8 months ago, almost daily.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of abdominal pain and cramping.\u00a0\u00a0Weight fluctuates...sometimes I lose 10 lbs in a short amount of time without trying, but then again, I\u00a0\u00a0just recently gained about that amount back in a short amount of time...with no change to diet etc...I'm still on the average to small side as far as my size goes.\u00a0\u00a0I had a rectal/anal fistula that I finally had diagnosed (after months of symptoms) last fall, and fistulectomy about three months ago...still healing from it.\u00a0\u00a0(it started to form a secondary abcess during healing, so I had a second smaller procedure in the office to stop the infection)\u00a0\u00a0The colo-rectal surgeon only dealt with that, there was no discussion of underlining issues/disease causing it.\u00a0\u00a0I have mouth ulcers in my mouth in cycles every 1-2 months...one time i had more than a dozen in there.\u00a0\u00a0But usually it's anywhere from 1-3 at a time, always accompanied by low grade fever and swollen glands.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the ER 2 weeks ago for sharp lower right abdominal pain (was thinking it was female related because they found an ovarian cyst.)\u00a0\u00a0But the follow up with the OB/GYN says he doesn't think it's related to the female organs at all (he re-examined everything and felt no cyst on the ovary etc..)\u00a0\u00a0The severe pain lasted about a week.Anyway, these are the kind of things I have been dealing with for the last year, more often than not...just miserable...and my body just hurts all over too. (MRI a little over a year ago on my back shows degenerative changes in the lumbar area)\u00a0\u00a0So I found a new doc today.\u00a0\u00a0Internal medicine doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I shared with him all my symptoms and (oh i also have white spots forming on my skin, like I am turning albino or something...and something else on my skin they couldn't identify so they are sending me to a dermatologist.) anyway, he brought up Crohn's disease as being what he is most concerned about right now.\u00a0\u00a0So he referred me to GI doc, but also to a Rheumatologist and Dermatologist and he also did a ton of blood work today.To those of you who suffer with Crohn's does this sound to you like it could be that??\u00a0\u00a0I thought no one better to ask then someone who actually has it.",
