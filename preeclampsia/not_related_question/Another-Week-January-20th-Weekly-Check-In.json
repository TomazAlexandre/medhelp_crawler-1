            "answer": "I have not much new to report. I am still having lots of BH and or contractions. I have a doctors appt tomorrow for an U/S and an internal exam to figure out if i am dilated more and Logan's position. According to my family, my belly is dropping and i am noticing the pressure in my body getting lower and lower. Add to that the dizzy spells are back. So now i no longer drive anywhere. Everyone thinks Logan will make his appearance at the beginning of Feb.On this past Sunday i had my baby shower. It was great we got so much and only have a little left to get. Its amazing and overwhelming to think that he is coming anytime now and that we are preparing his room. His room is about 75% done we are just finishing some final decorating things. His back is just about done being packed for the hospital and mine will be done tonight.My last day of work is 1/30. With all the pain and the dizziness the DH and I decided that the 2 extra weeks would be good. Plus we may go early anyways. So for now i get driven in and out of work because of being dizzy and don't want to cause any accidents.Thats all for now. Updates will be up tomorrow after the doctors appt and U/S.Good luck all,Jonelle",

            "answer": "I'm just over the 37 week mark. Feeling pretty miserable most days, but some days are good. I think taking care of a 21 month old is to blame on that! LOLI have an appt today to see if I've dilated at all...which I'm keeping my fingers crossed!Claire is moving around a LOT, and will suddenly press on my bladder to the point I have to freeze for fear I'll pee myself. Everyone says it looks like I've swallowed a basketball because she is right out there in front (I was more \"rounded\" when I carried Levi). Even the doctor told me last week that I am ALL baby this time around. So I guess that's a good thing! Hopefully I won't have to work as hard at losing the weight this time.Other than that, it's the usual...peeing every 1 to 1 1/2 hours each night, hips hurting every hour, can barely roll over, can barely get out of bed, and having a really hard time shaving my legs! LOL And acid reflux rears its ugly head constantly, which makes Tums Smoothies my best friend again.I think that's about it on my end. I'm just so glad we're near the end! Good luck to everyone!",

            "answer": "I'm so excited for everyone!I had a routine appointment yesterday, where I met with an OB instead of one of my midwives, and I didn't care for him at all. When I told him I wanted to try going natural, he burst out laughing, and sat there giggling for like 5 minutes about how he heard that all the time, and then spent another 10 minutes trying to talk me out of it. Not a very favorable impression, but I really love the midwives there.I'm still only having occasional braxton hicks, which is a little discouraging. Terrible pubic pain at night.....like Hope said, rolling over in bed, getting out of bed, and shaving are all pretty excruciating right now! But I think the worst thing is the Restless Leg Syndrome I started experiencing last week.....it's AWFUL, is anyone else struggling with this?? I've had a terrible time getting to sleep at night because of it....I just found out my sister had problems with it too, and I know it's supposed to run in families. Anybody have any suggestions on coping with it? I read that it's sometimes linked to low iron, but I'm taking in tons of iron, and my levels were fine two weeks ago. Do you think I should ask to be tested again?Anyway, I can't wait till things get going...I'm due in two weeks, but if she is two weeks late, I am looking at the possibility of being pregnant for almost another month, which is an extremely discouraging thought right now. I'm so jealous of all of you who have stuff happening! I know my time will come sooner or later.",

The doc tells me that unless she does a full evaluation of me with another 24 hour urine and bloodwork to see if they get the same results than there will be no induction. She says she does not induce at 38 weeks unless absolutely necessary because of lung development. I then told her that 4 weeks ago I had teh steriod shots for lungs...and she said that she would leave a note for the doc that I am seeing in office on friday to check on things with me..and that we will see from there. Im just frustrated because I was so excited that I finally knew that next week would be it...and then for her to shoot my spirits down the drain. I literally started crying when I got off the phone.I am done being pregnant. I am done going for tests 2-3 times a week.

I thought for SURE that I would have had my little boy by now but I guess he's going to come when he's good and ready. I feel great though, so I can't complain. I get a little uncomfortable at night when I sit too long and I've been getting more BH contractions..stronger ones too. So I know its my body just prepping itself. So I'm just as anxious as ever! I'm sleeping fantastic, passing right out, peeing every couple hours but still sleeping awesome. My appetite has increased these last couple weeks but I've also been getting really BAD acid reflux...it burns and makes me want to yack! So on one hand I'll be hungry, on the other I won't want to eat because of the aftermath. I've had my days too where I am just completely exhausted but for the most part I am bouncing around getting the house ready for Caidens arrival.Oh yea and Caiden is still soo very active! I don't know if he still has room in there or what but he is always moving around..or punching and kicking!So just waiting and waiting!Were in the process of interviewing Pediatricians right now and we haven't found one we like. I think I'm being too picky..its such a tough and important decision! Other than that, just looking forward to my Ultrasound on Friday, finding out his weight, position and hopefully a lot more information! I just can't believe I'll be 39 weeks in 3 days!! The end is near!!Hang in there girls! Let me hear your updates :)",
