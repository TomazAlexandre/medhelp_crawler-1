            "answer": "It is unusual to be so swollen so early, if that's what it was. But if you say you gained 10lbs since seeing her it might just be the added weight. Honestly if you dont notice it and you feel fine otherwise she was probably just seeing that. Ask your husband if he thinks you look swollen, as he's a more accurate judge and if YOU think youre swelling then call your Dr. It can be a sign of preeclampsia, but I wouldn't stress too much. Just keep an eye out and pay attention",

I was just trying to say that if youre not feeling well and are worried about it to get it checked out, if for nothing more than piece of mind! I'm sure youre fine, your body's going through crazy changes in a short amount of time and when people don't see you for awhile its more noticeable than you, who sees yourself every day you know?
