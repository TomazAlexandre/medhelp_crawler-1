    "question": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0I asked this question previously and wanted to re post b/c I think it got lost.\u00a0\u00a0:)\u00a0\u00a0I am 15 wks pregnant and have noticed a cloudy urine for the past week or so.\u00a0\u00a0I have no symptoms of any kind of infection. (pain, discomfort, etc)\u00a0\u00a0Is is possible for this to still be a bladder infection?\u00a0\u00a0I have started drinking more liquids, in case the cloudiness was caused by dehydration, and so in the past few days I have had more frequent urination.\u00a0\u00a0I know frequent urination is also a sign of a UTI, but there is no pain associated with it.\u00a0\u00a0If this is an infection, what harms can this do to the baby and what are the treatments for it?\u00a0\u00a0I have a regular dr. appt tomorrow anyway and I will definitely ask him...I just wanted a heads up on what might be causing the cloudy urine!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much!Amy",
