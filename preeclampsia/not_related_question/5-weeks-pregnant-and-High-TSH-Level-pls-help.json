            "answer": "hi Kousiki,The very same thing happened to me. I had my blood tested around 4 weeks gestation and my TSH was at 10. My T4 was slightly low, though still within normal range. I started medication around 5 weeks, right after I got my results.I was in a complete panic at first and consulted 3 doctors, all of whom reassured me that the risks were very, very low as long as I was medicated from that point on. They basically told me to forget about it and enjoy my pregnancy.Thyroid function is most important in the first 12 weeks because the fetus does not make its own thyroid hormones and relies on its mother's supply. If hypothyroidism is left UNTREATED throughout pregnancy, the risks include miscarriage, preeclampsia, low birthweight and premature delivery. Treatment will reduce that risk. Some studies have concluded that hypothyroidism in early pregnancy may lead to a baby with a lower IQ (the keyword being MAY). Even among those, the difference in IQ was not that significant and in some studies, the children born to hypothyroid mothers did catch up by a certain age. One study I read suggested that the lower IQ was actually linked with prematurity, since hypothyroid mothers were more likely to have premature deliveries.There are lots of conflicting studies on the matter and what you read on the internet will almost certainly scare you, like it scared me. It's always better to ask your doctor than read stuff online! Try not to worry and be assured that if you are treated, things will more than likely be perfectly fine! I am now 30 weeks and things are progressing exactly as they should be...",
