I would just decorate and do the Christmas things that make you happy with your daughter and don't even try to include him if he's not into it. I know it probably hurts but that's the best you can do. He should be bending over backwards for you right now but you can't force him to. Why doesn't he want to be in the OR with you when you have the baby?",

The doctor will explain that he wont see anything he doesn't want to.\u00a0\u00a0And it doesnt make you look like the bad guy for nagging him :) I have a hubby who is equally as stubborn and can I tell him something (regarding medical issue), but he wont believe me until he hears it from a professionals mouth.And put the tree up where you want it and he can be a bloody grump on his own :)",

You have been going through daily discomforts and hardships for the last nine months! And it's YOUR body that they are doing the surgery on, not his! Seriously, , the least he can do is be there.

Im just trying to forget bout everything hes saying n deal with everything one day at a time. I think i might talk to the dr on the 20th n make him go in with me so he can hear it from the dr. I wish men had to go through everything we go through. I told him he couldnt last 9 months being pregnant. He said he could.\u00a0\u00a0Id like to see him go 9 months carrying a baby with fibromyalgia and high risk for preeclampsia n any other problems that could happen or diseases that ppl deal with on a daily pregnant or not",

Im the type of person who hates holidays. I was finally gettin in the christmas spirit n wantin to do a lil tree n some other christmas stuff. He wants to be the scrooge n wants a lil 3ft white spiral outdoor tree for in the house cuz it just folds up. I said no its not goin to happen. So he starts talkin bout how he hates holidays n hates christmas n christmas is just another way to waste money. I told him to go somewhere else with that. My freakin birthday is on christmas. And my daughters is the day after. N im having a c section on the 27. He better start liking christmas....im so mad i wanna cry n actually sittin here trying to hold them back.
