I remember going to a dr. appt. with my best friend who is ( 5'2 215), and she asked if she should loose weight before trying to conceive, and her doctor told her, it wasn't that big of an issue, as long as she was healthy and didnt have any major health problems... i am def. finding a new dr. he has been really reluctant to refer me to an RE, to help me see what is going on with me....",

            "answer": "That is sad! You aren't very overweight at all. Sometimes I think it's just an excuse for docs to push losing weight on people. Yes, it is better to be healthy and fit when you get pregnant, it lessens the risks of gest diabetes, preeclampsia and all those things. But many people have perfectly healthy pregnancies that are overweight. The only thing I would notice is if you have any signs of polycystic ovarian syndrome and insulin resistance. I have that and I'm not overweight, but many people with larger abdomens have this insulin resistance, which can cause miscarriages. It caused my to have 3 before I figured it out and got on metformin. Signs of this are irregular cycles, facial hair and other hair in weird places, infertility, miscarriages, and many more. I only have irregular cycles, but they found my blood sugars a little out of wack and insulin levels high. Just something to think about!",

I am 5'3 and weigh 140 , i am not extremely overweight... i could shed a few pounds, but overall, the weight is well distributed. Could being overweight really cause my m/C's?\u00a0\u00a0 I just feel like he almost attacked me with it, it has never come up before, and this is my 4th m/c.... has anybody ever heard anything like this before?",
