            "answer": "Baby could also be sitting on your optic nerve. My hubby did that to his mom. She had to get coke bottle lens glasses pregnant with him and has had perfect eyesight the rest if her life.But since vision changes can be a sign of PIH/preeclampsia/toxemia (whichever you wanna call it) I would call your Dr as soon as you can. If you do develop other symptoms (swelling of your hands and/or face, sudden weight gain, throbbing headache, etc) I would call labor and delivery or go to the hospital too get checked out. It can be very dangerous for you and baby left untreated.",
