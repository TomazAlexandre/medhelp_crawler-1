I'm 37 weeks today and my due date is August 17th.And why would they be inducing you at 39 weeks? Are you high risk?",

            "answer": "Don't worrie i went in to labor and delivery for the same thing at (on a Sunday) 37 weeks 5days and nothing no dilation. Anyways on that Wednesday i had a regular ob appointment and i was 2cm dilated!\u00a0\u00a0That didnt meen much since most women can be dilated and not go into labour till there due date. My mom was at 4cm with her last and didnt even know it. When they schedule to induce you they will do it if you've gone over ur due date or a medical problem or for the daye u were due. Personally i would wait because ive herd being indused is more painfull than going in natrural. We are almost there hun dont worrie:)",

            "answer": "My doctor induces all of her patients at 39 weeks to \"make sure\" she will be there for the delivery because she is a one person practice. Thank God I am not high risk as of right now, I had preeclampsia with my previous and my pressure was a little high on Friday and again today, but not much and with a couple of breaths, it went down to normal. And to answer Alysseaab, yes my due date is the 16th, but will be getting induces on the 9th. Both of my previous pregnancies, I went into labor naturally, induction was never brought up until I developed the preeclampsia and even then my son came on his own. So when the doctor came to deliver him, she then mentioned that I was going to be induced if he had not come on his own. I am hoping that this little guy decides to do the same thing and come naturally.",

    "question": "Had an ob visit today, got the group b test done and she also checked for dilation. I have been experiencing a lot of lower back pain and pressure, along with pain inside the vagina and mild cramps. So base on all the stuff I have been experiencing, I thought I would be dilated some, but it turns out that my cervix is high and her exact words were, that she could only get and finger in there (whatever that means). So no dilation at all and that makes me feel a little disappointed! And just a few minutes ago, I got a call from the ob office to let me know my induction date and time. If I go by induction dste, I have 12 more days to go, but I am so hoping that he decides to come on his own before that, I am not looking forward to being induce. Any mommies out there who went natural into labor before their induction dates? Any encouragement will be greatly appreciated! Thank you! God bless!",
