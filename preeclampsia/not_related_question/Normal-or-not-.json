    "question": "Hi, I'm 30w pregnant. I've had swelling in my feet for the last few weeks which I know is normal. Recently my fingers have started to swell and my face swells. Even though they swell it's not huge swelling, enough for me to notice though. This morning I woke up and my eye lids were pretty swollen and my vision has been a lil blurry today. Which I've had a history of blurry before getting pregnant if I hadn't drunk enough water. I Have been drinking alot of water while pregnant. I have a doctor appointment friday and am going to bring up my concerns. Just wondering what you all thought.",
