            "answer": "I had never heard of it so I looked it up. Here is what I read:HELLP syndrome is a group of symptoms that occur in pregnant women who have:H -- hemolysisEL -- elevated liver enzymesLP -- low platelet countSymptomsHeadacheNausea and vomiting that continues to get worseUpper abdominal painVision problemsTreatmentThe main treatment is to deliver the baby as soon as possible, even if premature, since liver function in the mother gets worse very quickly. Problems with the liver can be harmful to both mother and child.CausesHELLP syndrome occurs in approximately 10% of pregnant women with preeclampsia or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome is associated with more serious cases.Many women have high blood pressure and are diagnosed with preeclampsia before they develop HELLP syndrome. However, in some cases, HELLP symptoms are the first warning of preeclampsia and the condition is misdiagnosed as hepatitis, gallbladder disease, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.Tests & diagnosisDuring a physical examination, the doctor may discover upper abdominal tenderness, especially in the right upper side. The liver may be enlarged.Liver function tests (liver enzymes) may be elevated. Red blood cell and platelet counts may be low.PrognosisWhen the disease is not treated early, up to 25% of women develop serious complications. Without treatment, a small number of women die. The death rate among babies born to mothers with HELLP syndrome varies and depends on birth weight and the development of the baby's organs, especially the lungs. (See also: Prematurity)Please keep us posted. This sounds pretty serious, so hopefully you do not have it! Good Luck!!!",

The reason I thought of you was because I had my follow-up incision check yesterday, and my OB was outlining what we were going to do at my next appointment. In addition to flu shots and such, he wants to do a blood count because apparently my platelets dropped during this pregnancy as well. I am normally over 200, and during the pregnancy they dropped to under 140. The day after delivery, they had dropped to below 100. I had no clue. He wants to make sure they have come back up. Anyways, that made me think of your post. By the way, he didn't seem too concerned, and obviously this pregnancy wasn't affected by the drop in platelets. Probably why he did so many darn blood tests, especially towards the end, in addition to seeing me every 2 weeks throughout the entire pregnancyanyways, wanted to let you know it may not be serious, but i'm glad they're listening to you. the other symptoms are alarming. hope everything went well.",

I was there for about 3 hours and it was a quick reminder that I will be there again soon. There were mothers giving birth and it got me very excited for that day when I can hold my baby! Of course, my FULL TERM baby! They are going to be doing regular bloodwork and watching me closely. I am bothered by how I am feeling but if they say everything else is okay then I will go with that. Still having upper right quadrant pain and just a general unwell feeling. Nauseous, headache, general malaise. I was nearly in tears last night because even though I DO NOT want HELLP, I would really like to know why I feel so uncomfortable. I was whining about it last night and Ben simply said \"You're pregnant.\" Ugh...yes, obviously...I just never felt this yucky. I shouldn't complain though...I have had a very easy pregnancy so far with no morning sickness or really any symptoms early on. I guess they all waited until the end. Maybe I am one of those women who gets morning sickness at the end of their pregnancy. I have had some pretty severe sciatic pain as well and for that they gave me oxycodone. I've never taken this before and didn't take it last night because I was afraid to. Sounds like they will reduce my hours at work here soon. The chair sitting is making it worse. I feel fine in the morning and as the day progresses it gets bad.Anyhow, just wanted to thank everyone for their concerns and comments. Thanks Jess for updating everyone. I'm so glad everything came out fine!",
