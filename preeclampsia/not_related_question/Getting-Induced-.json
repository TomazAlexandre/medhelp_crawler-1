Induction can be risky and I heard hurts more than going in naturally. I'm finally pregnant with a little girl and I'm trying to be strong and go naturally. She's due Dec 12th. I would suggest not to do the induction unless you have to, and since you're a ftm the doc will say anything to scare you. I watched a documentary called business of being born. It opened my eyes to so much. I recommend it. (:",

It all went smoothly,\u00a0\u00a0and my son came out healthy,\u00a0\u00a0but having gone the natural route with my first born, I realized that I much preferred just letting nature take its course, and will be having baby number 3 whenever the baby decides to make its entrance.\u00a0\u00a0There are pro's and cons to being induced,\u00a0\u00a0but ultimately it is your choice,\u00a0\u00a0not the doctors, so do not let him pressure you into anything.",

My level 2 peri wanted to induce my first one at 37 weeks, i delclined until week 40. What if the weeks are off, and your actually less far behind.....baby needs all the time they can have! Good luck! Plus, i feared not being ready and ending in a c-section.",
