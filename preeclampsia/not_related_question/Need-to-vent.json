I would cry all day if someone would listen and feel bad lol.\u00a0\u00a0This is my 3rd pregnancy and I've never felt this bad even sleep is horrible! I have been using a heating pad and that has been working a little. I've been taking baths and drinking tons of water too. My MW just keeps saying the same thing. I think if anyone tells me to drink more water or take a bath again I will lose it!! Tylenol doesn't help either so I'd rather not take pain meds. One midwife told me they would give me muscle relaxers and the other one told me she didn't want me to feel loopy. Honestly I would rather feel loopy in the evening and get a good night rest then this. I know it will soon be over and worth it but it's so hard and it makes me so anxious and emotional",
