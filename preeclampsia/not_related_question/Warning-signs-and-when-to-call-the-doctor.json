            "answer": "WOW Sounds like you were the classic pre-eclamptic patient! I am really surprised your old OB didnt have a problem with you gaining 35 lbs in one week, that can kill you....that is a massive volume overload and its hard for me to even comprehend that amount in such a small amount of time.Ok we will start with number 1..the chest heaviness. I agree with the previous poster that it \"can\" be a normal phenomenon related to the pregnancy, however with your history of volume overloading with that weight gain (I am assuming this is water weight gain..were you peeing normally??) I would be concerned that it might be related to something else. When the heart is overloaded with too much fluid, it has to work harder, and working harder can cause some chest pain..not a good thing, need to get that checked out. Of course it could be heart burn, sometimes that can feel like a dull ache, or it could just be related to the Normal increase in blood volume and the heart adjusting to that increase in volume.Number 2: the visual disturbances- Pregnancy can cause a change in your vision, it has for me all my pregnancies (I always have to get a new Rx for my glasses bc my eyes change slightly) however the visual disturbances you describe sound a lot like what I had around 24 weeks, I thought they looked like stars...like when the cartoon characters get bonked on the head. This is not normal. There are a few things that may cause this. One is a change in blood pressure, either too high or too low. Mine was actually from low blood pressure, but they can be a sign of extremely high blood pressure also. If you start to see black floaters it could be related to the retina in the eye. When blood pressure is too high it can cause the retina to detach from the eye and cause serious eye problems that may be permanent.As you can tell by my post, I would HIGHLY recommend you calling your OB and telling them the whole story, and describing your current symptoms. Do not feel embarassed about calling when you have a concern. Call today.Good luck!",

I'm currently in labor and delivery, being monitored for uterine activity.The pressure in my chest is secluded, and not from baby, so they are watching that as well.They know about my previous history, and are concerned I may be having early signs of preeclampsia.Baby girl is NOT happy about the monitor, and is squirming like mad.",

    "question": "I'm nervous to call my doctor about this, so I hope it's ok if I post here.Quick history:I am 28 years old, 21w 3d pregnant with baby girl #2. I've had 4 miscarriages.My pregnancy with my DD#1 went meh with crappy docs who didn't check on a few huge concerns I had. I gained over 35 pounds in one week, had some crazy intense migraines that would last for at a minimum of 3 days and would pretty much knock me out until the pain went away. Vision problems - blurry vision on and off along with feeling like my eyes were straining. Swelling so severe you could lightly touch my legs with your finger, and the imprint would last for over and hour, and I couldn't fit my feet into flip flops much less shoes because it hurt so bad. I switched docs at 30 weeks, and still had no answers. Was not given the option of natural delivery and had a forced c-section at \"39\" weeks.I did not experience any chest heaviness during my last pregnancy, but last night I woke up feeling like my chest had a weight sitting on it just in the center. No problems breathing whatsoever, just real uncomfortable. I've been having some mild on and off lower back aches, and this morning I've had pretty consistent mild aches in my lower abdomen. My eyes are also starting to feel strained again, and last week I had a visual disturbance that caught me off guard - like shimmering water just to the left side of center. It lasted a little bit, but not more than 2 hours. I've had that happen before, but NOT during pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Baby girl is pretty active, and her kicks are nice and strong.I have moved states, and adore my new ob, but am afraid of calling because of my last experience with my previous ob. My new ob has kept a close eye on me during this pregnancy, and I've been working out with a personal trainer to help maintain my weight gain and prevent the blowing up that happened when pregnant with my DD#1.Anyone else have these or similar issues at 21weeks? I'm not sure where else to turn and don't want my doc to think I'm over reacting.",
