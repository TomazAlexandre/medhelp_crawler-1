            "answer": "I have had midwives with all three of my children and LOVED them.\u00a0\u00a0The office has a team of midwives, so I saw a different one at each visit and didn't always know who would actually deliver me.\u00a0\u00a0Since they were all great, it didn't matter. I enjoyed getting a different persective each time.From my experience, midwives are warm, caring, and much more personable than doctors.\u00a0\u00a0For example, during my second labor, which was long and difficult, two midwives spent hours in my room rubbing my back and talking to me.\u00a0\u00a0What doctor is going to do that??If you do go with a doctor, I would try to find a female provider.\u00a0\u00a0I just think anyone who's been through this is going to be better than someone who hasn't. = )",

            "answer": "The choice seems obvious to me. Do you want a person who is MORE or LESS qualified to care for you? I think that ESPECIALLY in your situation, you'd want the MORE educated one - and that would be the OB. Stick with the Doctors, forget the trendy midwife. If something goes wrong, you'll be delayed waiting for a BETTER EQUIPPED doctor anyway. Midwives are NOT equipped to handle ALL situations. It seems like a no brainer to me - It's just plain smarter to go with the doctor. Good Luck in whatever you decide though.",

            "answer": "I kind of agree with Jax. Your three biochems, combined with your age may make you higher risk. With that in mind, an OB seems like the logical choice. If you were 25, completely healthy with no previous issues, I'd say heck, go for the Midwife if you want to. But you're not...and, if it were me, I wouldn't want to risk my health or my baby's health just to have the touchy-feely personal attention of a midwife. But that's just my opinion. :-) Whatever you decide, I wish you a happy, healthy pregnancy and delivery!Tricia",

    "question": "Hi all.\u00a0\u00a0I'm so excited to be posting here.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 8w3d with my first bean, due date is Aug 21. I'm almost 40 and had 3 biochem and I don't want to talk to any of my friends or family yet (except for a few close ones) about this bc I'm nervous of m/c. So this is my question. RE just discharged me and now I have to decide on OB. My sister says I should go for a midwife instead. Is one better than the other?\u00a0\u00a0I'm already checking out possible hospitals since if I go for OB, who I pick will depend on hospital affiliation. Also is there a good website for looking up the questions I should be asking on the hospital tours? Thanks all!",
