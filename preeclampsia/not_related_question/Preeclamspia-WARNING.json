With my first I developed preeclampsia early on that went unnoticed because my OB, like yours told me that my swelling was normal. It developed into eclampsia and help syndrome. I was in the hospital fighting for my life for weeks even as I was slipping away, but we made it. I'm glad to know that you're alive and well also. My primary doctor mentioned to me that women who go through this type of trauma are likely candidates for ptsd.Preeclampsia is not uncommon and the signs and symptoms should not be ignored.Thank you for posting here to help other women! Best of luck and healing energy to you!",

            "answer": "I had Gestational hypertension starting at 27 weeks with my son I had to have him via csec at 37+3 because it was getting out of hand even on meds. I didn't so many 24 hour urine collections in and out of the hospital for monitoring. That all happened last year he was born at the end of April and I'm now 24+3 and have been having blood pressure increase for the past couple of weeks so I'm scared since it's starting sooner than last time. I do have a great Dr tho and she went ahead and started every other week visits a lil earlier than normal to keep an eye on me. And if I have problems she will see me right away. We just don't live close to a hospital that does babies before 36 weeks so that makes me nervous.",

    "question": "Hi ladies, so 3 weeks ago I was 25 weeks pregnant when I was diagnosed with severe preeclamspia. To cut the long story short we lost our baby and I was near death myself with internal organs failing due to the disease. I did not have blood pressure issues before and I am generally in good health. The reason for my postis not to sscare but to educate others about the seriousness of the disease and highlight the warning signs. For a disease so common (according to my research) I think I was failed by my gynae. Don't get me wrong, I don't blame her but I am now telling u what she shud have told me; which is: SWELLING IS EXPECTED IN PREGNANCY. HOWEVER, IF U SWELL IN THE HANDS AND FACE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE GET UR URINE TESTED FOR PROTEIN TRACES AND UR BLOOD PRESSURE CHECKED. U CAN GET THIS DONE AT THE PHARMACY OR EVEN AT HOME IF U HAVE THE DIP STICKS AND A BP MACHINE.Ladies, I learned of preeclamspia on the internet when I was looking for remedies for the extreme swelling I had. After reading about it I wasted no time. I went to see a doctor who was horrified after getting my BP and urine results which showed my kidneys were already failing. I was admitted immediately and more tests were done and all was really not looking good.\u00a0\u00a0The baby was suffering and her growth was stifled. Th placenta was under performing and too mature for the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0It was as old as 38 weeks but I was only 25 weeks preggies. My liver and lungs were also disfunctional. All this was due to preeclamspia. PLEASE DO NOT\u00a0\u00a0TAKE EXTREME SWELLING FOR GRANTED. PREECLEMPSIA IS CALLED A SILENT KILLER BECAUSE YOU WONT BE FEELING ANY PAIN YET THE DAMAGE IT CAUSES CAN BE LIFE THREATNING. I wish u all the best with your pregnancies. Please I do not intend to scare u but rather to warn u as I wish I had been. Take good care of urselves. I will be back again some day :) I praise and thank God for sparing my life. I knw I will see my baby again in heaven one day. Ciao!!",
