    "question": "Monday I was having sharp pains etc contractions and could barely move.. they were irregular but called the Dr and got in to be seen.. They took my blood pressure which was 155/90 and the Dr came in checked the baby's heartbeat which was 130 and my cervix and said I would be fine and put me on bed rest for two days.. she told me if I have contractions consistently to go to Hospital right away but that is all she said.. she's actually a Nurse aprwctitioner.. I'm still having contractions but they are irregular and I feel as if my blood pressure is still up bc I keep getting migraines.. I feel so lost and without answers.. like why am I asmlready having contractions and WHY is my blood pressure High.. what is everyone's input on this? Should I be worried?",
