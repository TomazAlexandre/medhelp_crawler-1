That is why my husband after leaving the active duty army made sure he stayed on in the national guard. We only pay $204 a month for insurance and it covers all family members. It also covers my pregnancy 100% and when I go to have the baby we only pay $25 the first day and $17 a day after that, that I have I been the hospital. Obviously this isn't a choice for everyone but maybe your hubby can join the weekend warrior squad and reap the benefits. We also get amazing dental and full base privileges as well and with me not working right now, we actually qualify for WIC, for the time being.",

We don't have any debt. No house payment or anything. Found out today that if I want to keep my insurance at work whenI go on fmla which where I work is completely unpaid I will have to pay in advance for the insurance. Well that isn't to bad however my premiums a month once the baby is born will exceed 500 bucks. So I basically have to pay them 2k before I get my leave because I can take 16 weeks off. And when I go to the hospital to have the baby I have to pay my deductible which is almost 2500 bucks. So before I pay my bills for the time off work I have to come up with almost 5k. We make to much money for wic, food stamps or Medicaid with is both working. Oh and I also found out that when my doctor puts me on light duty my employer just sends you home instead of putting me in the office and letting you keep working.\u00a0\u00a0So sorry for the rambling but that is my vent for today. Hope you all can see why I am feeling defeated today.",
