He pretty much put me on bed rest and I don't have another apt till August 11 witch I'll be 23 weeks and 3 days",

            "answer": "A lot of the time doctors will chalk it up to being the heat, or just an unfortunate effect that pregnancy has on you. They should be checking your blood pressure, as well as your urine for proteins at every visit. If those are both fine, you aren't having contractions, and your swelling isn't too terrible (which you'd be amazed how big they have to swell to cause concern) then they will typically be led to believe that it's just from the pregnancy. I have gone into the doctor twice now over my swelling, and all of the crazy symptoms I had that all matched preeclampsia to a T, and both times It turned out I was just fine. It's definitely scary, and tests your patience, but as long as your doctor is checking and keeping up on it, you should be okay. Just make sure to follow his/her instructions.",
