            "answer": "First baby i was induced due to preeclampsia right at 41 weeks. All i remember is having to go poo...what an embarassment!!! I don't recall my water breaking. 7 hours later came my 7lb7oz baby girl. No meds and it wasnt as bad as everyone was saying.Second baby I was in labour all night and didn't know it lol...woke up and went to dr appt and was told i was in labour. As soon as i went to rest room my water broke. 5 hours later my son was born @ 6lbs13oz. Hurt worst than the first and i did get an epidural.Third go round i was induced due to preeclampsia again. I was 4 days away from edd. I tried to get an epidural again but due to my body been so swollen the dr couldnt get a successful stick. 7 hours my baby girl was born 7lbs8.1oz. I still have the scars on my back and occasionial back pain from the epidural. This time i hope to have all natural labour :)",

I was looking out the window at the 6:20am there was one star in the sky. I remember thinking something going to happen with my baby today(did know the sex) the her dad got in at 6:30 I got out on bed and a drop of water hit the floor my waters had broken I woke my mum who said go back bed it will be hours. The contractions start straight the way every 3 mins. Told my mum I can't wait so when straight to hospital. Was 3 cm when got there they gave me gas and air. I sounded like a drunk man when I spoke. They took me down to deliver.I was stuck at 91/2 cm for about hour. My baby poo inside me. Then I push the head out and the midwife put my hand on the head. I said what's that she said his head I said is it a boy then she was like not unless he has a willy on his head. Push the rest out and there was my beautiful baby girl. Took 3.1/2 hour from waters breaking.",

            "answer": "Lost my mucus plug at 37 weeks. 3 days later I woke up at 12AM with BH contractions. I didn't know they were fake so I started timing them. They weren't very painful and they never got closer and closer together. After 2 hours they ended. About a week after that at 38.5 weeks, I wake up again at 12AM because of contractions. They followed a pattern. Got worse and worse. By 4AM I had to poop. I pooped like 5 or 6 times, each time when I had a big contraction. By 7AM I was emtpy inside and could barely stand or walk. I had my head down on the kitchen counter while I swayed my hips back and forth. My husband woke up at 8AM. I asked him to help me shower and get ready. People told me to eat before going to the hospital because they won't let you once you get there. But I didn't because I had no appetite.We got to the hospital at 9AM. I was admitted at 3cms dialated at 10AM. I broke down and got epidural at 11:30AM. Then it was chill for a while. I watched two movies and my water broke during one of them but I didn't even know because I was numb and couldn't feel it. Started pushing at 3PM. Baby born 20 minutes later :)",
