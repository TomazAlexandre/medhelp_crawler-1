The second ob I had switched to had no idea my baby was a macro somnia risk meaning I'd have a big baby. They didn't tell them because they were negligent and it wasn't the first time the first ob had neglected us or done something harmful to our health. So when I went to deliver they didn't know until I was pushing. As a result I began to hemmorage and pass out and my baby suffocating. Finally after trying everything and having a fourth degree tear& breaking my sons collarbone they got him out and by God's grace we both survived. Now with baby #2 and any baby after we have to have a c section",

But that was the main reason was INFECTION. And sometimes baby would get stuck in birth canal but that goes with the statistics of having an epidural.",

It's not like how it use to be where vaginal was the only option and if the baby got stuck or your uterus ruptured or something that that would be the end of it. Also now we have so much medicine that's availiable to us that fights infections and whatnot. So it's only in extreme cases will a mother or baby die ( and remain dead)from actual childbirth. It's really nothing to worry about or think to much about because your just putting negative vibes into your body and baby",
