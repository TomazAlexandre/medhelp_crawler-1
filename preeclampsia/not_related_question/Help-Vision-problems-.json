    "question": "Hey Moms! I awoke today from a 30 minute nap and could not see out my right eye. I rubbed it and everything around near and far still remain extremely blurry to the point I couldn't recognize. After about 30 minutes of praying it started to get better but the vision is still blurred at a distance.\u00a0\u00a0Has this happened to anyone before? A couple weeks ago I had a lot of pressure in that eye when I would bend over but my doctor said maybe sinuses. I'm praying this is just a pregnancy thing.",
