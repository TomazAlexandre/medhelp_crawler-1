It's based on personal preference.",

            "answer": "Yes the risk of getting the bacteria is the same as if you are pregnant than if you are not but the only difference is the effect it has on you and the baby if you get it while pregnant... The bacteria is deadly to an unborn child and can cause birth defects and stillbirth as for the effects on a person is just flu like symptoms so if someone is okay with risking that to their unborn child by not heating up deli meat then that is on them... I don't wanna risk the life of my unborn baby for a sandwich personally so I don't even eat it at all! But like it was said its up to you honestly",

            "answer": "I was told by my midwife to avoid them because it's possible to get listeria which can cause major harm to your baby, even death.. I guess it's a personal choice I want a sandwich so bad but the fact that there's even the slightest chance that I could get itand it cause harm to my baby I choose to avoid it as best I can. I mean my mom ate them all through both pregnancies with both my brother and I even though her doctor told her not to and we're fine. There's just a chance of catching listeria and that scares some women. Like I said personal choice. I believe if God wants my baby to be healthy it will be no matter what but I'm a ftm so I worry about everything. Hope this helps!",
