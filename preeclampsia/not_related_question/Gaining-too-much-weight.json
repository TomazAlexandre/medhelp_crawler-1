            "answer": "Im right there with you! Ive always been small and I have gained more weight than recomended. It actually makes me self conscious when I plug\u00a0\u00a0my weigh into this ap and it says \"excesive weight gain\". I also recently quit smoking and I think that adds to our hunger. I try to eat really healthy and eat alot of friut and veggies but its imposible to resist sweets and goodies. I think our bodies know what we need and if your craving sweets there must be a reason. Just be sure to keep up on ur blood tests, try to eat a ballanced diet, and dont let it get you down. No need to \"diet\" while pregnant. You're not alone. :-)",

            "answer": "My suggestion would be to ignore the scales and just enjoy your pregnancy. You have time to lose it when bubs comes and breast feeding helps lose weight. Its better to be eating healthy and giving your baby the best chance at life. Don't worry. Just go hard St the gym later if it worries you. That's what I'm doing ;)",
