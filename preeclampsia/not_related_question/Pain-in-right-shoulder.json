It can be confused with heartburn, gallbladder problems, flu, indigestion or pain from the baby kicking. Shoulder pain is often called referral pain because it radiates from the liver under the right ribs. Lower back pain is different from muscle strain common to pregnancy. It is usually more acute and specific. All may be a sign of HELLP Syndrome or a related problem in the liver. Shoulder pain can feel like someone is deeply pinching you along the bra strap, or it can be painful to lie on your right side.What you can do...Pain in this area should be taken very seriously; do not dismiss it and go to bed.

It is characterized by Hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells), Elevated Liver enzymes (which indicate liver damage), and Low Platelet count.Between 4% and 12% of women who have severe preeclampsia or eclampsia develop HELLP syndrome. But women can have HELLP without having either preeclampsia or eclampsia first.1 In most cases, this happens before 35 weeks of pregnancy, though it can also develop right after childbirth.1, 2HELLP syndrome often occurs without warning and can be difficult to recognize. It can occur without the signs of preeclampsia (which are usually a large increase in blood pressure and protein in the urine). Symptoms of HELLP syndrome include:Headache.Vision problems.Pain in the upper right abdomen (liver).Shoulder, neck, and other upper body pain (this pain also originates in the liver).Fatigue.Nausea and vomiting.Seizure.HELLP syndrome can be life-threatening for both the mother and her fetus. (Most fetal deaths that follow HELLP syndrome are actually caused by complications of premature birth before 28 weeks of pregnancy.3) A woman with symptoms of HELLP syndrome requires emergency medical treatment.so it looks like it would be hellp syndrome if you don't have the high blood pressure they need to check your liver...\u00a0\u00a0girl sometimes you have to take charge of your health care especially when it is a nurse that may never have seen hellp before",

If you don't do this and something bad happens to you or your baby you will have to live with that for the rest of your life. If you DO do this and everything is normal then you have that assurance and peace of mind.I know standing up to your doc is hard...I had to do it just yesterday regarding my blood clot history as my high risk OB was trying to pass the buck to everyone else...THAT'S WHY I GO TO THEM!!!**link to full article and copy of relevant paragraph.**http://www.marchofdimes.com/professionals/14332_1222.aspHow is blood pressure measured?At each prenatal visit, the health care provider measures blood pressure with an inflatable cuff that wraps around the woman's upper arm. The pressure in the arteries is measured as the heart contracts (systolic pressure) and when the heart is relaxed between contractions (diastolic pressure). The blood pressure reading is given as two numbers, with the top number representing the systolic pressure and the bottom number representing the diastolic pressure (for example, 110/80).A systolic reading of 140 or higher, or a diastolic reading of 90 or higher, is considered high blood pressure.Because blood pressure can go up and down during the day, health care providers often re-check a high reading to determine if a woman truly has high blood pressure",
