I went into labor at 24 weeks and delivered via c section. My first twin Mia passed within 20 mins of birth and Melody passed two days later from suffering a massive brain bleed. This all happened less than 3 weeks ago. I am devestated. But, I have to look into the future. The dr said that we can start trying in 3-6 months. We have to believe that god has a plan. Even though we can not see it now. If anyone would like to chat about this please email me***@****I still have another month until i go back to work and am bored.

I called the doc because I was having Braxton Hicks left and right and they said it was nothing to worry about unless they became more than 4 an hour. That night I woke up and went to the bathroom to find I was bleeding profusely. By the time I arrived to the hospital I was 4cm dilated. An hour and 45 minutes later I was 10cm. 2 hours after arrival, my son was born weighing 1lb and 11 inches long. He only lived for a few minutes. I was told that all his genetic studies came back with no abnormalities. I had no sign of infection in blood or urine. There was no explanation for what had happend. That was in December of 09. I am now 8 weeks pregnant and as anxious as could be. But I understand what you're going through. All that can be done is crossing fingers for now. Good luck to you!",

Results later had showed there was absolutely nothing wrong just went in for a check up and there wasnt a heart beat and nobody could tell me why but they had to induce my labor and i had to give birth to her. I also have an older sister she is 21 and has two kids of her own. While i was in the hospital my sister had sent a mass text to everybody (im from a small town so word gets around quick) saying i had lost my child and had to diliver vaginally and had also taken a picture of my daughter, Lilly Cierra, and had sent it out in a mass text also. I had no idea that she did that until i was planning the cremation of Lilly when a friend had showed me the msgs. It was very hurtful and still to this day cannot get over that she did that, my mom or nobody showed any concern for the situation and just thought what she did was fine and pretty much told me to get over it.\u00a0\u00a0Being in a situation like your sister, there really aren't any words or really anything anybody can do to make you feel better. What does help is knowing somebody is there for you, somebody you can trust not just anybody. My step dad who has been in my life since i was 2 didnt say anything to me never said sorry he didn't even act like anything occured which also was very hurtful. My advice is just to let her know youre there for her if she wants to talk about it, sometimes its hard to talk about so wait for her to come to you. I'm really sorry for the loss it's really a tough thing to go through and is something we'll never get over but having friends and family that are willing to help is the next best thing. I wish you guys all the best that goes to anybody who has lost a child, neice, nephew, grandchild, or cousin, things will hopefully start to look up its been a few months and yet its still hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but its there and we'll get there I truely believe that.",

They were going to try to hold of labor as long as possible but I just kept bleeding, had alot of back labor and then they were losing our vital signs. I had an emergency c-section and my baby girl was born at 25 weeks. She lived for 36 hours and my husband and I just laid her to rest yesterday. I feel your pain and understand what you are going through. I do not know how strong in your faith you are but for me and my husband, we are leaning on the Lord to help us heal and grow to find our way through this tough point in our life. I have been talking to friends, keeping occupied. Im not sure what else to say because I am still coping and just starting the grieving process myself. I will say I found some closure by writing my feelings about my little angel. If you write to your little angel it might help find some closure, maybe not take away the pain but help knowing you are talking about it out loud. Hope this helps. if you find anything that helps you, please let me know",

            "answer": "I'm so sorry for your loss. I went 25 weeks pregnant with twin boys and at work (a phlebotomist at a blood bank) was on my feet all day. At the end of my shift I sat down and when I got up I start pee-ing on myself, so I thought. I could not stop no matter how hard I squeezed. I went to the bathroom and it was still going, that's when I realized my water bag might of broke. I went to the hospital and one of the bags did break. Stayed in the hospital for a week the had an emergency C-section due to me having a fever. First baby died 5 hours later and 2nd baby died a day later. This is the hardest thing I had to go through. This happened in 2009, and to this day I still cant get over it.But to cope through this, I feel family and close friends are very important. I lost my religion and almost lost my husband because I just completely shut down. I do have two boys before this pregnancy. And to everyone's surprising this past year,I am now a Sunday school teacher and I am no longer mad at God.\u00a0\u00a0if you can see a psychologist t that is also a big help. Keep your family close but also let them know when you just need your time so they can respect that and give it to you.another thing we do in our family to keep our twins memories with us, is we celebrate the three days they were with us ever year. something simple...I take out their urn and light a candle. And I am Mexican and we have a celebration that we celebrate our loved ones that has passed away. Dia de los Muertos, Nov. 1 and 2. and that is a big celebration. By doing this has helped my whole family and especially my boys understand death and to celebrate the love we still have for them. They always say we have two angels looking over us.Your in control on how you want to handle this. This sounds Mad, cuz I thought so too, but the more you talk about it the easier it gets.I will pray for you and your angel.",

I was diagnosed with pcos when I was 19 and then at 24 I fell pregnant with the love of my life. I had probably one of the easiest pregnancies known to man as everything was perfect, no morning sickness, no bleeding, no pain, no weight gain, no nothing, some people didn't believe I was pregnant until they saw my bump. My daughter was due 15/9/13, I made it all the way to 37weeks to the day where I went to the hospital as I didn't feel her move for a couple hours. Where it takes 3midwives for them to tell me that they couldn't find my daughters heartbeat. She had passed away 3weeks before she was due, born 2days later on the 28/8/13. After going for my hospital check up to find out that there's was nothing wrong with me or my daughter, our bloods were fine and her placenta was perfect, they believe that her heart skiped a beat and just didn't start beating again. Like I said its still so painful and raw and I'd do anything to have her back. I have already asked my partner if we could have another baby, not to replace Hope but to have what we've always wanted. He wants another baby as much as I do but both of us are so scared that it might happen again, neither of us nore our families can go through this again. I don't know if it will be easier to conceive after having Hope, regardless of my pocs which is not a bad case.Has anyone been through something similar and had a healthy pregnancy and baby after a loss so close to the end? If someone could please help or reply I would be most grateful.",

            "answer": "I lost my sweet baby boy on October 27, 2013 at 18 weeks. I had been having slight bleeding and severe abdominal pains for a couple of weeks. I went to the emergency room on October 18. I was told everything was fine with the baby, but that my cervix was soft and that I was severely constipated. I was told to follow up with my Obgyn ASAP. Which I did. Unfortunately my OB was not enthusiastic or concerned about my cervix and refused to perform a pelvic exam on my follow up visit. He listened to my baby's heartbeat with the Doppler and told me my cervix being soft was normal and sent me on my way! 7 days later I was still experiencing bleeding and went back to the ER. This time I was told I was dilated to 9cm and my water broke a few hours later and I had a boy that 6.8 oz. I was DEVASTATED. What has helped me to cope is writing to my baby when I'm feeling sad and missing him. Talking to friends and family about my son and using his name out loud. (Kayden). I'm not yet ready to take out his urn and look at keepsakes that I have of him. It is still too painful. But I take solace that Kayden is in a better place and is watching over me and that eventually I will be with him in heaven. Plus Kayden will always be in God's memory. I have no doubt about that. I'm still looking for someone to blame (including myself) for my baby's death. I feel if I would have done anything different in my prenatal care my child would still be alive. Now I am having baby fever and want to get pregnant again. Not to replace my child, but to feel a void. I know it might sound crazy to some. Love and prayers going out to anyone who has ever had to go through something of this nature. God is with you. Take care.",

The next day at work I used the bathroom and started bleeding excessively and rushed to the ER where they did a sonogram and my baby was fine and moving around, but my cervix was thin and opened and I was already dilating. They said there wasn't anything to do and less than 24 hours from my first ER visit I gave birth to a silent baby. My boyfriend and I are devastated. They think I have incompetent cervix but they don't know. I won't go back to the doctor for 6 weeks. Its my greatest desire to have kids but I'm so scared something like this will happen again. I'm also just scared that I won't be able to deal with my grief and it'll hurt my relationship with my significant other. We just buried our child yesterday.

            "answer": "Thank you for being brave & reaching out. I too am going through a roller coaster of emotions & live each day the best I can for my beautiful 3 yr old son but some days are hard. On the 13th November 2014 i gave birth to my beautiful baby boy Enoch. He was 19wks 5days. At 18 wks i started bleeding while I was at work and was rushed to the hospital. Unfortunately I had a incompetent cervix & all the amniotic fluid surrounding baby had leaked. Drs told me the devastating news that there was slim chance of survival for my precious son. He was still kicking strong, so I still kept hope & stayed on hospital bed rest drinking lots of fluid in the hope it would replenish what was lost. On the night of the 13th November i went to the toilet & felt a strong kick then pressure fall between my legs, i shut my legs tightly & called for the nurse. The nurse placed a bed pan in the toilet and my precious son was born into it. He was so perfectly formed & I loved him so much.18 mths later we found out I was pregnant again. We were so overjoyed but also apprehensive. We announced the news just to immediate family and asked them to keep it to themselves. I made sure to attend all hospital apts & stitched my incompetent cervix as extra precaution. All was going well & by week 20 I was feeling more confident as I had passed the apparent dangerous stages of pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0We found out she was a girl & we were filled with so much joy that my mind started planning for her future...decorating her nursery, buying dresses, where she would sleep. My son would kiss my tummy every night and say \"love u my sister\" I was just over 23 wks when I started to feel sick, sore back & found bright yellow discharge. I went immediately to the hospital & they admitted me in. Internal examination was done & they found that my cervix was only 1mm & that was being held by the stitch. I had also contracted a infection which was making matters worse. On my 2nd night at the hospital my waters broke, I was panicking on the inside but appeared calm on the outside. Drs told me that keeping my baby girl inside me would be too dangerous as she may contract the infection i had & recommendation was to cut the stitch & allow her to come out naturally. I gave my consent to remove the stitch & - flurry of NICU doctors & nurses began to prepare. I was so scared but I wanted to be strong for my baby so i kept smiling & being positive. 2 hrs after removing the stitch my princess arrived into the world. She was born 24wks & weighed 760g. We named her Graceline Hope. She came into the world breathing on her own & then they whisked her away placing her on CPAP. We were in the NICU everyday from morning till night. Talking, singing, praying for her. Kangaroo holds were few but when we had the opportunity we always held the memory close to our hearts. We changed her nappy & even wiped her down. I pumped out milk for her every 4 hrsx Everyday was a miracle & I refused to accept that she would not survive. On day 17 her breathing started to deterioate & she was placed on the ventilator. She had also contracted an infection which was what we were praying that she would not get. Her heart rate started to go down & the next night we were given the heartbreaking decision to allow her to go in peace & not be in pain. She survived 19 days & then graduated to heaven on the 31/8/16 in my arms. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to endure & even now I struggle to understand why me? Why did I have to loose 2 angels? Most nights I cry myself to sleep but I still live in hope & have faith that God has my angels wrapped in His arms. I hope & pray my story helps some other parent that is going thru the same thing.Don't give up hope & keep the faith. Even though it may feel like the end of the world, the sun will always shine thru the next day. Love you my angels Prince Enoch & Princess Graceline",
