Alot of woman dont have any signs or have any progress. They just wake up one night and go into labor. Like my mother and my friend mendy who had hers a week ago. She wasnt effaced or dialted at all. Her water just broke out of knowhere. The only thing i think about dialating and effacing is that your body is preparing, getting a head start. Which does make labor shorter than starting from the begining. (excluding complications) Every labor is different. We only have maybe 2 weeks, 3 weeks tops before we hold our baby. I know its tough and im def on the end of the rope here. But it will go by quickly.",

LOL.\u00a0\u00a0Anyways, the doctor ended up checking me every week anyways.\u00a0\u00a0I also had mild preeclampsia, so that could've been why too, I never really questioned it.\u00a0\u00a0He ended up inducing me because of my condition and told me that since she was sitting high would 99% chance need a c-section - but I told him I wanted to try it on my own first.\u00a0\u00a0I was induced at 39 weeks and I got to 10cm and she was still too high.\u00a0\u00a0After 2 hours of pushing I was able to deliver naturally :)\u00a0\u00a0I'm just telling you this in case your doctor does tell you that you aren't progressing or the baby isn't positioned right - because if I would have listened to my doctor I would of had a c-section.\u00a0\u00a0You have to trust your instincts.\u00a0\u00a0So if you feel you want to be checked, whether you have changes or not, tell the doctor you want to be checked.",
