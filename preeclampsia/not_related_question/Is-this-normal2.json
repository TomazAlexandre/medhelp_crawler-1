    "question": "I'm 37 weeks pregnant and since yesterday morning I've had a horrible headache and have been seeing some spots on and off in my eyes. I had a doctors appointment Tuesday and my OB told me my blood pressure was slightly elevated and I needed a follow up for Friday to double check it, however last night my lips, especially my top one became very swollen, along with my headache and the floaters I've been seeing. I know it's nothing I was allergic to because I hadn't ate or drank anything in hours. Is this normal? Or should I be seen sooner?",
