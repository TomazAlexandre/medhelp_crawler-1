            "answer": "Honey im dealing with this right now. i was told monday at my 20 weeks u/s that i had placenta previa, but since i've not bled or anything my OB did not put me on bed rest. He just wanna keep checking to check if the placenta moves up. If it doesnt i will most likely have to have a c-section. Dont freak out, with prayers everything will fix itself :-)",

    "question": "So I went to the doctor for my anatomy scan and found out I'm having a girl! But I was suddenly worried thinking something was wrong as the ultrasound tech said she needed to do a vaginal scan after becoming very quiet. Naturally I asked was something wrong and she\u00a0\u00a0said the\u00a0\u00a0doctor will talk to me... Not only is my placenta low but its completely covering my cervix and also split. Now I have to be on bed rest longer and the talk of me being hospitalized is seeming more likely. I am so scared! I have to go back in two weeks but if I start bleeding more I will be hospitalized. :( My doctor says\u00a0\u00a0either way I'm looking at an early c-section which makes me nervous in itself.\u00a0\u00a0Have any moms had placenta previa before? Am I freaking out too much?",
