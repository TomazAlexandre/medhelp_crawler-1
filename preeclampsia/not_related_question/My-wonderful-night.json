It would be normal for your healthcare provider to monitor your urine during each visit.What does the urine test look for?A urine tests is used to assess bladder or kidney infections, diabetes, dehydration and preeclampsia by screening for high levels of sugars, proteins, ketones and bacteria. High levels of sugars may suggest gestational diabetes, which may develop around the 20th week of pregnancy. Higher levels of protein may suggest a possible urinary tract infection, or kidney disease. Preeclampsia may be a concern if higher levels of protein are found later in pregnancy, combined with high blood pressure.",

I rarely have called to ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0In the past 2 months I've called twice, both times with valid concerns.\u00a0\u00a0I was passing blood and tissue one time, and the other my eyesight had gone completely blurry and I couldn't see.\u00a0\u00a0Both times NOBODY bothered to call me back!!!The thing is, no matter how reputable your doctor is, you need to feel comfortable that when you have a concern, it is addressed to your satisfaction and that you aren't made to feel intimidated or embarassed to express your concerns!\u00a0\u00a0You've got a high risk pregnancy and aren't asking for anyone to bend over backwards.\u00a0\u00a0You just want to pee in a cup and get a urinalysis for goodness sake!Murphy's Law about your heart... of course nothing will happen with the monitor on, but as soon as you take it off, you'll get the fluttering again! I've had that happen to me.Personally, I would find another OB/GYN, tell them up front on your first visit about your concerns with the other doctor, what you need from them, and then decide if you'll stick with who you have or switch over.I hope everything goes okay for you!\u00a0\u00a0Try not to stress too badly.\u00a0\u00a0If your blood pressure was okay, likely you're all right but it's best to get your concerns immediately addressed by whoever is willing to address them!Sheri",
