            "answer": "The pain will be so bad you probably won't notice the epidural being inserted. But also, don't expect it to help so much.With my first, I had my epidural put in even though I wasn't even feeling my contractions like most women do. Well I got stuck at 6 cm, so they gave me some pitocin to get me going again. Yeah, I thought I was going to die at that point the contractions were do bad. And I have a fairly high pain tolerance.Not trying to scare you, just being honest.Good luck to you though and hope you have a safe delivery!",

I didn't want to be induced or get the epidural but I wanted it to be as safe as it could be because I was having a preemie. She only weighed 4 lbs.

And as much pain as you'll be in you would want to have the epidural, you wouldn't care about nothing but letting the pain stop. Idk why they waited so long with me. Maybe because I was 16 and they wanted to torture me. Lol.",
