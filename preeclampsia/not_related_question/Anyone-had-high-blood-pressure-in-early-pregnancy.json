            "answer": "I had prenatal hypertension with my daughter. I only took meds while I was pregnant. After she was born my blood pressure when back to close to normal after a month or so. I was induced a day before my due date because of it, but I am also overweight. Everything with her was fine other than she pooped before she was born, so she had a little bit of breathing problems. You would never know it now though! I hope that some of this helped!",

Severe headache, seeing floaties, or dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0They obviously checked my urine at each visit as well for protein to check for pre eclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Mine never got to that point.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on bedrest for three weeks before I gave birth due to swelling and pitting of legs (that was beautiful, I have to tell you)---\u00a0\u00a0and my blood pressure stayed high after I gave birth. We were in the hospital for 2 extra days due to my blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I had a cuff that automatically took it every couple hours which was a pain in the behind as it did it all night long.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, sorry you are having to deal with that but hang in there.",
