            "answer": "a blood test can detect a pregnancy as early as 5 days after ovulation. basically because it once you ovulate and the sperm and egg meet it takes about 5 days for the egg to implant itself and that is when the hcg hormone starts being produced.that being said....if you ovulated late it is possible that the blood test could have been wrong it just depends on when you ovulated.\u00a0\u00a0however after 11 years (i'm betting) it is unlikely that your tubes came untied.good luck to you, let us know what you find out.~nanci",

I had blood work done that showed a high level of pregestrone, which confirmed his diagnosis. Could you please explain how this happened and if it could happen again?Thank youI found the article that I was looking at earlier on the net.\u00a0\u00a0I copied it and pasted it here. Let me know what you think and I will let u know what I find out. Thank you for your help I realy appriciated it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Posted by hfhs.md.rcs on April 26, 1999 at 23:51:24Dear Tamm:Tubal ligation has a known failure rate that is 1-3/1000 women in the first 5 years and 10/1000 women by 10 years.If the portion of the tube attached to the uterus unseals or the ends of the tube grow together, there is a pathway for sperm and egg to meet.Keywords: tubal ligation failureThis information is provided for education purpose and is not a medical consultation.

I took a EPT test and it came back poitive and then I went to the hospital a few days later due to cramping and they told me that I wasnt pregnant. Here it is Oct. I still havent had a period I have all the signs of being pregnant. I can even feel my uterus now its gotten hard like a brick and further up in my abdomen. But I still can not show a positive urine test. I did do some research on it and I learned when you have a tubal its best to do blood than urine becasue of some reason its harder to get a positive urine test. The problem im running into being that I dont have insurace that its hard for me to find anyone to do a blood test on me they tell that they cant to a blood pregnancy test because I have had a tubal. I have come to the point as to say I know my body well enough I have had 3 kids and I know in my own little way im pregnant so im just going ot wait until the baby comes. I am so frustrated with this situation. Its going to cost me well over 200 dollars just to get a blood test done if I can find someone to do it. I have been on the phone with several nurses around here in my area and they all tell me the same thing \"you have had a tubal you need blood done not urine.\"Im compleatly at a loss.",

You see I just turned 43 in April, I have had reg periods my whole life (no more than 5 days late) and now I find myself 19 days late. I've had my tubes clamped for 18.5 yrs. I am going through some stress right now but my periods have always came early or more frequently with stress, not late. Before the tubal I've never had a problem to conceive, let's just say it was necessary or I would have 20 kids by now!! I have ALL the symptoms of pregnancy with the exception that the pregnancy test I took 6 days ago being negative. I thought maybe menopause but there was no warning and no symptoms leading up to it if it is menopause. Any thoughts?",

Since by tubal ligation in 94\u00a0\u00a0I have been always on time never late and very heavy for 7 to 10 days. In July was atleast a week or more late, this month never really had a period a smear here and there. I have severe nausea, breasts hurt, horrible headaches,tired all the time. My 5 yr old boy twin asked me today if I had a baby in my belly because my belly was hard and asked me if it hurt and I said a little and he said then you probably have a baby in your belly I told him no that mommy couldnt have babies anymore and he said if GOD wants you to have a baby he will put one there. My stress level is no more than usual, keep thinking I will just wait and see if it comes next month, but am very curious.\u00a0\u00a0I hear your chances are higher having them tied over 10 yrs and being over 35 anyone with any knowledge of this??",

I have since gone to the bathroom 2 more times since I went at 0630 this a.m. and still the discharge on wipe. My husband doesn't want to talk to me about it cuz he is nervous that I may be pregnant. Funny thing about it is..........I believe in my heart that I am. I have heard that women who have had their tubes tied have a hard time getting positive results from urine samples. Not sure why though. I hope things work out for you. You are not by yourself:) If anyone else can give advise please do.",

I do not know how ole this is but I had a tubal reversal done on 4-13 after my TL 7 1/2 years ago. I had them triple burned and he put them back together. Dr. RIchard Levin is a leading specialist in this field since before I was born. It cost me 6,200 and this included hotel stay for two nights, the night before and the night after. hotel shuttle to the hospital, surgery,meds everything!!!! i did not even give the hospital my insurace card and all I had to say was I was a patient of Dr. Levin. You can look him up at babiesbylevin.com He is the nest and offers free services afterwards till you are pregnant! Even another surgery if needed. he is in Louisville KY but he has had ladies come from Alaska, and from the middle east and further. He has the best bedside manners and is like an old friend not just\u00a0\u00a0a dr. There is also a support group I am a memebr of for ladies deciding to have one and aafterwards. We have ladies even in their 50's get the surgery and concieve. He looks over your operative report, checks FSH if needed and Sperm then calls you on the phone for free to tell you if you are a good canidae for the surgery. Best of luck to you! Oh I lost my daughter at 23 weeks and she only lived for three hours. I had my TL about a month afterwards too. I fully understand, but also know we were not in a state of mind to make such a decision. Sorry about your loss! I miss my Emma everyday! She would be 8 this August! :(",

But since then Ive been wanting to have another baby and every now and then I thought I was pregnant because of late periods.(mind playin tricks) I had to start the pill because I spotted after periods and have been on them for 4 yrs and they helped with the spotting but in July I didnt take the pill and got very bad period so I re started it in August but since Im 35 now I stopped and the pill. my periods come 24th of every month on time and even came 24th in july when I didnt take the pill. But July was the last time I got my period.\u00a0\u00a0On the 24th of August I cramped for about a week but no blood. I had lower back aches, light headness, dizzy, cramps, urinating a lot, wanting to eat everything and still no period. Ive taken 4 hpts starting from 1wk late n all neg. Even did first morning urine 1 wk ago and still neg. Now 3 wks late and I barely get cramps but stll lower backaches. I hve a dr appt thursday with my primary physician to get a blood test because planned parenthood wont give me blood test unless they feel its ness. I must say to anyone thinkin to have TL PLEASE DONT DO IT!!!! U Never know what may happen that will make you want more children.

            "answer": "I am also hoping that GOD will bless with me with another baby. I too got my tubes tied and regretted it- while I was still in the hospital. At the time I got my tubes tied was during my C-section in 2006. At the time me and my boyfriend were unemployed and n ot very responsible even tho were older and should have been. My mom also was the biggest influence on me getting my tubes tied. Well after our daughter was born, we completely turned our lives around. Boyfriend is now my husband. He has a very good job working for the city as a lineman. We just purchased\u00a0\u00a0our new home. He is also the best father I have ever seen! He also has 3 grown kids and i have 2 older kids. Our little girl we have together has been such a huge blessing and I believe she was sent to us to change our lives. When she was about 6 months old I started researching tubal reversals and thats when I found out it is possible. I brought it up to my husband but he said he didnt want anymore kids, he just wants to spoil the one we have together. I begged and cried to him to the point that is caused arguments with us. He then said, lets wait awhile(well im getting old) now our child is 3 and I've been bringing it up again. He doesn't want anymore kids, he says hes too old,he's 51 now, i'm 37. I want this soo bad. I threaten to have the reversal, he says he will wear condoms. So I guess the only way I will have another child is by GODs help.As far as the reversal for some of you ladies, check out Dr. Levin or baby's by levin center. I have done sooo much research on this and this is the best place to go. Don't go with cheapest doctor. Don't go with closest doctor. His prices are about 6900 but that covers everything and he will follow up with you til you get pregnant. He will help, for free, with fertility care as needed. He will re-do the surgery for free if for some reason the tubes re close. They have many options as far as paying for the surgery. You can apply for medical loans just like if you were to charge the surgery. If you don't qualify then you can get a co-signer. They didn't offer this a couple years ago. I almost applied last night without telling my husband but chickened out.Please, anyone contact me with any pregnancy after a tubal ligation. I love to hear about it. my user name is my email. I had to spell it like that. Any of you that have had pregnancy symptoms, what ever happened. Many times I have had the symptoms too but I think it was just because I want it to be true so badly.",

            "answer": "Hello ladies!After reading every ones desprate attempt to get pregnant after a TL, this is one true story to leave you in awe. I had a TL after the birth of my 4th son in April 2007. I was unsure of the type of tubal, all I know is that I DID NOT want anymore children. I am 28 y/o and I just started my career as a paralegal, and I was at a point in my life that I knew I didnt want anymore children. Well I started dating this guy who had no children, but was unaware that I could not have anymore children, and I did not want to tell him because I thought it wasnt none of his business and just in case I needed a big come up on money I would tell him I was pregnant.+ I didnt think the relationship would go as far as it did anyways. I figured he wasnt my type anyways. I know ladies...NOT SO NICE.Well, I finally decided I needed that BIG COME UP ( $ ) so i told him I was\"P\". I thought he was going to tell me to abort the baby, but my BIG PLAN blew up in my face. He actually wanted the baby:-o, and on top of that, he told his entire family. Everyone was so happy being so this was supposed to be his 1st child. Ladies, this man became everything I wanted in a man. He was like a dream come true. Everything you could wish a man to be, he was and more. After the big announcement to the world, he became so attached. He started rubbing on my belly, rubbing my feet, wouldnt allow me to do much of nothing for myself. I couldnt even bend over to tie my shoe without him doing it for me. I began to feel real bad about what I had done, but deep down inside I knew that even if I could have a baby, i wouldnt want it. Besides, I had just started my career for christ sakes!!!! and I wasnt mentally ready to start over. Well I guess GOD had other plans for me. He tought me a big lesson. This is story marks a true saying in the statement \"There is power in the tounge\".My last period i told him was 10/25/09. Which it really was. I was trying to figure out a way to tell him I lost the baby. So I decided to wait until Nov. when my period came to tell him I miscarried, but he was so happy, and I didnt want to take the joy he had or break his heart, and to make matters even worst, he asked me to marry him. I really started to feel bad, and knew if I had told him the truth he would be devistated and probably wouldnt want to talk to me again. So I pushed it off for another month, and said I would tell him at the end of Dec.Well ladies, I began to feel a little diffrent the entire month of Dec. I started urinating a lot, getting cravings, I picked up 2-3 lbs, uncontrollable sleep moments etc. the whole \"pregnancy syndrome\" ordeal. So I decided to take a PT and it was neg. I knew God had loved me so much, that he would do that to me so i brushed it off. Well my period became due and I got 1 day of light bleeding and that ws it. Nothing! Nada! Zip!\u00a0\u00a0 WELL I DECIDED TO TAKE A 2ND PT WHICH WAS (+) AND A BLOOD TEST CONFIRMED THE PREGNANCY. AT THE DR. APPT TODAY I FOUND OUT THAT NOT ONLY AM I 9 WEEKS PREGNANT, BUT I AM 9 WEEKS PREGNANT WITH FATERNAL TWINS, AND THEY ARE IN MY UTERUS WITH A STRONG HEART BEAT!!!!!! I HAD A LATERAL TUBAL BOTH SIDES TIED/CLIPPED/BURNED LIED, DIED, AND LAID TO THE SIDE, BUT GOD SAID OTHER WISE. SO NOT ONLY DID I GET PREGNANT, I GOT 2 MIRACLES, LESS THAN 3 YRS AFTER TUBAL, AND NO EPTOPIC PREGNANCIES!! DUE DATE IS JUNE 29TH. WEDDING IS APRIL 14, 2010. Sorry to be so long winded, but this story needed to be told...to give hope to those who need it. NOW WE WILL HAVE A FAMILY OF 6...WOW THAT'S A BIG NUMBER, AND JUST TO THINK IT ALL STARTED AS A PRANK. I GUESS I HAVE TO PUT THAT CAREER ON HOLD AFTER ALL!",

I said no way, so I checked my breast and had a discharge like milk as I had in the past with my 4 other children. Now I'm worried, I took 2 hpt and went to the doctors office and took the blood test and everything is negative. Now mind you I had a tubal that I was told was a perminent proseedure done 12 yrs ago. Could it be that because I was on my cycle at the time that the test were performed could cause a negative result or what could this be. My family doctor said it's probably gas, but I know the difference. I have had heartburn out of this world and my stomach is not hard at the bottom it's huge at the top right under my breast to right at waist line. the most confusing thing to me is I feel pregnant but with all my other pegnancys when I missed my cycle I knew I was prego. This movement in my stomach has been happening on a daily basis for a month now and in the beggining I did just chalk it up to gas till I saw the milky substance and the waves and I know it's not gas I know what my body feels and I also have alot of swelling going on in the legs and feet even my hands and don't talk about the urge to pee all the time and the headaches and being tired.

See almost 10 years ago I had my tubes done during my C-section with my son who was born 1-31-01..But my last \"normal\"\u00a0\u00a0period was on Oct. 6th.... I got what I thought was going to be my next cycle early. on Nov. 1st. but that started completely different... really light and only lasted about 21/2 days... in both Dec and Jan I started bleeding around the 7th and 8th which was normal cycle time for me.. but again the bleed was different.. lighter and only lasted about 3 to 4 days... other than my typical 5 to 7.Ever since mid Nov. I've been experiencing typical pregnancy symptoms..\u00a0\u00a0Like fatigue, enlarged and sometimes painful breast, frequent urination, some nausea\u00a0\u00a0in Nov and Dec but nothing now. ( I only had morning sickness with my other 2 pregnancies in the first month also. ) My abdomen is also getting bigger and I've gained some weight.My problem is I haven't gotten a positive HTP yet. the last one I took was in mid Dec. I have no insurance and no Drs. will even see me once they find out I've had a TL and neg. tests. I even think I feel movement already .. I can't get a blood test done without a drs. order ... I'm at a loss here I mean I guess\u00a0\u00a0I just have to wait and see what happens. but if I'm pregnant I'd like to get pre-natal care.\u00a0\u00a0and without proof other than what I'm feeling... It's impossible.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions are appreciated..Thank You.. Colleen",

I do not know how it was done, but I'm starting to guess most drs. are doing clamps? Well, low and behold I was supposed to start my period this month, I had forgotten the exact date, last month it was somewhere between the 16th and 19th and I am not one to be late myself, only maybe one day or just plain a day or two early. I AM LATE!! It is now the 25th!!! I had figured out I had started my last period atleast by the 19th, well, the latest I should've started by any means would've been the 23rd, giving some way for 28 days in february. I usually have a period for about 6-8 days on average so I do know myself pretty darn well. I started having really sore breasts like I would the week I was expecting to start (this is why I say I should've started the 19th!), then two days later they weren't as sore but they're still sore and my areola has gotten a tad darker from being light colored, my nipples are tender and get erect which is abnormal unless I'm cold or in the shower, etc., I am gassy, have had cravings, almost thru up in the walmart food section yesterday just from the smell, I'm more tired than usual, not moody just seem very chipper lol, I'm peeing alot and even made sure to get a urine test done to make sure there is no infection and don't know why they didn't do a pg test, I took two pg tests a couple days ago that were negative. I AM FREAKING OUT!!! Lol, I won't be upset either way because I am an adult and if it is to be it will, I can't hate a child or myself because nature wants its way, just worried it may be eptopic or that I might just have a tumor or cysts or something worse. I wish the best of luck to you. I am planning to have my fiance' of the past year take me to the hospital today because I have had one hectic week worrying.",

I called the doctor and they have told me my muscles in my uterus are stretched from all the kids i had. My lmp two months ago came a week early started getting really bad headaches, dizzy spells. I was thinking of how i felt while i was pregnant with my twins and thought to myself this is how i felt pregnant. SO i waited to see how my period was this month and i came 4 days late and lasted 2 days. I made dinner and just out of the blue i got really nauseated from the smell. My belly is getting bigger, i have really bad back aches, sore breasts, very tired, and getting more nauseated. I broke down last night and bought two tests.The first test i thought was neg but later that night i seen what looked like a faint line in the positive so i retested this morning and i got a plus sign. Im worried to tell my husband that we are expecting\u00a0\u00a0our 7th child. Everyone was telling me you cant get pregnant after having a TL well i guess i proved eveyone wrong on that note. Now to make a drs appt. Very nervous to do that. I am so excited for this and to all the women out there wanting another baby after a TL just keep praying and keep in mind that it can happen and it is happening more and more. If its meant to be it will happen",

Pregnancy symptoms don't always mean your pregnant. It very well could be a medical condition causing your symptoms. Even though I would have prefered to have been pregnant. Even at my age of 43.

I took two home pregnancy tests and left them on the sink in the bathroom only to return about twenty minutes later with a faint positive sign. I then read up on it saying that if it is left more than ten minutes then it could be a false positive from an evaporation line. My breasts feel hot and heavy, ive been eating food like crazy, having to urinate often, large increase of vaginal discharge, and ive been tired and moody. I can't really afford to go buy more pregnancy tests because they are so expensive! And I hate to go to the doctors office and look like a fool thinking that i'm pregnant after a tubal. I have been doing research on what a tubal pregnancy would look like and I don't have any of those symptoms, so I really don't know what to think. Any advice??",

After five pregnancies, miscarrying 3 children, and then the last two that made it ended up being high risk pregnancies...I was tired. And my doctor granted my request to have a tubal ligation. I am regretting it big time. My husband and I wanted at least one more child, and while I enjoy not having to be on birth control or remembering to use condoms, I hope beyond hope that I am one of those cases where I will be pregnant again. I can't go in for a reversal right now, but I have been having symptoms of tender breasts, feeling worn out more than normal as of late, and I had some cramping which I should not have had because my cycle had ended a week and a half before hand. Not to mention the fact, I popped a stitch on my bra the other day. It felt tighter than normal. And I have NEVER had this problem with this bra before. I'm keeping my fingers crossed. Now while it will suck being pregnant right now because I am renewing my vows in 8 weeks, and I have a wedding dress and everything that has been altered to fit my now slim figure, I am hopping that this new start with my husband, will be further blessed with a new little one. I took a hpt this morning, and a light half a line formed at the top of the \"base line\" of the test. I'm not sure if it is a defective test, or it is starting to pick up on pregnancy hormones.

Pre menopause symptoms can start at 35 yrs and last up to 10 yrs, and we will notice weight gain and all kinds of symptoms.

Nausea, sore breats, fatigue, hormonal/emotional roller coaster, cramps, spotting, no real period, etc. My HPT and blood test were neg. I ended up demanding for a sonogram because I thought I was going crazy. Well, they didn't see anything.\u00a0\u00a0I was not pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0They did blood tests to check for thyroid problems, perimenopause, cysts, etc. All tests were negatives.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr said it could just be an \"off\" cycle and everything usually get back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0And it did. I'm back with regular cycles, normal period, and no symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0However, I really kind of wished I had been pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0But I'm really trying to get that out of my mind, knowing how impossible/improbable it is. I can't set myself up for disappointment month after month because I'm not pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know why I feel this way....I've had my tubal ligation for over a year, never thought about it twice, knowing we can't handle a forth child....but now I find myself wanting to be pregnant again! I truly felt saddened by my choices.....I don't even want to ask God to grant us a miracle.....I'm scared I would just set myself up for disappointment after disappointment.....Anyways.....I just never thought I would go through this grieving/mourning phase about a tubal ligation and being finished for good....Good luck to all of you!",
