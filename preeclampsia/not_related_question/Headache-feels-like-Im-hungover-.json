            "answer": "I've been getting those lately but it's due to the heat and dehydration I believe. Its very hot where I am and we have no air conditioning so I barely sleep as I'm already so uncomfortable and then the added heat is awful. So I wake up feeling hungover! I try to pound as much water as I can throughout the day especially when I'm outside, but sometimes no matter how much water I get I still get those headaches in the morning.",

However you mentioned you already have a perception from your doctor so idk. Maybe your dehydrated since that is what hangover headaches are from..? I would ask your dr. Two days is a long time.",

Tylenol isn't helping and even my prescription my doc gave me for tension headaches isn't helping. It's a horrible feeling. I feel so yuck!
