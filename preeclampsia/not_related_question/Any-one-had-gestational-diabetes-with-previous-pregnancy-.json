            "answer": "They wanted me to deliver her early as they said on the scan she was measuring 9lbs or more but she was only 6lb 10. They never once mentioned c section to me so I wouldn't worry. I am now pregnant with my second and don't have GD up to now fingers crossed bt my blood pressure is slightlying high this time and I'm only 16 weeks bt urine was fine so they've put me on meds to lower my BP but I'm worried about that and if It will develop into preeclampsia :( they said hopefully not as being fully monitored but there's risk of c section with this I read so I'm worried but my mam had 2 c sections and said they r fine but I'd\u00a0\u00a0deliver vaginally like last time too. Also my gd blood sugars never were high until I went into labour and then they shot up bt they injected me with insulin and I and baby were fine. hope that helps,sorry for the essay haha",
