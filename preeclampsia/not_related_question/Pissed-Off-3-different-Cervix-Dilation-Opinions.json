            "answer": "Thank you. Yes, almost about 85% of people complain when they have to see her. And although I wanted to turn around and not see her at all. My doctor won't be back until my due date so I didn't want to go the weekend and not know. And she had me leant up a tad bit, my doctor has me laying all the way back. I don't know if that made a difference",

            "answer": "Did ppl can measure dilation differently especially if they don't do it all the time. The assistant might not do it often. I know your done and want to meet your baby but don't get upset go with the fact that you are still at least two. Thing might stay there till Labour starts and all of a sudden you could jump to 4-5.etc.\u00a0\u00a0I know I like seeing progression too. But don't let the assistant get you upset.\u00a0\u00a0Baby will be here soon.",

If you don't feel comfortable or trust the Asst then it is probably not good to have her advising you on what to do...I would listen to the other doctors over the Asst however dilation is not the best indicator on when you will go into labor...you could be completely closed and go into labor tomorrow or be stuck at 2 cm for weeks",

I have been told false test results twice now once for 1 in 90 chance of down syndrome and then that I had preeclampsia which neither test was correct but the nurse called me and told me I was positive.

    "question": "So my primary doctor at my 38 week appt said I was just about 2 cm and baby head is down in good position. Then we had a scare/false labor last Saturday and the lady at the ER said the same thing and that my body is definitely preparing for labor. So today at my 39 week appt my doctor is out of town and his Asst who is known for screwing things up says I'm not dilated at All and I seem to be closed. How is that possible. I was sooooo upset and my fianc\u00e9 had to calm me down. I'm so over being pregnant I have tried everything and as hard as I have been working someone tells me a different result. I think she was unsure but she wants me to come Wednesday to discuss being induced Thursday. I camcelled movie night with Love because I just want to stay home because I'm so confused. I just wish she would come on out. Any advice Ladies",
