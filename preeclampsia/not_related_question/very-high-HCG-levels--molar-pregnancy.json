            "answer": "Hi everybody,I really don't know where to start off from, right now I'm 25 weeks pregnat (first pregnancy) I\u00a0\u00a0took the triple screen test at 18 weeks which uses 3 serums/hormones found in pregnant women. I think my baby has Down Syndrome! I'm really going crazy here, I have a lot of sadness and grief! my HCG was very very very high!The \"normal\" average for these three is 1 MOM. Thecloser to 1 the better. So a safe range is usually 0.5to 2.5.For Afp mines was 1.74. Which this was actually normalbecause its between 1.0 mom and 2.5 momFor Hcg mines was high. very very very high. I had 4.1momFor Estriol I was low. I had 0.41 mom.Considering those three numbers at 18 weeks (when HCGshould be lowering not high!) my age and my weight,race , my risk was 1 in 171 for Down Syn.What freaked my out lately is that I didnt realize howhigh my hcg of 4.1 was. I remember the geneticscounselor telling me it was on the higher side butassumed all high risk women had that high of a number.Come to find out now i'm way high (4 times higher thannormal) and usually the high risk women are between2.5 and 3's.My estriol is also low which is risk for downs. whichalso worrie me.but the one that really made me a high risk for downswas hcg of 4.1 mom.I called the genetics counselor today and\u00a0\u00a0she said itwas high indeed, they do get women with that high notoften but they do. But at least she didnt say most ofthose cases were bad. Most are not downs. Especiallyin my case she said not to interpret it as moredangerous becaue whats helping me is the fact that myafp was normal 1.71. usually downs is more common tohave a low AFP and a high HCG (and low estriol).Really that combination of low AFP and high HCG wouldthen have made me riskier.She said the thing about a high HCG is that becauseits produced by the placenta it can also meanplacental problems. Which can also mean a high riskpregnancy in and of itself....they end up being highrisk pregnancies for premature labor, preeclampsiawhich I think is high blood pressure during pregnancyand diabetes in pregnancy and low baby weight.Normally this is pointed out by bleeding which I havenever had and so thats why I'm labeled as risk fordowns because so far I've not had these other factorcomplications.She\u00a0\u00a0said maybe I have a placental problem but theycan never know for sure. but again, the fact that\u00a0\u00a0myAFP was\u00a0\u00a0in normal range is i guess reassuring for me.FYI...my placenta was \"previa\" or low during theultrasound. Blocking my cervix. Usually these move outof the way but if it doesnt then it may mean cesariansection.I will be monitored more closely aside of the risk fordowns because of this high 4.1 marker. And possiblyhave weekly checkups after 34 weeks.Anyhow the 4.1 thing freaks me out a lot especiallywhen put together with the low estriol. But thecounselor at least gave me hope by saying that atleast the 4.1 can mean something else too especiallybecause the afp - the one actually\u00a0\u00a0made by the babywas normal.So far she has been the only one to tell me that shefeels my baby will be ok. Shes not a doctor (whichdoctor's wont say that for legal reasons) but she hassaid it at least twice now. I hope God hears her.Sorry for the long letter I just felt you guys couldunderstand my results better if I went into detail. Ihope the one with the problem is me and not my baby.please help me, what can I do?? has anybody had a similiar pregnancy??? what sould I do?\u00a0\u00a0***no Amniocentesis recommended please***",
