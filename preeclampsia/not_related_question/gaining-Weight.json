            "answer": "Well either Ahcccs or you are paying your insurance to get a good doctor. If the Dr is not working for you change her. Because everytime you have a consult they charge the insurance hundreds of dollars and you are not even getting a simple question answered!On my case the PA said I should lose weight because I am over weight. Just eat healthier and smaller portions they said. I spoke to my Dr and she looked at me weird but said just stay away from carbs, juices, and sugar. Drink lots of water everyone in my fam looked surprised at a \"diet\" my dr had set. Well I lost 8lbs and I'm on week 21+4d and I'm hoping my baby is healthy since I haven't gained weight and it puts me away from diabetes and preeclampsia or high Bp. So as long as ur eating healthy it doesn't matter if you lose or gain. Baby still gains weight :)",
