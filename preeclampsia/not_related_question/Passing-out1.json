    "question": "Anyone ever passed out/ blacked out/ fainted?I took out the trash today and as I stepped down into the garage, I blacked out, rolled my ankle and have no idea how I landed. Although Im pretty sure on my shoulder as my whole left side was dirty and shoulder was achy.I came to just as the UPS guy was dropping off a package. He helped me into the house and get ahold of my hubby.Drs say my blood pressure is rising and have me on weekly visits. Im 34 weeks... but when I called the birthing center they were more worried about my ankle and said the baby may have been laying on a nerve. Might have caused me to pass out. Im ok but am calling my dr tomorrow morning. I know I shouldve went to the er.. but ours is no good and could wait for hours. Id rather monitor myself at home. So far so good.",
