            "answer": "I started working again when Noah was 6 months, I started pumping when he was five months so I would have extra milk stocked in the freezer. My milk supply stayed up until Noah was 10 months old then I noticed that he was not getting enough from me so I reluctantly gave him formula. I would nurse him in the morning and at bed time and then formula during the day. By the time he was 12 months my milk went buh bye. I started trying to loose weight when he was about 8 months so that probably had something to do with the milk shortage.Stick with the pumping as long as you can, It's such a great feeling to know that your providing you child nourishment.Good Luck!!!!",
