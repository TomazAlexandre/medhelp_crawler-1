I get there just to find out he was called away to a meeting. I hadn't been seen in over 5 weeks because he was on vacation for 2 weeks. Every time I call, he's unavailable and the nurses leave the phone on the answering service sometimes a whole hour after they're open. They said they'd tried to call but I never got a call, nor did my husband or MIL and they have all 3 numbers.Ugh!! Sorry for the rant.",
