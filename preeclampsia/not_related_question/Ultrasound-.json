            "answer": "With my son, I had one at 12 weeks and one at 20 weeks and that was it. I was measuring close to where I should have, weight gain was adequate, no excessive edema or signs of preeclampsia or any other serious complications and baby's heart rate was consistent and normal. So there was no reason to spend extra money for extra views when they already knew everything was going well. More than two or three ultrasounds in a low-risk pregnancy isn't an example of evidence-based practice.",
