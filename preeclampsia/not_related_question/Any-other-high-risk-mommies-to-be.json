He lived 1 day before infection took over and he passed. They aren't 100% sure what caused my pprom, they are calling it a domino effect. I had the premature rupture, a full placental abruption, an infection, and a possible incompetent cervix. So this time, I had a preventative cerclage placed at 13wks and am doing weekly Makena injections. Everything is going well so far, a lot of restrictions physically but no bed rest yet! And we are having another boy and very excited!\u00a0\u00a0We are cautiously optimistic as I'm approaching the 26 wk mark again. (Sorry for typos, on my phone!)",

            "answer": "I'm twenty years old and 31weeks+1day with my first baby. Throughout my pregnancy from probably about 16 weeks onward I had cramping and contractions, Dr didn't think anything of it. It only got worse and at 26 weeks I ended up having bad continuous contractions, went to labor and delivery and got a positive FFN, my cervix was 6-7mm long, dilated 1cm. They kept me that night and haven't left yet. In the mean time my cervix has shortened to nothing, thinned to 100% effaced with funneling, and I've had a lot of nothing happen most days, but several days where I've cranked out contractions like crazy going into preterm labor. They've stopped it so far after using magnesium last time it started up again. But they say once I make it 32 weeks, they won't intervene anymore and will let it happen naturally as it would occur on its own whenever it does. Keep your head up, I've realized things could be much worse I'd hate to be in the trendelenburg position I believe that's what its called? In a bed head down at the floor feet toward the air. I'm okay with strict bed rest if I don't have to do that lol. All that matters is that us high riskers have miracle babies who just might take a little extra special attention or treatment :) good luck to you and congrats :)",

            "answer": "I am 37+4 right now. My doctor is thrilled and shocked that I haven't given birth already. What put my in the high risk category is a fibroid. Thought I had a kidney stone last summer, and it turned out to be a 1 cm fibroid. Got pregnant in October and instead of the fibroid disappearing they way they do for many, progesterone was like fertilizer for it. It is now over 8 cm (larger then a softball). My doctor told me to treat it like a twin...so I named it Phil. One of the side effects of a fibroid is that it can suck all the blood from the placenta to grow bigger which takes away from baby. Lucky my placenta is in back. Because the fibroid is down low and to the left, they fear that it could break my water at any moment. They are going to let me try and go with a natural birth. Her head is now below the fibroid which is good, but if her shoulders. arms, hands, legs, knee, ect hit it just right, it could burst. Now fibroids are full of blood. That means a huge blood loss for me which means I then go into emergency surgery. If baby doesn't burst it, I get to heal from birth and then go in a couple months to have the fibroid removed. I then will have to always have a c section due to having a hole in my uterus.",
