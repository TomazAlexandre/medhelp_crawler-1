And why women don't let doctors keep testing after they find out there's a chance. Just know there is a chance but its not like you won't love your baby anyway.",

Also the blood test only tells you if you're more likely to have a baby with down syndrome, not that your baby definitely has it or not. Try not to stress out about it too much.\u00a0\u00a0:)",

She is absolutely amazing!!!! She graduated to Heaven 1 1/2 years ago,\u00a0\u00a0right before her 1st birthday. I'd literally cut offboth my legs to hold her here on earth again. I pray your child is amazing health!!

My sister had preeclampsia and she nearly died from it. Hardest thing I myself had ever dealt with and he was was nephew. It takes a strong person to be able to cope with the loss of a child. Infant/child's death is so devastating. He was born with a cleft pallet. And only weighed 1lb 2oz. And about the size of a palm. But he was beautiful and he was so loved. I'd give anything for my nephew to be alive today. But God works in mysterious ways. God bless you though Mommas!",
