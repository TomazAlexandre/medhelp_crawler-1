            "answer": "@aicnov14 thanks if it happens! \u263a@My2LoveBugs Not sure yet, that's why they had me do the urine collection. I had high bp before the pregnancy & they kept saying towards the end it would go back up, & while at my appt. Tuesday it did. Just left the hospital now after turning it in & having my blood drawn. They said if it's bad they would call my doctor at home & inform him..... fingers crossed. I wanted her to come today, but not this unhealthy way",

    "question": "Happy Thanksgiving to everyone! Hope you enjoy your holiday & be safe to all who are traveling!I'm finally 39weeks, due next Thursday, & was seriously hoping for a Turkey Baby because my 1st born was born a holiday(Mother's Day), so I though it would be cute. But we all know, babies come when they're ready, not us.lolHad my sweep Tuesday, & started my 24hr urine catch yesterday because my bp was 160/90 (about to turn it in) & I lost my mucus plug this a.m.!!!! I was having terrible cramps so I thought I'd use the bathroom & seen that large glob (sorry t.m.i) come out. Hopefully losing it, all this nausea & the cramps are a sign!CONGRATS TO ALL MOMMAS WHO JUST BROUGHT THEIR ANGEL INTO THE WORLD OR WHO WILL BEFORE THE DAY IS UP - SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR! \u263a",
