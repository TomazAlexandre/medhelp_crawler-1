    "question": "So I went to my doctor yesterday for my 20 week appointment. I thought everything was going to be great. When I got in there they did all the usual blood pressure, weight, urine, babies heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0When it came to the blood pressure they said it was rising up at every appointment.\u00a0\u00a0I had high blood pressure last pregnancy but then my doctor told me I might have to go on bed rest at 28 weeks and that it isn't good that my blood pressure is rising and for me to gain 6 pounds in three weeks when I have lost 20 pounds and just now gained. Plus she said I have some swelling.\u00a0\u00a0Has this happened to anyone else and they know what is going on? Has it just been doctor being over cautious? So scared right now I don't want nothing to happen to the baby",
