            "answer": "I would let your Dr know just because it could be a symptom of preeclampsia. But everyone is different. My cousin had severe preeclampsia with her second pregnany. She hated the experience so much she had her tubes tied. Anyway, it sounds like edema. Idk.Sometimes when I stand too long my legs get swollen. Sort of feel like water balloons... or something.",

            "answer": "I've been having issues with swelling (mostly mild) since about 13 weeks - I'm now 21 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I think it has a lot to do with your level of activity, temperature, and diet.\u00a0\u00a0We went to the lake for the 4th of July and I was VERY swollen for two days afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's because I was out in the heat (Florida summers are brutal!) and also because I ate lots of salty foods.\u00a0\u00a0I also notice that if I sit at my desk all day, my legs are especially swollen.\u00a0\u00a0Gives me a really good reason to come home and put my feet up!By the way, my blood pressure is fine.\u00a0\u00a0I asked my doctor about it and he said there are two groups of pregnant woment - those who swell and those who don't.\u00a0\u00a0He said his wife's nose even swelled when she was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely ask your doctor about it though, and keep a close watch on your blood pressure.Kelly",

    "question": "I was wondering if anyone else has started having issues with fluid retention? If I press on my skin the marks stay for ages. For example if I press lightly with my finger nail on my arm, the mark will stay there for 5-10 minutes or so. I can almost play tic tac toe on my arm before it fades away!My husdband has noticed particularly in the morning as if I sleep with my fingers etc on my face or chest I will have those marks for a good 10minutes after I get up and move around. I noticed it too from resting a laptop or books on my legs.I tried looking stuff up but all reference to this seems to be more about legs and ankles etc but this is everywhere. It is also not that I look puffy either. It is really quite weird. Anyone else had this start up?",
