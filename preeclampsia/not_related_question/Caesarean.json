If U guys have a healthy pregnancy with no problems then inducing should even be an option(of corse if it dosnt give u or baby an danger). Seems these few years doc goes for inducion and c sec because it easier for them.And U can defentlig give a vaginal birth after a c sec, if Ur having also a good pregnancy. If U really want to do a natural birth then insist on doing it. Many midwifea here in UK want people to do natural delivery most even after a c sec(as long as U and the baby are safe).",
