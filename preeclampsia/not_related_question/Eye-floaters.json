It was only decided the day before at 10 PM that I was having the operation! I has preacclampsia which was not picked up until Wednesday when I had a scan just to check the position of my placenta as at 20 weeks it was low lying. One of the symptoms was 'shower' of moving silver eye floater spot things as well as headaches which I put down to regular pregnancy hormones. I was lucky that mine got picked up. Preacclampsia is very serious. I just wanted to make you aware that it is always better to be safe than sorry. Hope all is well. Please let me know. Xx",
