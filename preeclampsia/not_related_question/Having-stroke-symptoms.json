            "answer": "Oh gosh, VERY sorry to hear this.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors do treat the mother first.\u00a0\u00a0If you are at risk of a stroke, they will take that seriously. Do you have preeclampsia?\u00a0\u00a0High blood pressure?\u00a0\u00a0PLEASE talk to your doctor. They often take babies very early for this or at least monitor you very carefully for when delivery is essential for YOUR health.\u00a0\u00a0What does your doctor say?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor will terminate when it is in the best interest but it is unique that you are 6 months along.\u00a0\u00a0Are you high risk?\u00a0\u00a0If you just wish to terminate on your own, that is different.\u00a0\u00a0That will depend on your state's laws.\u00a0\u00a0Let us know how this goes, okay?\u00a0\u00a0We are here to listen hon and help if we can).",
