Elective c sections, or a section without any medical cause are rare. A lot of doctors don't want to do elective c sections.",

With my son a year later it was scheduled becuz I am small and my children were born so close together that me attempting a vaginal delivery could cause me to bleed internally.\u00a0\u00a0This is my 3rd and its been 6 years-the doctor and hospital I am delivering will NOT attempt a VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) so this one will also be a scheduled c section.",

            "answer": "Well most of the time women have scheduled cesareans bc they have medical. Conditions like preeclampsia or gestational diabetes etc. Other times times it is bc their first pregnancy ended in a csection for one reason or another so they automatically get a scheduled one thereafter. Thankfully thigh my first pregnancy ended in a csection I am having a vbac vaginal birth after cesarean. Some women don't have this option bc they either are not a good candidate for it or live in an area where surrounding hospitals don't do then a lot of county hospitals will not do a vbac. Or they just don't want a vbac think its easier to have a scheduled birth.",
