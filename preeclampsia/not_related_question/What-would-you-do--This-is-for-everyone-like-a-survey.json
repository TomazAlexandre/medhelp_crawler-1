A surrogate agreed to the testing requested by the \"expectant\" couple. DH sperm, donor egg. The testing came back with the fetus being pos for Down's. the couple asked her to terminate and she refused. They sued her before the baby was even born and 3 months later she had a perfectly healthy baby girl WITHOUT down's. Teh couple sued for custody and was rewarded with only visitation beacuse \"they didn't accept the baby as is before birth and only wanted contact when they realized she was indeed healthy.\" It was considered that these parents couldn't unconditionally love this child and so did not deserve to raise her.As for the question of a defect that would make life impossible for the baby to live...I agree with you blondie. I would rather have my baby go to God from my arms that to be ripped from my womb and killed in the process.And let's face it. A couple can TRY to terminate ALL the pregnancies it wants in search for the \"perfect\" baby, and all they are left with is a child who has to try to live up to those parents unfair expectations.",

I agree with blondie that this is an opinion- not me saying what someone else should or should not do.I was VERY early when I was born, and the doctors told my parents there was no hope of me ever leading a normal life.

            "answer": "Hello,Well Cheesetoo I am wondering where you get your stats. I helped deliver a baby for a 47 year old mother and the baby was born perfect. I don't tend to pay attention to the world's stats because I know who is in control. So please don't worry so much but spend your time more constructively in prayer.LOL I will be praying for you. As for the question in this post, I don't have any intrusive tests when I am pregnant and I would not terminate a gift from God no matter the curcumstances. I have a sister who was told early in her pregnancy that her child had Triosomy 18 and was urged to abort based on a blood test only! She declined and I delivered a perfect little baby girl for her. I also have a sister in law who had a still birth for unkown reasons and would not have done it any other way. I only know what it is like to have first trimester miscarriages but through the pain I trust God completely. I don't mean to sound rude, I am also opinionated. This forum has been a true blessing for me. Thanks,Helen",

    "question": "I was reading a post the other day from a different site and I came across one that a women wanted to have the amnio test done because she wanted to know if her baby would be born with a defect because if it were so she was going to terminate that pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I have actually heard a few people say they would do that. It really angers me to hear such things.\u00a0\u00a0Especially after I had already lost a very wanted baby.\u00a0\u00a0How can you purposely kill it just because it is not perfect.\u00a0\u00a0I myself was asked this question and it sickens me now but I actually had to think about it.\u00a0\u00a0I can't believe I would even think about it.\u00a0\u00a0I would never terminate a pg for any reason.\u00a0\u00a0I think even if my childs defects were life threatening I would want to have the chance to hold my baby and let it feel loved before the Dear Lord chose to take them from me.\u00a0\u00a0So my question to all of you is this.\u00a0\u00a0WHAT WOULD YOU DO???Thank You,",
