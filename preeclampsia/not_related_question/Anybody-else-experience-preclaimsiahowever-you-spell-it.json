            "answer": "Hopefully you are able to make it a few more weeks... 37 weeks is considered full term... your baby would still be fine it you needed to be induced though... my aunt had to deliver her 7th baby after battling severe preeclampsia at 24 weeks.... my aunt was in the hospital for 2 weeks and my cousin was in the NICU for 3 months... I remember my aunt was tripping out because she had her baby home and she was a few months old and it was before her due date.. your doctors will monitor you and make sure that you and your baby are both healthy... I know that I am at risk for preeclampsia-- I had chronic hypertension that went away at about 24 weeks so I was taken off my medication but my doctor reiterates that I may have to go back on it if my blood pressure spikes... so far it has been good-- thank god but im still being closely monitored because I have gestational diabetes. .. so having that plus the preexisting high blood pressure puts me at a higher risk. I'm 33 weeks and just hoping that is one piece of bad news that I don't get... she needs to stay put for 4 more weeks",

Went to work and my co worker said that I look a little swollen in the face as well. So I can only imagine what the doc will tell me friday when I got back. I hope its nothing, but I also hope u can make it to ur 38th week, but if u can't 35 weeks is not that bad. Baby is already 85-90% prepared to exit and meet the world!",
