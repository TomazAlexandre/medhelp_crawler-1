    "question": "So I feel like with this pregnancy EVERYTHING is so different from my first (boy).. I feel like with this one EVERYTHING is happening.. I had really bad nausea at the beginning, VERY emotional, gestational diabetes, pregnancy gingivitis, mouth ulcers (which I never heard of, but apparently is completely normal during pregnancy)..I just feel like I can hardly deal with it anymore.. I am ready to have my body back and meet our little girl.. I'm sorry for venting, I vent to my husband and he pretends to understand which I love him for but he doesn't get it at all.. & I don't have many friends because I cleaned my life out. So I figure why not where people actually understand.Thanks ladies..",
