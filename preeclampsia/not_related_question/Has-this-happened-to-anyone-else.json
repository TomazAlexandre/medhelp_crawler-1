I was out shopping for a car seat & all of a sudden I starting seeing spots in my vision. Went I got to the hospital, not only was there protein in my urine but my blood pressure was 200 over 180. They induced me on the spot. They most likely won't induce you yet, but they may give you something to help slow down your symptoms. It's best to call your doctor to be on the safe side.",

The baby just happens to lay up against my spine quite often. It can get scary :(You may have something different. I would bring it up to your doctor.",
