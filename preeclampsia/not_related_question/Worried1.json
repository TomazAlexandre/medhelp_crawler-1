            "answer": "How elevated was your BP? Also did they order a 24 hour urine test? If they didnt I would highly recomend you ask your Dr about it. When a pregnant woman shows signs of preeclampsia and has protein in her urine its cause for a 24 hr urine. You pick up a container from them or a lab. And collect all of your urine for 24 hours and when you return it they draw your blood.",

They had to induce labor early (almost a month early). I gained 50 lbs of fluids in my body.My advice is to follow Dr orders. My Dr had to bring in a specialist to talk to me about how serious the matter was cause I didn't think it was such a big deal and hated being on my left side 24 7 for a month.If you get put on bed rest use it as a time to bond. Talk and read to your baby.Stay calm and try not to be stressed it will only cause more problems. Take control now you may avoid complications.Keep us posted....",

I am however supposed to start physical therapy here soon for my siatica nerve on my left side for the remainder of my pregnancy so it's hard to lay on my left side since it hurts so bad but I try to stay on my back or right side...

If your blood pressure continues to be high and you don't feel like you're getting proper care, go to a different hospital. Even with preclampsia there isn't much they can do, you'd likely be induced and have more frequent appointments for monitoring. Hang in there, you're near the end and hopefully soon you'll have your beautiful baby, no nerve pain and lower blood pressure! ;-)",
