            "answer": "Well when my doctor said that I was leaking protein in my urine I also had high blood pressure so I had the condition called toxemia, and had to be admitted in the hospital for a week until I turned 37 weeks and than be induced, but don't worry because if you had that you will also have high blood pressure and your doctor would have told you. Just pray to God that you won't have toxemia but if you do don't worry about it! You can still have a healthy baby they just have to watch you closely,\u00a0\u00a0I had a healthy 6 lb 10 ounce baby and now he is a 4 yr and is healthy and happy and I am 25 wks pregnant with a healthy baby. Good luck and may God bless you and your little one!",

As long as the protein is not accompanied by high BP or swelling, you're good. :) I'm actually being induced on the 14th at 37 weeks because of Pre E. I was diagnosed with it at 32 weeks and have been closely monitored since then.",
