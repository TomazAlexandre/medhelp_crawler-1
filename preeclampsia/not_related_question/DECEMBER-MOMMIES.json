            "answer": "Due Dec 19th with a little girl. She will be born before that though.Im getting rather uncomfortable. Can't sleep anymore. I literally get up every hr to pee and half the time i get woke up by tingly arms and hands. My baby girl keeps having dips in her heart rate. Been hospitalized for it once already and have had 2 biophysical profile scans. I now get NST done twice a week and i see the ob every week. My blood pressure is elevated and i have high amounts of protein in my urine. Im hoping i don't develop preeclampsia with this pregnancy too.She weighed 4lb 2oz at my scan done at 30weeks. That's 5oz less than what my son weighed at birth at 35weeks.Ob said if she continues to have dips in her heart rate they will take her early. Im ok with this if it should happen since she would have a better chance outside my womb than inside.",
