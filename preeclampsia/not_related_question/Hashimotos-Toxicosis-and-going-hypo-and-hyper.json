I have energy, quite the appetite. But I also feel normal, like before all this thyroid nonsence.\u00a0\u00a0I have to rest soon, not sure what it will say.The endo said I probably had postpartum thyroidis.

            "answer": "I have Hashimoto's toxicosis and have cycled up and down a lot. A whole lot. Forever. Well, not forever, but it seems like forever.The only significant indicator I have when I first turn Hyper is heart symptoms. Not racing heart. Pressure on the heart. A dull ache. Skipped beats and once in a while a little rev up for two seconds. A feeling that the heart is way past tired, and ready to just stop. Normal blood pressure and heart rate.The depression is worse, and eventually I get shakey, am hungry a lot and need to sleep a lot.I am tired and can't stand heat or cold whether I'm Hyper or Hypo. When I'm Hypo, my muscles hurt.I haven't tried playing with my meds. I'm sure it would help if one could anticipate one's hormone levels a day ahead, but I can't. The symptoms lag behind the actual levels. I'm sure I'm nearly euthroid right at the moment, but my heart still feels like I'm very Hyper.Hope I understood the question.I'm not thinking too fast today.",

            "answer": "Hashitoxicosis is diagnosed by demonstrating a presence of anti-thyroid antibodies indicating Hashimoto's, along with a history of hypothyroidism that cannot be regulated along with frequent or prolonged bouts of Hyperthyroidism such that Thyroid replacement hormones must be discontinued by times.One method of treatment, that seems to fail consistantly, is to shut the thyroid down with Methimazole or Tapazol, and use replacement hormones like Synthroid or Armour to treat the drug induced Hypothyroid state.It can be very hard to diagnose. I was first diagnosed with a \"slow thyroid\" and put on Synthroid even though my chief complaints at the time all pointed toward Hyperthyroidism. My bloodwork said Hypo, so that's what I was treated for. I was tested every three months for a year and a half, and my bloodwork showed a need to up my meds every so often.Then I went in quite ill one time and my bloodwork showed I was extremely Hyperthyroid. Suddenly I had Grave's disease instead. After a lot of frequent bloodwork and a lot of horsing around with several doctors it was discovered that my levels were swinging up and down every week, and what my tests showed just depended on what day I walked into the lab.That \"one time\" was sixteen months ago and it has been hell ever since trying to treat it. After having lived with it for over three years trying to get regulated, I have decided the only way to treat it is surgery and RAI.My hope is that it will be controlled by Synthroid after the treatments, but I am starting to wonder if it will ever really settle down. I can't see how one could bounce up and down weekly if one does not have a thyroid, but the more I read the more complicated it seems.",

            "answer": "I have had Hashimoto's for about 10 years. Initially, in my early 20's a doc discovered a lump on my thyroid and general swelling which they biopsyed but could not get a good sample of. A partial thyroidectomy was done to rule out cancer and the lump turned out to be benign. (follicular adonema). I was told that the remaining piece of thyroid would continue to function well and to periodically check my levels. At that time, I did not know that I had Hashimoto's. No one told me. And really, as if any twenty-something is going to go for blood work regularly! If it 'aint broke........Fast forward to age 31 when, after my second son was born I began to fall asleep standing up! I went to get my thyroid checked and was definately experiencing hypo symptoms. I started taking a low dose of Synthroid. I am now 36 and have been experiencing a few hyper symptoms lately as well as continued hypo and a goiter and another lump has developed which is also benign. I have been advised to discontinue the Synthroid and will see an endo in a month after getting my TSH and free T3 checked. I am wondering if anyone has had dizziness especially immediately upon eating? I also get teeth chattering, muscle soreness, a heavy feeling in the eyes and the weirdest one.......my left eyelid is sometimes noticeably droopy!!! I also notice that my lymph nodes in my neck swell and feel sore sometimes. I also developed celiac disease last year. Am I alone here? Does anyone share these symptoms? I suspect Hashitoxicosis and I hope that the endo will listen. I am tempted to get the rest of the thyroid removed to eliminate the swings",

            "answer": "Hi Everyone,I am new to these kind of \"posts\", but find them extremely helpful and comforting.\u00a0\u00a0I have Hashimotos--diagnosed Jul 2007, about 7 months after the birth of my son (first child.)\u00a0\u00a0I felt horrible, despite my tsh only being 9.5 (I have heard that some people's tsh is really up there), but my antibody level was really high.\u00a0\u00a0Was started on synthroid 50 mcg in middle Jul 2007.\u00a0\u00a0Tsh has been \"fine\" over the last 9 months.\u00a0\u00a0Despite my internist telling me to get it checked 3 months after starting, and if it was fine then, I wouldn't have to check it but once a year!!!\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately for me, I am a nurse myself (however, I have found, that when it is you as the patient, all of the nursing mentality goes right out the window), so I persisted and had it checked 2 more times.\u00a0\u00a0 After only 3 months of synthroid, my tsh was down to 2.8 (end of Sep. 2007), and then I had it checked a second time about two months later (Nov. 2007) b/c I was feeling crappy again--at that time it was 2.3.\u00a0\u00a0I was told to stay on the same dose and that it was \"perfect.\"\u00a0\u00a0Well, back to feeling better for a while, at least.\u00a0\u00a0In Feb of 2008 I had my routine gyne appointment and asked again to check my tsh--my periods were heavier anyway, and I just wanted to keep tabs on it.\u00a0\u00a0This time it was 1.8 (which was about 7 1/2 months on meds.)\u00a0\u00a0Which brings me to the present....I have again been feeling really crappy the last three weeks or so (April 2008).\u00a0\u00a0Back to the brain fog, slow and sluggish feeling, and lots of weakness and fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0This time, I am having some muscle twitching or something--not constant--but noticable enough.\u00a0\u00a0I actually was freaked b/c it reminded me of when I was pregnant and the baby would kick--it's like a quick little jerk or something--calves, abdomen (sometimes).\u00a0\u00a0It comes and goes---some days I don't have it at all.\u00a0\u00a0I did have the weakness and sluggish feeling when I was first diagnosed, but didn't have this twitchy thing.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, if you google muscle twitching, the first things that pop up are ALS and MS--which totally freaked me out!\u00a0\u00a0But, I definitely have all the other \"thyroid\" symptoms-which, strangely enough, is comforting that I am quite sure it is related to my thyroid prob.\u00a0\u00a0I have read all your posts and sounds like you can swing from hypo to hyper....great, what fun!!\u00a0\u00a0I haven't yet had the pleasure of experiencing \"Hyper\", so I am wondering if you have any insight.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone else have this muscle twitching thing ever?\u00a0\u00a0I read in a lot of places that it may have to do with low calcium levels/parathyroid involvement??\u00a0\u00a0As far as I know, my T3 and T4 were both normal.\u00a0\u00a0Also, one of the posts I read was someone who had post-partum thyroiditis...do you a have Hashimoto's?\u00a0\u00a0Because my diagnosis seemed to coincide with my pregnancy and delivery...I was wondering if eventually things would just go back to normal (i.s., meaning I would be able to go off of meds.)\u00a0\u00a0I know that pregancy can trigger the problem, though.\u00a0\u00a0Along with this intermittent muscle twitching, I am really achy, constipated, foggy, tired, and I am quite sure I am having some heart palps...not very often, but I have noticed a few little flutters here and there, and also having a strange feeling in my left eye (like it is swollen and something is in it) and find that my vision is a little blurry after reading a lot or doing a lot on the computer.\u00a0\u00a0Pulse and BP are OK (so far--checking at home.)\u00a0\u00a0Sorry post was so long...new at this and have lots of questions, but feel so much better knowing that other people are experiencing the same things.\u00a0\u00a0It's scary.\u00a0\u00a0The thing I find so strange, and perhaps very specific to thyroid (??), is that the symptoms seem to sort of move through in waves(there is the nurse brain in me!)\u00a0\u00a0It's like one or two days of really bad brain fog, then a day or two of the muscular discomfort, and a day of constipation, and a few days of visual disturbance in some form...it is enough to make you think you are crazy!!!\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I can't catch a break here!\u00a0\u00a0 I am going to call doc tomorrow and get my levels checked--I read some of you saying though that the sxs seem to lag behind the levels, so not sure what to expect.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I am having sxs of both hypo and hyper at the same time, but my gut tells me that I may be leaning torward hyper.\u00a0\u00a0Also, does anyone feel that they have a certain \"range\" that they feel best at??\u00a0\u00a0 As my tsh has probably never been below like 4.0, roughly, then perhaps a tsh of 1.8 is too low for ME (although it is within normal limits)????\u00a0\u00a0UUUGGGHHHHH!!!!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for reading and any input would be appreciated!!\u00a0\u00a0Hope you are all feeling well......KS",

Many others on here criticize natural but don't knock it unless you've tried it - I met a woman from UK who has been on it since the 60s and her american doc put her on synthetic instead and she went immediately downhill and asked for her Armour (natural) back - let me know what happens :) Terri",

            "answer": "Hi KS -Here's what I've learned - Tsh is acronym for thyroid stimulating hormone - if your tsh is high number it means your pituitary gland is putting out alot more tsh to make up for your low t4 & t3 - so you want a lower tsh - I don't recall the exact numbers on the range but it's less than 1.0 to 4.5 or 5.0 - mine stays higher near 10 because if I go withing that \"official\" range - I am way too hyper (but that doesn't mean I have energy) so I stay higher tsh - but keep my t3 & t4 in range - also I've tried lots of synthetic like Synthroid, Levoxyl, generic synthetic, etc. but Armour is freeze dried pig thyroid - the problem some people have with it is that the t3 to t4 ration in a pig is higher than in a human so for some people they don't like it but I don't convert t4 to t3 so for me it's perfect - everyone is different - hashimoto's disease (named for dr. who discovered it) is when the body sees thyroid as invader and body attacks it and slowly destroys it over time until it doesn't work - hashi toxicosis is when your body is going hypo/hyper instead of just going more & more hyper - some people just take their thyroid pill & have no problem - others like us have all kinds of side effects - Armour is prescription but can obtain it through some naturopathic doctors (not actual md's) Endocrinologists & many gp's go ballistic if you utter the words Armour - it's been used since the late 1800s as rx for thyroiditis - that muscle twitching scared me to death - it got so bad when I was on 100mcg Levoxyl that I would lay on my arm to keep it from jumping around at night when I was attempting to sleep - my doctor (Endo) told me I imagined it or drank too much coffee ) make sure your doctor listens to you when you tell your symptoms - and ALWAYS keep copies of your blood test results and write your brand of thyroid med & dosage on every test and how you feel at that time - this has helped me keep track of what worked and what didn't - if your doctor won't help you - find a new one - good luck - let me know what you find out - research all you can about the tests your doctor has requested and others he hasn't - my doctor checked my Vit D levels & they were very low even though I eat healthy, work out & take vitamins - not unusual w/ thyroid patients to have low D - also a good doc will check antibody levels & many other levels - talk to him/her about this - the thyroid websites have good info about this too - Terri",

Was treated for depression for years. After the birth of my 6 year old I found a doctor who said I was hypo at tsh of 5 and put my on 75mcg of synthroid. Have taken it for the last six years.Started having cervical radiculopathy, raynauds, depression, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain. Went through all the tests and nothing was wrong with my spine or anything else. I do have carpal tunnel.Just tested and now my tsh is at 1.67 so the doctor tells me I am fine and to keep taking the meds. I was also diagnosed with Hashimotos disease.Here are my symptoms:chest painnumbness, tingling, pain in arms and legsstomach pain after eatingeither no appetite or ravenousweight lossdiarrhea or constipationstart periods 3-5 days earlier than normal and are heavy with crampsheadachechillsfeel like I can't regulate body temp (either too hot or too cold)nausea at timesfatiguedepressedexhaustedcrying and irritableanxietydry lips and skinbrittle haireyes hurtforgetfulnessexhausted by any activityI think that my body is dumping the thyroid hormone all at once and then I get really sick. I have good moments. I can have a couple of days where I feel pretty good (not totally myself) but better than when I am so sickI take 75 mcg of synthroid per day and 30 mg of adderall for ADHD per day. Probably don't have ADHD. I think it is due to the thyroid inbalance. II have trouble writing and remembering words. At times my tongue feels like it has been scalded by hot coffee or a hot drink.The doctor seems to think I am crazy and \"difficult\" Keeps trying to put me on antideppressants but I know I don't have clinical depression.Anyone have any ideas?God bless us all that have to live this private hell every day. It seems like no one understands how I can be fine one minute and feel like I am dying the next. I want to be healthy and productive!!!!",

            "answer": "Believe me I understand everything you say. I have been to so many endocrinologists who either think I am making everything up or say they are just too busy to deal with my problems.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that I had thyroid disease as a teen but it was not diagnosed until age 21 when I had Graves crisis. After a year of PTU they diagnosed me with Hashimotos. I have degree in nursing but my health is so bad I cannot work. After 32 years with Hashimotos you would think I could be well but it doesn't work like that. The thyroid has a mind of its own and yo-yo's up and down. You may have a normal TSH but still feel high or low.\u00a0\u00a08 years ago I began having terrible muscle and tendon spasms that no medicine helps. 3 years ago I lost all balance and now cannot walk a straight line and fall constantly. 2 years ago blackouts started - they come on with an aura of excessive yawning or horrible chills and then I am literally unconscious for up to two hours. After this I have to will my arms and legs to move and have slurred speech. 1 year ago I began to have severe abdominal pain and spasms after eating. Six months ago I began to have terrible pain in my arms and upper chest - tests show that my muscles are spontaneously tearing. In addition, I have such terrible headaches, joint and muscle pain I cannot sleep, My left foot is completely numb but feels like I am stepping on cold things. I have seen numerous neurologists who tell me that I have no sensory nerve function or reflexes but there is no cause for it. Could be thyroid related. I have taken synthroid which puts me on a roller coaster of TSH values (highest 81), then Armour\u00a0\u00a0thyroid which did the same thing, now I am taking a compounded med of T3 (not Cytomel) dose 60mcg twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0I really don't think anything helps. My husband of 28 years just thinks I am mean but the truth is I am so depressed, exhausted and in so much pain I just can't handle much. Anyone have suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0By the way I also have low VitD and B12 levels (but B12 shots lower the level), and and a high sed rate which indicates inflammation. My real worry is that I will develop thyroiditis and vasculitis and have another stroke (first one in 1990). I am a tough old bird (52) and I just keep going. I also had breast cancer at age 38 that the doctors said was due to my thyroid. GREAT!!!\u00a0\u00a0 One last thing don't just accept the diagnosis of carpal tunnel because I read an article about how hypothyroidism can cause thumb and hand pain and I truly experienced that when I was really low!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for letting me vent, no one seems to care that I feel the way I do.",

What has your doctor said about RAI or removal of thyroid - it sounds like your life would only be better without it as it sounds like it so bad it's damaging the rest of your body - hashimotos does cause muscle spasms & carpal tunnel - I read that in several different sources - you sound like you go into hypothyroid coma - I can't believe a research hospital isn't looking into your case - is this a possibility in your city/town? The losing balance/spasms etc are things I only experience when I on too high a dose of synthetic & my TSH is less than 10 - go figure ! It sounds like we have similar side effects but from different brands & different amounts - I can't for the life of me figure out why the medical community isn't doing something - at least acknowledge that these patients are not crazy - I hate egotistical doctors who refuse to listen to their patients - my very best to you & I hope you will prevail in your search to find the solution.....T.",

I have been so confused b/c my TSH showed hyper, then normal, then hypo, and hyper again since Feb. This has all been since last June. The first endo wanted me to take meds for the hypo, but I did not and it swung hyper on its own. Now my new endo wants me to take tapazole, but I am not sure. I do not really have too many symptoms and I do not want the meds to take me in the opposite direction and make me have symptoms. This is a very frustrating thing and it is hard to get straight answers from the doctors. They just want to put me on meds, but not explain it. So I have been coming here for answers. I thought Hashimotos was supposed to be hypo, so this helps me realize this can be the normal course of things.",

I hope to eventually feel better and back to \"myself\" sometime!\u00a0\u00a0This post has been a great source of support for me and really helps me feel like I am not alone...thanks to all.An update:\u00a0\u00a0I had my blood ckecked at my PCP actually just yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0Was hoping to get in earlier, but the office didn;t call me back and then they were closed, etc, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I would have liked to have my levels checked about 3 weeks ago--when I first posted here and was feeling horrible.\u00a0\u00a0But, that didin;t happen,\u00a0\u00a0Plus, it seems like sometimes the levels don't give an accurate picture anyway--either they are normal and you feel horrible, or if they are out of whack, you might miss it as the symptoms may lag behind.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway.....My TSH was 1.63, T4 was 1.1, and antibodies down to 256 (from > 1000 in June 07.)\u00a0\u00a0They didn't check T3--I had to barter for them to even check the antibody level!!!!\u00a0\u00a0 So, on paper...everything is, of course, \"fine.\"\u00a0\u00a0My doc told me to stay on 50mcg per day.Last week I felt really pretty good...the muscle weakness and brain fog had gone.\u00a0\u00a0 I was still having a funny feeling in my left eye occasionally, constipated, and a few muscle twitches (but much less than a few weeks prior.)\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, though...pretty good.Hah!!\u00a0\u00a0Just started yesterday having some GI fun...sort of had this wierd metallic / acidy taste in my mouth yesterday and most of the day today.\u00a0\u00a0No particular \"heartburn\", but I am burping more than usual????\u00a0\u00a0not too bad, but just another one of those \"fun\", transient symptoms (I hope!)\u00a0\u00a0I also did have some gurgling (like my stomach was revved up), and a really soft BM (lovely!)--\u00a0\u00a0HYPER???\u00a0\u00a0Again, a TSH of 1.63 might be too low for me--that's was I think.\u00a0\u00a0Considering I felt great with a TSH of 5.5 (prior to starting any meds or even being diagnosed, but GP at that time jsut sort of gave me the heads up, but I felt completely fine and didn't go on meds).....hhhmmmm.A few last thoughts/questions:Anyone else have a wierd taste in their mouth or bouts of acid reflux?\u00a0\u00a0I have never had any GI symptoms to speak of, so maybe it was just\u00a0\u00a0 something I ate-- I don;t know.\u00a0\u00a0It is really very mild.d\u00a0\u00a0But, since all these things keep popping up, I just assume that they may be related to my Hashi's / thyroid.I have an appt. with an Endo that was ref. to me by 2 co-workers who really like him--one has Graves, the other, Hashi's.\u00a0\u00a0The appoint. is not until July, however!!\u00a0\u00a0But, i am going to wait....what else can I do?\u00a0\u00a0I am going to bring all of my labs and questions with me...so I hope he will have some insight.\u00a0\u00a0But, in the meantime, if I should need or want to have my \"levels\" checked again....what is the standard, or should I say, what is the standard that I should ask for.\u00a0\u00a0TSH/T4/T3/antibodies??\u00a0\u00a0All???\u00a0\u00a0Just curious what anyone else has routinely checked.\u00a0\u00a0 B/C I have an HMO (lovely managed care), it's like pulling teeth to get anything done.\u00a0\u00a0The Endo that i am seeing is not even in network, and I am just paying out of pocket for the consultation--and if I need to change ins., etc, from there--I will.Does anyone know or has anyone experienced any changes in regard to the antibody level decreasing?\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if the fact that the antibody level has dropped significantly would make me feel any different..is it supposed to make you feel better, worse, or maybe doesn't matter at all??Also, I haven't had time to research \"adrenal\" involvement, but have seen that idea thrown into the mix here and there.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could just be \"happy\" with the fact that I have thyroid disease (Hashi's), and attribute my symptoms to that.\u00a0\u00a0But, because I am so up and down, I get worried that there is something else wrong, even though Hashi's seems to be the likely culprit for everything I experience....it's frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0Everytime I get a new symptom, my mind starts racing to figure out what else it could be!\u00a0\u00a0 UUGGHHH!Thanks for listening!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to all...take care!!",

As an older woman, 54, diagnosed with Hashimmoto's and grave's three years ago I find that I too have been going up and down week by week between hyper and hypo. Now I have been told that my cholesterol is over 240. Is this a hypo symptom. i never had this before. also, since I am going through menopause, I think that the doctor's all say it is menopausal, but I have many hypo symptoms most of the time with some hyper days. I go to the endocrinologist next week so I'll see what she says. But it is great to know that it is not all in my head.thanks for the posts",

            "answer": "Hi there, just wanted to say by all means have your doc check for anything else you or he/she thinks could be wrong (especially if your insurance will pick it up) On the other hand it does sound like you could have gone hyper - which happens to many of us so always err on the cautious side and ask doc if you could try lesser dose to see how you feel - hyper doesn't always mean energy or weight loss - this often has the same effects as hypo but far harder on your body. Be careful especially with Armour - it's way more potent due to having t3 component. I just found a new doc who will test all my hormone levels besides thyroid so I did blood work and now am waiting to do saliva test for other levels and cortisol, adrenal etc. Also, this doc treats only w/ bioidentical hormones not chemical or pregant mare's urine, ie. Premarin, Depo, etc. Do get your hormone levels checked, also, I quit eating wheat 9/23/08 and this solved alot of gastro problems - also, I exercise and eat no hydrogenated oils and eat organic, no hormone foods. All these things do a world of good for folks w/ immune system problems like Hashimoto's. Also, started accupuncture w/ a doc at a teaching hospital and taking chinese herbs. This has helped me feel fabulous, down side is it is expensive for accupuncture. Went to an endo at same hospital and he couldn't get over how small my thyroid is - it used to be huge, now I swallow handfuls of vitamins no problem. Do all you can to help yourself. I wish I could be of more help. I went off all thyroid hormone 3 months ago and feel great because I eventually go hyper even on only 15mcg a day. I know my tsh has gone down 10 points since accupuncture and herbs so right now I will see what happens with other hormones which are low (estrogen & testosterone) and will then think about dealing with taking thyroid hormone again. Wish I had some insight for you but I always used to ask doc to lower dose to see if I felt better because the hypo/hyper thing gets so confusing it is sometimes hard to tell what you are so worst thing is to go too high as you don't want to go hyper.***Be sure to get vitamin D checked - this is often low in thyroid patients and can cause depression if too low.By all means take vitamins if you need to.

A good doctor will listen to how you feel not your lab values. I tend to stay a little more hypo (with my doctor's okay) because hyper makes my heart hurt and I'm too out of breath. Talk to your doctor - if he/she is listening then your doctor should find a happy medium with you to feel better. By the way, I was tested for Graves too and it was negative for the antibodies - some of us just react this way and there are numerous theories why. It may take some months to find an amount that works for you with your doctors help. Hope it all works out for you!",

I can understand the Ativan use as thyrotoxicosis can cause a very high level of anxiety. I had a thyroiditis episode that gave me two different thyroid storms while I was being treated with a chemotherapy. Unbeknownst to me I was a Hashi's patient and the Interferon really ticked off my immune system, causing it to wage war on my thyroid. The beta blockers were temporary and they controlled the high heart rate and blood pressure that the thyroiditis caused.It sounds like you may have been in a hyper state when you were started on the meds. Do you have any labs that the more knowledgeable can see from that time and now? They may be able to tell you what was going on...~MM",

My hypothesis is that if my Ab levels are high it could explain the hyper symptoms - the antibodies could be attacking my thyroid, causing follicles to burst and dumping thyroid hormone into my system and making me hyper (called \"thyroid dump\"). But it would have been helpful to have the levels measured when I was experiencing the worst of those (things have since gotten somewhat better). We'll see.",

I've done this numerous times, when I needed a dosage between the manufactured doses.That said, if you are only getting tested for TSH, you really don't know what dose you need.\u00a0\u00a0TSH is a pituitary hormone and can fluctuate greatly, even intra day; it is not necessarily indicative of actual thyroid hormone status.You need to be tested for the active thyroid hormones, which are Free T3 and Free T4.\u00a0\u00a0Free T4 is considered a storage hormone and can't be used directly; it must be converted to Free T3, which is the hormone used directly by the cells.It's possible that you need to add a medication with a T3 component, such as cytomel; or switch to a desiccated porcine medication, containing both T3 and T4.Without adequate testing, there's no way you can get adequate treatment and get your levels stabilized.It takes 4-6 weeks for dosage change to take place, when one is on a T4 only medication.\u00a0\u00a0It simply takes patience to regulate levels, but patience does no good, if you aren't getting the proper tests.",

    "question": "This is kind of a survey/question to those of you diagnosed hypothyroid Hashimotos but who feel or actually are cycling into a hyper (not hypo) state. Do you seem to have symptoms of hyper like red in the face, hi b.p., shakiness, depression, hot all the time not hot flashes, hot tempered, double vision or poor vision etc etc but yet you feel run down, tired, fuzzy mentally, slow gastro processes so you go to the doctor and he/she says you are right in target range for tsh below 3.0 or thereabouts and great free t4 free t3 levels and all else looks good so maybe they raise your thyroid med dose thinking you're still a little hypo (not hyper) or have you lower dose in case you are actually hyper and for a short while you feel better or feel worse right away so now you don't know if you're up or down ? Yes, that is a run on sentence but hopefully I'm clear - here is my theory - maybe you have gone so hyper your body is shutting down or slowing down to protect itself or it's just breaking\u00a0\u00a0down altogether - Has anyone had this experience and if so what do you do about it or what does your doctor do or say to help you? And if our thyroid gland worked normally would pituitary and other supporting systems output consistently same amounts ? I know this is a good question for Dr. Lupo as he actually believes there is a phenomena as Hashitoxicosis unlike my past 3 endos. I'm curious what you folks think about this and what your experiences have been.",
