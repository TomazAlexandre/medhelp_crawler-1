            "answer": "Your baby isn't full term until 39 weeks. They have found recently that babies have a lot of brain development in the last couple weeks. I understand you're uncomfortable,\u00a0\u00a0we all are but your child is worth a couple weeks of being uncomfortable to helake sure they are developed the best that they can be. Beyond that, I did nipple stimulation for HOURS and it didnt work. Pregnancy is the best test of patience I think we will ever have because nothing works unless baby is ready to come out. If something does, it's a coincidence.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't get my daughter til 40+5. And that was even with 2!!!! membrane sweeps.",

            "answer": "I agree with Fliickan I think it's best to wait babies lungs aren't fully developed until they're full term. You're almost there you can do it you don't want your baby ending up in NICU. I'm 32 weeks and I pray everyday that my baby don't come early until she's fully developed I'm uncomfortable too but I want a healthy baby and so do you trust me. Be patient and everything will work out great. God bless you and your sweet baby :)",
