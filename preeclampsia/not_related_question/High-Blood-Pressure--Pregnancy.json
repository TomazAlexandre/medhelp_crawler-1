            "answer": "i had high bp towards the end of my pregnancy, as a part of preeclampsia.The only advice i have is that you stay on your left side as much as possible. If my readings were high, my OB always had the nurse retake my BP while I was laying on my left side. The numbers were always lower then. While in the hospital, even after delivery, he had the nurses take it that way. I guess it gave him a clearer picture of what was going on, since he attirubuted some of the problems to postural hypertension.It sounds like they are taking very good care of you and being extra cautious. That's great. Hang in there as long as possible, and relax as much as you can. i had to have DD at 36 weeks. They didn't bother inducing because my doctor felt the chances of induction being successful were low and that i'd have to have a c-sec anyways. plus, i was very sick by that point anyways.",

            "answer": "Tiredbuthappy gave some great advice.\u00a0\u00a0I also suffered from high BP and everything turned out ok - I was induced 1 week early and had a successful vaginal delivery.Q: was your BP monitor calibrated by the hospital?\u00a0\u00a0This is important so you dont compare apples with oranges (i.e. if your home monitor is not calibrated it could be showing readings higher or lower than the actual values).In your situation, bedrest is very important and as Tiredbuthappy mentioned, lie on your left side as much as possible.\u00a0\u00a0It will be a pain to do this, but is important - walking around and activity can raise BP.\u00a0\u00a0Limit your salt intake and drink lots of water.",

            "answer": "Hi There...I am actually due today, but 2 weeks ago I went in for my week 38 check up and I had high blood pressure and a massive amount of swelling.\u00a0\u00a0(I gained 6 lbs. in a week from water alone!)\u00a0\u00a0I too have never had protein in my urine and this was the first time my blood pressure was high.They ran some blood work for pre-eclampsia which came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on bedrest as well to combat the high BP and swelling.\u00a0\u00a0A few days later when I went back to the doctor my BP was fine, but my swelling was still out of control.\u00a0\u00a0Again, no protein in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0I am being induced tomorrow because of the swelling.But, point is... I have been following my doctors directions of bedrest.\u00a0\u00a0It isn't fun, but hey... it lowered my BP, right?\u00a0\u00a0:)\u00a0\u00a0So, just listen to the guidance of your doctors and hopefully your BP goes down soon, because it is much too early for you to meet your baby :)\u00a0\u00a0Also, I would try not to worry about your BP because you may be causing it to be high by stressing out about it.",

    "question": "I am about 23 weeks pregnant with my first, due in late June. A few weeks ago, my doctor pointed out that I've been having high blood pressure readings in the 140's over 80's, but I have not had any protein in my urine or other signs leading to pre-eclempsia (other than occasional foot swelling). On Feb. 18, my doctor put me on a week of bedrest and a medication called Methyldopa. When she checked me a week later, Feb. 25, my levels were high again and she sent me to the hospital to be monitored for a couple of days and do a 24-hour urine analysis (they also doubled my dose of meds). In the hospital, they took my BP every hour and it was consistently low. After finding NO protein in my urine, they let me leave but have me on bedrest until Tuesday. Since I've been home, my home monitor is showing elevated levels, not real high, but not as low as the hospital. That has me worried.I'm happy the docs are keeping a close eye on me, but also VERY worried because if the BP gets worse, they'd have to induce me early (when the little bean isn't even ready yet)...*** Has anyone suffered high blood pressure during pregnancy and did everything turn out OK for you??? Advice??Thanks = ( Heather",
