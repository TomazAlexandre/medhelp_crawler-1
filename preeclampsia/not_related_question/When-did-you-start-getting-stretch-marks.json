But I did get just a few tiny stretch marks on my one breast by about 2 months. Sometimes it has more to do with how fast you gain the weight or grow. My belly has grown at a nice even rate, but my breasts just all of a sudden grew to a bigger cup size within like a few days back at the beginning. Oh well, DH will be the only one who sees my few stretch marks...I highly doubt that he will care at all.",
