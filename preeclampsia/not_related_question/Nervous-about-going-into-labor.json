            "answer": "No advice bt I am having a repeat csection on the 23rd. I must admit I'm super stoked & ready to meet my daughter bt I'm scared. It's been almost 8 yrs. My son was an emergency csection & bc the epidural failed I was put to sleep. This time I'll have a spinal which scares me bc unlike the epidural there is no feeling at all & I've heard there is burning when it's given. I'd much rather prefer to be put under again. LOL The closer I get the more nervous bt that's normal for all mother's. I jus pray & ask God to keep me & my baby. I sort of wish labor would start before the date cause I'm in so much pain bc I did want to try for VBAC bt where I live they dnt do that. The docs are all for it bt the hospital doesn't allow it. They'd jus cut me again.",

            "answer": "@PoeticPep- All I remember with the spinal was that it stung for a split second, like getting a shot and then everything went numb. They delivered my baby, sewed me back up and had me in my resting room all within 58 minutes. I was very thankful that it went so well. This time I'm just nervous about going into labor because I don't know what contractions feel like, what its like when your water breaks or who will deliver my baby if my water breaks and my doctor is not on call. So it's the unknown that gets me, but you're right I will leave it in God's hands. :)I wish you the best of luck! Scheduled c-sections, in my opinion, are fabulous because everyone is on queue and not under pressure in an emergency. Either way, you'll do great!",

I mean I would assume that is the slight random pain I've been feeling, but I'm not 100% only because I never had even one contraction with my first. He was perfectly cozy and content (most likely because I ate everything in site and he loved it), and he probably would have stayed in there a few more weeks if we let him. Lol but not this one, she wants out. So I'm anxious to see how this plays out.We only have a few more days! Yay! :) Good luck!!!",

LOL I have a short vaginal canal & still her head could jus barely be felt. She only dropped enuf to add more pain & discomfort bt still so very high up. So I'm due for csection in 12 day's with no sign's of labor bt she is always super busy. I'm up most of the night bc of her. If I go in labor early I would still have a csection tho. My water started leaking 2 day's before I was due & the contractions came the day before. It never broke, the doc had to do it. I had an emergency csection bc I failed to progress early on & my son wasn't tolerating the contraction's well & I still had a long way to go.",

Now I'm no expert\u00a0\u00a0on contractions bc I have high pain tolerence. Its like pain in your uterus as well as your belly getting tight and it's in intervals. You can time them and they will last longer then a few seconds. Now if you do go into labor, call them and they will have you cone in right away. They will stop the labor and start to prep you for surgery within about a hr or so after stopping your labor. And it will go pretty much the same as your previous\u00a0\u00a0c section. Now the spinal I remember\u00a0\u00a0was a burning sinsation\u00a0\u00a0then everything went numb slowly. And they finish prepping\u00a0\u00a0you.",

    "question": "I have a c-section scheduled on the 19th of this month (personal choice as I did the same with my first. Not at\u00a0\u00a0all prepared for vbac so I'm going with what I'm used to). But my husband's little cousin had a dream that our baby will be here on the 14th. Which I thought was strange because he's only 11 and for him to be so adamant about her arrival, it just makes me nervous that I may go into labor before the 19th. I have been having crazy dreams of my water breaking or looking at a calendar and hearing \"she's coming in a few days are you ready?! etc...I didn't go into labor with my first so I don't know what to expect and I'm getting real nervous. Excited too, of course but nervous.Any mommys out there have any advice for me or have had a c-section and went into labor before the scheduled date? How did it go?",
