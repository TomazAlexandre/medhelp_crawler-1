            "answer": "If you don't feel comfortable with inducing you can always say no. If there are no other problems I would say no and request to be placed on nst's (non stress tests) til he either comes or a real problem appears. The nst will just monitor his heart beat, movement and your bp for about 30 mins or so. I am going to just request nsts instead of an induction. I did nsts with both of my others and they were born healthy on their own we just monitored for stress on them.",

            "answer": "My doc said that the reason they offer a induction is to lower the risk of c section. If your pressure really shoots up they may have to rush you to delivery. I was only have mild issues and got inducted at 38 weeks and 3 days. I'm glad I did because I just had a feeling something was off. My pressure was crazy high and her heartrate was being effected. If your not comfortable don't do it but ask your doc why?? If they really feel danger they will give you information to back their decision.",

    "question": "Hi guys. I'm currently 36wks+4. At my 36 week check up my doctor was concerned about my BP which read as 156/96 but when she checked it again it had dropped to 138/82. She's told me that if it's high again at my 37 week checkup that she will want me to go to the hospital and get induced.Now I normally have a high BP (120's-130's over 70's/80's) and since the check up my BP has been reading between 135-145/ 95 on average. My concern is that I do not want to be induced and I don't want to be pressured in to it if my BP is only \"slightly\" high. Baby is completely healthy and even measuring big. He doesn't show any symptoms of chronic hypertension and I'm not experiencing any symptoms of it either.\u00a0\u00a0She's also been checking my urine at every appointment and has made no mention of proteins so I don't think that I'm experiencing preeclampsia.For any of you that may have experience with hypertension, if I'm only in the 140's/90's do you think I'd still be safe to say no to an induction? The stories I've heard on here previously have stated crazy high BP'S such as above 200/100 so I'm just wondering if anyone knows what that \"critical balance\" might be.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously I don't want to put my baby in any danger but he's not ready to come yet and I don't want to force it unless it's truly necessary.",
