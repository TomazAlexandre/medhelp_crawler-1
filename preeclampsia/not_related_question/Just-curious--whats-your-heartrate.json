I also had problems with palpatations\u00a0\u00a0with my daughter (late in pregnancy) - I ended up going to the ER one day because they were so bad. Tests all came back fine and the resounding answer from the doctors is that palpatations are common in pregnancy.I've started having them again this pregnancy though not frequently yet. I hope that all works out for you. :)",

            "answer": "Sorry... i've been very busy and when not busy, i've been so tired.To answer most inquiries, some palpatations and increase in HR is normal during pregnancy.My cardiologist was very befuddled. He definitely does not like my case because he can't figure out what's wrong- just like last time. i wore the halter all day yesterday, so hopefully it will give some answers as to what's going on... even if he can't say why. He even suggested a couple of times that i see someone who specializes in this (he thinks it may be related to my preeclampsia last time, but my OB disagrees). He's confused because my bloodwork is perfect, my blood pressure is low, and my heart is structurally sound.My OB was disappointed in what my cardiologist had to say. he said we could go see another cardiologist, but he also suggested i see pulmonologist since shortness of breath is a consistant symptom. it's a long shot, but maybe the high HR is due to shortness of breath and not vice versa. Plus, he knows the pulmonologist he recommended well, and feels he is a good diagnostician and won't just sit and scratch his head.I have been feeling a little better. I still have a high HR, palpatations, and shortness of breath but it's not as extreme. My cold is mostly gone, so i suspect that was exasperating things. I am back at work, and doing OK. The worst part is walking to and from the building and up the stairs. that always leads to palpatations. My cardiologist said that if necessary, we can get me a temporary handicap parking permit. I think that might help.",
