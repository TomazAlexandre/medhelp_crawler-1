I am having my baby at a birth centre and am getting looked after by a team of midwives so I don't have an OB. The next test I have is at 36 weeks for Group B Strep (GBS). Is everyone getting the GBS test?\u00a0\u00a0I was told it's not compulsary and that results can change during pregnancy... eg you might be positive one week and negative the next, so testing is prob a waste of time??",

I have a GBS test at 36 weeks and go to appointments every week after that point too...like the other ladies. My midwife does recommend getting the GBS and I just had a friend that was positive for it. She delivered to quickly to get the antibiotics and her little boy got the GBS and was in the NICU for a week. So, I'm doing that one just to ease my mind. I also have to be cleared by an OB at 36 weeks to deliver at the birthing center instead of the hospital. It's some law. They just make sure the baby is head down and that I don't have any obvious issues like placenta previa or anything. Other than that...It's a waiting game.",

I'll be 33 weeks, then I'll see her at 35wk and from 37wk on, I'll see her weekly until D-Day. I'm also getting the GBS test done somwhere around 35 weeks, like Spiket, I also have a friend that tested positive for it, and didn't get all of the antibiotics in during labor, and her little one spent a few extra days in NICU, so I recommend it. Our bodies have a way of fighting off infection that our babies can't yet, so just a thought. As far as exams go, I'll all for it once I'm 37 weeks, just to see if labor is impending, and to make sure she gets turned around. She's been in the breech position for the past few weeks, so I'm HOPING she flips soon, so I can go on with my natural birth plan. I'm not sure if/when I'll get a stress test, I think it depends on if I show any signs of preeclampsia, which so far all is good. :0)",
