It was her feet she had no room to move she was pretty much stuck, the last few weeks with her she never moved 'it freaked me out' but I remember the pain was horrible.. The tailbone pain is from the pressure I think.. When I gave birth my tailbone was damaged 'pretty much broke' I could barely sit for months after I had her.. I wouldnt worry about that happening though, I haven't heard anyone else say that happened to them.. But hang in there, you're almost done!",
