I was dialeted 1 centimeter when I went in\u00a0\u00a0they had to break my water and gave me cervidial,and the next morning only went up to 2cnt. So they gave me pitosin, I didn't start to have consistent contractions until I was 4cnt, tried to get an epidural but it only took on one side. I made it to 6cnt and wouldn't go past that for 2hrs. My blood pressure skyrocketed and my baby girls heart rate was lowering so they took me back, put me under and within an hour I believe my daughter was born. 9pnds1oz 20 3/4 inches long. I was in labor all together for 18hrs.",

            "answer": "Was in labor for two days. Had my son a day shy of 39 weeks. It was pretty bad the last couple of hours i had to get my membrane stripped because after a day and a half of early labor i was still at 1/2 a cm after she did that the contractions were more intense and within 4 hours i went to 8 cm had him at 1 am the next day. Pushin was pretty fast or at least it seemed since seeing him come out looked fast. He was 7lb 7oz",
