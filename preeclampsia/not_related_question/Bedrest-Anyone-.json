I wasnt allowed to fix my own food or get outta bed unless to use bathroom and I was restricted to showers every other day (like that happened\u00a0\u00a0..lol). It was cuz they thought I would go into preterm labor because of symptoms I was having at 7mos. Turned out that I nearly had uterine rupture...the lining was very very thin and when doc did c-section the intial line to mark went straight thru and even knicked my bladder. I had to stay on the darn catheter longer which was a pain cuz I itched to get up and go...I hate laying in bed...lol. So this go round we are watching the symptoms but so far...this one has been so different that I dont feel like I did with my first or second...so we are hoping all goes and continues on well and no bed rest this time!",

The baby is right on my cervix..the contractions are few and far between but what are the chances I'll have to be on bedrest for the rest of this pregnancy? My cervix shortens to 2.7 when they pressed on my belly.",
