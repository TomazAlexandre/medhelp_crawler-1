            "answer": "If it's pitting adema it can be a sign of preeclampsia (especially if the swelling moves to hands and face). When you make an indent does it stay or pop right back out? If it stays it is pitting adema.Go to your doc and have them check your blood pressure, urine protein, and look at your adema. Do you have any other symptoms, like blurred vision, headache, confusion? You're already 40 weeks so there wouldn't be any harm in inducing you now.It can be 'normal' but if it's a lot of swelling, you have to take precaution for preeclampsia.",
