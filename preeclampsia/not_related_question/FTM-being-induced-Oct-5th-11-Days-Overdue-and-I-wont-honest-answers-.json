            "answer": "It really depends on the person as to how induction goes. My induction was horrible. I had thirty six hours of excruciating piggybacking contractions, two epidurals that didn't work, and ended in an emergency c section because I stopped progressing and LO heartrate kept dropping and mine was going through the roof. Some women will say theirs went great, and a lot will say theirs ended in sections. It really just depends. I personally will never allow my doctors to induce me again with any future children. Especially after I read an article about \"informed refusal of induction\"",

            "answer": "I was induced with my first my water broke and I only dialated 1 cm in. 6 hours and the next 13 hours was horrible my epideral didn't work whatsoever I threw up twice from the pain and progressed too quickly to try for the drugs again. At the end I was having trouble catching my breath I have asthma that flares up when getting an extreme workout they had to give me an oxygen mask cuz my daughters heart rate kept dropping from not enough oxygen getting to her and because I wanted the epideral I hate to wear a blood pressure thing.on my arm and just so happened that every contraction I had it'd take my blood pressure at the same time so I'd be contracting.and my arm would be.going numb cuz it was so tight and it made everything that much worse... Hopefully never have to be.induced again most horrible experience.ever..",

            "answer": "Induction does turn out to be a different experience for everyone... but mine went \"okay\" considering... I was induced 10 days late with my daughter. They used cervidil to ripen my cervix I think I had to leave it in for 12 hours or so... but my contractions started while that was inside preparing my cervix. It took a long time for me to dilate to 4 cm, about 18 hours or so. And then I got the epidural as soon as they would let me because the contractions were very painful and very close together ever since they started. I seemed to progress better with the dilation after I got it. They broke my water and baby started stressing a bit so they put sterile water back inside of me and put me on oxygen etc. When it came time to push, I pushed for an hour with no luck and took a 30 minute rest and then pushed another hour with no luck so they gave me a choice to try a vacuum assisted birth or go ahead with a csection.. I chose to try the vacuum first and that worked luckily! Altogether from the start of contractions I was in labor for 28 hours. I'm now pregnant with my second 11 days until my due date and I'm praying I won't have to go through another induction! Good luck!",

Didn't feel anything but little cramps so they broke my water at 7 pm than instantly contractions were bad every 2 mins. Got epidural at 945 and by 1245 it was time to push and had baby Sophia at 118 am. So start to finish was only 11 hours. Good luck hun ur almost done!!!",

Of course it was very very painful, but I expected it to be.
