            "answer": "Well, I am just really beginning to think that my doctors dont care. I just called and talked to the midwife at the hospital....telling her my concerns. How I have been out of work since December, that this is affecting my life....my relationship with my husband and our well being.....and asked what the choices were. She said they wont induce unless medically necessary. So, I asked her to check on my 24 hour urine that I dropped off yesterday to see if it was any worse than 309 (protein level) and she said that it is 392. So, its worse, but she said it could be worse than that. She told me to wait til tomorrow and call the doctors office and speak with someone about it..and go from there. I am just at the point where I feel like they dont care!",

            "answer": "Lance, unfortunately I don't think they will take any of that into consideration. As much as your finances and relationship with your spouse is very important...to them the safety of you and your baby is most important. So unless you or your baby are medically at risk, they won't induce. I got nervous when they scheduled mine because I thought something was wrong and his reasoning was because he thinks if I go any longer than 5 days past my due date I won't be able to deliver. But he would not schedule it a second earlier. So they do have their reasons.But like you, I think if your that close to your due date, your healthy and the baby is healthy there's no reason why they can't try inducing you...especially considering all things. But as doctors they just like to see mother nature take its course. But I really hope they give you some answers! I know how frustrating it is girl! Try and relax and remember everything happens for a reason! I too am worrying about the weather...my Mom said to expect a blizzard Tuesday into Wednesday! Which means we'll have nasty snow and than ice pretty much into the weekend. I'm like great...I'll go into labor then! But just remember, a lot of things are out of our control and we can't do anything about it...so try and take it easy!! And were here for you if you need to talk or vent :)Keep us posted!",

My level is close to 400 and when my MIL heard that...she packed her bags and is heading here tomorrow from VA because she has no doubt they will induce this week with a number like that. SHe works on the delivery floor (RN) of the VA hospital and spoke with the MD's that she works with and they all said to her that they would 100% induce with a number like that. So, I am hoping that that is the news that I get tomorrow morning. Hopefulyl at least...because my MIL is leaving first thing in the morning and the office doesnt open until 830 am..so it would really stink for her to be on her way to find out that they arent going to do anything and to have to turn back around.

I know they have been back and forth on it...but now its a matter of comfort for me and hubby and I would like to know what you ladies think!!!Being that I have been out of work since December 30th, my maternity leave started then. I was banking on my tax return to help me pay my bills throughout the rest of my maternity leave once she arrives. However, we did out taxes last night and, we are not getting NEARLY what we thought we were getting back. I immediately started crying. I pretty much cried all day yesterday......I am stressed to the max. We cant afford to miss a mortgage or car payment, or fall behind on anything. Do you think that they will take any of this into consideration???DOes the patient have any choice whatsoever in the matter??? I just cant do this...I need this baby out!I am officially 38 weeks, I dont see the harm...but dont know what they are going to say!",
