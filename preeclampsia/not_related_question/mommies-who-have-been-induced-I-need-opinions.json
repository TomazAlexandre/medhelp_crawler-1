At 28 hours of barely to no progress they suggested a c section.\u00a0\u00a0So my experience is if your not dialated at all I wouldn't suggest it. Every person I know who wasn't somewhat dialated ended up with a hard time. Those who were at least a little were fine. Good luck.",

My labor went terrible, my little guy could not handle the pitocin, and I had to have an emergency c-section. My best advice is to do everything you can to have your baby without being induced! It is different for everyone but from my experience I would have never wanted to be induced if not for a serious medical need in my situation.",

I definitely wouldn't let them break your water until you're far enough dilated (I'd say a minimum of six cm) that labor is unlikely to stall. If pitocen or cervadil isn't starting your labor and there's no medical need to induce, you can just stop, go home, and try again in a few days. UNLESS your water is broken, that is.",
