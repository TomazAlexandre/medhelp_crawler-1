            "answer": "There is absolutely no way to know for sure if baby will be OK born past 37wks. 37wks is considered full term...but for a first pregnancy, it's actually closer to 40wks. Chances are fairly good that a 37-wk baby will be \"OK\" but many 37wk babies end up in the NICU because they are behind on one or another developmental milestone.There is so much vital development, both physically (weight gain) and mentally (brain development) in the last weeks of pregnancy, and it's really not a good idea to deprive baby of this womb time if you have a choice.Most women who induce before 39-40wks do so for medical reasons (i.e. one or the other, mom or baby, is at risk)...and while you can try to naturally induce labor on your own, most likely none of it will work. Your body will not go into labor until it's ready, because it's protecting baby as long as possible.So would I advise finding ways to make baby come early? No...best to let baby come on her own time frame...while she will PROBABLY be OK...probably isn't good enough for me, personally. I've had 2 pregnancies go to full-term already (40wks and 39wks4d and I'm pregnant with #3) so I know how miserable and exhausting it can be, but it's not worth the risk to me to induce or try to get baby to come earlier.Why is it you're so eager for baby to come before 40wks?",

            "answer": "I want to add to what \"whatstheodds\" said...if baby comes on her own before 40wks, that's entirely different - that means that your body and baby have agreed that it's time, and baby's lungs have a much higher chance of being ready for life outside of the womb.",

            "answer": "Just being at risk doesn't mean you actually have it. It is better for the baby to be there for as long as possible. It's going to be uncomfortable, and it's going to drag on. I spent 9 months vomiting everyday, all day and wasn't able to eat close to any food. I prayed to just die, because I was so tired of being sick and I was incredibly weak. It was a struggle half the time to even want to get out of bed.Pregnancy does not end because YOU are uncomfortable. When the baby is ready, they will come--you shouldn't force them out otherwise.",

            "answer": "Trust me, I understand. I had a miscarriage, then got pregnant again. With that pregnancy, I found out I was having a beautiful baby girl...and then I got kidney stones. many kidney stones. I ended up having to have surgery at 34wks on my kidney because it was so swollen and infected. So not only was I miserable from end-of-pregnancy and scared to lose my baby because of my history with miscarriage, I was recovering from kidney surgery. VERY painful. She came at 40wks on her own. It wasn't easy to tough it out....but she was perfect, so I knew it was worth it.With my 2nd child, I started having weird neurological complications about halfway through the pregnancy...by 37wks I was going blind for a few hours every day, and I was fainting and vomiting from horrible headaches. I held on until 39w4d before they induced me because I had gone completely blind for the better part of a day and they were worried that permanent damage was going to be done to my optic nerve if we didn't induce.I'm pregnant with #3 now and about 21wks...who knows what it's going to be like? but unless one of us is in danger (imminent danger, not possible danger) I will be holding on until baby is ready because it's best.So trust me, as you can read, I know what it's like to be afraid for baby..to be\u00a0\u00a0miserable, to be sick, to be \"ready\" for baby...but until baby is \"ready\" you've got to do your best to hang in there. I hear from so many first-time mommies that they want baby to come ASAP, and I always say \"this is the first of many sacrifices that you will make for your baby as a new mom....toughing it out for the last few weeks can make the difference between a baby born when he/she is ready, and a baby who has to be in the NICU because you wanted to rush things. becoming a mother means a lot of patience...and this is a good time to learn it.\"Best of luck to you..I'm sure your doctor has his eye on the potential for preeclampsia and if it becomes a big risk, I'm sure he'll discuss your options...but the reasons he says \"you can begin to try to do things on your own\" and not \"let's schedule an induction\" is because no doctor worth his salt will induce you at 37wks without a reason for your first baby.",

Read what I went through...both times it was a different type of hell but if you can hang in there and baby doesn't decide to come before 40wks on her own, it's definitely best.I had the opposite trouble with my son..my blood pressure kept bottoming out - like 60/37..and I was passing out regularly as a result.Everyone has their challenges at the end of pregnancy - some worse than others - but just think of what a difference a few more weeks can make in the first days of your daughter's life.If your blood pressure becomes an issue, I'm sure your doctor will consider your options...but short of that, the best thing you can do now is relax and wait. Sounds like aside from the blood pressure everything has been pretty typical, even if it's uncomfortable. and trust me even the most normal pregnancy is uncomfortable. heck, it's miserable in the last couple weeks.but you can hang in there...just gotta set your mind to it :-)",

More than likely, they will survive better on the inside. 37 weeks is NOT the magical time when baby can come and be fine. Many still have breathing issues and have to be in NICU or on breathing machines. As someone else said, pregnancy is only the first of many things you will sacrifice as a mother and parent. You wouldn't force your baby to do something they're not ready for after they come, why start now?",

            "answer": "If your dr. thinks you are ready and is ok delivering the baby at 37 weeks then that's up to your dr. and you, not what other people say. IF your dr. thinks it could be time they can strip your membranes and you can walk a lot, have sex those kinds of things with help get labor going if your body is ready. If it's not those things won't work. It doesn't hurt to walk or have sex...walking will help bring baby down and is always good for you....you won't be able to have sex for six weeks after the baby comes so have as much as you want lol.Those things can bring on labor if your body is ready...if you have high blood pressure and it's better for you to deliver your baby early your Dr's will make that decision and will induce you themselves while being monitored...they will only do this if they feel it's better for you and the baby.",

            "answer": "Would you really want to take the risk that your baby could have complications for the rest of it's life because you didn't think you could handle it a few more weeks? That's just something to think about I had high blood pressure in the beginning and low towards the end I was puking and passing out everywhere. It was so bad I would put on bed rest had to drop college and quit my job. I couldn't keep down water so we all know what is it like and trust me you can do it. When baby is ready to come baby will come and if the doctors think the baby needs to come early he will let you know so no worries. Just think how wonderful it will be when you that baby for the first time knowing that it was safe inside of you until it was ready. My sister did talk with her doctor and they compromised she didn't think she could do it and he didn't want to take the baby that early but they did meet in the middle and wouldn't you know it she did a ton of walking and two days before she was scheduled to have baby she had him. What ever is best for you is in the end between you and your doctor. Good luck and take care and hang in there if ya can :)",
