            "answer": "LOL... I have my c-section scheduled for October 11th. I probably won't make it til then. I was hoping more for a September baby. I just hope she's not born on my nephews birthday which is the 9th of October. My daughter already shares her birthday with her cousin, I don't want another kid of mine sharing their birthday. I actually had my daughter at 37 weeks so hopefully the same with this baby. How is everyone else going? Anyone else think they'll have thier baby before thier due date?",

            "answer": "Well I officially have 3 weeks 2 days until my due date which is kinda freaking me out. I had my last daughter at 38 weeks and that is only 9 days away from where I am now... yikes! 2 1/2 weeks ago I was 2 cm 60% effaced and a -1 station but I wasn't checked this appointment since I'm not on bed rest anymore (YAY!) so I don't know if I've made any progress or not. I'm kinda hoping I haven't since I am determined to have a Libra baby and the sign of Libra doesn't start for 8 more days. Baby is supposedly measuring in at about 5 lbs 4 ozs so she could be a small one like Aspen was. Kinda glad I stocked up on that preemie clothes during bed rest. I tested negative for GBS this time around so I only have to be at the hospital 24 hours and actually not have an iv this time! Means I can walk and mess around during labor instead of being shackled to my bed like a prisoner! I haven't packed my hospital bag yet but my sister is supposed to be returning my suitcase to me tonight so I might do it either later tonight or tomorrow or next week some time. I do however have Navy's hospital bag packed and ready! I have her going home outfit and her possible picture outfit. Although I'm thinking of getting her newborn pictures taken somewhere other than the hospital so we'll see if it is actually needed. The room is finally 100% complete and is sitting in pristine condition waiting for her to arrive. The other day I got this huge cleaning urge and actually pulled out the washer and dryer to scrub behind them. DH wasn't happy. Hmm... other than that nothing really big happening. Still getting contractions on and off and they are starting to get worse... but that is expected at the end of pregnancy. I just wish I knew when she was coming. With Aspen my water broke and so I knew I had to go to the hospital and that was it. This time I'm worried I won't know when I am actually in labor and I am so stubborn I refuse to go to the hospital unless I am 100% certain. This could be bad if she decides to come fast. Oh and DH decided that he is going to take a week off when the baby is born! I think it is very sweet of him to be there with us for the first couple days. I'm going to need that help!",

            "answer": "lol. Alaysha is correct! Jett arrived on aug. 30. I had placental abrubtion and had to have an emergency c-section. It was a very scary situation and I am so luck that everything ended up ok. I was cooking dinner and blood starting running down my leg. I had no pain and drove myself to the hospital. It was very quick and painless. The only thing that really scared me was doing it all alone. My husband was 3 hours away.\u00a0\u00a0Jett was 4 lbs. 15 ounces and 18.5\". He had to stay in the NICU for 9 days. He is finally home and doing great. He is now 5 lbs and 19\" long and as cute as a button! lol. Thanks for all the prayers! Good luck to everyone else!!! And just to let you first time moms know....(if you're having a c-section) it's not bad at all. The epidural didn't hurt a bit. Nothing was half as bad as I expected it to be. Even getting the staples taken out 3 days after the delivery didn't hurt at all. Oh and the baby weight seems to be coming off\u00a0\u00a0pretty easy too. Without working out! The only thing that isn't working for me is breastfeeding. And that is because he was in the NICU with a feeding tube and then they introduced bottles right away. So he doesn't want to breastfeed and it's hard to keep my supply up. But I\"m trying everything I can to keep pumping so he can have as much as I can give him!Good Luck Ladies!!!!",

She said they wouldn't stop me, so we shall see! I am on bedrest, but it doesn't seem to be helping all that much. I have been on Prometrium too for contractions, but that also hasn't helped much. Baby is measuring big and so am I, so I guess they don't think it will be a big deal if I do go into labor anytime soon! There is a full moon on the 23rd (and I know that it doesn't really say much as it doesn't happen to everyone and we can't really say if its true or not) and I can see if I apply to that or not..lol!I am glad I found this forum b/c its so neat being able to talk to others who are due the same month I am!!!!",

            "answer": "I would put all my egg in delivering early just due to dilation. Freshlove has been like 3 cm and pretty effaced for weeks and hasn't delivered. I was put on bed rest at 32 weeks and told I wouldn't make it to term and I'm 2 cm 60% effaced and she is almost fully engaged and that was 2 weeks ago (don't know what I am now) but I am now 36 weeks almost 37 and off bed rest and still nothing. I heard that its common to dilate early with the more pregnancies you have so being dilated if we've already had one isn't unusual. Wouldn't it be amazing if doctors could give us a legitimate time line for delivery? I have to admit I'm slightly po'ed that I was told I would have her early went through all that stress and the steroid shots to develop her lungs had to be bored out of my mind and leave work a month early for NOTHING. I wish I hadn't even listened to their advice. I know they did it as a precaution but god how annoying. My sister even took work off for 2 weeks to come and watch my child since I wasn't allowed to get up to even open the fridge for her.",

Several times I've gone 5 to 6 hours with regular contractions, but I tell Jacob it isn't time yet and they magically stop- weird right? I'm determined to have an October baby! I feel like I'll go earlier than expected, but I bet I'm wrong. I am due the 10th which happens to be my dad's 50th birthday... so for lunch I celebrate his birthday, then for dinner I celebrate my father-in-law's 50th birthday (seriously how does that even happen). That was the ONLY day that worked for BOTH parties so everyone could make it. So I'll probably be one of the 3% (I think it is) women who delivers ON her due date hahaha.I haven't packed a hospital bag- I know they say not to do that when you go into labor, but I have a very specific list of what I want to take and I'm probably going to wait until I am convinced I'm in real labor to pack and go. I don't know if I'll have a fast labor or not so I don't want to get to the Birth Center too early! If I should happen to go fast, I have all the stuff I would need to deliver at home- including and oxygen tank and scale! haha I think I have my bases covered!So now we're kind of all in the worst TWW ever haha.

I am not being mean or anything, but I go to a specialist and pay $50 each visit and to see a PA, ugh! I have seen her more than my actual doctor and its starting to get annoying! There are two partners and the PA. I think I have actually seen my doctor maybe 4 times this whole pregnancy and usually that would be a lot, but for me, someone who has been in every two weeks since I was about 24 weeks and then at 30 weeks I started to go every week and it adds up! I just hate paying money for the specialist if I am going to see a PA!So last week my doctor told me I was 4cm and that my cervix was so short (she didn't use effaced) that it was 0.76 and that meant that I could go at anytime b/c only .76 of a cm was holding it in like a cork. She told me to take it easy but that I didn't have to be on bedrest seeing that the baby was measuring 3 weeks ahead and big and that she looked great and if I went into labor they would not stop it.Well, today the PA said that they would stop me if I did go into labor, even though she was measuring 6lbs 2oz roughly at 35 weeks and that she said I was only 2cm???? My cervix was still 0.76cm and she told me that I could not do anything or go anywhere and even complained about the fact that I had my 2 year old with me, but I have had a hard time this go around with help....I can't ask my family to take off for months before she even comes! They have helped but can't continue until after she is born. My daughter has to go to VPK otherwise she will get kicked out and I can't afford a nanny or to take my 2\u00a0\u00a0year old to daycare other than the two days she is already going! I have no choice! And my MIL the one that can help has stage 4 cancer, so I can't depend on her b/c she is getting treatment plus working full time to pay for it all and is tired most of the time! I guess I am just venting, but I wish they would schedule me a date or something or stick with what one is saying! Oh well, just praying my little one comes soon since she is so big;) Guess I am just wishing too much!",

Then on October 10th- ya my due date- I have my dads 50th bday celebration at noon and then my father in laws at 6... Both of which I'm the planner and host of. I need to go through and make my house party ready, but I can't get motivated at all. Then the weekend after that were headed 4 hours west to my husbands uncles so they can finish his basement- that means either I'm huge and my husband might miss delivery due to the distance, or I'll have a very small newborn to travel with. I also have midterms and papers due mid-October and I haven't had the energy to focus on it cuz I'm used to doing homework after everyone goes to bed, but I'm just too tired to stay up anymore. Blah!

You need to just take it easy and do things a little at a time. You still have awhile, so maybe you could work you your homework, rest, clean/get ready for the parties, rest, and so on;) That's how I have been doing it lately. I clean and my girls mess up, so I have learned that when they go to bed, I pick up and then rest or hit the sack. Or I wait til the morning to pick up before they go to preschool and then get them ready to go and then come home and rest while they both or just one is gone. Today I haven't felt like doing much, as I cleaned all weekend, and luckily the class I am taking only requires one day a week to do the homework, test, or writings. Last semester was super hard b/c I had more than I could handle, but I managed to get through it and I see this semester being a breeze, even when the baby is born!Are you sure your gonna want to travel with a newborn? You might not feel up to it. The first three months were so hard for me to get into a routine, b/c I was so tired!Well, good luck to you and hopefully your little one will come sooner than your due date!",

SCARY! We were all talking and the nurses commented that the baby had a full head of hair when I felt what was like a moose on my chest.\u00a0\u00a0It was the other doc and a nurse pushing my upper belly to try and push him out, they had to use a vaccum three times on him to try and get him out.\u00a0\u00a0My doc is only 4\" 11 so she was on a stool pulling and tugging on my little baby.\u00a0\u00a0She finally said that she got him out and he cried right away.\u00a0\u00a0That's the best sound in the world besides the time when they first call you 'momma'.\u00a0\u00a0The rest of the surgery went smoothly and recovery since then hasn't been bad at all.\u00a0\u00a0Ian is the best blessing our family has had.\u00a0\u00a0His 17 yr old brother and 15 yr old sister are enamored by him and love on him as soon as they walk in the door after school.\u00a0\u00a0Dad is amazed by his son and I'm excited to watch him grow.\u00a0\u00a0I don't miss being pregnant, maybe a little, but its definitely been worth going through the fertility treatments, IVF, and the wait to have him.\u00a0\u00a0To all you other ladies, hang in there and your time will soon be here.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to all those trying to conceive.\u00a0\u00a0SSBD!!!",

    "question": "So which one of us October mom are going to deliever first? I was just thinking about this and it seems like a few of us are almost there. My c-section is scheduled for Oct 6th but my doctor doesnt think I will make it til then. I'm guessing it will be the end of September again. My daughter was born 5 years ago on September 27th. Funny part is I told her that Peri may come early and she was excited. I asked her if she could come on her birthday and she said YEAH...then I said well that means you won't be able to have a party. She looked mad and said well NO!. LOL Funny! I finally packed my hospital bag and decided on the coming home outfit, however I dont have the picture outfit. I picked out the dress my other daughter wore as a back up but I'll be at Babies R Us this wkn to look for something else. I had 2 showers and they both were very girly and great. I am amazed that I got more this time around then my first. I have scheduled my last two drs appointment for this pregnancy and then the big c-section. I'm so ready to have my baby and ready to kiss and spoil her. The doctor thinks that she is already 6.5 lbs so Im not worried about her weight anymore. People at work have started to countdown my days. Every day someone sees me they say not today huh? LOLWhat's your update?",
