            "answer": "Do you have any way to get to a baby store to get breastmilk storage bags? Many regular stores like Target, Walmart, or even your local pharmacy carry them as well. Another option would be to just store it in bottles (if you have any) and then just pour and portion into their bags when you get there. Just make sure to mark when you pumped it. You could even use a regular beverage container, and then just pour and portion when you get there. Since she is a preemie, I would boil or sterilize whatever container you do choose. Also, since it is already Wednesday, it would be OK for you to wait until Friday to transfer and then freeze some of the milk if they can't use it all right away.Congratulations on the arrival of your baby girl. Pumping is hard work, but is the best gift you can give a preemie. She'll be strong and healthy enough to come home in no time! My first was born weighing only 4 lbs 13 oz at 36 weeks (emergency c-sec due to preeclampsia). On breast milk alone, she went fro 3rd percentile at birth to 75th percentile by 2 or 3 months!",

            "answer": "No there isnt a way for me to get to the store, right now my husband and I are relying on our cusin for transportation because we dont have a drivable car right now. I was just wondering if there was any thing around the house i could use to store it in. The Lc at my Health department said I could use any kind of jar that seals really tight. But like you my daughter is only getting my milk, and I'm really hoping they dont have to suppliment with formula I left like 16 bottles, with about 1 oz od milk in each yesterday with them, and shes up to 16 ml per feeding and is feeding when she hungery, not\u00a0\u00a0on a scedule. so its kinda got me worried. the she will run out before i can get there.The baby food jars are the only thing I have, besides for 16 oz drink bottles.She was born at 32 weeks, due to membrane rupture, and I didnt know it just thought i peed my self. well ti leaked it all out in 24 hours before i realized i was in preterm labor. she was born (through emergency C-Section fetal distress.) and weighed 4 pound 1 ounce. she will probably be released around my due date, May 24th depending on how everything goes for her.",

            "answer": "If you sterilize the jars and lids by boiling in water for 10 minutes they will be fine to store your milk in. Now as to whether the hospital will accept them, that is a question that you will have to ask them. If they won't then I would freeze that milk in the glass jars to use later, just remember to leave some room at the top of the jar for the milk to expand when it freezes. Or as tired said transfer it to their containers when you get to the hospital. I always had to freeze my milk within 24 hours of pumping as if I left it longer than that before freezing it when I defrosted it my baby wouldn't drink it and it would smell sour but I guess every one is different.",
