            "answer": "i think toxemia is the same this as preeclampsia. my doctor also suspected it at my 35 week check up. i also had blood drawn, and had to do a 24-hour urine sample. the ultrasound showed that the placenta was begining to deteriorate. this was all on a thursday. on friday i handed in my urine sample and he drew more blood to compare them. my platelets were kinda low, but that can occur normally during pregnancy as well, so he had to check and see if they were dropping. over the weekend i felt like cr@p. my blood pressure was high and i just felt terrible in general. at 8 AM monday morning he called me. the lab results were in and he told me we were going to do a c-section that day. my platelets had gone down a little, but i was \"spilling\" protein into my urine. he had me go in for a quick ultrasound and to pick up paperwork to take to the hospital, and then i went in. the ultrasound showed that the placenta had further deteriorated. he also explained that if my platelets were any lower, he was going to have to use general anesthesia instead of a spinal. They did a blood draw when i got the the hospital and luckily they had not gone down anymore. my urine sample at the hospital was +4. my bp was high, but not as high when i layed on my left side.i delivered when i was exactly 36 weeks. i was concerned about the baby being born early, but my OB was confident that she was going to be ok. he said that when the mother is in distress, the baby is in distress, and as a result the lungs often develop faster. he did not do an amnio to see if they were ready. in the OR he only had a regular pediatrician on hand and he anticipated her going to the regular nursery. he was right- she came out screaming and healthy. only thing was she was much smaller than he had estimated. the previous week an ultrasound measured her 5 pounds 8 ounces. and you'd think she would've grown some too since that u/s. she was born 4 lbs 13 oz. i wonder if the placenta dying had anything to do with that.so that's my experience. of course yours may be different, but i thought i'd share. i know some people are put on bed rest and all that- i think it depends on how far you are and how bad your labs are. for me, we were far along enough where the risks were too great to both me and the baby to keep waiting.",

    "question": "Hi ladies. At my 35 weeks appointment this week I was told that my OB thinks that I might have toxemia. I had to collect my urine for 24 hours and I am going to get some blood work done today. She tried to explain to me what exactly toxemia is but I had my 9 year old son with me who decided that while she was explaining to me what it was would be a good time for him to start making little noises. Needless to say, I didn't hear what she said. Could anyone tell me what exactly toxemia is and what they do if I do have it?Thanks in advance.~Danielle",
