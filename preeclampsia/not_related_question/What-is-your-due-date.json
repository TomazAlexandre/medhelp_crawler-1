No dilation or effacing so this time around I learned from another forum that I read from women were orally taking Evening Primrose Oil and also inserting it into the vagina so I did that this time around and I actually have some change. I stopped last week because I ran out and just haven't felt like going to the store to get more but it is safe to take with no side effects at least that has been what their doctors have told them. You can always google it.Manderella- Lagree with Angela induction is way more preferable then a c section. I was induced at 40 weeks with my first and I had no dilation or effacement whatsoever. I was in labor for 16 hours and pushed for 23 minutes. I did have a first degree tear (had a 9lb 7oz baby boy) but that is the best tear you cold possibly have because no muscles were torn and recovery was actually a week or 2. After 4 weeks of delivering I felt completely normal, might have actually been before then but I know I was feeling good because dh and I started having sex again 4 weeks postpartum. Sorry if that is tmi, lol. Hopefully baby will decide to come on its own but if not induction is not always bad for people.Tryingforbaby2- Welcome, you are not too late we are also here for you after baby is born, might not be as often as we would all like but if you leave notes on pages or send personal messgaes maybe that would get our attentions quicker.",
