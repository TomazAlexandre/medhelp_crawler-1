After all was said and done I asked be dischared the same day I delivered only to be admitted again the next day. The preeclampsia they said I didnt have.... I went back into the hospital with Post Pardum preeclampsia I had it... it just reared its ugly head as far as high bp goes after.

I had never felt more in touch with myself and who I was to be in this world.We had a heartbeat, we could see it blinking on the screen. It was the most awesome thing ever and we were so proud because it was ours and we had so many plans.I told my family April 10, 2004. Easter weekend. And the next night, it was all over. It was our first pregnancy and my heart broke that night. Because of a previous D&C for fibroids and the unfortunate realization that it may not be my last miscarriage that I would need a D&C for, my doctor wouldn't give me a D&C. Instead, he prescribed something for the pain and told me I would need to 'pass' it. He assured it would take 4 days, max. Well, I could have kicked him. It took 9 days of horrible emotional trauma. Oh, and of course, then there was the actual physical miscarriage itself. It was so hard to cry like that every day, with my heart breaking.But I know that I was meant to be a mother and I am actively TTC. My husband has been wonderful, and he has been there for all the false alarms and the endless HPT's.We will conceive. I have no doubt. We will see those 'two lines' again! We will never give up! But we will NEVER forget our little angel. April 11 will always be a day I remember, but now, it's a reminder of the baby I will hold someday.",

Personally I think it is due to my fibroids which the doctor discovered after the first miscarriage. The first pregnancy was a \"blighted ovum\" the second was not. I saw the heart beat on Jan 16/02 but then suddenly 3 weeks later, nothing...I could not believe it happened again!\u00a0\u00a0I had a D & C & hysteroscopy on my gyn's advice.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe would that help with the fibroids? My other thought was that my body was not producing enough progesterone however I live in Canada and found out that Progesterone cream is banned here!\u00a0\u00a0Figures...I've also read that NSAIDS (Advil etc.) can stop the heaviness of the periods with fibroids. Mine are extra heavy, but I went back on the pill to counteract them for the past 4 years. Now we want to try again (the final time of trying as I'm 39) so this is it! I'm off the pill as of Feb. 23 and so praying that the miscarriage doesn't happen again and we can successfully get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Any support/help would be appreciated. I'm very nervous about 1) trying again 2) miscarrying again and 3) those awful heavy periods!\u00a0\u00a0I'm up for any pre-conception herbal & vitamin remedies if anyone knows of any or the proper way to use NSAIDS to make the bleeding less heavy, or pretty much anything to help us have a successful full term pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks and good luck to everyone here!!",
