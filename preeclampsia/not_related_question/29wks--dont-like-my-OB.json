            "answer": "Sorry to hear that you're being treated that way.\u00a0\u00a0And -- it really is your OB who should see you for the swelling and headaches since it is a sign of preeclampsia.It also should NOT be taken lightly -- you need to get in as soon as possible.Call back and DEMAND to speak to the doctor...DEMAND that they see you NOW!Once you get checked out, tell your doctor that you are VERY concerned about how you've been treated.\u00a0\u00a0If he/she is apologetic, make sure he/she speaks to his staff so that you are not treated this way again.\u00a0\u00a0If he's NOT apologetic, then you really may want to find a new doctor.Finding a doctor at this point may be difficult as some may not want to take on someone this far along -- others may have no problem doing so.Do you have any other health issues/complications?\u00a0\u00a0If not, it may be easier for someone to take you -- but you don't know that they won't be just as bad if not worse.I'd start by getting in w/ doc for check, then making him/her aware of the problem and see if you can make it work.Good luck!",

She said she doesn't just SEE people for UTI's.....mayabe she would have a nurse call me back. That was it! I said DON'T BOTHER!! UTI's could mean early labor...Ughh. I hate that for you, but , you will find someone that will be happy to take good care of you, I promise..",
