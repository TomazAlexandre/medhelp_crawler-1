Once, they had to literally KNOCK ME OUT to stop me or i was going to die. i tried to call my primary doctor to get him to do something and he wont cuz he hasnt been seeing me for the pregnancy, even though he too once witnessed phenergan not working. i dont know what to do i am so mentally exauhsted i want to die.",

A very good friend of mine tried castor oil, and according to her, it worked. BUT, with your history, especially acid reflux and all the meds, do not try it!! You will be so miserable, you won't get to enjoy what little bit you do have left, and hopefully, you have a half-way decent labor. Have you considered threatening to change docs if they don't let you induce?? Doctors really hate that, and won't like the idea, but if you insist that you just can't do this anymore, and you're willing to do that, they might cave.

I want to be induced before I lose my mind, or I will go to another specialist that will give me what I want\". If you have to, call your PCP, and find out if you can get some kind of a referral, and tell them what you want to do. Maybe they can write something up for you saying they think you should be either induced or referred. Put your foot down, the only reason they are making you keep going, is because the docs always like to see a woman go \"full term\", which, from what I've seen with alot of women, is 2 weeks over...yuck!\u00a0\u00a0You have the right, don't let them push you around and bully you. Hopefully the threatening will work, and of course, just tell them you've done research and know that it's a safe time to take the baby. You shouldn't have to deal with this anymore!!",

They all say that a baby should be delivered if it'll survive better outside the womb.There is a risk you'll have to have a c-section if the induction doesn't go through (sometimes it doesn't work... you'll have to read up on it because there's too much info on it for me to type up). Once they break your water, you have to deliver within 24 hours to reduce the risk of infection.",
