            "answer": "I had my labor and delivery class yesterday and the instructor (a l&d nurse) clarified that full term is 37 COMPLETED weeks. So we won't be full term until 37+6, at midnight. Basically 38 weeks.I'm 35+3 and I feel pretty good. We have been having some rain so the temperature isn't as bad as it had been. My energy is up a little more, too. I think baby has dropped as of yesterday, which is annoying because I'm already super sick and tired of going to the bathroom all the time. My hands are still sore and stiff when I wake up and I've reached 40 pounds gained. Not happy about that, but other than it being a pain to move around and get comfortable there are no complications so I try not to complain too much.",

See I always thought 36 weeks was full term for some reason until I got pregnant and read the books so I was so excited to finally hit it, oh well, a couple more days! 19 left, I can't believe I'm almost down to single digits I feel so blessed to have made it this far with very little complications. Oh so know all about the hand swelling and pain, my hubby has to help me do my hair for work (I work with food so it has to be pinned back and in a ponytail) but in the morning I have no grip whatsoever and can't grab anything or wrap the elastic so before he leaves for work he helps me get ready. I'm done work this weekend, time has gone so fast I almost can't believe it!!",

My dad asked me how I was doing last night and I told him I felt like I was being split in half with all the pressure going I'm down there, he laughed and said 'oh just wait, theres more!' Thanks dad LOL. The peeing is driving me nuts too, I feel like I'm going to explode and then when I go to the bathroom I urinate for a whole three seconds and done, wtf! It makes it hard to sleep, my hubby jokes that he's gonna set up a makeshift cot in the bathroom for me so I don't have to walk do far because getting in and out of bed is a hassle (and just rolling over makes me run out of breath!)",

What a let-down!And I know, I was sad when the nurse said full term was the END of 37 weeks. Dangit!

She's already been wanting to induce because of my preeclampsia but my labs aren't quite bad enough to warrant induction. I've been drinking 80 ounces of water a day to keep from swelling and help my blood pressure, I don't think the bed rest is effective at all since I'm up every 5 minutes to pee lol. I was 42+5 with my oldest so I try not to complain too much but I am certainly ready for baby!",

I've been crampy all afternoon today but nothing really timeable so In hoping it will start soon. Also found out at my appointment I tested positive for group b strep so I'm kind of bummed about that. I wanted to be at home for as long as possible but that isn't an option now that I have to go get an iv. My doctor scared the bejeebus out of me sent me straight to the hospital saying my blood pressure was 150/94 and then after being monitored for two hours the doctor at the hospital said his machine must be broken because almost every reading they had read 112/82 which is my normal... Better safe then sorry I know but I didn't plan on spending my only day off work in the hospital (8 hours for the results! Ridiculous!)",

    "question": "At least physically. 37 weeks yesterday, full term, woo!! My body HURTS. On friday I thought I was going into labor, turns out it was just braxton hicks, dangit. Pretty sure baby is dropped and in position. Hurts my pelvis to move, or walk, or sit. I'm only comfy laying down, which makes me want to sleep all the time, but there is so much\u00a0\u00a0I want to do around the house before baby gets here. How are you all feeling?",
