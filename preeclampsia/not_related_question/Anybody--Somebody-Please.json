            "answer": "Demerol is a narcotic pain reliever. Headache IS listed as a known, possible side effect.Phenergan is an anti-nausea drug (often given with Demerol because Demerol frequently causing nausea and vomiting). Headache is not listed as a known side effectTerbutaline is a bronchodilator. Headache is listed as a known possible side effect.Terbutaline is fast acting and doesn't stick around for long but I know from personal experience that Demerol and its side effects can stick around for a few days.Dilaudid is another narcotic pain med...and a known side effect is headache.When you see your doctor, ask if he/she will give you Stadol. It does NOT have headache as a side effect :) Unfortunately, it is given by injection...But if your headache isn't going away, it might be worth it...IF your doctor will give it to you.Most narcotic pain relievers have headache as a possible side effect :(Blood pressure....Yes, pain can cause an increase in BP. In fact, clinical nurses look at pulse and BP when people come in complaining of severe pain. If someone has a normal BP and pulse and wants narcs...it is a pretty safe bet that they are med seeking.I hope your headache resolves very soon (((hug))) Try accupressure, a warm compress/heating pad to the back of the neck, a long hot bath or shower...and of course watch your BP.",

    "question": "Okay, I\u00a0\u00a0went to ER sat evening for back pain. Turns out I was having contractions 2-7 minutes apart. They gave me demerol, phenergan and terbutaline, I was very woozy of course. they stopped the contractions and released me.Sunday morning I woke up with a severe headache(scale of 1-10 it was a 10), I waited a few hrs I thought maybe it would go away, it never did. It hurt when I yarned, talkd or even moved my head. Finally I called the ER an I asked them could the meds they gave me have this side affect she said no. But mind you I didnt have a headache before\u00a0\u00a0I went to the ER sat. I called my on call doctor he asked what my bp was at the time it was 146/97, I do take bp medicine so he advise that I take another one. Okay I did that.The pain was still there. I went back to the ER sun. BP was good, but my head was killing me, they gave me a another pain med Dalutted or something like that,\u00a0\u00a0it brought my pain from a 10 to a 8, They released me.Well, had my follow up appt with my doctor on yesterday, my head was still hurting, barely could move. He told me to go back to ER-LD, and he was going to run tests for Hellp syndrome,m and a list of others. All tests came back good. Because if they didnt he told me he was going to admitt me for bedrest or delivery. When my doctor came tp talk to me before releasing from the hospital, he said he dont know about these headaches, and he said he is wondering if it could be a \"hangover\" from all those meds.Well I am at home on bedrest, head is still not normal. I have to go see him again in the am.My question is1: Do you believe the cocktail of all those meds rhey gave me sat caused this, ifso how long would it take to wear all the way off.2. Do you believe that the reason my pressure was up some because of the pain, does nt pain sometimes cause a rise in pressure.",
