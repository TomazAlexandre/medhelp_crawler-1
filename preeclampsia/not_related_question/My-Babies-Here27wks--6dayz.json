            "answer": "Sorry responding so late you guys lol but i was diagnosed with preeclampsia. And i ddnt go into labor or feel any contractions. Lucky me! But my baby was doing fine still with her normal kicks and punches. I was admitted into the hospital on a friday b4 9/10. And she was on a heart monitor 24hrz a day she was having low dips in her heart rate but she always brought it bck up within seconds but doctors wanted to monitor cause at anytime she dropped and it kept going down she was gone be taken out. But in our case my bp hit 164/110 so i had an emergency c section. For 1st time moms a epidural doesnt hurt at all. It feels like being poked for a blood draw then after that i didnt feel any other pokes it felt like i was getting a massage but that OR room is cold. Lol but my body went out so fasti could move. But you can feel them digging around in you and you hear the tools lol but when she came out i went 2 sleep instantly so i still have never heard her cry yet. But i had to be given 2 pints or 2 quarts of blood im not sure and some platelets i still cant remember why i needed it. But she weightd 1lb 1oz and was 11inches long so shes very lil. But shes not on any machines like i thought she would be. Just a feeding tube cause shes not old enough yet to eat out a bottle. And she has a ventilator to help her breathe but she breathes over the ventilator its just there in case she ever stops breathing on her own but she doing fine. Just attacking all her tubes and nurses that get to close lol",

            "answer": "The worse part about the experience is i have a very low tolerance to medication. I usually take i.e. kids liquid benadryl and it knocks me out for a few hours. So in the hospital the pain meds i was on would only make me sleepy but when i got out and they switched it to something higher and i have been able to walk around it makes me crazy halucinate confused and want to fight. But i havent regained that memory back yet.",
