In my opinion they are just more personable and supportive.\u00a0\u00a0They spend more time with you in your appointments to go over all your questions, concerns, and reasons for tests.\u00a0\u00a0And they do work with hospitals and support whichever birth option you choose but are obviously better if your choosing to go all natural with as little interventions as possible.",

However, she was daft and never could seem to remember any important details, even looking at my chart before coming in to see me. I had a hospital birth and the epidural, just like you can with an OB. But my bp spiked and I developed preeclampsia and my heart rate was sustaining over 160bpm while in labor. She had no clue what to do.This time I'm seeing an OB at a different practice and he is absolutely amazing. He remembers every little thing we talk about at my appts and I never feel rushed like I did with her. He listens and is understanding and addresses my concerns.You can find some pretty bad OB's and some equally bad midwives. I would just recommend trying a couple out and seeing who you feel more comfortable with.",
