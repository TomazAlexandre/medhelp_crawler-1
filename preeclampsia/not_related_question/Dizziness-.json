My blood sugar was only 45 one hour after drinking the sugar drink. Turns out that after I eat foods high in carbs or sugars, my body produces too much insulin and drops my blood sugar which causes the dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0I just try and eat foods that are high in protein and carry snacks with me. Easy fix if it's something your doctor hasn't looked into yet :)",

    "question": "Im almost 27 weeks and have had serious dizziness. Im 32 and on my third child. My youngest is 12 so its been a while. I didnt have this with my other two pregnancies. I have asked my doctors and they say nothing but eat right, exercise, sit down and rest. My blood pressure is always normal when they check and i stopped working i only have to clean the house. Its not like im doing too much. Its so annoying not feeling well everyday especially when it started during my second trimester. Just curious if anyone else has had this issue. What it might have been or how you dealt with it??",
