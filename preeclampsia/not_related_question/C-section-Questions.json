I'm relatively skinny, though, so maybe my spine was easily felt.As far as the procedure itself, I felt nothing, not even when they 'warned' me about all the pressure. Plus never felt nauseaus or anything...just so excited to see my baby. That was a suprise b/c she was slimey and whitish...Took less than 30 mins to close me up and off I went to the recovery room to nurse. It was all a wonderful experience!Note they won't let your husband / partner in til after the spinal and draping!",

            "answer": "my spinal did not bother me at all, and i HATE needles. i didn't mind feeling numb either. i didn't know when they started cutting- it just felt like that were pressing gently on my belly. i think they were halfway done when i realized they actually started, and i only figured it out because i could hear the dr asking for various instruments. there was A LOT of pressure on the top of my abdomen when they delivered her, primarily because the nurse was practically jumping in my chest to push her out. it didn't hurt though- just felt like someone pushing real hard on my chest. after that i started to get very very intense chest pains. it felt like it was shooting all the way through to my back. the anesthesiolgist said it was common,and due to heart burn. it got much worse and very intense,and i started to panic. he quickly put something into my IV which provided instant relief, and i pretty much slept through the rest of the procedure while they closed me up.recovery sucked, i won't lie. i had preeclampsia, so i had to get magnesium sulfate for 24 hrs. i was so drugged up, that for the first day or two, i barely recognized or cared that i had a baby. but i suspect that's because i was so sick, and because i didn't get to go straight to a mother/baby room like most people do because i had to be monitored. all the c-sections i see on TV like the Baby Story, the moms are alert and happy during the procedure, and they cry when they see the baby. it didn't really register with me. but like i said, i was very sick. i could barely stay awake while i was being wheeled in to the room to get my spinal.it may not sound like much, but a lot of my misery beforehand came from the fact that i couldn't eat or drink. the dr called me monday morning at 8 AM and told me i had to go to the hospital (based on results from tests done friday). i hadn't eaten or had anything to drink since the night before. my procedure was at 5 PM. i had terrible heart burn, i felt like **** from not being able to eat, and i was so thirsty i thought i'd die. they wouldn't even give me ice chips. i wasn't allowed to drink after the procedure either. if i am required to have a c-sec again next time, i will make sure they schedule it in the am.definitely make sure you have help after having the baby. the thing i found hardest when i got home was trying to get up from the couch while taking care of the baby. and my baby was tiny (4 wks early). we had moved downstairs because i wasn't allowed to go up and down stairs (once or twice a day max, according to dr).",
