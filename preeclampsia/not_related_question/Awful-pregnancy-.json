She'll be worth it. :)",

            "answer": "Yes. Being induced for gestational hypertension Tuesday. This is my 6th child. The others were a breeze. But as most moms who know will tell you, and like they told me, every pregnancy is different. I am no doctor, but because of the protein and swelling they will probably watch for preeclampsia. In which case they could probably induce. At least thats what they are doing to me. Dont worry. Everything will he fine!",

I then had about 5 weeks off being sick, then I got pre-eclampsia. I was in and out of hospital like a yoyo and was finally admitted permanently a month before her due date and was induced at 37 weeks.I'm currently 36 weeks pregnant with our son. I was a little sick (the normal amount), I actually had people tell me I was glowing during my 2nd trimester and now my main issue is reflux (which iz nothing compared to my daughter) i am still comfortable and although my blood pressure is a tad high it seems to be stable (It's being checked twice a week).It's amazing how different each pregnancy can be. My daughter put me off having another for 3 years where as this pregnancy I'm really going to miss x",
