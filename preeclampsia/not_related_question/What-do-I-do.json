            "answer": "You are very welcome.I think there are too many events and unexplained symptoms in yourpost which point to what I suspect, however, I must make clear that it is the synergy of many factors that contribute to individual situations.Genetics, viral load, environmental factors, heavy metals, etc. are usually involved, which is useful to explore and correct,\u00a0\u00a0where possible, when return to optimal health is desired.So, I'll\u00a0\u00a0give you some information on MTHFR gene mutation, which I'll keep as simple as possible and without going into any complicated technical details.MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydofolate Reductase)\u00a0\u00a0is a gene which signals an enzyme with the same name MTHFR.Mutations in this gene result in lowered activity of the enzyme, potentially causing serious health problems.One of its many functions is to convert folate to a methylated form of folate (5-Methyltetrahydrofolate). 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate is used to convert Homocysteine\u00a0\u00a0to MethionineWhen the enzyme MTHFR is not activated or partially activated, homocysteine will not be properly converted to Methionine and will be elevated in serum. A consequence of this-->\u00a0\u00a0histamine produced in your body does not get broken down.Elevated Homocysteine has also been associated with a higher incidence of various serious\u00a0\u00a0diseases.Research shows that high homocysteine levels and/or those with the MTHFR mutation- even without elevated homocysteine, as its levels fluctuate- show a higher propensity for thrombosis (blood clots), arteriosclerosis , Alzheimer\u2019s, stroke, heart attack, ***Fibromyalgia, ***migraines , osteoporotic fractures, bone marrow disorders and for those of child bearing years, it has found to be connected to higher incidences of down\u2019s syndrome, spina bifida, other neural tube defects,\u00a0\u00a0trisomy,***miscarriage, ***stillbirth, implantation failure, placental abruption, preeclampsia, higher incidences of autism, amongst others. :(If you were to test positive you may want to have your parents, siblings, and your children\u00a0\u00a0tested, as well.Independent of MTHFR mutations (there are many) if hypothyroid with low thyroxine (T4) and low Riboflavin, your MTHFR enzyme activity will be impaired. You should have your thyroid function assessed by gettingtests for Free T3, Free T4 and Reverse T3.\u00a0\u00a0Your t3/rt3 ratio is the best indicator for thyroid function which should be 20 methylocobalamin and 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (methylfolate) respectively,are commonly caused by Gene mutations like the MTHFR , the most significant factor in methylation impairment\u00a0\u00a0specifically the 677 and the 1248 mutations, which affect about 40-50% of the population, in various degrees.MTHFR Gene\u00a0\u00a0testing. One of the least expensive places for this is23andMe, which will send you back \"raw data\" (no analysis) which needs interpretation.No problem. If you decide for that , let me know and I can give you a couple links where you can upload the data and get the answers for free .Or you can do your own research for that.Please let me know if you need additional details, however,please note thatmy comments and suggestions are not intended to replace medical advice.Best wishes.NikoPS Chronic inflammation without resolve due to increased production of B cells and decreased production of T cells, is another presentation of certain MTHFR mutations, due to undermethylation.",

            "answer": "You probably missed the part -->...You should have your thyroid function assessed by getting tests for Free T3, Free T4 and Reverse T3.Please confirm what tests you had. The standard practice is to test for serum levels of TSH and T4 -sometimes T3 is included- but these indicate only serum levels, not thyroid function.In low thyroid conditions, your thyroid gland may be producing adequate levels of thyroid hormones, however, just like in diabetes 2 where the pancreas produces enough insulin, but there's insulin resistance, the same situation may exist in hypothyroid conditions, where there's resistance to the thyroid hormones.In the end, I'm not suggesting you have thyroid resistance, but you definitely need to rule it out, since it would be THE reason, nothing your doctors attempt in regards to treatment-other than some symptom management- would work effectively. Healing at the cellular level is thyroid-dependent.Thyroid resistance is suspect, not only because of some of your symptoms, but because of all the unresolved biological and perhaps mental stress (mental stress is something unique to everyone, depending on how it is processed) which usually leads to adrenal fatigue.It is common in adrenal fatigue to develop thyroid resistance, as the adrenals force a hypothyroid state, for adrenal recovery.",

    "question": "I have several lupus symptoms including but not limited to;butterfly rash (confirmed by doctor), joint pain (especially my knees and hips), rheumatoid arthritis, sensitivity to sunlight, headaches, fatigue, hair loss, along with several other symptoms. I've been diagnosed with pleurisy, neuropathy, and migraines. Sometimes I'm so weak I can't get out the bed. My knees are now starting to lock up. I work 2 jobs and I have a family. I'm constantly sleepy and the list goes on. I've seen several doctors. I've had a positive ANA test but they say that doesn't mean anything . My blood work also shows high inflammation levels and my red and white blood cell count is always off. I've had several other test come back either positive or inconclusive. The doctors act as if nothing's wrong and that everything is in my head. My specialist see the clinical symptoms but she always looks at me with a puzzled look. She gave me hydroxychlor 200mg but says it's a trial and that I may possibly have SLE and said she'll see me back in 3 months. Up until my first pregnancy at the she of 21 I'd never had to visit a doctor outside of routine visits. After my 1st child I had several miscarriages, which they said could be a part of lupus. My second pregnancy was high risk but I was never told why. I had more miscarriages and then became pregnant with my 3rd child which was even harder than the 2nd. After I had my 3rd child my doctor basically made me get my tubes severed and said it was too dangerous for me to keep having children but still didn't give my a reason why. She just said If I became pregnant again she wouldn't be my caring physician. About a month after my 3rd child is when my symptons started. That was 7 years ago. They've became worse and worse now I have kidney pain to add to the list. What the hell is going on with me?? I'm beyond scared and the doctors test me as if I'm a mystery. They won't give me pain meds even though the rest clearly stated that I had to levels to prove the pain is there and they refuse to diagnose me. I'm so full of life but I can't live it because I'm so limited due to all of my problems. Is there anyone out there that can please help me??",
