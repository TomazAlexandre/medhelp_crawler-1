I try to vent to my baby's father but he will never understand the pain, the peeing the heartburn the trouble walking, sleeping and just moving period!!! lol I'm 37 1/2 weeks and I am not contracting at all!! I'm just stuck at 1 and half cm dialated. This pregnancy has been a blessing but I'm over it, especially since I have too much fluid and I need to be monitored twice a week on top of my weekly dr visits!! My due date is April 30th and I think i'm going all the way to the end : (",

            "answer": "i'm due the 23rd, and I swear the closer it comes, the slower time moves. I've been losing my mucus plug for a week now, and the baby is so low the doc says she can feel the head. but no contractions whatsoever, no other signs of labor. I have alot of financial problems though, and since she's sitting sooo low, i can barely walk. so my boss cut my hours and now i'm scraping already and I haven't even started maternity leave yet (which is unpaid for me). I am potentially facing eviction because this child is being stubborn and will NOT come. I've already tried everything in the arsenal for inducing labor and no luck. I was just at the doc's today and i haven't changed from the last two weeks ... 80% effaced, 2.5 cms. I can't take this anymore. And following the pattern set already for me, she'll show up sometime in may, after they induce me for passing my due date. i can't help but be pessimistic",

I'm still feeling great besides having permantly swollen feet, ankles, and hands which has become just painful! My midwifes wont induce until im two weeks late so my journey Isnt even close to being over unless he comes out on his own which would be shocking bc the only pain I've had are mild period like cramps. I've tried so many things (Walking, sex, bouncing on an exercise ball, up and down stairs, evening primrose oil, spicy foods..etc) and havent had a single contraction. The only thing really making me miserable is the lack of sleep. I have to pee every twenty minutes and can never seem to get comfortable! He is still super active so im loving every last kick bc im going to miss them!",

    "question": "How are we all dooooooing?!Haha.. I've been asked that question about a billion times in the last few days.. family and friends emailing/calling/Facebooking to ask if I'm in labour yet.. if I'm feeling ok.. if we've decided to run away to the forest to give birth in a cabin, far away from medical assistance.. hahaha...SO.. here's a spot for all of us that still aren't due yet to continue to talk about being pregnant.. expectations and anticipations.. and even frustrations.\u00a0\u00a0;DI'm definitely gearing up for this great adventure.. but since the babe still hasn't dropped, and no signs of that darned plug making an appearance yet.. I think that I'll make it all the way to my April 24th due date... maybe even beyond.\u00a0\u00a0I measured 42-44 cm yesterday at my last appointment.. and after shaking my belly all over the place, it was pronounced that I'm going to be having a \"big\" baby.. then she laughed in such an evil way.... haAaaaaahhaa.. oh doctors... sadists all of them.How are YOU doing?",
