            "answer": "Hi!I can understand your apprehensions regarding your pregnancy. Asperger\u2019s syndrome is said to a defect in brain functioning and is known to run in families. It can also occur as a sporadic case in a family. The genes responsible for it are not known and hence its inheritance pattern has not been determined. What I can say is that if there are other family members affected by it in older or younger generation then chances of your baby inheriting it are more. However, if you are the only person known to have this, and considering that you are able to manage your life well, chances of your baby inheriting it are less. However, please discuss with a genetist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "I think this mercury poisoning is pure BS, Asperger tends to run is some families. Unlike autism which is more random and mostly unexplained.I am a female with Asperger and yes my only child, a son, has Asperger as well. So does my father, and I suspect my late grand father as well.Odds are high your baby may have Asperger but it does not mean he/she will have it. My father comes from a family of 11 and some of his siblings absolutely do not have Asperger, others I am not sure, I suspect a few of them are Asperger.If your baby has Asperger, it's not the end of the world... and it's best to know at an early age to help him develop stronger social skills.",

            "answer": "Hi I am a woman with asperger's. I have two children. The first has severe autism and the second is not even close to asperger's. She is very very social.There is no way to know whether your child will have asperger's because it seems to be genetically predetermined. But asperger's is not the worst thing to have, so my advice would be to just focus on having a healthy pregnancy overall. Eat healthy foods that will help your baby develop well, with or without asd which is out of your hands. Wild salmon, eggs, vegetables, humanely raised meats...this is how I ate with my second pregnancy and I had no complications. I had a vaginal birth with my daughter, no drugs or epidural, and with my son I had a whole host of complications including preeclampsia and cesarean. But still it appears that what he has is genetic. I have tried diets on him for years. He is who he is and he is a gift just like my daughter. He can play the piano and no one taught him.I would not take any advice to avoid vaccinating. I did do that with my daughter where I waited three years before getting her first vaccine and she came very close to pertussis. My son brought it home (he had no boosters) and my daughter came down with the initial fevers, but her ped got all of us on the medicine right away so my husband and daughter never got the cough.After that I brought my son up to date and started my daughter on dtap (because she needs tetanus shot) and I would have waited on the mmr but there is an epidemic right now in my state and I do not want to take the chance. Measles is not a benign disease and can cause lots of complications including brain damage.",

            "answer": "I don't think vaccines cause autism at all but if you are really concerned, read about the diseases they prevent and decide which are most important for now. HIB is an important vaccine. Hpv, right now, perhaps not necessary.Maybe you wait on measles a little while and see if there is an outbreak. My dr actually has me on call for that. She volunteered herself to the task. She also helped me formulate the alternative schedule and told me which vaccines she needs immediately. If you do not have a ped like this find a new one. Whilea ped may not agree with any concerns about vaccines, they should respect them. Besides there are risks with vaccines but they are often outweighed by the benefits because the risks are rare. It would be better to get the mmr than to get measles in my opinion.",
