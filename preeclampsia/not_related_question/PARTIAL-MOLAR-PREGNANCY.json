            "answer": "I had a complete molar pregnancy. I had to have an xray. Nothing was found. I had to wait a year after the hcg went back to 0. For a partial they make you wait 6 months usually. It took my hcg almost 6 months to go back to 0 so I had to wait 18 months before I could get preg. I have had 5 healthy babies since the molar.",

However the thing is tha tmy hcg level is already down to 12 ( I had my dnc done about 2 weeks ago).\u00a0\u00a0I am scared 1st because this is my second pregnancy and the only one that I had problems with since the bagining( I have a 2 year old and with that pregnancy I had no problems whatsoever). 2nd because they told me that I may need either chemo or radiation depending on what the Dr. says. 3rd I don't even want to think what would my little girl do without her mom.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice will be appreciated.",
