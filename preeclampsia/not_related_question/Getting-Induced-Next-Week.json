Oh wait, I can't wait to put my own socks on without hollaring for my husband to do so! LOL I have gained 50 pounds and waddle like a penguin! Luckly it's all belly and boobs! My belly is holding lots of amniotic fluid, so I have so much pressure under my ribs causing me not to be able to BREATH! They said he is also laying on my main artery in my back restricting blood flow. I would think that was enough to go ahead with my C-Section but they said its normal! Are you all having that problem! I had to go to the hospital yesturday because I was so out of breath I was seeing black spots. I was hoping they would go ahead and take him but they wouldnt! They said I am dilated a good 1 and 80% thinned out. When she checked me, she actually touched the babys head and he floated away! She said he has so much fluid theres no telling what postion he will be in this coming friday. Keep me updated girls and GOOD LUCK!",
