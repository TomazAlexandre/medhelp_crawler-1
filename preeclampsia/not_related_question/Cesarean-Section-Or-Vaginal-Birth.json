They have less respiratory problems as well as less mucous in ears. It's also seems to be more special for mom. When it's vaginal you generally get to hold and look at your baby right away where in a csection they clean up the baby, do the assessment, and then someone can hold the baby up to mom or atleast on the ones I saw. If it came down to my babies safety though I wouldn't think twice. It saves allot of babies loves as well. Healing seems horribly painfull. Moms who had vaginal births jump up much quicker that is depending on the moms. As I said though I would prefer vaginal but wouldn't hesitate if my babies heart rate dropped. Csections are also good for very premature babies who bones arent as hard and skin isn't as tough to not get damage during a vaginal. I'm going to try and go completely natural this time though. Epidural increases the risk of csection and I'm going to try a water birth and have finger crossed.",

Failure to progress, since herpes outbreak, breech baby, etc? (Not judging, just curious)Yes, in general a vaginal birth leads to an easier recovery and is better for baby. But depending on why you had your last c section, it's a whole different story. (Besides, try telling someone who's had an easy recovery from a c section that vaginal birth feels better sooner, then have her talk to me. I had a third degree tear and couldn't walk normally for a good month)It's a personal decision and one I hopefully never have to make. I just pray that I'm able to have uncomplicated vaginal deliveries and never have to debate a Vbac. Good luck, whatever you choose.",

My incision had no issues healing and i took absolutely no paun meds after the c-section was finished. Not even tylonal. Everybodys experiences with vaginal and/or c-section are going to be different. And i am also choosing to have a c-section again with this one. With the risk of uterine abruption i am not taking the chance. My doctor informed me that over 90% of women have a successfull vbac but i have already burried one child and i am not taking ANY risk of haveing to do that again, nor will i run the risk of leaving my son without his mother. I have heard the risks of both c-section and vbac and i feel that the c-section has less risk. Judge if you want but i am fine, healed wonderfully, and for the record my son came out fine. And not all hospitals clean the baby and then let someone else hold them to your chest, it is different in each state and country. In ohio we can hold baby while they close the incision as long as baby is healthy. Have a great day everyone!",
