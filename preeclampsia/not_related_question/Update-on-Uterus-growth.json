I know they have to manually version Grey to get an accurate measurement on him because he keeps wanting to lie semi-transverse and because of how he's pushing on the sides of my uterus it makes the measurement slightly off...IDK though.Hang in there hon keep us posted, good luck <3",

Are they going to give you a shot for his lungs to mature?",

She was full term but was the size of a 7 month fetus.\u00a0\u00a0She was 18 1/4\" and weighed only 4 lbs 15 oz.\u00a0\u00a0The only issues she had were having to stay in NICU for 4 days.\u00a0\u00a0That hospital wouldnt' release a baby until it was 5 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0She had a little trouble coordinating sucking and swallowing and was tube fed for a couple days but once she left nicu at 4 days old she hasn't had any problems since. She's now almost 14 and healthy as can be.",

    "question": "Okay so as you all know Ive been having problems with my uterus growing.\u00a0\u00a0from the time I was 27 weeks until 32 weeks my uterus was flunctuating back and forth from 27 to 28 back to 27 then 28 cm again..\u00a0\u00a0My doctor saids your uterus is supposed to be however weeks you are but in cm.\u00a0\u00a0So at my 34 week checkup I was meassuring 32 cm, so my doctor thought my uterus was finally growing.\u00a0\u00a0Then last week at my 35 week check up it was at 33 cm.. But then today at my 36 week checkup its back to 32 cm.\u00a0\u00a0 So my doctor informed me that the baby could not be growing.\u00a0\u00a0So he set me up an appointment, and I have an u/s on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0Hes gonna check out the baby and see if he is where he needs to be in weight and stuff.\u00a0\u00a0 He said if hes not then he is gonna take the baby next weekish or something...Should I be worried?\u00a0\u00a0Im so worried. I hate that I have to go all weekend with this on my mind.\u00a0\u00a0And he also didnt mention if he would give me a c section or induce me.. Im so excited to think i could be holding my baby this time next week, but i dont want him to be unhealthy or not weigh enough, but my doctor ensured me that he would have a better chance growing outside of my belly then inside..I still dont get why this is, why is my uterus not growing, I have gained 34 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Can you please help me try and figure out why this could be, and help me to stop worry.What do you think he would do a c section or inducing me?Im so worried and scared :(\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your help",
