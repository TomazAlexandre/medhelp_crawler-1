            "answer": "I'll start :)My due date was August 29, but the c-section is scheduled for August 20. But I am honestly wondering if i'll make it another 10 days. I never went into labor with my first, so this is all so new to me.first of all, my BP went up Saturday. It was back down a bit yesterday, but I am still paranoid about getting preeclampsia again. Luckily, I see the dr every Monday and Thursday.I've been having BH for months, but I think I am starting to get contractions. They start in my lower back and are much more intense than my period cramps. They then wrap around to the front. There were only 2 that REALLY hurt yesterday though. Of course, they stopped over night, and I haven't had much of anything today.I got morning sickness this morning?!? It's been months since I had the pleasure of puking for no reason first thing in the morning.Changes in discharge (although i don't think i've lost my mucous plug)My body is definitely cleaning itself out. I don't know if I truly have to poop this much, or am just making myself go because everything is so tight it feels like I have to. But my intestines are definitely cleaned out.It's not that I'm in a rush... I just want to know when! I have a lot of last minute things to be done right before the baby comes that I can't do in advance- mostly get stuff ready for whoever watches DD.",

Scheduled for an induction Aug 20..I really want him to come sooner, I've been having a huge anxiety about being induced and I'm not sure why because I've done it before.
