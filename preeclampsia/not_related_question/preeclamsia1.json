            "answer": "Hi, sorry to hear that. Try to stay calm and rest as much as possible.I had preeclampsia with my first baby. Had to have emergency c-section at 28 weeks as my bp was 180/110 and baby wasn't growing.. You can't have vaginal with high bp unfortunately. I had a c-section.I wanted natural birth.. But obviously things didn't work out that way. Don't be scared of c-section. Its really quick, like an hour total. My recovery was pretty easy too. Started driving after about a week already. My baby had to be in NICU for a while. But if you are late term, just make sure you have some help at home if as you don't be able to lift your baby for some time.",

            "answer": "I had PIN pregnancy induced Hypertension that developed into pre-eclampsia. I was induced but due to the inability of docs to keep my blood pressure down and I was getting sicker it required a c-section delivery. Otherwise I could have gone \"natural\". It will all really depend on your body and baby. Stay as calm as possible and try to hold on.",
