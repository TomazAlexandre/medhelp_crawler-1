            "answer": "How far along are you? Doctors check at every appointment for it. The common signs are if your blood pressure is high and they find protein in your urine. Most women with pre eclmapsia don't know they have it until the doctor tells them. If you have severe sudden swelling and also gaining more than 5 lbs in a week (I can't remember exact weight gain to worry about but I think it was 5 lbs) due to water retention it is something to be worried about. If there is severe upper abdominal paim, usually on the right side, I'd call your doctor. I wouldn't just go into the hospital, definitely call your doctor first and they will squeeze you in.",

            "answer": "What was your blood pressure at your last appointment? Swelling is normal in pregnancy, especially in those areas. It sounds like normal end of pregnancy symptoms to me, but if concerned I'd ask your doctor to check you out. I don't see a need for the hospital though. If you were showing the major symptoms (high blood pressure and protein in the urine) your doctor would have let you know and be monitoring you more closely. I had facial numbness last week and they had me come into their office to check for pre ecclampsia since my blood pressure has been borderline high since 20 weeks.",

My doctor didn't have any clue I had it in tell I mentioned to him my weight gain and swelling. He then checked my urine and is motoring my blood pressure which was a little high at my last appointment, I am 36 weeks and he plans to induce me at 37 or 38 weeks depending on how everything goes.",
