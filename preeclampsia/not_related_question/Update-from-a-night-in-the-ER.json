Magnesium Tablets are indicated in this case.",

            "answer": "I'm sorry for your ordeal. It really sucks when you're not seen by the one person that knows what's going on with your body \"almost\" as well as you do.This was my experience with my son 2 1/2 yrs ago. I was having contractions at 7 mos and was sent to labor and delivery. The hospital called my Dr office and he was on his way to the hospital for a delivery. When the nurse in labor/delivery told me that, I thought my Dr would come by and check on me. No, he never did. Contractions stoped and I was sent home and was to follow up with my Dr. Where I found out Fibronectin (I think that's how you spell it) was found in my CM which is a sign of pre-term labor. I asked my Dr why he was not able to stop in to check on me. He told me that he is only contracted through the hospital for labor/delivery. If I am NOT in active labor, they will not admit me and therefore have to be seen by their staff. He did however call the hospital and kept track of my progress. Which thank goodness I didn't progress any further.So, maybe talk to your Dr. He may be in the same situation as mine. Which makes perfect since. That's why you pre-register at the hospital. It's almost like reserving a hotel room. Where as if you walk in off the street, you would deliver your baby with a Dr on staff.",
