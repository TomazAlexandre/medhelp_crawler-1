I've been diagnosed with PCOS and insuline resistance, sent to the fertility clinic, tried all kinds of treatments - nothing worked. Then I stopped all treatments because they made me feel horrible most of the times and we completely changed our life style, we both lost significantly a lot of weight (weren't obese before, just overweight) and started doing regular ovulation tests. After another 6 months when we were already sure we'll never make it I got a positive result on the home test. I've had an absolutely easy pregnancy so far, except for excessive tests and ultrasounds and panic attacks thanks to my doctors (who are overly cautious with my pregnancy - they were sure I won't succeed without IVF) - they were sure I'll have complications like gestational diabetes, preeclampsia etc. At 31 weeks I was almost admitted to the hospital to induce the labor - but finally all tests came back perfect.",

Or you can try hot tea mixed with lemon and honey sounds off but trust me it does its magic. I was like that for servel weeks when I was around 13 14 weeks and it was the worse feeling I'd get tothe point where I'd cough so much it would lead to throwing up. But if you have more then one hospital in your area try going to a different hospital because that's what I had to do. I just keep gling back and forth and Finally I found a Dr who was way more caring about pregnant women then others he tried and ran every test he could to figure out was wrong. And then finally prescribed me a cough medicine codiene. Just keep trying to get better don't settle for a no answer or no help from a doctor.",
