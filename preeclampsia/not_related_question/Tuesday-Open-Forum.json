            "answer": "Goodmorning Ladies,I was wondering if any of you moms have ever experienced night terrors with any of your children. My son who is eight has suffered from them since the end of January. They started when he came down with fifth disease (actually we all had the disease what a horrible illness). He wakes up exactly one hour after he has been asleep he then begins to jump around, waving his arms and sometimes he's even crying. You can't reason with him we just have to wait it out. This goes on every night, I have spoken to the dr, about it but they don't seem to worried about it they say that some children do it especially after a illness associated with high fevers. I just want some advice I feel so bad for him it must interupt his sleep so that his not getting all that he needs. Let me knowCinnamonheart-Do you live in Ontario New York or Ontario Canada? We live in Rochester NY.",

She went to the doctor Friday for her 36 wks check and was dilated to 3 so they put her in yesterday to induce. She could not have a epidural (spelling? sorry) because of something to do with her or the baby's protein. Does anyone know anything about that.But the baby is doing just fine from what I could get out of my husband. He was in a wierd mood last night and trying to get info out of him last night was like pulling teeth.",
