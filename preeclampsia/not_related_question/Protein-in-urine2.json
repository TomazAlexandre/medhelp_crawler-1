            "answer": "I had high protein 2 weeks ago. Tested again this week and it was normal. Most women test high at some point in pregnancy, doesn't mean anything unless you get more than one in a row. I hadn't eaten much 2 weeks ago, that was probably the reason it was high for me. Dehydration can be another reason. Odds are you have nothing to worry about, just take it as it comes. Good luck, and congrats on the baby!",
