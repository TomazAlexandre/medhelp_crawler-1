    "question": "I have had a terrible headache, sore throat, and ear aches for almost a week now! I have taken everything that I read was safe and nothing works!! Over the counter meds, teas, liquids, water with lemon, honey, ginger... NOTHING!!! My fiance even went out and bought a $100 humidifier and it helped me sleep.. for a total of four hours and then I was up due to the pain from my throat. The ER wouldn't do anything for me and my next doctors appointment isn't til Friday but I really don't think I can make it that long. Im in a ton of pain, not eating as much as I should, and I'm so sleep deprived!!! What can I do??!! My poor little man hasn't moved much so I hope whatever I have isn't affecting him.",
