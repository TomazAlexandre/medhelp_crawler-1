    "question": "I am very worried. First of all, I am 25, pretty healthy, minus a few benign heart arrhythmias but I have no physical limitations with them, etc. I am 10 weeks pregnat with my second baby. I had my first in 06 and had no complications, very easy pregnancy. Anyway, on Easter morning, I was getting ready, and out of nowhere, I started seeing a blind spot in my vision. It reminded me of when you're outside in the sun too long and you come into a dark room and pieces of your vision is missing. I then started seeing swirling lights, not inside the blind spot, but just around and lights in the side of my field of vision. It lasted maybe 15 minutes. I didn't feel weird or anything, just annoyed and scared. After it went away, within a few hours I had a really bad headache. It hurt to move my head. The headache hung around for a few days but I contributed the headache to the fact that my whole entire family was experiencing a headcold at the time. I didn't think much else about it. Then two weeks later, it happened again out of nowhere. I was laying on the couch talking to my husband when I started seeing the dark splothces again. same thing happened, swirling lines, zig zags, missing vision, etc. It lasted maybe 20 minutes and when it went away, my eyes felt tired. I had a dull headache come about later on but nothing bad. I have researched it and worried myself sick. It kind of sounds like ocular migraines but a bit different. I had a CT scan last November, about 7 months ago, for random dizziness I was having. It was clean and I was diagnosed with vertigo. I have also had blood work within the last month and all my counts and everything was normal. I had my eyes checked 4 years ago and it was discovered that I had a small astigmatisim but nothing major. I have good vision, the last I checked, and don't have glasses or anything. I'm not sure if this is just some random weird pregnancy thing or what but I have a lot of anxiety issues and just know this is somehow going to kill me! My bp and pulse and everything is always good and normal. Anyway, any help would be appreciated. Thanks so much!",
