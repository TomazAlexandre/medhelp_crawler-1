            "answer": "It may just be you need to put a couple pillows under your feet to elevate them above heart. But if it isnt helping with relieve have your blood pressure checked as well as urine. When protein leaks in urine (preeclampsia) it causes swelling that you grt very little relief from and it also causes high blood pressure. But if you have been moving a lot and on your feet swelling is normal and it may take a full day or a couple days of relaxing to get the swelling to go back down! Good luck to you!",
