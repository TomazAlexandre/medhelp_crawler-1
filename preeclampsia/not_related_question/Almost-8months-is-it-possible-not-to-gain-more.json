            "answer": "There are many women who gain more than 40 lb during their pregnancy and although the recommendation is 25-35LB it is only a guideline.Do you have extremely high blood pressure? I am surprised the doctor scared you in that way.If there is a particular doctor or midwife in the practice who you see more often, talk to them and ask why all of a sudden is your weight becoming an issue. Also ask for guidelines on how to continue with your eating to make sure it is healthy for you both.",

When I saw her last, I had gained 31 lbs and I asked her how much is too much and she said \"well you already gained too much, but its more common nowadays\" she said woman gain between 40 and 60 or more now when they should only gain maybe 20-40. She also said something about pregnant woman and cravings but she said nothing about toxemia.......so this doc kinda freaked me out a little.",

Good Luck - don't worry!",

He said nothing about sudden weight gain. I know when I was there about a month and a half ago I was at 31 lbs so that means Ive only gained 4 lbs since....which isnt sudden at all ??I go back for an u/s in 2wks he ordered one bc my last one was in Feb. & if I get him again for the checkup i will let you guys know what he says..........on the positive side..........he said the baby is in a good position and I measured perfect.

Now, I gained 35 and I went in yesterday for prenatal checkup and the Ob doc says watch it!!! He said I could get toxemia and that i dont wnat a c-section so drink lots of water and whatever you've been doing, stop (late snacking or eating unhealthy w/e) He also said the MAX should be 40lbs im already at 35...........and they say you gain 1 pound a week now.....I really really reallllllly dont want a c section......I ordered a prenatal yoga dvd online, going to go pick it up at the po today......but im just so nervous now....im going to be strict now about just watchingg proportions and drinking water......but what if that doesnt work!!!the OB office has 5 doctors, this is the FIRST time ive seen this doc, and he was SOO upfront, which I'm thankful for, because none\u00a0\u00a0of the other doctors told me the dangers of gaining too much.....but I feel like they should have told me this sooner....I know I should watch what I eat, but I didnt know about toxemia....my fiances boss wife blood pressure went up and she passed out after giving birth it was serious, i think she gained too much too........******I dont want to lose any weight, I just dont want to put anymore on, is that even possible at this point???*****",
