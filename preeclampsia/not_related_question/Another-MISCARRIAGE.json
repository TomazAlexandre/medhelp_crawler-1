I went back and forth with the d&c idea but my doctor and I decided it was better at this early stage to let it happen naturally. I too was afraid of too much scarring (I've already had a csection) because I want every chance to carry another baby to term. do whatever you feel is right for you and take care-I know it's extremely hard emotionally.",

I know a lot of women on here unfortunately know exactly how your heart just feels like it's being ripped out of your chest at that moment, including you. anyway, I got pregnant again in Sept. of 2006 and started spotting again right around the same time. we had 2 ultrasounds, dr. put me on progesterone supp. to see if that would help. m/c again, this time we never saw a heartbeat. after the 2nd m/c she sent me to a high risk ob dr. and he said because of my cycles being irregular maybe the clomid would help. he did say we could go ahead and start testing but that most ins. don't cover it until after 3 m/c...so it could be quite expensive and that a lot of times they can't find anything wrong. but I think he's willing. his nurse said my next step would be being sent to Green Bay for specialist care. the thing is my husbands ins. doesn't cover all the extra fertilty stuff but his open enrollment is coming up in Nov. and if I can change it to cover that maybe it will be a different story. I was just hoping we would become pregnant on our own and our luck would change. we do have 2 children that were both conceived naturally but adding a third seems to be an uphill battle. let me know how things go for you ok? sorry I rambled on!",

I m/c in March, found out another of his cousins was pregnant-due in Nov., sister in law found out she was pregnant-due end of Dec. When I found out I was pregnant again in Oct. I thought everything was going to be ok, only to m/c in Nov. I couldn't go to my husbands cousins baby shower let alone go to see her in the hospital when she had the baby. I didn't even call them for a few weeks, it was awful. I felt sad and on top of that guilty but I couldn't do it. my husband turned 30 in Dec. so we had a surprise dinner for him and neither of them (cousin or sister in law)\u00a0\u00a0were invited by me...I felt totally selfish. so the holidays were extremely hard, I wanted to be happy for them but I was so sad for me. why did they have their babies when we didn't?! it just doesn't seem fair sometimes. this March we found out my sisters best friend-who is almost like a little sister to me found out she was pregnant, and in May I found out 2 of my closest friends are pregnant also-one due Dec. 10th and one the 11th so they are pregnant together. neither of them were trying of course and one of them is having twins on top of it. I finally brought myself to go to my sisters friends baby shower in Sept. and it wasn't bad once I got there. but I won't lie and say I didn't feel sorry for myself. I saw my dr. for a check up a few weeks ago and she asked how I was feeling about the m/c now and I told her even after almost a year since the last one it's still hard. not as hard but still extremely frustrating, especially not knowing why they happened. she said it's totally normal-take the time you need to grieve. I also thought about joining a support group but never went that far. I'm sure if you ask your dr. or call a local hospital they could point you in the right direction. thanks so much for \"listening\" to me, it helps to talk it out to someone who understands. like yours, my dh is very understanding but as a woman you feel like your body betrayed you and it helps to talk with another woman. nobody in my family or circle of friends has ever had one so nobody feels that pain. just do the best you can and I like what love1221 said-I made myself believe that other people needed to be strong for me during this time, not the opposite. keep in touch and I hope you figure something out real soon!",

            "answer": "I know it totally sucks but hopefully things are going to take care of themselves now. All the sooner you can move on somehow. Crying does help, a couple days before I went to that baby shower I started in the shower-don't know why it was there but in a way I feel like a little more sadness comes out...for lack of better words. I'll keep hoping that everything happens naturally for you. Like I said, the Tylenol 3 helped me, not only with the cramps but helping me fall asleep at night. Otherwise I laid there wondering what I could have done differently. Anyway, my first name is Stephanie and I am 29(will be the big 3-0 this March :( ha ha) My husband Brett and I have been married 10 years and live in Mosinee. We have two boys-one is 9 and the other is 3. We never wanted them that far apart but my cycles were so irregular that's just how it happened. They are great. My 3 year old keeps talking about \"when he has a sister,,,\" I just hope someday we can make him a big brother. My 9 year old knew about the pregnancies and the first m/c was very hard on him. We kind of told him what was happening to prepare him a little. We went for the first ultrasound and saw the heartbeat so a week later when I was still spotting I honestly just wanted to reassure myself everything was ok. He was at my in laws so when we picked him up he slipped his grandmas shoes on and ran out onto the porch and said \"Is it still there?!\" I couldn't even speak, I just shook my head no and he ran in the house crying-went right to grandma. I went upstairs and just laid on the bed and cried. To him it wasn't just a 6 week old embryo, it was his brother or sister. A lot of our family told us we needed to be greatful for the two children we already have but really, is that supposed to make me feel better?! My first was a natural delivery in a Naval Hospital no less. No complications at all. My second was induced because of high blood pressure. It started at about 8:30am and by about 11:30 I thought my water had broke. The nurses came in to check me and said that's not your water it's blood. I've never seen so much blood in my life. My contractions started immediately and I could't stay on top of them. They called for an epidural and called my doctor to come up. She arrived and checked to see if I was dialating and also put the fetal monitor on his head. She no sooner looked up at the stats(baby's heartrate) on the computer and declared emergency c-section \"stat\". Nurses came flying in the room, unplugged everything from the wall and ran me down the hall. From the time a c-section was declared to the time our son was born was 13 minutes. My husband couldn't be in the room and I was completely knocked out. My placenta had abrupted so they kept saying it was good I was already at the hospital because if it happened at home we may not have made it in time and could have lost the baby and possibly myself. It was the scariest thing I've ever been through. My son's apgar scores were super low and he was hooked up to an IV and under oxygen so we couldn't even hold him for a good 24 hours. He turned out absolutely fine and is a pistol :) Too smart for his own good. So after that my doctor said I could have more children but I'd probably be seen by a high risk ob. I thought, \"to hell with that. I'm not having anymore children!\" So when we got pregnant last Jan. it was a one time oops,\u00a0\u00a0which totally surprised me because we had tried for so long for our second child. I was devestated at first. Scared out of my mind I'd go through the same thing. I cried the whole way home from the dr.'s office. I finally accepted the whole thing and thought \"God does these things for a reason so everythings going to be fine\"\u00a0\u00a0So I started to get excited, we told the family and our boys-although the younger one had no idea. All to have it taken away. So now I'm determined to have one more. There is supposed to be another one there yet and I will try until it happens. Just makes you wonder why the big man upstairs does what he does. Sorry to go on and on, just thought I'd fill you in on my story with this fertility thing. I hope you are feeling ok with the bleeding and cramps. Have the hubby take good care of you and I'll \"talk\" to you soon!",

I am anxious to find out what testing they do too. I'm wondering if you need to have it done around a m/c time or if I could try to start that even though it's almost been a year since my last one??? I could call my dr. I suppose. Yes, we have been trying to conceive like crazy;) Since the m/c was over last March...I think we went against dr. recomendations and didn't even wait the 1 month. Then went through the second m/c in Nov. and started right back up in Dec. Nothing happened so far. I was put on Clomid for 5 cycles and the last time I took that was the end of June. I don't know what the heck is the problem. Everyone says \"stop trying so hard and that's when it will happen\". WHATEVER!!!!!!!! How long have you guys been ttc? Glad things are progressing for you, onto the next step. What time are you normally online? For me it's late-after the kiddos go to bed. They had way too much sugar today I'll tell ya!
