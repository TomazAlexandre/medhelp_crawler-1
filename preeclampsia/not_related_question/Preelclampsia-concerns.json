    "question": "I went in for my glucose screening a few weeks ago and everything seemed fine. Well, for the last couple of weeks I've been feeling really bad..stomach pain, constant headache, blurred vision and some dizziness and mild swelling. Well, my Dr office called me the other day to inform me that the screening needed to be redone because one of the nurses dropped a vile of my blood. I'm just worried that maybe there is a problem and they don't want to let me know yet. Do you guys think this is cause for concern?Thanks28w4d",
