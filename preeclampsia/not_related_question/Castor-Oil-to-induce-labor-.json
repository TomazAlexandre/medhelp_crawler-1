    "question": "I was just messin around on the net and came across forum that some women have talked about using castor oil to induce their own labors. I guess they say its safe and that their doctors recommended them to do it. I have heard that it can make the baby pass meconium in-utero. But, they said that the baby can do that with or without taking the castor oil. Has anyone ever tried this? Did it actually work, or just leave you on the toilet all day/night? Don't worry, I am not thinking about using this as I am only 34.3 weeks. I just want to know people's experiences with it. Thanks.",
