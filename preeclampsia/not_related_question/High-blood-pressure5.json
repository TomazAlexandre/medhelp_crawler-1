            "answer": "It didn't affect my baby but I did deliver earlier I was induce because at my appointment at 38 weeks 5 days my blood pressure was really high and I had protein in my urine I was seen more often due to my blood pressure because they were making sure i didn't have preeclampsia because I was also very swollen throughout my whole pregnancy and at that appointment the doctor told me I had to be induce bc she was worry about me not the baby and it all happened at the very end all fast I ended up with a c section bc that's what happens most of the time when you get induce but I blame myself sometimes bc I wasn't careful with what i ate and they had me on a strict diet and I didn't follow it",

            "answer": "I had high blood pressure with my first and was a big balloon! I ended up getting induced at 39 weeks but my blood pressure spiked at 30 weeks and I was monitored closely & had to get a nonstress test a couple times but my baby was always moving and doing what she was supposed to be doing so thankfully I was able to wait until I was full term, my baby was healthy just had jaundice so she got lights but who knows what that came from! Delivered vaginally with no problems. I'm currently expecting baby #2 and we'll see how this one goes! Just take it easy and rest. Your doctor will make sure everything is okay.",
