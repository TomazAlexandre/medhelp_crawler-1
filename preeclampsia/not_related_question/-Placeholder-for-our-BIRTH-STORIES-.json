            "answer": "Hey ladies,Alana was originally due on Jan. 10 Th. 2010. But when i was 38 weeks they found out that my amniotic fluid was low. We decided to go through with a c section. On December 30 Th 2009 i had my c section at 12:30 p.m. and she was born at 12:57 p.m. She is a perfect little angel. Alana Laurie McCabe- 7 lbs and 7.8 oz and 19 in.'s long. The c section was pretty simple. A lot easier than i thought. The only thing that has been hard is the recovery. Just kinda painful, but bearable. She is the cutest little baby ever. Hope all of you have as good of an experience as me.",

            "answer": "I went into my OB appt on Monday the 18th of Jan for my biweekly NST. BP was still up at 174/98. Doc had done labs the day before that came back ok. NST on Monday also was great. Well doc said lets go ahead and check you and I was 4cm and 50% effaced. She decided based on my high blood pressures to strip my membranes. She then went an conferred with her fellow collegues and it was decided that due to my preg induced hypertension and that I was already 4cm with bloody show since she stripped my membranes that they would send me for an immediate induction. I was 37 weeks.Got to the hosp and was started on pitocin at 3:30PM.. I was checked again and was 5cm. The contractions were coming regularly but nothing I could not handle. I opted to have an epid however at that time (5:30PM) as the anest staff was leaving the hosp @5:30 and if I waited any longer we would have to wait for the on call one to come in from home. WOW, that was an ordeal I wish on no one. It hurt terribly and yes I admit I cried in pain. I had previous back surgery and everytime the Anest attempted to thread the catheter into the back he would hit scar tissue and bone. So it took 3 attempts and the 3rd which he placed very high finally took.No sooner had the epid kicked in that my water broke on its own in a huge gush. Fluid was clear.. Yay! That was around (6:00PM)The doc came in soon after my water broke and checked me again and I was at 5cm. Said it would be a while. Well at (7:15PM) I told Jeff that I needed to push.\u00a0\u00a0We called the nurse who hurried down and said I am sure it is just some pressure from the contractions as we just checked u 30 mins ago and you were btwn 5-6cm. I must have had a look on my face as she hurried and checked me said OMG you are complete and here is his head. So yay for me I went from 5cm-10cm in 30 mins.\u00a0\u00a0Doc was on the floor, rushed in I pushed 2x and Gavin Neil was born at 7:34PM weighing 6lbs and is 19\" long. :)\u00a0\u00a0I had no episiotomy nor did I tear at all. :)He is a tiny thing. :) Dark head of hair and feisty. He is perfectly healthy for being 3 weeks early and we are home and he is getting acquainted with his 3 year old sister who thinks he is \"soooooo cute\"! :)I am nursing and he latched on immed with no problems.I am charging my camera battery so I can upload some pics ASAP.Only neg is that I am terribly allergic to tape. So we told the anesth to only use paper tape on my back. Well I am now allergic to that as well and I have blisters from my butt all the way up my back onto my shoulders. It burns like crazy and is so gross. But they sent me home with cotizone cream to take some of the pain away.Thank you for the countless well wishes and congrats you all sent.\u00a0\u00a0I have the best group of friends and I cherish you all.Kelly :)",

            "answer": "I had convinced myself that my baby was perfectly content to stay in the womb for a very long time since there was no indication that I was progressing. My EDD was January 21. I was surprised to have my baby on January 20.I lost my mucus plug the evening of the 19th and then my water broke 3:30 AM on the 20th. I went to the hospital a few hours later and the OB said I was having regular contractions - they were not strong at all - but that I was only 1 cm dilated. I was admitted and the OB checked on me at 1:30 PM. I was still having contractions - still not strong - and was only 2 cm dilated. So they gave me pitocin. Then the contractions got really strong! i got an epidural and I started dilating pretty quickly. But I felt no pain with the epidural. At 8:30 I was 9.5 cm dilated and the OB said she would be back in 30-60 minutes and I would start pushing. My DH and I watched the clock and the OB eventually came back and checked me at 10:15. She said it was time. The nurse got everything ready and I started pushing a little before 11. I only pushed for 45 minutes. Our son, Ryder, was born at 11:38 PM on January 20. He was bigger than expected - 9 lbs, 2 oz. We had a lot of u/s and the doctors always said he was about the 60th percentile - so I was expecting the baby to be about 8 lbs. me and my DH did not know our baby is a boy until he was born. For some reason, we were both completely surprised and are so happy.Ryder is absolutely beautiful. My DH and I are so amazed by him. So far, he looks just like my DH. Ryder is a pretty calm baby - as long as he gets fed immediately when he is hungry and diaper changes don't take too long. After a couple of bad nights, he has been sleeping pretty well. he sleeps a solid 4 hours, wakes up for a feeding, and then goes back to sleep for another 3 hours. I am breastfeeding and that is going okay. He latches on pretty quickly, but falls asleep pretty quickly too.I now know what people mean when they say that you run on adrenaline.Congrats to everyone! And best of luck!",
