            "answer": "Thank you for your reply. But, now i am more confused. My lab was TSH 38.31 two weeks ago, and today 4.30. Been on Thyroxine 100MCG daily for 2 weeks since the last blood work, but do not feel any better....infact i feel worse (Dizziness biggest issue now) My hair is STILL falling out and my fatigue....STILL HERE. Furthermore, i was thinking that my levels would take up to 5-6 weeks to adjust...Could this be a sign that something else is going on? If so...what should i consider ? Any info would be as always...VERY Helpful ;)",

            "answer": "Hi,Your levels are looking better, however it may still take some time for you to feel better (and the retesting at 5 - 6 weeks will give you a better picture of what's going on once your levels have stabilised).Be patient with this for a few more weeks... it really does take a while to feel better as the thyroid meds are adjusted. (In my experience it took a few months to feel better from being hypo, even when the meds were correct)....You'll need to work with your endo (you'll see in Nov - December) and your doctor to screen for anything else going on, but primarily need to address the thyroid for now.\u00a0\u00a0If still feeling bad in another month or so and your levels are ok, see if you can get bumped up to see the endocrinologist sooner.Best wishes",

So i am wondering if maybe i had issues from before as well that i was not aware of. I am guessing that maybe you did too, which is why you had some complications....I would think that since Thy. problems are soooooooooooooooo common with a lot of women that Dr.'s would run tests during pregnancy, i have no idea why they do not. Wouldn't it make sense that they do?",

    "question": "Hi,9mths ago i had a baby through a C-Section. Recently i have been having more than normal hair loss and off and on weird joint pain, so i decided to have my thyroid checked. The results were TSH of 38.31 and T4 of 5.4, so my OB gave my Thyroxine to take for 2 weeks and then repeat the tests. He said he is not very fmaliar with Thyroid issus. Further more, I was also treated 10 years ago for\u00a0\u00a0hyperprolactinemia with bromocriptine and since then my prolactin levels have always been normal, including my recent test which showed 6.8. My mother has hyperthyroidism and so it does run in the family. I am concerned that my TSH was that high, is that normal? Would it be related to\u00a0\u00a0hyperprolactinemia? I am not able to get an appointment with a specialist till Nov-Dec and so any information regarding the issue would be very VERY helpful. I have been feeling a little dizzy recently, not sure if that is a symptom, and there are rare times in the afternoon where i may feel very tired....but I am confused about the blood work. Please shed some light. I do not get to see a specialist till a couple of weeks from now and so i have no where to turn to for answers. thank you in advance for any info ;)",
