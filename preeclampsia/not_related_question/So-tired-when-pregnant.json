Let me tell ya...it dosen't matter! I'm still tired after that. Dr's say because of the growing uterus in these last weeks and everything else that's going on your body goes back to how you felt in the frist trimester :/ that stinks! But atleast we will be used to it when the babies get here ;) All those sleepness nights, we will be tired the next day. I told my Mom the the 10 times of peeing at night, and the up and down with heartburn, and the need a midnight snack are just putting us in practice for when the baby gets here LOL! Good luck to you!",
