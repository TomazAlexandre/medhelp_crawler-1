            "answer": "It might be the baby. My little one was up in my ribs on my left and I had to work at getting him to move because it hurt and made breathing hard. Try prying at your baby from the lower last rib and push in and down. yYou have to keep doing it to wake the little one up and to make it move. I hope this is the problem and works for you!!!",

There was talk of appendicitis or the baby sitting on a nerve etc. turned out it was a urine infection in my case.

            "answer": "I also have the pain on the back of my right ribs, it's been going on for 6 days. Mine is like pinching pain, it worsens even doing basic household stuffs like doing the dishes, vacuuming, etc. My baby has been moving all over. So I don't think it is the baby. I am 25+4 days and went to see the doctor yesterday and he prescribed me FLEXERIL. But at the same time I have really bad sinus and he also prescribed me two other medicines. I am not sure if I should take all of them. As I don't like taking too many medicines at the same time and specially being pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor checked for the sinus but he never checked for my rib pain, so I didn't take my back pain medicine last night. sorry for long post. I read online that if you have a severe headache and pain on your right shoulder or abdomen, it could be sign of preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0So I asked my doctor and he said since I am 29 I don't need to worry about it. But I have gained almost 20 pounds this pregnancy and it's my first pregnancy. I hope your doctor listens to you more and hope you know what's causing the pain. I would love to hear back from you all.",
