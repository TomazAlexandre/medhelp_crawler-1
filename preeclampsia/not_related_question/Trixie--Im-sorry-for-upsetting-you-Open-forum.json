So far the bedrest is doing the trick to keep me stable. I'm 35 weeks, 3 days, and my Dr is planning to do an Amnio on Tues to test for lung maturity and possibly deliver me sometime in my 36th week. Baby is breech, (still!) so it is possible I may have a C-Section. If for some reason she turns, we will have an induction. It's been hard being on bedrest and thinking about all the things I could and want to be doing at home. I'm am glad that they are keeping me in the hospital, instead of bedrest at home. I think I would worry all the time and never be able to stay in bed enough. Dh and my Mom have been wonderful about doing things for me. I feel pretty ready with everything at home for Baby's arrival. We can't wait to see her! I'll try to keep you posted on things. Hope everyone is doing good. Take care! Kristen",
