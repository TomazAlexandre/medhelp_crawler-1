If their reasoning isn't clear or doesn't sound like a good enough reason (ie if your doc is going on vacation that's a pretty bad reason) then you can refuse the induction and wait for labor to start naturally.",

            "answer": "Watch \" The business of being born \". Don't let them induce with cytotec or its generic equivalent, it can cause uterine rupture. Only let them use pitocin. But I would be wary about inducing at 38 weeks. Due dates are sometimesOff by a week or two, and so your baby could actually be younger than you think and an induction could be bad. Ultrasound weight predictions are usually wrong, too. A lot of doctors won't even do them anymore. Unless your placenta is showing signs of distress or your amniotic fluid is too low, I would not allow such an early induction. Ask them to do a few non- stress tests first and if baby is acting normal there is probably no harm in waiting. Good luck.",

Staying in is best IF baby is getting what he needs and her's isn't.To the poster I would ask what type of induction as they can use a balloon to dialate, cytotec or another vaginal pill or will they start pitocin right away... May depend if your cervix is open yet. Also I would ask why they are waiting two weeks and if you will have another scan to see if baby is growing in those two weeks... If you have any other questions please private message me... I'm a pedi nurse and my sister has worked on ldrp for years",
