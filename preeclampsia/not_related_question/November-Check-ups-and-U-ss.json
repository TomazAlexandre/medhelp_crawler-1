            "answer": "my anatomy ultrasound went well. everything measured fine and we found out were having a girl! thinking Britton Marie. or maybe Brittan with an A. but the tech did say there was a cyst in/on the brain so im a little worried. she kept reassuring me that it can be normal to find one as long as there aren't more of them. so i will srely ask my doctor about it at my appointment.i have my 21week doc appointment on monday and ill be sure to update when i get home on that one. im assuming she will just meaure my abdomen and check the babies heart, go over the ultrasound with me.",
