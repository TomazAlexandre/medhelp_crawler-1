            "answer": "I'm right there with you! Our bodies were clearly designed for it and handle it, so I'm going to do my best to deliver fully natural as well. Not to knock other mommies who choose to have an epidural - I've heard too many horror stories so that's something that I just wouldn't choose for myself. That being said though, I am allowing my boyfriend to make the call whether or not to give the doctor the okay to give me one if I clearly cannot handle it, just in case. I'd love to do it with no epidural or drugs at all, but I also don't want my BF to stress out or worry any more than he already will be.",

            "answer": "I think it's really important to keep an open mind. I know so many people who wanted to go natural and couldn't and are really upset with the way their labour went. I never said what I would or wouldn't do with my first, I didn't know what to expect.I managed to go 23 hours completely med free but my body was exhausted and I had to get some pain relief, it wore off at the end so when I pushed her out I was med free. My labour was 36 hours in total and in have had major complications and problems, my placenta didn't come away for ages, resulting in having away huge medical team push on my tummy after she was born and me needing meds to help it resulting in a massive blood loss (close to having a blood transfusion) and My daughter also got stuck at her shoulders because she was back to back.My second, my son was stillborn, and my placenta didnt come away so i had to have it manually removed in theatre, also lost so much blood i almost needed a transfusion again So its very easy to say our bodies are designed for it but sometimes it doesn't work the way we plan.If you go med free and have the labour you wish for then that's incredible but also if you don't manage it and need a little help that's great too. After all your there to bring a little life into the world and it really doesn't matter how that happens as long as both mother and baby are safe afterwards. Good luck to you, I really hope you get the labour you want.",

            "answer": "How about you go in with the intention of natural (remember your breathing exercises!) but then when you're there if you find its too much and you need some pain relief then get it. Don't feel bad if you need it. Or if you decide you don't need anything then that's ok too.It's truly an individual decision based on each woman's labor. How a woman decides to go through labor is as individual a choice as what name she decides to give her baby. So some will opt for natural and others will opt for help and others may not have a choice due to unforseen circumstances. Either way, it's not wrong to do it one way instead of the other.In the end the only truly important thing is that mother and baby make it through delivery. How they get there isn't as important.",

My husband knew when I looked like I was gonna pass out. I was hesitant but knew I didnt have the stregnth being so tired and took epidural at about 7 centimeters. I got to rest and took less than 2 min to push out a healthy baby. I had no after effects like some people do. I am going to try without this next time tho cause every birth is different but not many things go as planned lol Good luck to you! :)",

My baby and I are healthy and Im not trying to sound like superwoman but I can tolerate pain. I prefer to go through that and risk having a complication later because of the epidural. My thing is if you can why not go full natural. Some don't even hesitate and want the epidural right away. I've made my birth plan and hope and pray that I can go through with it",

The baby seemed more alert too. warm water helped with pain and also pressure on my low back. I liked feeling like I was more present and that I could do what my body was designed to do.

First time mom and I really really really want to have my little girl with no drugs. Deff a big NO to epidural. Yea I know some will say why go through the pain if you don't have to well we were designed to have babies so we should know how it feels. Ive been looking at some videos and reading but I want more advice from already mom's that had their babies with no drugs. So I can try to be as prepared as possible even though I'll prob forget everything when feeling all those contractions lol no negative comments please ! I'm looking for support not negative Nancy.
