I understand not working can be stressful, I haven't been able to work my whole pregnancy and since I was at my job for less then a year I got let go with no disability pay or anything. I would think you would qualify for disability, you should look into that.\u00a0\u00a0and maybe nothing is really wrong, maybe your doctor is just being extra cautious. I know that's what my doctor is doing, because I was having preterm labor and my mom had my twin brothers at 6 months and me at 7 months and preterm labor can run in the family, they are just being extra careful. Just remember keeping those babies baking in there are the most important thing, and even though bed rest in boring, rest all you can now because in a few months you wont be getting any sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also on here ALL the time since I am at home, so if you ever need someone to talk to just find me here =) I hope things continue to go smoothly for you.",

Adding to what Peek said....there is\u00a0\u00a0a website (I think it's for people on bedrest with Preeclampsia but regardless) that is FULL of ideas of things to do on bedrest! Turns out you can accomplish quite a bit from bed! My good frend was on hospitalized bedrest for several weeks so I just googled \"things to do on bedrest\" and the amount of answers I found were nuts!Good luck with the rest of the pregnancy! :) Do you know the sexes of the babies? (Sorry if I missed that post) The next 15 weeks will FLY by!!",
