My son was 7lbs and totally healthy at 37 weeks...it depends on if the doc put a stat order on your tests..if you feel like you need to just show up to labor and delivery and they'll take care of you. You can also call an after hours line for most places, but, you're right, usually no news is good news but just keep an eye in yourself and do what you feel you need to do.",
