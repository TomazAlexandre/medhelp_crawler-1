He said it was BH, but i thought that a contraction would let up every now and then. It was tightened up continuously... never lessened and only got worse when i climbed stairs. I've never had BH before (or a real contraction for that matter). Is it possible for them to not let up for so long? One long contraction? It faded as soon as I got home and put my feet up.",

Not only are some of you worse off (sorry to hear that!), but you make me feel like it's OK to not be feeling good, to not be enjoying every aspect of this pregnancy.I bought a maternity support belt last night. hopefully it will help with the pelvic pain. I stopped climbing stairs at work and the unpleasant hours-long contractions have disappeared. Plenty of pelvic pain, round ligament stretching, etc... lingers.Mrs. Fergie- I had that crazy swelling in the pubic area a few weeks ago. It wasn't vaginal- it was the pubic area right over the pelvis. It was so swollen it was scary. I could push the flesh in like an inch! and boy did it hurt. I recalled experiencing the same swelling at the very end of my pregnancy and for the first few weeks post partum. I got very nervous because i had preeclampsia last time, and i feared this was a sign. Remarkably, it disappeared the day i started to sleep with my Snoogle pillow again. Maybe it was being aggrevated by the position of my hips/pelvis while i slept?It's finally hot here too, but i am enjoying it (for now).

I had to wear nana type shoes with valcro because my feet were so swollen. Yuck. You will all hate me when I tell you that here in Australia we are in Autumn (Fall) and so my twins will be here in Winter (August)! Yay!I am 36 weeks in size, yet I am only 25 weeks gestation! Oh the horror, my ligaments havn't had time to stretch- instead they have been tearing. It feels like a burning tearing pain in the top half of my stomach whenever I am on my feet. I have had trouble sleeping at night too, I get a numb feeling hip and leg after laying on it for half an hour. Then to turn over takes a massive effect and a lot of groaning! Its like doing a 3 point turn. Pelvic pain, back pain, the usual times by 10. When people ask me how I am, I just say now \"Dont ask!\". Im such a chirpy blimp at the moment!!!",

I too am so happy to be pregnant yet have had a lot of stuff going on with my body since the beginning! I felt pretty good from weeks 16-25 but am once again feeling like a big whining baby. Here I go...I had been mis-diagnosed as having over-active bladder a couple years before I got pregnant...now they say that I have internal cystitis which I can take meds for but they aren't recommended during pregnancy so no way, even though my doctor keeps asking if I want them! So I am literally in the bathroom every 15-20 minutes and \"holding it\" constantly at work which hurts like crazy, but it's embarassing to go to the bathroom that much. I have gotten up to pee every couple hours, sometimes every hour or more, to pee, and have leaked every single time I go to pee, since the beginning. Ahhh!! The past few weeks, when baby kicks me in the bladder, I have to get to the bathroom PRONTO or I know I will have an accident. This is hard when you commute over an hour each way to work!!I have had a sore belly for a couple weeks now which makes it hard to move around much. My feet, ankles and calves swell so badly that my shins are killing me by the end of the day. Right now I can put my feet up some at work, but will be working at a very active summer camp the entire month of July and can't even imagine what hell that will be...not to mention how I will be able to pee all the time... I have had spotting, painful contractions, back pain and random pains in my abdomen which have had my docs worried about pre-term labor so I've had a bunch of internal exams and missing work due to appts which my boss is ticked about and yelled at me for yesterday and then another supervisor wants me to be on bed rest so I'm less of a problem. I have gained 28 lbs already and I am only 27 wks which seems like too much. I've had a ton of pelvic pain for over a week, especially on my long commute but I can't exactly change positions. I'm also exhausted all the time again, as I was the first 15 weeks.Positives: My baby shower is in a month, I have an amazingly supportive husband and I passed my gestational diabetes test today!",
