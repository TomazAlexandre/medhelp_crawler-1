It helped so much with the pain. Don't feel guilty if you have to get one. I will say though, try to hold off as long as possible though because after you get one, you can't get up anymore. I've heard it's ideal to try to wait until your like dilated to a 7. But if you can't do it, go ahead and go for it.",

And just like any medicine, the epidural has potential side effects and that scares me, I try to avoid taking any medicine unless I have to! I'm getting induced with this baby on Saturday and I am going to try not to get one, but things don't always go as planned so I may get one if the pain is too much.",

Just think about it going into your body, it has to affect the baby In some way? That baby has to feel something. I will never get one because of the side affects. Every person I know that had one sill gets back pain from it and a few people had to go into the emergency room because they had a nonstop headache from the time they got it.",

They all suffer from chronic back pain, some of them didn't experience it right away, but a few years later the back pain comes, and they all said it either didn't work or it only helped with the contractions but not with the actual pushing. I'm not planning on getting an epidural, but it's a personal choice so it's up to the individual. Some women loved it and some hated it.",

But might I add that the drugs that you put in your body do have an affect on your baby, it can make them sluggish which in turn can make your labor longer or lead to a c-section, he/she may also have a harder time nursing at first. This is NOT meant to scare you! Lol\u00a0\u00a0I have just done some reading up on it, and have seen that an epidural can and does affect the baby though it may not always be in a major way.
