I AM NOT POINTING FINGERS AT ANYONE OR ANYONE IN THIS THREAD....GENERAL STATEMENT. sometimes i have found that ppl who share a different veiw have been quick to judge or point out wrongs instead of looking at it from the other persons point of veiw...i just weed those posts out and look at the posts that are factual.some ppl believe if you are TTCing you should act as if you are PG...and that is very fine and awsome. for me i only act PG when i get a BFP. i don't drink alot or take alot of meds, but i do have drinks when i go to a nice dinner or with friends in moderation and my doc says this is perfectly acceptable and NOT harmful in any way. the most important thing for you to do is not stress out. you did NOTHING wrong and your baby will not be effected by any of this....it hadn't even implanted yet. and even if it had it isn't tapped into your blood stream and as long as you have been excersizing all along...docs say that you can continue to do so even if PG. it is new regimes after PG is confirmed that may or may not cause probs.feel free to contact me at anytime and keep me posted as to what your doc says....happy health 9 mos to you girl!!!love....kimmie",

I really dont ever drink and I have 2 young kids (one thats nursing) so I have to wait until their in bed for the night to ever have even 1 drink but still if I would have even thought I was pregnant I would not have had anything to drink. Of course you'll always fine something to blame it on though. If I were you I would go see my doctor and have your hcg level checked. Good luck I hope all is well!",

To be on the safe side I took pregnancy tests on Sun. Wed. & Fri. (first response) and nothing. I even called the OB/GYN and explained the cramps, moodiness, breaking out, and no period after 33 days, and she also said that it was normal to feel this way because my body had not gotten back to a normal cycle and to give it some time to start AF.\u00a0\u00a0She said it was highly unlikely that I was pg given I ovulated and had sex the last time about three weeks ago. After the call, I popped a bunch of Advil for the cramps and continued to take a lot of Advil since. I went out to dinner with my husband and had several drinks on Fri. I worked out really really hard yesturday and last night I went to a Mexican place (shellfish) and had a few margaritas. I have been drinking a lot of caffine in the last couple of days too. Basically all the things I cut out for so long because I thought there was no possilbe way I could be pregnant. WELL, this morning I got this really weird feeling and decided to take another hpt (I dont even no what possessed me) and got a very very very faint line pretty quickly. I am sitting here crying because I dont know what to think. If I had any clue this could happen.\u00a0\u00a0I would not have done any of the things I have done lately.\u00a0\u00a0It scares me that I have such a faint line this much later and petrified of having another miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0I feel so completely overwhelmed, scared, and guilt",
