They both told me that it was not pregnancy related but not to have anymore children. I miscarried 3 times (before each one of my live births). I have never been able to get any straight answers about any of it. I have physically recovered from it except that I have shaking episodes on my right side still at times and my mind is not the same. My memory is horrible now and I sometimes can know what I want to say but sometimes I just can't find the right words. I have a bit of weakness on my right side also but not major enough for most people to notice. I also talk really fast alot of times but don't realize it (people sometimes look at me funny) I am now 33 and pregnant (surprise!!). I am scared to death but I also feel like God would not have given me this gift if I wasn't supposed to have it.

My symptoms are mostly under control but doctors seem unsure of the risk. I had preclampsia with the twins at 36 weeks and delivered via c-section at 37 weeks. My internal med doc referred me to my gyn but no one is really telling me how high the risk is of injuring the dissection further and/or of continuing the aspirin therapy and beta blockers. I understand no one can say for sure what will happen but I really need a better understanding of the risk so we make the best decision for my health and don't put our potential baby in harms way.

I had a PFO repaired during the the first month of my pregnancy. I was told if I want to have more kids i should be fine but to plan way ahead. I'm from a very small town in Idaho and didn't have the best experience with Doctor's or the nearest University hospital. My family docotor's were baffled by me but very supportive. My Cardiologist, Dr, Soresen from Salt Lake City, UT was the greatest! The University of Utah doctor's I was not impressed with. They kept me there for a week drew my blood every 4 hours, did MRI's and talked to me once a day for 10 minutes they finally sent me home with Lovenox shots 2x a day (I switched to Heparin) with no understanding of the cause at all. Thats when we found Dr. Soresen he found my PFO and repaired it 2 weeks later. I retaught myself to write, read and speak. My pregnancy went well, I went 37 weeks and delivered C-section for fear I could hemmorage. I won't lie I'm very scared of getting pregnant again. I guess I'm looking for reassurance and reccomendations on Doctor's within Utah and Idaho.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry about any grammar or spelling issues, LOL.",
