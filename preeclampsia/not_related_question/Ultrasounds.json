You should refuse if you feel uncomfortable maybe have some1 go w U to Ur apt to help give U support. So it's easier to say NO. How often do U go to the dr? It's usually only once a month until the end of the pregnancy. Of course unless Ur high risk.",

    "question": "My clinic *****. Not that I don't love seeing my baby but i feel like they do too many ultrasounds on me. I have been getting one done every time I have an appointment which is a total of 11 and I'm only 28 weeks and 4 days. plus another 3 when I was hospitalized. I keep telling my doctor I don't want to have an ultrasound every time I go in but she insist there is nothing wrong by having one every time i come in. Quote \"Don't you want to see your baby?\" What gets me more upset is that the tech never tells me the length and weight of my baby and I am always asking and she always spends like 30min to simply be taking measurements and she cant even give me any answers. My question is what should I do? I keep saying no but they guilt trip me by saying why don't you want to see your baby?",
