I take 1 to two a day based on my pain. I am scared that this is not safe for the baby, but this is my 5th child and after childbirth they gave me the percocet for pain, and I was breastfeeding. So, if it wasn't safe then why would they give it to you if you are breastfeeding? scared and confused!",

            "answer": "I have Lupus and Fibromyalgia. I was on Oxycontin (over 120mgs a day), When I found out I was pregnant( after being told I couldn't have anymore children 7 years prior), I tried to wean off the pills. After having high blood pressures and a few seizures, my doctors and I got me down to the lowest dose of percocet I could be on without these episodes. I go into the OB every week, am now 34weeks preg. , and am trying very hard not to get preeclampsia ( hence the worry over the pressures and seizures) like with my previous three children ( born at 36, 34.5, and 33 weeks).But everytime there is a new dr. or nurse involved you would think I was a crack addict. I get berated, told I'm abusing my unborn daughter, told it would serve me right if she did come out with horrid defects.. you name it! I wish someone would teach these professionals that there is a difference between my situation and a drug addict. I wish they would understand that I beat myself up more then they ever could over my failings because of my poor health. If there was any way I could have not put her through this, it would have been done, instantly.I'm praying for the best, planning on breastfeeding because that will help her to wean off easier.I wish anyone in this situation the best of luck, and hope for the compassion from health professional that I wish was there for me.",
