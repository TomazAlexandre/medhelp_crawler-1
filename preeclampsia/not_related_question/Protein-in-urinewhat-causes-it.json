            "answer": "sometimes protein in urine can be there one time and not the next.\u00a0\u00a0I think that spillage of protein is usually associated with toxemia but than also comes with\u00a0\u00a0horrible headaches and blurred vision. I would just ask her next time u see her,\u00a0\u00a0I wouldnt worry to much about itunless ur midwife seems overly worried. Sometimes protein in urine can show due to the dipstick they use reading mucus as protein ( mucus is a protein by nature) and it\u00a0\u00a0says on the label to the Urinanalysis test kits that this can be an interfence ( see i am still rememberin all my work terms and such from being a lab tech adn i actually miss working right now it was\u00a0\u00a0something to break up the day no to mention easier on the family budget)\u00a0\u00a0i would again just as her next time u see her",

Or was it actually +I'd just drink more water I had protein present throughout my pregnancy and sometimes it just due to not drinking enough and seeing as your urine is darker I'd say your body needs more.Also probably not in your case it could have something to do with kidney function n I had to have blood tests everyday but I had pre-eclampsia also",

            "answer": "Yes, I agree. Try to drink more fluids, it could be that you were a little dry. If it stays in your urine in your subsequent visits then you might be developing preeclampsia. I read somewhere (not sure where, but it was a pregnancy website) that sometimes the protein in the urine is present before the blood pressure begins to spike to indicate preeclampsia. I hope this isn't the case, it's likely nothing. I had random weeks where I had protein present, but I still made it to term with the help of bedrest. Mybp was fine, I was just dilating and having contractions the entire third trimester.",

            "answer": "i had 4+ of protein by time i was 31 weeks thats when the pre-eclampsia really kicked in its due to your kidneys leaking as long as your bp stays normal its not pre-clampsia i had to have my baby at 31 weeks and she is perfectly fine dont get me wrong it was a real scary time and you've hit 33 weeks so try not to worry good luck hun",

            "answer": "Thanks everyone! I'm not sure if it was a trace or +? She uses the sticks you dip into the urine to see how much protein there is, but she didn't tell me the number this time. I knew when I dipped it in, I had protein because it turns this greenish color and normally I don't have that. I would imagine there was a good bit because it looked like it did at the beginning of my pregnancy when I couldn't hold anything down.I am drinking a lot, but maybe those couple of days I just needed more than I thought since my urine was on the darker side. Yea, I figured if my BP was normal, then I shouldn't worry too much. Last week I was getting a lot of horrible headaches, but I thought maybe it was a sinus issue or the weather change.My midwife wasn't too concerned, she just wanted to know if I was eating enough, which I am, so it's confusing. I will see what happens next week at my appt. Hopefully nothing more is going on. I have been getting more contractions and they are getting stronger, but nothing consistent or in a pattern thankfully. 21 more days and I am in the clear!! Getting more excited now.",

            "answer": "Now I'm wondering if zantac could have caused the protein to show up? I was reading some side effects and while some are severe, I did have some of the minor side effects such as constipation, insomnia, headaches, and dark urine. Now some of these could be due to the pregnancy or weather change, so it's hard to say what's going on. BUT I did just start taking zantac over a week ago, so who knows! I take one every 24 hours and it helps tremendously with the acid reflux.\u00a0\u00a0I told my midwife I take it and she told me to try papaya enzyme and see if that helps. It's natural and would be better during pregnancy. Ah we will see.",

As long as you are drinking 2 L of water a day, its not due to hydration .\u00a0\u00a0You can develop pre- eclampsia at a later time during your pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0If you start seeing flashes of light or if you have swelling in your face or a significant gain of weight overnight. Go in to the emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry but, I would be concerned about a midwife who didn't at least warn you.\u00a0\u00a0You can develop high blood pressure overnight.\u00a0\u00a0The not eating enough question baffles me as well.\u00a0\u00a0I would think any seasoned midwife would be aware of the signs and symptoms, and proteinuria.",

    "question": "So I had my weekly checkup today and I am still 3cm which is great. I haven't changed in 2 weeks so I'm happy!From week 7-20 I could barely keep anything down so I always had a trace of protein in my urine during checkups and my midwife never thought anything of it because I was so sick. Well I'm 33 weeks now, eat normal every day and today I had protein in my urine. It's been weeks since it's showed up! What would cause this? The first thing she asked was if I was eating enough. I definitely don't eat a LOT but I eat a fair amount of food everyday and salad and meats. She was kind of puzzled. I also asked her what my glucose results were (kept forgetting at my other appts) and it was 80, so no worries there thankfully. My blood pressure is perfect. It's always at its lowest during pregnancy.I am drinking lots of water, the fluid around the baby is great, but my urine has been a bit darker and I crave ice all day long! It's crazy. The ice thing she said is my body is lacking in some area, whether it's iron or whatever and I have been slacking on my prenatals this month, so I'm back to taking those.Any thoughts on what would cause the protein in the urine this late in pregnancy? I'm kind of baffled. Never had this problem in my other pregnancies.",
