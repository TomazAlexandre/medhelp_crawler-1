I had high blood pressure and swelling so they tested my urine for protein and that (Thank GOD) came out negative. I have to go weekly now though. We started our childbirth classes last night and it was really great. Ben is a first time Dad (If you don't count how he is already more of a father to my girls!) so he bonded with the guys there who were also first time Dads. They also had to wear 30 lb empathy bellies. It was great!! How are you doing?",

They were saying in class last night that first time babies drop weeks before labor usually but second or more babies don't usually drop until just shortly before delivery. I didn't know that and to me it would seem the other way around, but what do I know! I bet you can breathe better now! I can't wait to meet my little man! Just think...not too long and we'll be posting about our babies and post partum ;)",
