            "answer": "I had pre-eclampsia with my daughter, when they induced me at almost 28 weeks, i didnt have a c-section but i was on magnesium for my whole labor. and my doctor said there is no definite cure-all way to prevent it, but the best way to try is eat HEALTHY. Kinda go by the diet as if you had gestational diabetes. I had protein in my urine at like 18 weeks then at 20 weeks there was no more. I'm at about 30 weeks and we're hopeful. Just be a little cautious, it's likely you can have it again, but it's not a forster thing.",

    "question": "I am currently 5 weeks pregnant with my 2nd baby. I developed pre Clampsia in the last month with my first born and had to have an emergency c section 2 weeks before her due date.I really want to experience natural labour and avoid another c section. What are the odds that I will develop pre Clampsia again? Or will I have to automatically have another c section because of my first experience",
