    "question": "Well if you have read any of my posts before you will know that i havnt had a very good pregnancy so far, with the bleedings i had, and now with the high amount of protein in my urine. Well the urine problem as been going on for weeks now and doctors, specialists and midwifes dont know what is happening, i have done 3 24hr urine tests now and they are all showing very high levels of protein for a pregnant lady.Yesterday i went to the ante natal day unit to have some more blood tests done and they have come back clear, the little one was monitored and she is doing fine and then the midwife did my blood pressure and it had droped to 100/50 from the usual 125/75. I have been to the hospital again today to see a new specialist and he was very nice he checked me over and baby seemed to be doing very well again, but when he did my blood pressure it had risen to 136/86. I have to start and go to the ante natal day unit for intense monitoring twice a week 9am-6pm and if my bp doesnt go down they are finally going to induce me (thank god) you never know i may be holding my little girl in a couple of weeks. Sorry its so long.",
