I had DDC call me back today on my review and they said everything looked ok and if i wanted a retest they would do it for 600$ if I really wanted too but its not worth it at this point especially with only 4 weeks left.Charamaire Please come back and update..",

My child would be left without a father and that is scary, but it is so rare so very rare that I just can't see that being the case. But then again I can't see how a paternity test could be wrong like this either. I asked DDC for an email or address to send the conflicting results and they said because of HIPPA that all I could do was call them. And that makes no sense to me at all.

I am getting induced a month early do to preeclampsia. :(. My doctor feels that it was brought on by stress. I am sending a certified letter to the father today to let him know what my plan is and to give him the opportunity to test without a court order, we will see how that goes. I highly doubt he will though. I have given up trying to go after DDC. I am going wait until the second paternity test goes through and then do what is necessary. If for some reason he gets an exclusion again, it does mean he is chimera and I am in for a long battle. I have meet with a local geneticist and he will help me if that happens. We both highly doubt that that is an option. It is more likely something happened at the lab or collection site. Either way DDC is responsible for who they subcontract out their collections to.No matter what I will not stop fighting. :). I will tel you ladies the outcome.",

I saw the picture and his id.\u00a0\u00a0It was my id that they lost a copy of and my name they got all messed up.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have the energy to fight DDC. My lawyers were clear on the matter. It would be long drawn out and expensive. I can't afford to raise a child on my own, fight with the father, and fight DDC. Not to mention the strain all this has put on job performance, which I can't afford to lose. I have to pick what's important and what I can handle. I have known this man for 19 years I know for a fact when finds out this child is his and DDC, who continually reassured him the test was correct 100%, was wrong, will go after them. He will fight that battle. It is hard to be mad at him although don't get me wrong I am angry with him. But just imagine if you were in his shoes. They repeatedly told him that the test was correct no matter what, I am not sticking up for him but we were not in a relationship. We both travel extensively for work. He had my word and then he had the word of an accredited company. Yes it hurt he would not retest but DDC told him there was no reason to retest and the results were correct. I had no idea about the other girl but to give him a small amount of credit he did break up with her when he found out I was pregnant. He put all his energy and focus on me and the baby. We did the test just to make sure. It broke his heart when he got the results. He shut down and shut me out. That is what he does. So now I am doing what I can and what I can handle. I have a full plate so I will let the father take his wrath out on DDC because I know he will. He is a very powerful man.",

My son deserves for me to fight. I need to be able to say\u00a0\u00a0I tried everything.As far as what I can and cannot ask for at court, I don't have much control. I can't ask for a different lab and I can't ask for a blood and swab. I will be good just getting a retest. Because he filed sanctions my lawyers can be held to pay his lawyer expenses so all three of my lawyers say me down and made me do a sworn statement about my sexual history and who my sons father is, that was super fun.",

I go to court in three weeks but my lawyer doesn't think the judge will order another test besides the prenatal one, which blows my mind and breaks my heart. This whole thing has turned into a circus and I think people have forgotten that there is a real life child involved here. People are quoting case law to me and talking about test accuracy and I am just staring at my son wondering why isn't he reason enough. And if they are so sure in the prenatal one then why does it matter if we do another one, unless he doesn't want him no matter what. That is what scares me is that when he finds out the truth he still rejects him and then I have wasted my time and energy. I am going bankrupt with this court case and, according to my lawyer, end up paying his lawyer costs no matter what\u00a0\u00a0and I probably won't get a retest. Here I am a single mom and I know without a doubt who the father is but do I lose everything to prove it. I am very very close to losing my job because I don't have childcare. I have cleaned out all my bank accounts. I am flat broke. I have prayed about it and talked to my preacher and the answer I get is to keep fighting. I just hope that once the truth comes out this is all worth it. I hope ten years down the road when my son has a relationship with his father I can say I did the right thing.",
