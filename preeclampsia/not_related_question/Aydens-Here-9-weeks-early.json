    "question": "My baby was born 12/11/24 @ 9:24pm. I was induced because I had very high levels of protein in my urine and my blood pressure was over 200/150 for a consecutive of atleast 3 days. Went to the ER because my pressure was slightly elevated to find it had risen even more by the time I made it to the hospital. So, I was admitted and watched very closely until my doctor said I could go no longer with my pregnancy. It was a very scary week, but he's here and doing really great!!! The NICU is an amazing place and full of amazing people!!! He was born @ 30 weeks 5 days weighing 3 lbs 8 ozs....Hopefully he'll be home soon because he's making great progress!!!",
