            "answer": "I had a blighted ovum last year I should have been 13 weeks when I went to get my ultrasound but the baby stopped growing at 5 weeks. Nothing could be seen but two 2 saks. It took me another 2 weeks to actually miscarry then I had to go to the er for bleeding too much and had a d and c. Im hoping all will be well with you! At 5 weeks it could just be too early to see anything. The best of luck keep us posted. Its so hatd going through the worrying. Im in the same boat again wondering if this is a viable prenancy im only 6 weeks and have an appt on the 31st.",

            "answer": "This happened in my 3rd pregnancy they seen everything except the baby. I wouldn't worry just yet. They doctor at the hospital wanted me to do a d&c but I refused. I went back a few weeks to an ob and found out that everything was OK and baby was just to small to see at the time. I had my first child at 35 weeks (during to preeclampsia)The first 2 pregnancies were miscarriages which I passed on my own.. Just be patient for now and see how it turns out I'm so glad. I didn't listen to the doctor at the hospital.",
