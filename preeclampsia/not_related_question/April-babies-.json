            "answer": "The main thing is to embrace the contractions. They are what is going to make it possible for you to get a baby into the world. If you think of them that way and try to work with them rather than fight them, you will be able to go without an epidural no problem. Working with them means breathing deeply through each one, and trying to relax. My sister in law noticed during one delivery that if she grimaced during a contraction, the pain actually intensified. Because when she was grimacing, she was also tensing up.Our bodies are equipped with a fight or flight mechanism that can be very helpful at times, but not during labor. If you get stressed or anxious enough, your body will reroute it's energy into your arms and legs. In times of unrest, this has allowed a laboring woman to get to a safer place before delivering her baby, if necessary. But in a safe environment, all it does is slow down your labor. So my advice is you surround yourself with people that have had positive birth experiences and listen to them. This should help you to lower your anxiety about the coming miracle of life. Good luck, you'll do great! (and if you end up needing more painful relief, please know that it is not a sign of weakness)",

I liked being aware of what was going on and not focusing on the pain and \"trying\" to relax. Also being able to watch my husband's reaction was priceless as well, so epidural the second time is an easy decision. Those that go without I think are superwomen and more power to them!
