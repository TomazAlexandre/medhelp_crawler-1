            "answer": "I've had cervadil and pitocin. For the cervadil it is like a long string that the doctor inserts in your vagina and wraps it around your cervix, as the other lady mentioned it is kind of strange to have it inserted. The cervadil is supposed to ripen the cervix fast so the contractions could be very intense (and least they were for me). If it isn't in your birth plan to have an epidural you may want to rethink that! I didn't want it and changed my mind after 4 hours of horrible contractions. Sometimes it doesn't take with the first cervadil so they need to do a second one. DO NOT\u00a0\u00a0let them do more than 2 as it can cause the baby to be in distress. Your body with go into labor on its own when it's ready!Good luck!",

I would really see if you could put it off. Baby just wasn't ready. I was induced on Saturday night and didn't have her until Monday night. I really didn't want an epidural but by Monday morning I was too tired. So not sure how far along you are but I will really try to go natural next time.",

I have preeclampsia and my tests that they have been doing to monitor it are coming back worse so they won't let me wait any longer I will be 39+1 on thursday. She just wanted to try the cervidil before she had to induce me so she's giving me 12 hours with that to try to make me labor on my own so I can only get 1. She really wanted to induce me today but I begged her to wait til thursday due to the father being out of town working he comes home tomorrow morning and tomorrow night we start the process:) I'm so scared and nervous but I was really nervous about the insert I had never heard of it before",
