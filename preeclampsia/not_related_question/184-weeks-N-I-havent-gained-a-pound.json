At first I was losing because of constant nausea, but then doc says my GD might be contributing now I'm less than what I started out and baby is suppose to be over 9lbs. As long as your eating and baby is gaining and growing there shouldn't be too much concern.",

            "answer": "Expected weight gain is based on your prepregnancy weight. If you were underweight they would expect you to gain about 40lbs, normal weight about 30 and overweight depending on severity they may not want you to gain any. So it really depends where you started prepregnancy. I'm 5'7\" and before I got prego I was 170 and medically considered overweight so my obgyn recommended I gain 15 lbs or 25 lbs max to avoid complications,\u00a0\u00a0such as high blood sugar,\u00a0\u00a0preeclampsia, etc. As long as you are eating healthy, exercising,\u00a0\u00a0and following your dr orders you and baby will be fine:)",
