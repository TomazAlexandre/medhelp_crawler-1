            "answer": "hi! i had a c-sec in july. the spinal was fine. i know some people have trouble with it, but mine went in easily- and i'm terrified of needles. i felt the tiny pinch of the first needle that numbs- after that just slight pressure. you sit on the table facing a nurse who braces you to make sure you don't move.during the surgery i felt pressure. honestly, i didn't know when they had started cutting. it felt like they were pressing gently on my tummy- i thought they were feeling around for the baby, turns out i had already been cut. i did have some problems during the procedure with a very intense chest pain, but the anesthesiologist said it was heart burn and common, and he quickly gave me something to calm me when i started to panic. oh yea- i also felt a lot of pressure when she was actually delivered because someone was practically jumping on my chest to push her out. but that didn't hurt- just caught me by surprise.my recovery was a bit different than typical since i had to be on magnesium sulfate for 24 hrs, and to be closely monitored. they checked the protein levels in my urine every hour during the night, and monitored my bp, but that was because of preeclampsia. they did bring me my baby shortly after i went to recovery, and put her to my breast. i suspect that as long as you and baby are healthy, you'll see her almost immediately after she's checked in the nursery and you're out of the or.they'll probably have you try to walk within 24 hours. you'll also go to the bathroom around then, as soon as your catheter is removed. they wanted a nurse with me the first 2 times i went. they measured how much i peed. it was weird, cause it was very hard for me to pee at first, it too like 15 minutes, and the poor nurse stood patiently and kindly waited for me. she even ran the faucet to help me go!my c-sec was monday, and i was released friday. as long as your baby is healthy, she'll go home with you.my recovery was tough too, although i imagine it's about the same for everyone. we actually moved downstairs for a few weeks since i was only allowed to climb stairs once/day. it was worth it though! it's still too fresh in my mind to consider doing it again, but i am sure i will at some point in time. good luck and enjoy your little miracle!",

            "answer": "That worries me about stairs, I have a flight to go up and down every day.I do remember when they removed my cath they said I could go to the bathroom but I never had them measure my pee. Weird. LOLThe doctor told me I would be on morphine for 24 hours afterwards or something. With my last one I had a epidural and I can't remember what drugs they had me on for pain afterwards.",

            "answer": "the long acting morphine was great!! after that, make sure you stay on top of taking you r pain meds. i didn't know at first that you have to ask for them- they don't just give it to you. i alternated the percocet and motrin, about 3 hrs apart.you will have to minimize stair climbing, so plan your trips. don't just run upstairs for a brush or anything. downstairs worked for us cause we were up all night at first. since i wasn't breastfeeding, i had to wash bottles, etc... and would've had to go up and down a lot during the night. plus, in the summer, it was hot upstairs",

    "question": "I have had a previous c section before but it was emergency, it was also nearly 5 years ago so I remember very little, everything is such a blur now other then remembering the terrible recovery I had.The doctor informed me I will be having a spinal block, never had one before. Anyone have one? What does it feel like? Will I feel anything during surgery? What should I expect recovery wise? How long before they will allow me to try and walk? Go to the bathroom? How long do they keep someone in the hospital after c section? Will they bring my baby to me right away or will I have to wait? With my daughter it was nearly 12 hours before I got to hold her. :(I'm actually really freaked out over this. :(Thanx.",
