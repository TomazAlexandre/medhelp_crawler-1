I have been though just about every lung/cardio test out there.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse and was told that my shortness of breathe had nothing to with this diagnosis but have read that some people do experience shortness of breathe, so ruling out mitral valve prolaspe(MVP) might be something you want to try. I would discribe my shortness of breathe as trying to suck in air and being stopped half way and being full when it is at its worst..\u00a0\u00a0Its with me everyday and some days its worse.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to get worse a week or so before my menstrual cycle.\u00a0\u00a0I quit smoking at the on set of this symptom, i too have tried different to relief this feeling.

            "answer": "My problems started ten years ago at age 30 when I suddenly felt myself getting out of breath while playing basketball. It seemed that any intense physical exertion would bring on feelings of breathlessness and it began to effect my play and my life psychologically. I became afraid of running and walking up more than one flight of stairs. Also, the fact that it came out of nowhere really freaked me out and I started having anxiety about diseases I might have and avoided most physical activity.I went to my doctor and was diagnosed with having GERD and given Prevacid. I tried this and then tried Nexium and my acid reflux and coughing at night disappeared but the medicine did nothing to help my shortness of breath. I was then diagnosed as having exercise induced asthma and given an inhaler. It didn't work. I was then sent to a pulmonologist and run through a series of breathing tests and even an echogram of my chest and x-ray of my lungs. They found nothing and prescribed a different inhaler which didn't show any sign of helping even while I was taking the tests. For some reason they gave it to me anyway and I went away frustrated. Next I was sent to the cardiologist and he ran me through an EKG, stress test on the treadmill, echocardiogram before and afterexertion. All results came back as negative with an excellent ejection fraction. They did find some PVCs but said they were nothing to worry about. I went away feeling better about my heart but still had the episodes of shortness of breath.After all of this, I finally decided to take control of the situation myself. I began an intense cardio workout program and lost weight. I changed my diet and did everything I could think of to become more healthy. At first I struggled with the conditioning and my own anxiety of losing my breath. The shortness of breath over the years had almost developed into a phobia of hard exercise. I hyperventilated many times in the beginning but after a few weeks I felt stronger and better. After a few months I was able to play basketball again and run like I used to without getting too winded. I had to rebuild my confidence as well as my fitness but everything seemed to be going OK. The only problem was that I still occasionally got the sensation of shortness of breath even though I was well conditioned and frequently became light headed as well. I became frustrated one day and did a work out even while feeling short of breath and seemed to feel better once I got moving. This got me wondering so I went to the pulmonologist while having another shortness of breath attack and my blood oxygen levels tested. They came back normal even though I felt like I wasn't getting enough air.Today, three years later, I'm even more confused than ever. I'm left wondering if I am really short of breath or is anxiety causing me to feel that way? I also wonder if the skipped beats of my heart (PVCs) have anything to do with the breathlessness sensations. I feel better than I did before beginning my conditioning but I still don't feel like I could just up and run at full speed without grabbing my knees. I also don't feel like I've solved the problem completely - only masked it by getting in better shape. If anyone has any answers, please pass them along. I've read many posts and the common thread seems to be that the problem begins in most around the age of 30. What's up with that I wonder?",

            "answer": "I am 26. I have just recently been dealing with the same problem. The problem started during allergy season, which for me is late April - early May.I thought at first that it was due to a sinus infection. I am going to try and take some antibiotics because the heavy breathing started after I had a bacterial infection in my nose. I am interested to see if antibiotics will work.I have also been taking an allergy medication called Chlorpheniramine. I have noticed that this particular over-the-counter medication works the best for me and is better than any other allergy medicines I have used. It really helps relieve the symptoms associated with having trouble breathing. If I take one in the morning, about 7:00am or 8:00am, I am usually good (no problems with heavy breathing) until 4:00pm or 5:00pm in the afternoon. At this time, the heavy breathing starts and it seems to continue, until I take another Chlorpheniramine. I usually take 2 Chorpheniramine a day. I know this might sound like a lot of medication for some, but it is not that much.As for panic attacks, I have been known to experience these too. I am sure that a panic attack, associated with worrying obsessively about not being able to get a hearty breath of air, doesn't help make it easier to breathe.Here is some information on Chlorpheniramine (If you want it. I am not a doctor or a pharmacist, so please don't take my word on it. I know it has worked for me and after you read more about it, one day it might work for you. I hope this helps.):Chlorpheniramine relieves red, itchy, watery eyes; sneezing; itchy nose or throat; and runny nose caused by allergies, hay fever, and the common cold in adults and children over age 2. Chlorpheniramine should not be given to children younger than 2 years old because it may cause serious or life-threatening side effects in young children. Chlorpheniramine should not be given to children older than 2 years old but younger than 6 years old unless prescribed by a doctor. Chlorpheniramine tablets, capsules, chewable tablets and liquid should be used carefully in children who are 6-11 years old; the extended-release tablets and extended-release capsules should not be given to children in this age group unless prescribed by a doctor. Chlorpheniramine will only relieve the symptoms of cold or allergies but will not treat the cause of the symptoms or speed recovery. Chlorpheniramine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. It works by blocking the action of histamine, a substance in the body that causes allergic symptoms.",

            "answer": "Some thoughts... not answers.Look into sleep apnea.Excess weight on stomach compresses lungs.Do you spend a lot of time in a recliner ?Alcohol use ?Eating too late in the pm ?Personal experience : If I suddenly try to run for a bus (I'm 66) or up\u00a0\u00a0a few stairs I can get seriously out of breath, dragging air in as if I'm about to die.My GP recenly set me up to have a stress test ( on a sloped treadmill) but after describing to the\u00a0\u00a0the above (bus & stairs) the stress folks aid that a stress test would not be suitable as they needed me to get up a good 'head of steam' in order to get useful data from my heart under stress and they recommended a pulmenary ( lung) test.Before the appointment came around I was at a local alternative caf\u00e9's music fest and ended up, after a few beers, jumping up and down in the front row of the crowded caf\u00e9 right in front of the band, dancing my merry heart out, just like the 'old days'.The next day, somewhat worn out from my fun night, I suddenly realised \"Hell..there can't be much wrong with my lungs if I could do that !\" as I recall sucking in air pretty powerfully without much problem as I boogied, and I concluded that \"It must be 'cos I'm so out of shape and overweight (210 lbs).NB: I WAS dancing upright and not leaning over as I would be when going up stairs or hurrying to catch the bus.So I've cancelled the test for now and will be working on losing weight and exercizing.I'm fairly sure that I do have pretty serious sleep apnea* too where breathing stops many times during the night. My pillow is a mess from drooling\u00a0\u00a0I toss and turn a lot too. I suffer from anxiety too.I also drink quite a bit of wine in the evening which is not good and disturbs my sleep. I also think I spend too much time in my recliner.Dylan (***@****)*I was tested 7 years ago with 'inconclusive' results as I had , unfortunately, gotten hyped up at my daughter's championship ice hockey game that evening and could not sleep for the test. I've had to postpone retesting this year as there is a $400 copay I cannot afford right now.",

            "answer": "I am having the same problem and i am very frustrated. I am now beginning to wonder if it is allergies.Im 26. i have been an athlete my whole life through college and am still very active in sports and running, not overweight, weight is not around my mid section, etc. Here are my symptoms:earlier this summer i was having difficulty breathing...only occured at night though. i couldnt lay down. i would have to sleep propped up on 2 or three pillows. I felt like there was something squeezing my neck and throat. I went away to the mountains...i slept next to a window and caught a pretty bad cold...lost my voice, coughing a lot.After the cold went away, i began to have even more difficulty breathing. i am training for a 1/2 marathon and noticed it during my work out---which was new, so this is when i decided to get it checked out. so i went to see my doctor who referred me to a cardiologist who referred me to a pulmonologist.i had echo done on my heart--normalchest xray--normalblood tests--normal(still waiting for the results of the allergy test though)so like the other post said...i feel better about my heart, and my health but i still cant breathe.Pulmonary function tests where the doctor said \"it could be asthma, very mild though\" he prescribed singulair and an albuterol inhaler for before i run. sometimes taking the inhaler can make me lightheaded. so i dont like using it.the inhaler and singular definitely helped with the tightness i was feeling in my lower neck and upper chest, but not with the breathing!and some days its better than others. and i actually do feel a little better after i do some mild cardio...but who wants to work out when they cant breathe???!!!! But it honestly is better on days i work out than on days i dont.oh, also a did experience a bit of heartburn...and i think i had a panic attack (which was self induced i believe cuz i was so worried about not breathing) which led me to go to urgent care one time. the doctor gave me some stuff for heartburn and acid relux and so then i thought i had GERD...which can also induce asthma...so i dealt with that and now my heartburn is gone...but breathing is still not normal.could be VCD? but i hear that VCD usually happens mostly in the morning...im am a singer and i can sing fine in the morning. my vocal coach hasnt noticed any changes in my voice...but she did notice me clearing my throat a lot which led her to suspect allergies.so i am going to wait for the allergy test results...and pray that its allergies and some sort of antihistamine will clear it up.I am suppose to go for a follow up doctor's appointment next week and will post again with the doctors findings.oh yea...im suppose to get a CT scan of my chest and throat, just waiting for the insurance to approve that.",

This may not be everybody's cause, but it is worth checking into.Do you guys consume any form of aspartame, sucralose, etc, you know the low sugar diet drinks and many processed foods with MSG?This was my problem; I discovered that aspartame is a toxin, and it wreaks havoc on people. It is converted to formaldehyde once it breaks down in the body. Formaldehyde by the way is the substance used to embalm dead people.If you have anything that contains any of these artificial sweetners, eliminate them immediately; and yes, your neighbor, or best friend may have been drinking them for years without this problem, but not to worry, their symptoms of a different nature will creep up on them, there are a slew of symptoms that have been reported to the Fda regarding this toxin. And please don't tell me that it was 'approved' by the FDA. The FDA is not to be trusted with your health.The first step is to immediately stop using these products and then do some sort of toxin cleanse.Don't waste your time going to the doctor on this one, they have no clue.Most of our illnesses come from a poor diet and fixing that fixes most of them.Do yourself a favor and eat toxin free.Best of luck to you all.If you want to talk about this further, email me at ***@****",

I've been to the doctor many years ago and was diagnosed with a mild form of asthma related to allergies (although I do not have allergies). I was given an albuterol (sp?) inhaler and singular (perscription allergy/asthma meds). They didn't seem to help any.I also have anxiety problems and panic attacks which don't help with the breathing. So its hard for me to determine whether the \"not being able to get a deep breath\" is from a medical condition or anxiety.I just went to the doctor yesterday and they tested to see if I had asthma or not... it turned up to be very mild so they weren't sure if this is what was causing the problem. I also have Mitro Valve Prolapse (heart murmmer). My doctor said this could be a symptom of this and if it is it could cause problems in the future (so if any of you guys also have this I would get it checked out by getting an ECHO test done) I am getting this test done next week. My doctor said if it isn't this then it may just be anxiety. If anyone finds anything out let me know please!",

It just stroke me one day and it destroyed my whole summer. I was suffering a lot those days, grasping for the air, dreaming for that one, deep precious breath that will change everything. And then I saw so many doctors. And it turned out - NOTHING. I am realizing now that this comes suddenly but it usually has long history behind (anxiety is not always the case,you may be under some sort of psycho-physical pressure). In my case it starts with mental extortion (my studies for example)... In the first stage of the 'condition' I usually go through panic attacks which are the worst of all, then I slowly develop serious breathing problems. For example this spring it started with two weeks panic attacks, I would be always almost fainting, really scary. But with the time I understood that nothing will happen to me and panic episodes vanished. But breathing issue remained to bother me and it developed other, even more disturbing health problems. Trying to cope with my breathing, I started to swallow air which caused reflux (my eating is horror now, I am burping all the time). Sometimes I even feel that my lungs are so run out and irritated....that they can not fight with this anymore. So heavy and tired...And just one month ago everything was perfectly fine.",

I used to find that deep breathing made it worse. I take small slow breaths making sure you breath out fully and hold it there for a while. The easiest thing to do is to ignore your breathing then you wont feel the need to take deep breaths.This might not apply to everyone, but for me it was anxiety.",

The ONLY medication that helps me are corticosteroids, but this is a poison, I once gained 30 lbs with a 2 weeks burst of steroids. To be taken only as a last resort.BUT in my opinion, the problem is hormone related. Namely thyroid and adrenal glands. I now know that I have hypothyroidism and am finally being treated for that. This is a very slow process, but after increasing my Armour Thyroid dosage, I started to have very good days last July with no SOB. Still far from being out of the woods because now Armour Thyroid cannot be found anymore, big shortage in the country, but I finally was prescribed a similar medication and hopefully we'll keep increasing my dose. We'll see if that really helps.Adrenal glands: my lab results are not perfect and I am currently looking for a doctor that will help me with that and agrees to try some medications targeting the adrenals.",

I have tried to quit smoking so many times, but then I get depressed or stressed out and\u00a0\u00a0end up having a ciggarette. I think smoking is disgusting and i hate it. I feel like a very weak person for not being able to quit smoking so much earlier. But now I have been having trouble breathing and it is scaring me. For the past few weeks, I have constantly been taking deep breaths with the feeling of not getting enough oxygen. It feels like I am suffocating. It is keeping me up at night with the feeling of not being able to breathe. I smoke less than a pack every 2 days, but as I mentioned before I have been smoking for a long time now. I am wondering if anyone has any advice, I am so scared to go the doctor and be diagnosed with copd or some irreversible lung disease. I am trying despretely to quit smoking, and have succeeded in cutting back to just 3 ciggerettes a day. But does anyone have any suggestions of what this could be if I were lucky enough for this not being related to my smoking? Why are ciggerettes not banned? I will never understand why the most deadly and addictive drug there is is stiil legal. When I was 14 the advertisements for ciggarettes were not banned yet, and it was the cool thing to do. I wish I could go back in time and never of picked up that first cigg. My mom smoked then so it was easy to start that young. But besides COPD, ASTMA, or there any other possibilities that could be causing my feeling of suffocating at night, deep constant inspirations with the feeling of never getting enough oxygen? My worst fear is being diagnosed with copd at 28. And the worst part is knowing that I have done it to myself.",

            "answer": "I am coming to the conclusion that the shortness of breath issue has something to do with the Pancreas, GERD, or the liver... aka Bile or Cholesterol. I am more inclined to think it is the Pancreas and glycogen ... then GERD. These seem to be the two main culprits that would just induce or have sustained breathing challenges! PLEASE test/check these two areas comprehensively. Doctors are incompetent... we know significantly more than they do... they just know how to write prescriptions because some kid walked in the door and sold him or her on writing toxins to facilitate an early exit from this universe. Go figure!!!\u00a0\u00a0Get a Fasting Blood sugar done... check it out... completely. Go over that Pancreas with a fine tooth comb. Make sure it is NOT Insulin Resistance Related. Stay away from diary products unless you go to a farm and get it all raw. Do NOT eat or consume anything pasteurized... it is POISON!!! Do NOT! You MUST safeguard your health. These doctors are not interested in doing it for us... they are too busy keeping the pharmaceutical companies in business.CHANGE your diet! Unfortunately, diet changes will STOP the breathing problems too. STAY away from anything that will turn into simple sugars... especially fructose.Yes, you can eat eggs, and bacon, and ham... however, I recommend turkey. Do NOT cook with Olive Oil it is unstable. Use peanut oil or coconut oil they can withstand heat and not produce radicals as Olive Oil does. Yes, you can eat butter... however I recommend Ghee. NO NOT all cholesterol is bad. The body requires Cholesterol too. Cholesterol problems are due to too much sugar... NOT fat. Those dumb morons for doctors keep telling us it is fat... no it's NOT it is SUGAR those IDIOTS! Carbs... keep your Carbs low, low, low, and I mean low. For example only eat brown rice.. do NOT dear touch white rice. Whole grain pasta a hand-full. Do NOT eat white regular pasta. Do NOT, oh my God! Eat flax bread... or a very dark pumpernickel... very little of this stuff. Yes, eat organic peanut butter it is okay. Count your calories ladies and gentleman. STOP eating sugar... STOP it cold. NO, not even in fruits unless it is muscadine grapes or blueberries. If you must have some sugar use green leaf stevia. Fruits are NOT good either. I know I use to eat them like there is no tomorrow... however, they loaded with useless sugar...yes they are. The damage it does on the body is not worth the few moments of pleasure. If you MUST eat fruit... only eat those local to the area... as those will help you in the metabolizing.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar will kill you faster than fats will ... believe me. However, fats in moderation... just do NOT go anywhere near sugar. Sugar would kill you faster than a cigarette and we all know how our surgeon general warns against smoking but those bastards are NOT stopping the obesity caused by SUGAR in our country!Fruits included. Sugar, is sugar is sugar!!! I know I love chocolate cake... and dark chocolate... but it will induce a breathing challenge because the Pancreas will not allow it. NO, I am not Diabetic... thank God... however, my body is not willing to take on anymore toxins... SUGAR being the GREATEST destroyer of all time. Remember breathing requires energy... and if the lung is not getting enough energy source their will be challenges to breath! I'm not a doctor but I am able to deduce what could be happening! Just try it out guys and let me know. If any of you would like to visit my Website... let me know. No, it doesn't cost anything... it's like this Website however, I preach the gospel of living a LONG healthy life... in and effort to put the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry out of business. Those people do not care about a single life in this country or they would insist on natural products to stop cancer, diabetes, breathing issues, cholesterol challenges induced by too much sugar, prostate issues or human growth hormone and so on.",

At first my doctor diagnosed me with asthma and gave me an inhaler.I was also experiencing panic attacks as I feared that if I did not monitor my own breath, I would stop breathing and die. This is when my parents sent me to see a therapist. Therapist saw this problem as purely psychological and diagnosed me with anxiety and OCD. My doctor then put me on an SSRI, and my breathing problem disappeared.I am now 21 and no longer taking SSRIs, and the problem has returned. It is especially bad when I am in a quiet public setting and I don't want the people around me to notice my heavy breathing or constant yawning. It is my feeling that the more I think about it, the more anxiety is produced, and the problem is exacerbated.I recently talked to my current therapist about the issue, and she mentioned that often times people with depression have difficulty breathing and tend to sigh a lot. This makes sense to me.I just started taking Adderall for ADHD symptoms and I think it has perpetuated the breathing problem. It is known to increase anxiety and heart rate, both of which are related to shortness of breath.Not sure what I'm going to do about this... maybe go off the Adderall and start taking an SSRI again...I wish my parents had never started me on the antidepressants; I feel like using them all through my youth has caused my body to be inadequate at producing serotonin and so I'm pretty much dependent on drugs for the rest of my life.",

I too was diagnosed with GERD and this is when the symptoms got progressively worse each night. Before I had GERD, my symptoms would kick in seldomly and would only last for several minutes and then its gone for months. However, after a night of overnight drinking red wine/white wine, late night meals right before bed, the symptoms of SOB and muscle pain recurs and being very consistent.I'm really starting to think if it's something the doctors are not telling us and are hiding from us to only make us feel better. Like it's not something that can be treated (nervous system failure) so they just tell us it's stress and we are the only one with the responsibility to control it.

More specifically faulty heart valve which has caused full blown heart failure by now. That is my self-diagnosis and I am almost 100% certain that I am right.But maybe I should talk about life circumstances that preceded this shortness of breath sensation/constant need to take deep breath/most of the time unsuccessfully thing.So the same Summer of 2000 I was going through a really bad time in my life. I had some serious problems at school, I was failing a lot of classes because of mental depression and severe social anxiety. Teachers were calling my house and my parents were harassing me because of it. I had a mini nervous breakdown and then a month after the stressful breakdown came down with this lump in throat sensation which was almost as miserable as my SOB.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't swallow any food, the lump was constantly there, except when I went to sleep, it\u00a0\u00a0then disappeared only to reappear in the morning. I was starving because i couldn't eat anything, I was also gagging all the time and felt pretty sick. So after lots of misery my parents took me to the ER where they found absolutely nothing. Next morning I started experiencing tightness in my chest, so I went to my family doctor who found nothing but gave me antibiotics just in case it's something. The antib's didn't help, but eventually the lump started disappearing, so did the tightness in the chest, but I was very traumatized by the whole ordeal. The stress and lack of food had worn me out. And when you think things couldn't get any worse, life had another plan for my unfortunate self , and that's how my SOB started.After 3 years of horrible SOB, it sort of went away for 5 years. Then it came back for a couple of months. And then it went away for a few months. It's a vicious cycle and now it's back with a vengeance. It even wakes me up at night. And it never used to do that. I think it's because of advancing heart failure. I can't go to a doctor because I fear the worst. I suffer from a severe form of generalized anxiety disorder. I know some of you are going to say \"Oh well it must be your anxiety\". Well, it's NOT anxiety. I've had severe anxiety all my life, and this is not part of it. It certainly makes my anxiety worse, because I can't breathe. I should mention my other symptoms which confirm my diagnosis of heart failure: Severe fatigue, lightheaded when walking around or doing any physical activity, no exercise tolerance, tightness and heaviness in the chest which makes it harder to breathe, horrible heart palpitations, skipping heart beat and racing heart beat which can last for hours, low blood pressure, cold feet, digestive problems such as diarrhea, and lots of gas and bloating.I don't want to go see a doctor about it, because like I said, I know something is wrong and I am almost 100% certain of my heart failure diagnosis. And I know heart failure can't be cured, so this is probably going to kill me soon. I am a ticking time bomb. So people, look into heart failure as the cause of this. Heart failure is harder to diagnose so you really have to be persistent with your doctors.Good luck everyone.",

I have had this for years, and I too thougt it was the end of the world.The feeling of not being able to get a full breath is caused by you taking in too much oxygen and your body is trying to tell you not to breath as deep. The cause of it is you are breathing out too fast and not allowing your body to take enough carbon dioxide.This disorder (Hyperventilation Syndrome) will lead to a anxiety attack, and an axiety attack will lead to hypervenitilation syndrome.QUICK FIX: GET A BROWN PAPER BAG AND BREATHE INTO ITFrom now on, only try to breath through your nose (I know it's hard, but the feeling of freaking out WILL PASS, and it will clear your nose)Here are some links:http://reviveyourlife.com/inspiration-and-wellness/do-you-suffer-from-hyperventilation-syndrome/http://firstaid.about.com/od/shortnessofbreat1/qt/06_HVSsymptom.htmhttp://www.depression-guide.com/hyperventilation-syndrome.htmI used Buteyko breathing technique to deal with this for years, if you go to the doctor they will do all types of test on you and they will not find it.YOU WILL BE OKAY, PLEASE LOOK UP WHAT I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE.If you need anymore info, you can email me at ***@****Good luck",

Vocal Chord Dysfunction2. Asthma3. Hyperventilation Syndrome4. Diaphragm restriction (get myofascial release therapy - this has helped me the most!!)5. GERD6. Hiatal Hernia (this one hasn't been ruled out for me, but I think it's my last hope)7. Anxiety (this usually just fuels the breathing trouble)Here's some tips:1. To strengthen your diaphragm blow up a latex balloon a few times daily2. Google for vitamins that reduce inflammation and there are A LOT3. IF you suspect hiatal hernia you can take two fingers at the base of your sternum and push gently but with some pressure towards your belly button (no need to go all the way too it)4. Lay on your side and do deep square breathing: breathe in for 4, hold it for 4, breath out for 4, relax for 4 (I can ALWAYS get a deep breath after doing this for a few minutes)Wish I could offer more, but that's all I remember at this time.Good luck to all of you!",

            "answer": "Since so many of you have this problem, and I myself had it, it's really quite simple. There is no cure, you just have to learn to not dwell on the symptoms, and it will eventually go away. If you keep stressing on it and getting too caught up on the symptoms, they will increase, and you will be harming yourself. That's why some of you have this case on and off. You get over it, then it comes back, but why? I'll explain.There's something called psychosomatization. That is the process when stress and psychological factors take their toll on the body, causing very real, tangible physical effects. This very thing which we are all suffering, is sadly mere psychological strain causing our body to suffer from this really (really) annoying thing. My doctor completely agreed, and boy was that doctor frikkin' smart. It's all just anxiety, maybe with some hypersensitivity here and there or other minute difficulties. He gave me histamine blockers, local corticosteroid nasal spray, and some magnesium supplement I think. It's working wonders. It's not completely gone, but it's almost there. Please don't forget the psychological aspect to this issue. Just do what I told you. Live your life, forget the symptoms, and all will be fine and dandy.Hope this was of any help to you guys. Feel better, and take care.",

I'm an athlete so you can understand how horrible it is. 5 minutes pass on the court and then I have to stop just to catch my breath, and every time I get yelled at, my coach keeps saying that I'm out of shape and need to exercise more, I try to explain to that I'm not physically tired I simply cannot breathe but no one listens. This almost never happens to me when I'm not doing a physical activity however I've had a few episodes where I just couldn't breathe I was literally choking, suddenly my throat closes up and no air is going in, and then out of no where it opens and I can breathe again. I should probably say that I've passed out like 3 times in the past 2 years, the back of my head, just above my neck, feels like it's on fire and then I pass out. Like everyone mentioned above, I have to yawn just to take in a full breath, when trying to do it without yawning it hurts like hell, it feels like my chest is too small to contain the expansion of my lungs when attempting to take a full breath so it feels like my chest is being crushed, and my back in the middle left side (actually a tiny bit higher that the middle) feels like someone is stabbing and twisting the dagger. This pain is constant when taking large breaths, although now I only seem to notice it when I remember even having it. I've never been to a doctor about this, I'm saving some money to try and get an X-Ray for my chest, but after reading what everyone said I don't think an X-Ray is gonna help with anything.

I already suspected something along those lines, as i survived 2 pneumonias at ages 15 and 17, but i didn't know there were consequences - pleural adhesions (where the lung lining sticks to rib lining and causes limited mobility of chest wall)My question to you is, does any of you have pleural adhesions as a result of pneumonia/Epstein Barr virus?

It comes and goes, usually in spurts that can last for days or weeks, and then disappears for a while. Feel like I need to take a deep breath - when I do, the feeling goes away for a couple minutes, only to return - pattern repeats. I'm 45, generally very healthy. Saw a doctor, who gave me an inhaler, which sometimes helps and other times does nothing. I have no cough or phlegm or fevers. Chest XRay normal. It does not affect my exercise tolerance. But here's the interesting thing - the only thing that I've ever noticed that consistently helps this feeling is alchohol. After I have a couple drinks, the feeling disappears COMPLETELY!!! I have noticed this on multiple occasions - in fact, I don't think there's ever been an instance when alcohol did not fix it. Sure enough, when my buzz wears off, the feeling comes back. I'm curious - has anyone else ever noticed this??? I guess this would fit in with the \"anxiety\" hypothesis . . .",

The anxiety pills or the inhaler did nothing (not even any placebo effect). for me the only thing that helped was yawning. always trying to yawn.I'm now 36 and have had my fair share of episodes. here is what I have learned:The symptoms seem to come and go, when they comes they last from 2 to 6 weeks although it's hard to say because you NEVER notice the day they go and a month later you think \"when did I start breathing normally again\". Between episodes can be anything from 2 months to 2 years.I've tried very hard to figure out what triggers an episode and the only advice I have is:AVOID CAFFEINE like the plague, that means tea too! even a can of coke can bring on the symtoms. (PRO-TIP: drink rooibos!!!)AVOID SMOKING TOBACCO, it can be fine sometimes but others it can trigger the symptoms, so I avoid.SMOKE MARIJUANA (even mixed with tobacco) this makes me feel like I'm in perma-yawn-breathing mode, the tension around the neck shoulders disappears, the chest weight is gone, my shoulders drop and every breath feels normal. I feel like my body belongs to me again. this is the miracle cure. as long as I smoke good quality marijuana every day I cannot have the symptoms. it's like a shield. this does not mean that if I don't smoke I will have the symptoms.It sounds very counter-intuitive to recommend smoking marijuana, but for all those who have tried everything, well it might work for you... for me it has been nothing less than life saving. It treats the symptoms and prevents the onset.If this condition is in any way related to anxiety (and it seems so), then how ironic is it that pretty much anywhere on this planet, I must also deal with the extra anxiety due to the risk of getting caught and punished for possession of my anti-anxiety medicine !!!",

It i s LPR or my laynx acid reflux.They said I also have non allergic and Allergic sinusitus, so whetherit is spring or not, Im going to be sensitive to things in the air, even justmild pollution.. I was also diagnosed with adult onset asthma twentyfive years ago.. guess what? wrong! no wonder the inhalers didnt workand I tossed them.. Now, further tests, and more knowledge on the doctors part conclude I have RAD.. Reactive Airway Disease..Apprantely your lungs can be breathing just fine, and they pick up somesmall pollutant or\u00a0\u00a0become hyper reactive to some tiny particle and trigger either shorness of breath or what feels like a small asthma attack.. but all the doctors said when it was just shortness of breath, it was LPR, larynx reflux.I dont understand that, its hard to take a deep breath, but I have had every test you can have, and thats what THEIR conclusions were.I have been on Kapidex for six months, the doctor said it would takea year for my larynx to heal, I couldnt believe it, so far she has been right,its better, but not quite there yet.. good luck everyone!",

I eat okay (my boyfriend is a chef, so there are 'cheat nights', haha). I run, walk, swim, etc.I have gained a little weight (5 - 10 lbs) over the past few years, but nothing dramatic.I started having this deep breath problem in November of 09. It happened daily, and lasted all day.I was in the ER bc I thought I was having a heart attack.I was put on Xanax and sent home.A month later, no change.Went back in the ER bc this time my chest felt tight.They diagnosed me with Reactive Airway Disease, said I must've breathed something in, and sent me home w/ 2 inhalers.Stopped the Xanax. Tried to inhalers.A month later, no better.Went to a pulmonologist, had every breathing test under the sun.Bloodwork, etc.Stopped my birth control, bc apparently Yaz can trigger your brain to think it needs to breathe faster, and you end up hyperventilating, according to the pulmo.A month later, no better.Finally went to the chiropractor who x rayed my whole body and found that my spine is twisted like a corkscrew, right between my lungs, and is pulling my rib cage with it, so in turn it is squeezing my right lung and putting pressure on my diaphragm.Had a few adjustments, and felt IMMEDIATE relief.I know a lot of people don't believe in chiros, and I was one of them, and I'm not here to promote them, but I am just telling you I had immediate relief.I started going three times a week and get certain adjustments. Also found out I had 4 herniated discs that I didn't know about.. just chalked my back pain up to too much yard work.I now go three times a week and CAN BREATHE.And just to show how well it worked.. I missed my first day on Monday, so I went Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and all day Wednesday without an adjustment, and since yesterday I have been having the issue back again.Last time I will miss an appt.Have your backs checked!!",

            "answer": "Most likely hyperventilation. Does sleeping by covering your face with quilt for 10 mins calm you down?It's not as easy to treat as the doctors would like to think it is.And it's not psychological - anxiety related as they'd like to think it is (though it might have been first caused by stress/anxiety).And it won't be relieved by exercise if you had it for long enough.Infact it can be triggered by exercise. After exercise you hyperventilate and then you'll hurt your chest, and tire the muscles so bad that the respiratory muscles can stay sore/tired for hours or days.Food can trigger it too (or lack of food), and sugar crash will definitely trigger it.Breathing exercises won't help much if you're overweight. But try. Requires 1 hour daily practice for months, and if you do it wrong will hurt you rather than help.Meditations do help some, but not unless you're going to put about 2 hours every day into it.Chiros - if you're lucky to find a good one, at least they can assess the spine which is good.And don't do the f***in yogic pranayama unless you want your breathing to be messed up even more. It exists there for other reasons, not anxiety.Action plan1. Lose weight if you're overweight for proper diaphragmatic movement.2. Avoid sugars and large meals, go low carbs.3. Daily Meditation make Breathing exercises\u00a0\u00a0easier.4. Breathing exercises (http://www.physiohypervent.org)4 is the most important of all. See these people in person if possible.I'm not a doc. Eliminate a few rare but possible causes - hypersensitivity pneumonitis(allergic alviolitis) and pulmonary hypertension.How do I know? Exact same condition still seeking answers....Perhaps the breathing exercises are the only thing that have helped me ever. As does eating some carbs. But now I know for sure its hyperventilation (although that could too have organic causes). I was misdiagnosed by dozens of doctors.",

Although since stopping smoking and half hoping these this sypmtoms would go away.. they havent :(My Sypmtoms:- Shortness of breathe/feeling of suffication- I feel like my lungs have shrunk as im not able to breathe in as much as I used to be able to, but feel my lungs are full and so couldnt take anymore in even tho it was only a little breath [ANNOYING]- Although I get this throughout most the day I tend to get more whilst driving or sat down. I'm constantly messing adjusting my car seat getting the feelin I cant breathe and that my ribs are squashing my disphram somewhere...extreme i no.. but its terrible.- I have to keep really stretching my body straight but it doesnt really help.- Evenings and nighttimes are the worst while im up, but then as soon as I go to bed it kind of goes, ive never had a problem with it in bed or been woken by it.- Feeling of something stuck in my throat/top of chest when I swallow [all the time] like flem or ball... but nothing comes up- I cant seem to cough!!! and when I really force one out its sound pathetic! and nothing at all comes up off my chest.- My voice has in the last few weeks gone weak aswell. I feel I cannot shout! When i shout my son in for his tea as I have always done, I just cant get to the high tone Ive always got too... 1 because my voice feels to weak and again pathetic & 2 because by the time I have called half his name im out og breathe anyway- Strange thing is I went to kent for a few days and it kind of disappeared!! I say disappeared because it was like I'd forgot all about it then soon as I returned home....to manchester [2minutes ftrom the city centre] bam! struggled again...it was bak.- Doctor said it was mild astma and gave me an inhalor which does absolutely nothing for me whatsoever.I'm getting abit worried now tho, as I was kind of hoping it was due to the smoking finally taking it toll on me... but by sounds of it from people who have never smoked -- and it not shifting or feeling any better since I have quit im not so sure",

Im sitting here with the problem now and I have had it 10 minutes before i read this thread and still have it now after finishing it 30 minutes later!I went to the doctors yesterday. He told me after doing all the checks like many of you have mentioned it is just anxiety.. and I am having attacks. But these so called 'attacks' are happening all day now. Its so tiring. I just want a satisfying breath. Anyway, he wouldnt give me any anxiety tablets as he said I am too young and I just need to run it out of me. Im not being funny but I have never heard such c**p.I am constantly yawning trying to get that deep breath but i can only get it on every 30-40 breaths.Just read that multi vitamins have cleared it for 1 person so I just ordered the best of the best - will keep you updated.I am also going to ask the doctor to give me xanax and still no hope then go to the chiropractor like many of you have suggested... although I get no back pain.My sister suffers from this too - but it panicks her much more than me and she has an actual attack.God.. I wish the doctors could see this thread and invest some money to finding the cause for all of us.As I'm sure you all are..

I am diabetic, smoker for 13 years (cigarettes, and shisha or hooka) on social and stress occasions, overweight (BMI = 29), and physically unfit. I went back to smoking 3 month ago after a long time quit (6 months) and smoke 12 packs on a period of 2 months. Of course, cough was constant with a lot of phlegm. 3 weeks ago I stopped, and so did the cough, but exams were approaching and this new problem of short breath appears with constant attempts to yawn. The panic is on the rise and I go in a vicious cycle of cough and tried an inhaler. What is more is that my brother has these attacks for 14 years, so I really freak out as I am a very dramatic person (drama king as some of my friends describe me). I started researching these 'symptoms' and found this website. After reading a lot of the comments, I felt really funny. I discovered that those were nothing more than anxiety attacks (first time this happens this way). What adds more to the equation is my psychological situation. I am living alone in a forign country, almost no friends, fear of approaching people (appearing in the form of ignoring everyone because of which I ended being misunderstood and somewhat considered to be an ******* with many enemies), struggling with intermittent depression (constant thoughts of hurting myself as attempts to get attention), a background of child abuse (sexually and psychologically [neglect]).The only reason of mentioning such very personal details, which might not appear to be relevant, is that this may help someone else figure out if this is just psychology display or a real physical problem.I turely am thankful for everyone for sharing their story, it is only because of this I was able to 'cure' myself.Hope the best for all of you,A.K.",

When I was younger and worked in a mall situation, I was diagnoses with environmental asthma. When out of that situation, asthma symptoms went away, but I am still very sensitive to certain smells, chemicals, etc. Years later I developed this breathing issue. I was working a very stressful job, had all tests done, was told nothing was wrong with me. I worked for a newspaper at the time. I truly believe I was allergic to the ink. Once away from that situation, my symptoms have gone away, although, when I read the newspaper, it does make me cough. My breathing was so bad, I had gone to the ER several times. Check at your jobs/homes, to see if there is something you ae coming in contact with that you are very sensitive to or allergic to. I truly believe this is an allergic reaction to an irritant.

Same thing, I am gasping for breath and have to turn it into a yawn before I eventually get a satisfying breath. One other problem I do have is bad breath, I am obsessed with having clean teeth for this problem, brushing, flossing and using mouthwash every day. I have asked my dentist and he said my teeth are one ofthe cleanest he has ever seen so my bad breath is not down to hygiene. I have been the doctor and he seemed to think my breathing and bad breath problem may be connected. He tried giving me tablets for reflux but no change to either. I have googled various bad breath and breathing related illness's but they include regurgitating and heartburn but I don't get either. I am worried there is an underlying problem that the doctor is unable to find...! Does anyone else who has posted about breathing difficulty also get bad breath as I am still trying to figure out if the two are related...",

Previously I have seen physios and chiropractors for an ongoing back problem who have mentioned my breathing maybe related to my back...one even suggested that the nerve at the top of my spine which contorls breathing maybe getting tangled. I have had more back and neck troubles since seeing a chiropractor so I would not reccommend personally. Even when I am at my most relaxed I still have severe difficulty breathing deep breaths so am not sure how connected the anxiety is to the loss of breath. I also have low iron and have tried all the multivitamins and iron tablets but they make no difference. I have had an inhaler as a young child but have been tested since for asthmer but have not had it. I had a heart murmour as a child but apparently that is no connections either. Someone has suggested anti-histamines to me for possible allergies but can't say I have tried it and looking on here not sure it is worth it, besides i dont want to be taking tablets forever. I really hope someone on here eventually has an answer because this is such an uncomfortable condition and sometimes quite embarrasing to explain to people why you are yawning all the time(especially at work!)...its making me pretty miserable.

I've noticed that it's something that progressively got worse over time and looked up my daily medication side effects on a hunch...voila- The problem is a condition called metobolic acidosis. It's too much acidity in my blood and it causes a buildup of carbon dioxide, which inhibits oxygen from being absorbed. This causes the breathlessness and need for more oxygen...It also causes some chest pain and tightness. Mine won't go away until the medication is completely out of my bloodstream. I have to taper slowely, unfortunately, so that means that I have to take bicarbonate treatments several times a day and fill up on electrolyte drinks (no caffeine, alcohol, or anything that can dehydrate). It tends to get worse during the day because that's when you are active and need more oxygen for your body to function.This condition isn't necessarily caused by medication either...there can be underlying medical conditions that cause it\u00a0\u00a0that have no other symptoms. It only takes a simple blood test to diagnose this, and if left untreated for long periods of time it can cause irrepairable kidney damage...If you're anemic then it's much worse (that's why I'm glad I got diagnosed when I did!)Another tell tale sign that will tell you this could be the problem is if you have flank pain. Whether it's occasional or constant. This doesn't always happen for people, but it's a definate clue to the problem if that is happening.Just an F.Y.I. and something to look into. :)",

Some days are definitly better then others as some days all my breathes are short an on other day\u00a0\u00a0only a few of my breathes are short. I am nervus that i wont be able to catch my breath one day. Yawning does make it a lot easier to breath.

In Oct. of 2009 I pulled into the parking lot at work and could not take a deep breath, the next thing I knew I was sitting on the ground in the rain gasping for air. A coworker called a ambulance and I was taken to the ER. After three days in CCU and a multitude of tests all I was told was I had a pulled muscle in my chest and had a reaction to cold medicine. The not being able to take a full deep breath went on from time to time but never stayed long enough to pay much attention. That is until about two weeks ago, I had no cold symptoms of any kind or any other medical complaint I was aware of.Now I find it impossible to take in a deep breath or yawn, I've seen the doctor three times in the last week but all they tell me is I'm having an anxiety attack, which is just what they told me a year ago. One thing that has helped me get in a deep breath is to take in a half a breath through my nose and finish it through my mouth,\u00a0\u00a0sometimes it works and offers a little relief.I,m on my way to Dr. appoint. # 4 tomorrow and hoping for the best. The best way I can explain it to them is to say the feeling is like being under water and trying to breath through a cocktail straw.I am a bike rider and my rides seem to make me feel better.I have checked into this from the scientific to the bizarre, one of the officers I work with told me about an article he read about the Chem Trail Consperisy and an area in Southern California that had a over 300% increase in respiratory complaints in less then six months. I don't know about all that but\u00a0\u00a0I do know that this is effecting my life in a most negative way. I can,t believe that with this many people suffering through this, that no one is looking at this from a medical stand point and saying there needs to be some kind of research.

The sensation comes and goes for NO reason. Sadley, it has just become a part of my life, and no, breathing exercises DONT HELP. Thank you to all who posted, it really made me feel like I'm not alone. I may follow up on some of the possible causes. The only advise I can give is, when it starts try to keep your mind on something else. I know it's hard and sometimes impossible. Maybe I've become sooo used to not being able to breath, it's just second nature, sad huh? Blessings",

            "answer": "I didn't think as many people had this same problem, wow.My name is Kim, I've just turned 19 and have had this problem for a very long while, and when I try to explain it to people they never seem to know what I'm talking about as they have never really experienced it! I've been told by a few people, however, that this can be associated with stress - I would find this a perfectly acceptable reason but, I'm not stressed at all, I'm very happy with my job and enjoy it thoroughly and I have no other reasons to be stressed at all. I also find that the yawning technique works quite well (well, when it does actually work) but I shouldn't have to yawn every time I need to inhale deeply, every time I need to take a deep breath, I find that I have to stretch mu upper body in order to make sure that there is no restriction to my airways that could be cause by the way I'm sitting/standing etc (strange I know!). I get the urge to breathe in deeply a lot more now too and it's very frustrating that I can't do so!If anyone knows anything that can possibly help with this I'd appreciate if you could get back to me. I've tried breathing exercises and relaxation techniques but none of this seems to help.I know how everyone feels and I hope that you aren't suffering too much; it's an absolutely horrendous thing and is one of the most frustrating things I've experienced!",

            "answer": "Thank you all for your posts! I had no idea how many other people were suffering with the same issues I've been experiencing. I'm 39 years old now, but when I was 32 I started experiencing the feeling that I couldn't get a deep breath. Night time was absolutely the worst although it would happen during the day too. I would just be busy doing normal things and I would become really aware of my breathing and need to yawn constantly. I have never had trouble sleeping in my life except when these episodes would occur. I would dread going to bed and trying to fall asleep which is completely abnormal for me. No matter what i tried, deep breathing techniques, excersizing, etc. it just always felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen and i would get light headed and feel like I was going to pass out although I never did and my heart would race or feel heavy and irregular when it was beating. I had this for about 9 months and I went to the Dr. once during that time and he told me it was anxiety. As many of you have stated, I didn't have anxiety or stress in my life at the time, but when the symptoms appeared, they definitely brought on anxiety. I did have back pain during this time and I was fasting at points so dehydration and misalignment in my spine could have been factors. After 9 months I was healed of this and until 6 weeks ago I didn't have any of these symptoms\u00a0\u00a0again. What brought it on again, I have no idea. I do have some stress at work right now and I have some upper back pain/stiffness. I probably am not drinking enough water and I may be lacking in some vitamins. I am going to continue to pray, make an appointment with a chiropractor, drink more water and take a vitamin supplement and I'll let you know what happens. Blessings to you all and may God's peace be with you!!",

            "answer": "Hello everybody,I HAVE SOMETHING MIGHT HELP YOU ALL!! YOU SHOULD TRY IT & LET US KNOW.I'm Saudi Male, Over-weight, 30 years old, smoking Shisha once a day and living in Saudi Arabia. Same symptoms (No satisfied breathing unless with Yawing or waiting couple of minutes, with little pains or continues little pressure on the chest sometimes). I was following your posts here in weekly basis & then found something improved my case & hope it will help so.It was started with me since 4 months (April 2010) suddenly without any previous diseases like Asthma, Allergy, Anxiety,\u2026etc.Like everybody here, its start was very terrifying & scaring. So, in first time, I have visited ER to check & after X-Ray & Blood test, they said you have nothing. Then, I have decided to do FULL Checkup including (ECG, Spirometer & Lungs Size Tests) & all results showed I\u2019m OK with only deficiency in Calcium & Vitamin D plus Cholesterol was little bit high. Doctor prescribed only supplemental Vitamin D & Calcium (1200 mg daily) but I didn\u2019t take the medicine daily in the beginning & he said you don\u2019t have something inside the chest and might be in chest wall & anxiety without any more advice.I did many searches in the internet & have decided to stop taking Supplemental Nutrition (Multi-Vitamin) Products since I found in searches that they may cause tension in respiratory muscles. But unfortunately, no improving was noticed!. Then, I have found in some searches that deficiency in Calcium might cause the tension in all muscles!!Since ONE Month, I have decided to try taking the prescribed medicine to supply my body with Calcium & Vitamin D, NOW I felt the difference!!!My case is improved & I can say the pressure specially is disappeared but shortness is still there but significantly less than before.MY ADVICE IS:If you are free from Asthma, I think the reason of our symptoms is the tension in respiratory muscles due to deficiency in Calcium & Vitamin D, which is a conclusion I have reached by myself not by doctors. So, please do full checkup plus check your Calcium & Vitamin D, then, try to watch yourselves & let us know.MY NEXT TWO STEPS ARE:1- I will try my best to lost weight & see if it works or not.2- I will focus on chest exercises to stretch chest muscles more as recommended by an Orthopedic.Frankly speaking, I\u2019m so disappointed from concerned doctors since they didn\u2019t take it more seriously in analyzing our symptoms.I will translate my experience to Arabic Language in next post because unfortunately I didn\u2019t find any Arabic website covering such symptoms!!Looking forward to hearing from you.Wish you healthy & satisfied life,Nasser",

My mom keeps telling me that its anxiety but I know that it's not anxiety because there's nothing I'm anxiuos or stressed about. I'm glad to know that there are people out there who share this same problem, and that this is not just happening to me.It seems like wherever I go, whoever I'm with, and whatever the time of day it is, I can never get a deep breathe from my chest. Instead, I seem to be panting through my nose- never through my chest- which causes me to become very light headed and forgetful of things. I yawn about twice a minute when I get bored, but its an obnoxoius yawn- not out of tiredness, but out of needing to inhale enough oxygen.I don't know how I'll ever be able to function again as a \"normal\" human being. The problem haunts me 24/7, just not in my sleep, and it appears to be getting worse every day. I can barely have a half- decent conversation even with the ones I love most, nevermind co-workers or schoolmates.This problem has literally consumed my life.Let's try this: Everyone, fill out this little poll I made, just so we can have some general information about who is most susceptible to having this problem. I'll go first.Age:\u00a0\u00a018Sex:\u00a0\u00a0MBMI: 16.9Smoker: NeverActive: YesStarted having 'breathe' probelms at age: 10What the doctors said: AnxietyTraumatic experiecne: NoFrequency: Always, no exceptionsDescribe 'it': light headedness, dizziness, fear of not breathing, sweatingLost friends because of it: YesDo feel 'angry' all the time: YesHas it 'consumed' your life: YesThanks alot, everyone.

Its a relief to hear that I'm not alone and that apparently everyone's doing fine.I think after reading all of this I have come up with the cause and at least a solution (hopefully.)I constantly suffer from anxiety attacks, attacks where I feel trapped and like I might die at any moment and things of that nature. My mind is always thinking on what is, or will, or has gone wrong. Worst case scenarios. I often pray for many things to not go wrong that I simply create in my own little mind. I cannot ever seem to relax, nor can I seem to \"let go\" of my problems, even if they are fabricated in my mind.Lately I've been unable to get good breaths and it caused me to feel more trapped and panic even more. After reading this I think our breathing problems are mostly mind set, which I had thought of before. However, when one panics, one breathes through their chest, and feel short of breath, thus requiring a yawn or deep breath to try and get air. If you calm and focus on breathing with your diaphragm however, I think it helps.Lately I have also been drinking Rockstars and coffee and various other caffinated beverages. These seem to heighten my anxiety when I'm not doing things, and thus cause the attacks more frequently.This of course can not be found by doctors for it is a mind born illness. I do not know how to calm these attacks yet, but I need to try to learn soon. I do not wish to live like this any longer.Best of luck to us all and hope that God helps us.Oh, and I'm skinny and fairly good athletically. Even today I ran around for quite some time without being out of breath which made me wonder about this breathing thing. Glad I saw this site. Thanks guys, hope I helped.",

It started with mild discomfort, and in the last couple of days, has become exponentially worse. Even as I am typing this, I find it more comfortable to breathe in once, as deep as possible, wait 2-3 minutes, then do it again than to breathe \"normally.\" There is a tightness in my back, between the shoulders and I can not get a \"full\" or \"satisfying breath. They have me on a ton of pills and some inhalers, but nothing is working. I have done many breathing tests, and come up with nothing except my lung function is low. At first they found an infection, which they treated successfully, but the symptoms persisted. Then they believed to to be silent reflux mixed with an inflammation of my vocal chords... They have been treating that for a few weeks, to no avail. Yesterday, I went to my allergist, and did yet another breathing test and treatment. They told me my lung function was low, so they were going to give me an Albuterol breathing treatment, and preceded to do so, only to be confused by the fact that my lung function decreased by 42% from the original. Is there anything anyone can do to help? I'm just afraid its gonna get so bad that one of these days I'm either going to wake up in the hospital or not wake up at all, it's deteriorating so quickly anymore...",

Do not give up, as it works gradually.The Yog Pranayam (breathing exercises) will\u00a0\u00a0help you relax and also help with the breathing difficulties.You will notice benefits in days.Initially do kapalbhati 20 times and anulom vilom for 2 minutes, several times a day. When your breathing improves, do all the the pranayams in order, as described.Come back to report your progress, so others can benefit.Build up your timing gradually. If you feel tired or dizzy, stop and resume after 1 minute.Bhastrika - Take a long deep breath into the lungs(chest not tummy) via the nose and then completely breathe out through the nose.

It's obviously complicated but it seems to be connected to the diaphragm and being able to relax- which ain't so easy in this insane world. With me, it gets worse when i don't exercise and eat. I tried a breathing excercise we do in yoga called pranyam and it seems to help relax the diaphram, as long as you take your mind off it for a minute or so. Here is how to do the exercise. Sit up in a comfortable position with your spine straight. You can be on the floor or in a chair. Start exhaling in short punchy breaths, about 2 exhales per second about 50 to seventy times. Don't worry about the inhale, it will come automatically. Practice this as often as you like, it's non-addictive with absolutely no side effects. If nothing else, you will feel better because of all that wonderful oxygen getting to your lovely brain. Meditation is also a great way to de-stress and give you some self awareness which is a whole lot better than vegging out in front of the TV. One more antidote you might try is laughing hysterically at some sill thing for 5 minutes. Easier said than done for us mature and responsible adults- maybe that's really our problem!",

Do it! it will change your life!Do you constantly feel tired, worn-out, blurry-eyed, and fatigued? Does it seem that you are always anxious, panicky, and in a bad mood? Do you find it difficult to catch your breath even when you aren\u2019t engaged in any type of physical activity? Do you worry that you have a serious disease that no one can diagnose? Have you spent countless hoursvisiting doctors who have no answers for your strange and mysterious symptoms? Have you lost your sense of excitement and vigor in life?If you answered \u201cYes, that\u2019s me!\u201d to most of these questions, I want you to know that there is hope. Unsure if life will ever be the same, many who continually experience these feelings launch a desperate search for answers as to why these \u201cunexplainable\u201dsymptoms are plaguing them. I was one of those people, and I\u2019m glad to tell you that the energetic life you once knew can \u2013 and will \u2013 return. Regaining your health and happiness is much easier than you think! As you well know, breathing is an essential function of life. Without the continualexchange of air through our lungs, life will cease in a matter of minutes. Any way you look at it, breathing is the most important function performed by the complex and intricate mass of cells, neurons, and tissues we call our bodies. One fact which many fail to realize is that not all breathing is the same. Sure, the general concept of air exchange holds true, but the efficiency and mechanics by whichthe breath occurs is of paramount importance. Efficient, well-balanced, and controlled breathing is synonymous with healthy breathing. Healthy breathing provides life, energy, and a calming sense of peace to the otherwise hectic lives we lead. I\u2019ve had to learn about healthy breathing the hard way \u2013 by experiencing the detrimental and frustrating health effects of inefficient, unbalanced, and unhealthy breathing. After a prolonged period of sub-optimal breathing, an autonomous breathing pattern is formed which becomes difficult to correct without the proper know-how. This chronicbreathing imbalance is known as Hyperventilation Syndrome (HVS) \u2013 a condition that can wreak havoc on your physical and emotional well-being. HVS is a common affliction suffered by many, but one that often goes unrecognized and untreated. One group of researchers has referred to HVS as \u201cthe silent epidemic\u201d while others have suggested that nearly 20% of the population suffers from this condition. Some studies have even suggested that overbreathing and chronic hyperventilation lead to nearly 40% of all physical and emotional symptoms for which patients visit their doctors. As a former HVS sufferer, I believe it! The information contained in this book is meant to help you recover from this affliction and regain your sense of self. In a relatively short period of time, you will find yourself well on the road to recovery and should begin to see moderate results almost immediately.When it comes to curing Hyperventilation Syndrome, knowledge is power. Once you understand HVS, the symptoms that it creates, and what you can do to overcome its grasp, you can banish it forever. My life and good health are proof of this fact!Get the entire eBook at this site. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!God bless!!!http://www.hyperventilation-syndrome.com/",

I have been going on 8-9 years of this with no answers either. I have been diagnosed with asthma, but nothing they give me for it helps. I try to argue that it isn't asthma but the doctors won't listen. I quit taking inhalers and started studying natural remedies. I took an herb called Lobelia for a few years with great results, but it slowly started to not be helping as much. I am now pretty convinced its a magnesium deficiency. I ordered magnesium chloride oil online as magnesium is best absorbed through the skin. I also take oral magnesium which should be taken with calcium so it can absorb. I have had great results when I remember to use the oil daily and not just at the onset of the difficult breathing. Hope this helps!",

I always experience nervousness, but this was the first time for the breathing issue.\u00a0\u00a0While on the plane after the shortness of breath started, I had really bad heartburn.This issue continued through my entire visit to europe and upon returning to the states, I saw my GP. He said that causes of SOB in girls my age is usually associated with Acid Reflux.\u00a0\u00a0I took Prilosec and it got better for a week or so and then went away.\u00a0\u00a0So I thought, \"yay - its just acid reflux!\"But now its back and I returned to the Prilosec with no relief this time, and its worse.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm searching through the internet looking for answers.I am concerned that the yogi breathing exercises seem to increase oxygen intake, while chronic hyperventilation seems to be caused by an excess amount of oxygen (to carbon dioxide ratio) - so they wouldn't necessary be a good combination in my mind.I am intrigued by the possibility of magnesium and Calcium as suggested above, so I think I'll definitely try that - since it's something I can try immediately. I might also throw some meditation or HVS breathing treatments in there - I found these from Dr Weil which sound like the are aimed at this issue.http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART00521/three-breathing-exercises.htmlI do think I'll suggest some of the other possible culprits to my GP (COPD, Heart Issues, Anxiety, etc) but I haven't explored this as much as some others, so I'll stay with the dr appt for now.I am just very happy to hear that I'm not crazy. My boss even told me that its 'nothing - just allergies' so I think everyone things I'm embellishing the severity of the symptoms, but they're very real.Good Luck Everyone - As more and more people start crossing other things off their lists and trying new things, please keep us updated!!!",

            "answer": "thank you all extremely for sharing your testimonies.i have been suffering with every last symptom you all have stated for more than two years. the need to yawn excessively to get a deep breath, the heaviness in my chest and stomach, excessive burping, issues with swallowing, difficulty sleeping, clogged nostrils, and soreness in back, neck and shoulders. ive had the anxiety/panic attacks too. i have had it all.\u00a0\u00a0i am 39 years old, i am obese but i am losing weight. i have changed my diet several times, believing the problem was food induced. i started taking allergy medication, Clariten, thinking it was allergy induced. as one of the lady's said, exercise seems to help me as well. i always feel better afterward, but the SOB returns.\u00a0\u00a0ive tried everything i could think of.in one post a gentleman spoke of resisting the urge to take a deep breath when the sensation comes. i had tried that before and it worked. i noticed that if i wasnt thinking about it i wouldnt have the sensation to breath deeply, but as soon as i thought on it the sensation would follow within minutes. anxiety certainly exasperated the situation. i also believe stress is a\u00a0\u00a0major contributor.i recently began a process of re-training my metabolism. this is a very detailed process having to do with re-balancing hormones within my body so they may began to work properly and to their full potential for maxium metabolic health. in the few days that i have been eating this new metabolism building diet, i have noticed a huge change in the SOB. ive hardly had any episodes, even when i think about it im not triggered to take a breath. another gentlemen spoke of taking magnesium. this diet requires me to eat magnesium enriched (if that's correct) foods, as well as several other minerals and vitamins.personally, i believe the condition is a caused by a combination of everything mentioned in this thread, especially hyperventilation syndrome, allergies, and poor diet. the information about aspartame was very alarming and important. please take note to removing it from your diet if you use it.i would like to thank all of you for sharing your story. it moved me, and i was happy to know it brought many of you comfort to know you dont suffer alone. to you who shared and suggested remedies, bless you for caring enough to do so.to Ms. Greb(sp), i pray you special comfort and peace. sounds like youve had a rough go at it.a blessing of peace, prosperity, and healing to you all!",

            "answer": "I am new to this site but, like others, a bit worn out from not getting answers from specialists etc.My problems started approx. 18months ago following a bacterial infection in my ears which also moved to my lungs.Ever since I have been slowly getting worse and now notice everyday I have problems with my breathing, heaviness in my chest, chest pains, sometimes coughing and tiredness. Asthma meds dont help at all.I have had so many tests, in June 2010 I was told by a Respiratory specialist that I have the very rare condition known as Pulmonary Hypertension which if you look it up on the internet, the prognosis is not great!Anyway, after a second opinion my new specialists (Cardiologist and Respiratory) are still undecided as to what is actually wrong with me and so I have more tests plus re-tests to be done.I used to be able to run up to 11 kilometres but over the past 12 months (due to inability to exercise the same) have gained around 15 kgs (not sure what that is in lbs?).\u00a0\u00a0I actually first started to notice it during exercise which now makes me quite unwell hours after exercise.Anyway, I realise non of this helps anyone but everyday for me is difficult mainly due to the worry of how I am feeling.\u00a0\u00a0It is very scary, especially when I was originally told I had a terminal condition.One thing that I often think about is, approx 3 years ago I had a Mireena (IUD) inserted but removed in August 2010 because I thought this was the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I still think it may have contributed to how I am feeling now.Please let me know your thoughts. Not sure where others are from, I live in Australia.",

            "answer": "Hi, new to this site, but what a relief to read your stories. I have been working out for 3 months doing cardio and weights. I was being treated with antibiotics because I have a sinus infection, so laid low for a few days. Today I went back to work out with my trainer\u00a0\u00a0doing super sets but not much weight, lots of reps. After the first set I noticed I was breathing really hard, normal, but having difficulty bouncing back and breathing was becoming difficult. During the second set I felt a slight pressure in my chest and suddenly it felt like someone had knocked the wind out of me and I could only get shallow breaths. I haven't had this happen before (I was diagnosed with adult onset asthma but rarely need the inhaler). I used my inhaler for the first time in a long time, had to lay down and then leave the gym. When I got home I was so tired I just fell asleep for an hour and when I woke up I felt better but still have this tightness in my chest. I wonder if it is from those heavy duty antibiotics they gave me for the sinusitis or was it just the weight lifting causing blood pressure to drop. any clues would be helpful. thanks",

            "answer": "Symptoms of Magnesium Deficiency?What are some of the symptoms of magnesium deficiency? They are outlined beautifully in a recent article by Dr. Sidney Baker. Magnesium deficiency can affect virtually every organ system of the body. With regard to skeletal muscle, one may experience twitches, cramps, muscle tension, muscle soreness, including back aches, neck pain, tension headaches and jaw joint (or TMJ) dysfunction. Also, one may experience chest tightness or a peculiar sensation that he can't take a deep breath. Sometimes a person may sigh a lot.",

Recent studies are linking it to magnesium(frequent in fibromylagie sufferers) and Zinc(chronic fatigue and depression) deficientcy. the syndrome is\u00a0\u00a0in many ways similar to connective tissue dieseases and involve defective collagen or a reduction of\u00a0\u00a0hyaluronic acid. but there are many supplments that can help.I hope this is a startSam",
