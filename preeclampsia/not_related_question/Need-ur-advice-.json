            "answer": "I'm 23w4days and I'm having swelling ankles after a long day in the office. My doctor said to wear something comfortable that doesnt restrain your feet, drink a lot of water and put my feet up at home on a surface higher than my body (table, stool or desk). Also don't cross you legs and flight stockings apparently help ease swelling. Good luck! :)",
