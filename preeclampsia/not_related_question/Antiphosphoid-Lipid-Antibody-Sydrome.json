            "answer": "I was very surprised that I am pregnant again. We used IUI (antibodies in my cervical mucous)in August 06 & Feb 07-can you believe 2 for 2? Anyway, all was going well at the 8 wks visit (early 10/06), heartbeat was strong and not more than 5 days later, I saw blood (kinda pinkish) and then 2 days later, I saw blood again (only one time each when I wiped). Saw my RE (9 wks gestational age but measured at 8wks). So by 10 wks the pregnancy had ended and I needed to have a d & c-I never expelled anything-it seemed the pregnancy stopped in utero. I was devasted, I have only been married 2 1/2 years (didn't come off the pill until after the first year of marriage) and did not know there was a fertility problem but we weren't really trying as in keeping temperatures, looking at ovulation patterns and etc... but at my last physical (2/06), my NP said that if I wanted to get pregnant, my biological clock was ticking (I was 40 then). Worked with ovulation kits for several months and couldn't tell if the lines were the same color as the control (just a big headache) and couldn't keep the temps right either. Finally, went to the RE in (7/06) and within a month found out that I had the cervical mucous problem (I also have hypothyroidism-so who knows how that shows up elsewhere in the body) but by 8/06-I was pregnant. After the miscarriage, he did detailed testing and in January (07), I found out about the clotting issue. By February 07, I am pregnant again. I am very nervous and scared because I was so devasted with the miscarriage. It was like the 2nd to worse thing I had ever been through outside of my parents passing away. I hope I can hold it together and not have a nervous breakdown and have hopefully and prayfully have a positive outcome this time. I will not see my RE until next week for my first visit and will only work with him until my the end of the first trimester. He did not mention anything about preeclampsia in the last trimester but I guess he figures I will be with another physician by that time but I will ask him about anyway.",

So the next step was to look at his sperm sample to determine if he had a low sperm count. His sample came back fine so it was the cervical mucous that was killing his sperm therefore they couldn't not get to the uterus to meet the egg, so with the IUI procedure-they bypass the cervix/cervical mucous and deposit the sperm in the uterus, where they are just waiting for the egg to come down the fallopian tube. Through this process, I have learned more than I ever wanted to know about my body.",

Then it came out at 17, and so she said not to worry (yeah right) then we repeated it and it was 16. She explained to me the levels like this: there are negative, low positive (or inconclusive), moderate positive and high positive. She said low positive normaly doesn't require any treatment other than baby asprin. She said prednazone (sorry I am horrible speller) doesn't really work. She said the asprin is good. I am not sure tho about after getting pg, I didn't talk to her about it yet, we only emailed and I haven't seen her since. So prob will get the lovenox too. Man, I hate needles!
