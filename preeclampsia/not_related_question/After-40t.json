            "answer": "It depends very much on the individual. Certainly everybody's fertility drops massively around 40 and there is far more likelihood of having multiple births, birth defects, miscarriages, fetal abnormalities and pregnancy problems such as diabetes and preeclampsia. That said it is possible to have a healthy baby over 40 and even an easy pregnancy. There are plenty of examples - I'm 40, 35 weeks and one of my friends who is 44 will be induced on Mon. We're just more delecate when we're older :) and to conceive may take longer, require weight loss and clean living from both parents. Good luck x",

            "answer": "@lacretamia21 I think it's misguided of you to state that 40 plus is too old to bear children. We're still fertile and more than capable of carrying and rearing children at 40+. In fact many grandparents even step in and do a wonderful job of parenting when parents are not around for whatever reason (death, illness etc.)Surely your concern should be focussed on being a good parent rather than a younger or older parent.It's also unfair to put an age cut off on anybody's uterus/fertility and personal choices. Everybody walks their own path in life.....you have no knowledge of my journey for example and yet you judge. We all have to play the hand we're dealt in life and that is all we can do.",
