            "answer": "I had to be induced due to preeclampsia. I wasn't prepared because I was only 35 weeks. Thank God my son came out healthy. I didn't want an epidural but I was told I had no choice because of my blood pressure. I was induced at 8:30am my water broke on it's own at 9:30am and at 11:39 my son was born. It took no time at all. I was actually expecting to be in labor a lot longer.I really want to go into labor on my own. I heard the contractions aren't as harsh as they are on pitocin. Plus that was my plan in the first place. Natural hoping it happens this time.",

I did have a hard time delivering the last two but that was bc they were big babies (the reason i was induced early with both of them) and I would have had a hard time delivering even if I hadn't been induced. None of mine resulted in a Csection and I didn't get sick during labor.",

It wasnt a planned induction but when i went for my appt that mornibg i was already 6 cm dialated but my sons head was too high and i had a huge bulge of membrnes and my doc was worried if my water broke id have cord relapse because i had so much fluid. She sent me in for an nst where i was cobtractibg but very irregular\u00a0\u00a0they gave mr oxytocin at 2 pm which made my co.tractions stronger within about half hour. My doc came by the hospital at 7and i was still only 6cm so she broke my water and 40 mins lter my son was born. My labour was only 5 hrs and i had no epidural as my co.tractions were mabageable until my water broke but i dilated too quickly to get the epi. My experience was good with being induced. I was very happy to welcome it as i had false labour for 2 weeks before he was born!",
