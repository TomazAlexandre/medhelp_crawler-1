One of our boys was anemic but was to little to do the transfusion and another one had the enlarged spleen. With all four boys we delivered anywhere from 21 to 26 weeks. Until I read your message I felt that we were the only ones going through this. I am now pregnant again (with another boy) and I am 19 weeks. So far everything is good but I am a nervous wreck. We were not trying to conceive and when we found out I was pregnant we prayed for a girl (we have 2 girls that are healthy) because the dr's think it is sex-linked genetic problem. I wish I could give you advice as to what test to ask the dr's for but we have gone through everything. I am really surprised I have any blood left. Just this pregnancy they have taken 16 tubes of blood to test for specific problems and absolutely everything is fine. We haven't gotten an amnio this time. I have refused. All the other times the chromosomes have come back normal. You and your wife will be in my prayers and I pray that you can bring your boy home. If you or your wife need someone to talk to for support I would be happy to email you. Just let me know.In His Grace,F.R.O.G.",

We did two PUBS (Blood transfusion through the umbilical cord) and she was starting to turn around. But then my body started to mimick hers.(Mirror syndrome-like preeclampsia) I gained 50 pounds of fluid. My blood pressure went to 160/115. I was given steriod shots to try to develop her lungs quickly. On May 17th my water broke. Since I couldnt give her anymore blood transfusion, and babies with hydrops have a 0% survival rate before 30 weeks...they wanted to induce me. I held out as long as I could. But I was told I had fluid in my lungs and I was on oxygen myself. When my heart started going crazy was when my husband begged me to deliver. I feel like a failure, but there was nothing more I could do. My little girl was born at 26 weeks May 18th, and lived for 10 hours. I felt very happy with our doctors at greenville NC. They gave us so much information and fought for our little girl in a very hopeless situation. They say it wont happen again, we pray it doesnt.

And they told me mybaby has hydrops and i have to deliver it right away or my baby will not make it through the due date. My baby have five percent if she will live or not on the day for my c-section. She came out and went straight into the icu. I can't see her after 12 hrs or more bcause they have to work on her. They don't know what causes her heart problems. They have done blood drawn check and fluid check in my body and everything came out negative.

So, here we are 2 years later and my wife is 26 weeks pregnant w/a severely hydropic baby that'll most likely die as well. Again, we have no answers.\u00a0\u00a0At 16 weeks our baby boy started to show fluid, but just in his belly (ascites)by 19 weeks the fluid progressed into hydrops.\u00a0\u00a0We went to Detroit at 19 weeks gestation and Dr. Mari (excellent doctor)gave a complete ultrasound hoping to find signs of anemia (which our last baby wasn't). After the ultrasound he indicated that he didn't think the baby was anemic which wasn't good for us, b/c his only chance to live would be if he was anemic and they could do blood transfusions.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, to be sure, Dr. Mari did a cordocentesis (Sp?)and the baby wasn't anemic and still is showing no signs in ultrasounds. Finally a genetic Doctor spoke w/us and told us that most likely the hydrops is caused by a genetic defect in the baby.She had the baby's blood tested for enzyme deficiencies and again tested for chromosome abnormalities and viruses. All tests were neg.We are now waiting for the Pyruvate Kinase def. test hoping it's pos. PLEASE HELP us if you know of anything else we can do.Mat",
