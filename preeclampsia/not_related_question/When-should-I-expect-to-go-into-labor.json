            "answer": "With my first son I didn't go into labor until 5 days before his due date and the only reason for that was because I had preeclampsia so at my Dr's visit they asked if I was ready to meet my lil guy and I was like no lol my husbands at work and I need to go drop my car off and get my bags, they told me that I could go do all that stuff but to come straight back to the hospital after I was done so I did as I was told. I arrived at the hospital at about 11am and we didn't get a room until about 4pm (it was super busy there, thank heavens I wasn't in labor) once we got a room they hooked me up to an IV and the fetal monitor and gave me pitocin to induce labor, well my lil guy did not want to come out I stayed dilated to 2cm all the way until the next morning so at 8am the next morning they decided to break my water after that things went pretty quickly and I had my son at 4:50pm the next day. I'm currently 26 weeks and 5 days pregnant with my second son and I have no idea when this lil guy will arrive, but my Dr thinks that he will arrive early because I had the preeclampsia with my first but we will see =0)",

            "answer": "Well with my first I had him at 36.5 weeks =) He weighed 8.5 pounds and was 20 inches! He had no problems besides a little bit of jaundice which made him stay under the lights for 2 days and then had to check his levels for the next 7 days after we went home. My water broke and he was sunny side up and I too received pitocin to help with dilation and 3.5 hours of pushing... NO pain meds either...(14.5 hours of labor)My second boy I was 38 weeks and my water broke at home again @ around 9 pm got to the hospital at 11 pm, had an epideral, pushed for 3 minutes and baby was here no problems whatsoever. He has been seriously healthy =)I think you won't know until the time comes to see how long it is going to take (she could come early or be up to two weeks late! HEAVEN FORBID!) and hopefully your doctors make sure that you are not overdue!",

            "answer": "My first pregnancy my water broke 2 weeks early just randomly since I wasn't having contractions or anything or at least not ones I could feel. Most first time pregnancies though end up going past the due date. Both of my close friends who were pregnant went about 5 days to a week past their due date. One of them was 80% effaced and at 2 cm from 36 weeks on and ended up being late.",

LOL I'm 25 weeks tomorrow and when I was going through stuff I realized that I'll need a hospital bag, so I got out my one luggage case and put it aside so I could fill it up. It's way early for that probably but that's the way I am I guess.",

I was induced so i wouldn't know... but don't do it, not a good idea unless it's absolutely necessary!As for this baby, I'm a little scared of what going into labor will actually be like... will I be at the store when my water breaks? Will I be in labor forever? I dunno... with my daughter it was only 4 hours from the time my water broke... with this one I'm scared it might be longer since i'm not being induced.Although I'm really hoping that this baby comes at the end of September. My due date is October 3rd so I'm not hoping for a really early baby, just maybe like 4-5 days earlier than expected.",
