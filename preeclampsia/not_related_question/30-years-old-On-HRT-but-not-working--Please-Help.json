            "answer": "Hi!It sounds to me as though you might have prolonged, severe post partum depression.\u00a0\u00a0If you were my patient, I would refer you for an evaluation by a good psychiatrist.\u00a0\u00a0Abnormal thyroid function is often associated with postpartum depression.Also, I'm not completely certain what you are referring to when you mention hormone replacement -- and why you are on that? Many women taking progesterone get symptoms of\u00a0\u00a0fatigue, water retention, crabby mood,etc.Hope this helps!Dr B v",

            "answer": "I did have Post Partum Depression. I have been seeing the same Psychiatrist ever since.\u00a0\u00a0She had me on about 7 different anti-depressants because nothing seemed to help.\u00a0\u00a0She has told me over and over again that she feels my problem is not Psychiatric at this point and feels that it is physiological.\u00a0\u00a0I was taken off of anti-depressants about a year ago because the simply weren't working.My HRT is Progesterone Drops, Estrogen Drops, and DHEA pills.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on this because all of my hormone levels are very low, but they are not going back up even though I have been on the HRT for about 7 months now.\u00a0\u00a0My testosterone actually keeps dropping.All of my doctors are stumped. My Endocrinologist doesn't know what to do either.Thanks",

Here are a few quick examples.\u00a0\u00a0Oh.. all of this started when I was 26... I'm 30 now and still sick.I started sweating really bad and developed shortness of breath before the weight gain ever started.I have Vit B12, Vit D, Magnesium, Ferriten defeciencies.Was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism at one appointment, then told the next appointment I don't have thyroid issue by the same doctor. Was told to stop going to McDonalds.............which I don't eat fast food anyway.I have Thyroid nodules and ovarian cysts (PCOS was ruled out, not sure how though)IGF-1\u00a0\u00a0 (growth hormone)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LowEstrogen\u00a0\u00a0LowProgesterone\u00a0\u00a0LowTestosterone\u00a0\u00a0 LowFSH\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LowCortisol\u00a0\u00a0 Low and High.. results are varied even though done at same time of day.Triglycerides\u00a0\u00a0 HighHLD\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0LowFatty LiverThere are so many other things but I just can't remember them all.Does anyone at all have these same problems?\u00a0\u00a0What could be causing all of this?\u00a0\u00a0I'm feeling so bad these days but none of my doctors can explain why or do anything to help me.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor said she has never had anyone respond to hormone replacement like me and that she can't explain it.",
