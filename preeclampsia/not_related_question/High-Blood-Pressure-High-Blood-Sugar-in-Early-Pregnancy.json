            "answer": "So I'm googling high blood sugar and it says it can cause birth defects. I can't believe my doctor said to just wait 3 more weeks. Why wouldn't they want this under control immediately? I am so scared that I have harmed this baby. I'm already 7 weeks and I have no idea how long my sugar has been high. I don't know what to do. I think 300 is way too high to let go for 3 more weeks.Does anyone know the percentage of birth defects with high blood sugar or diabetes?",

            "answer": "Thank you. I'll keep those symptoms in mind. I have been getting 3 -4 headache a week. All my doctor said today was, \"That's why\" (in response to my high blood pressure and sugar levels.) I also have a lot of water retention already so if things get worse I may try to see the doc sooner or go to ER. I know preeclampsia can be life threatening.",

I am so happy that I've been able to get both down to nearly normal after just 12 days and without medication. I go to my doctor on Monday and will go from there but I'm so excited!",

So looks like a missed miscarriage. Very sad day for me, heart is very heavy. I just wish I could hold my baby. I'm so sorry that I could not protect him and give him the chance to be born :(",

    "question": "I'm 7 weeks 3 days today and had my first pre-natal exam. I've been having a lot of headaches and dizziness and when they checked my urine they found sugar so they did a finger stick and it was 300. I had nothing to eat for over 12 hours. They took my blood pressure twice and it was high...148/97. I'm 33 and I did have pre-diabtes 10 years ago but controlled it with diet/exercise and I had no problems with my other two pregnancies (in 2007 and 2008). I asked the doctor what effects it could have already had on the baby and she just said everything will be ok and they'll address it at my next visit on August 9. They were also having a problem with the U/S machine and it was so grainy they couldn't get measurements or find a heartbeat.My question is: What effects can high blood suger and blood pressure have on a developing fetus? Can it cause mental and/or physical defects? If I can't get this under control before my next visit, is 3 more weeks going to hurt the baby? Does anyone have suggestions for bringing the blood sugar/blood pressure down?I know that i have to stop eating out and cut out all refined sugars/breads and I'm going to start a good excerise routine but I am so worried that I will harm this baby or lose it, especially since they couldn't find a heartbeat. Any help would be appreciated. I'm really frustrated that the doctor wouldn't take more time to answer my questions.Thanks",
