I think a lot of the swelling comes with the heat I know when I went to the zoo my hands got so swollen I could barely open and close then and as for now my feet and hands are still swollen and hurt but atleast I can open and close my hands although some days are worse then others. Good Luck only 6 more weeks ;)",
