            "answer": "I dont know anything about HELLP syndrome but if you dont have that, I can tell you a bit about the high blood pressure aspect of your post and what to expect from that since this is also considered a complication.If you have developed gestational hypertension (blood pressure readings are above a certain cut-off on TWO separate occasions) then your doctor will make some suggestions on controlling the high BP.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on your current circumstances (how high your BP is, whether you work, any other symptoms etc.) attempts to reduce your BP could range from a reduced work schedule, change in diet, medications, bedrest, to more extreme measures of hospitalization and possibly early delivery if the condition is extreme, can not be controlled and your baby is under stress.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on your numbers, your doctor may want you to come in for a non-stress test and/or amniotic fluid index reading on a regular basis to make sure baby is doing ok and your urine will be checked on a regular basis for protein to make sure you are not developing pre-eclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0 The doctor will not let you get past your due date w/ hypertension but will try and keep the baby in you as long as possible - usually they will induce around 39 weeks but again, it depends on the situation.I hope things turn out ok for you, but you are correct that in the worst possible scenario (delivery at this point) your son stands an EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, chance!",

            "answer": "The only effective treatment is delivery of the baby. Several medications have been investigated for the treatment of HELLP syndrome, but evidence is conflicting as to whether magnesium sulfate decreases the risk of seizures and progress to eclampsia. The DIC is treated with fresh frozen plasma to replenish the coagulation proteins, and the anemia may require blood transfusion. In mild cases, corticosteroids and antihypertensives (labetalol, hydralazine, nifedipine) may be sufficient. Intravenous fluids are generally required.Its incidence is reported as 0.2-0.6% of all pregnancies, and 10-20% of women with comorbid preeclampsia. HELLP usually begins during the third trimester, and usually in Caucasian women over the age of 25. (Padden, 1999) Rarely cases have been reported as early as 23 weeks gestation. The outcome for mothers with HELLP syndrome is generally good. With treatment, maternal mortality is about 1 percent. However complications have been observed, including abruptio placentae, acute renal failure, subcapsular liver hematoma, and retinal detachment.SO if you do have it, it looks as if everything will be okay for you and you will probably meet your baby sooner than expected!",

So then the doctor comes in and I tell her about the pain in my right side and how its been spreading to my back and left side and the top of my stomach sssooo she sent me to the lab to get a whole bunch of blood work done because she thinks that I might have an enlarged liver (I think she called it Hells Syndrom or something) and she will see me monday to discuss the results... Have any of you had this or know about it?? What is the treatment?? Are they going to make me have the baby early?? Im so confused and upset.
