I will have to answer your questions as time and space permits . here is for Q 1best wishes1st Q:\u00a0\u00a0what can she do, besides lasix pills, to get rid of the fluid in her legs?Fluid in the legs can be because of a low protein level. This is dues to malnutrition from being severely ill. The medical term for this is anasarca.Here is a good patient education summary from UpToDatePatient information: Edema (swelling)AuthorBurton D Rose, MD\u00a0\u00a0Section EditorRobert H Fletcher, MD, MSc\u00a0\u00a0Deputy EditorsLeah K Moynihan, RNC, MSNDavid M Rind, MDLast literature review version 17.2: May 2009 | This topic last updated: May 8, 2009 (More)EDEMA OVERVIEW \u2014 Edema is the medical term for swelling caused by a collection of fluid in the small spaces that surround the body tissues and organs. Edema can occur nearly anywhere in the body. Some of the most common sites are: The lower legs or hands (also called peripheral edema) Abdomen (also called ascites) Chest (called pulmonary edema if in the lungs and pleural effusion if in the space surrounding the lungs)Ascites and peripheral edema can be uncomfortable, and can be a sign of a more serious condition. Pulmonary edema, which can be life-threatening, is a symptom of heart failure and is discussed in more detail separately. (See \"Patient information: Heart failure causes, symptoms, and diagnosis\").EDEMA SYMPTOMS \u2014 Symptoms of edema depend upon the cause, but may include: Swelling or puffiness of the skin, causing it to appear stretched and shiny. This is typically seen in the lower legs (called peripheral edema) or lower back (called sacral edema, frequently seen in those with edema who have been in bed for long periods).Swelling is often worst after sitting or standing for a period of time (due to gravity), and may be worse at the end of the day. Pushing on the swollen area for a few seconds will leave a dimple in the skin (show picture 1). Increased size of the abdomen (with ascites) Shortness of breath (with edema in the chest)CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH EDEMA \u2014 A number of different problems can cause edema.Chronic venous disease \u2014 A common cause of edema in the lower legs is chronic venous disease, a condition in which the veins in the legs cannot pump enough blood back up to the heart because the valves in the veins are damaged. This can lead to fluid collecting in the lower legs, thinning of the skin, and in some cases, development of skin sores (ulcers) (show picture 2). (See \"Patient information: Chronic venous disease\").Edema can also develop as a result of a blood clot in the deep veins of the lower leg (called deep vein thrombosis). In this case, the edema is usually limited to the feet or ankles and may affect only one side (the left or right); other conditions that cause edema usually cause swelling of both legs. (See \"Patient information: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\").Pregnancy \u2014 Pregnant women retain extra fluid. Swelling commonly develops in the hands, feet, and face, especially near the end of pregnancy. Swelling during pregnancy is not necessarily a sign of preeclampsia (sometimes called toxemia). (See \"Patient information: Preeclampsia\").Monthly menstrual periods \u2014 Edema is women that occurs in a cyclic pattern (usually once per month) can develop as a result of hormonal changes related to the menstrual cycle. This type of edema is common, but does not require treatment because it resolves on its own.Drugs \u2014 Edema can be a side effect of a variety of medications, including some oral diabetes medications, high blood pressure medications, non-prescription pain relievers (such as ibuprofen), and estrogens.Kidney disease \u2014 The edema of kidney disease can cause swelling in the lower legs and around the eyes. (See \"Patient information: Chronic kidney disease\").Heart failure \u2014 In heart failure, also called congestive heart failure, the heart is weakened and its pumping action is impaired. Heart failure can cause swelling to develop in the legs and abdomen, as well as other symptoms. Heart failure can also cause fluid to accumulate in the lungs (pulmonary edema), causing shortness of breath. (See \"Patient information: Heart failure causes, symptoms, and diagnosis\").Cirrhosis \u2014 Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver from various causes, which can obstruct blood flow through the liver. People with cirrhosis can develop pronounced swelling in the abdomen (ascites) or in the lower legs (peripheral edema). (See \"Patient information: Cirrhosis\").Travel \u2014 Sitting for prolonged periods, such as during air travel, can cause swelling in the lower legs. This is common and is not usually a sign of a problem. Table 1 provides tips to minimize leg swelling during travel (show table 1).If your leg(s) remain swollen or you develop pain hours or days after the flight, contact your healthcare provider. Continued swelling and pain can be signs of a blood clot (deep vein thrombosis or DVT). (See \"Patient information: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\").",

            "answer": "Q 1 continued:DIAGNOSING THE CAUSE OF EDEMA \u2014 If you develop new swelling in one or both of your legs, hands, in your abdomen, or around your eyes, you should be call your healthcare provider to determine if you need to be evaluated. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of edema in adults\").EDEMA TREATMENT \u2014 Treatment of edema includes several componenents: treatment of the underlying cause (if possible), reducing the amount of salt (sodium) in your diet, and in many cases, use of a medication, called a diuretic, to eliminate excess fluid. Compression stocking and elevating the legs may also be recommended. (See \"General principles of the treatment of edema in adults\").Not all types of edema require treatment. Edema related to pregnancy or menstrual cycles is not usually treated. Peripheral edema and ascites is usually treated slowly to minimize the side effects of rapid fluid loss (such as low blood pressure).Reduce salt (sodium) in your diet \u2014 Sodium, which is found in table salt, can worsen edema. Reducing the amount of salt you consume can help to reduce edema, especially if you also take a diuretic. Guidelines on how to reduce sodium are available separately. (See \"Patient information: Low sodium diet\").Diuretics \u2014 Diuretics are a type of medication that causes the kidneys to excrete more water and sodium, which can reduce edema. Diuretics must be used with care because removing to much fluid too quickly can lower the blood pressure and impair kidney function.You may have to empty your bladder more frequently for several hours after taking a loop diuretic. However, other side effects are uncommon when diuretics are taken at the recommended dose.Compression stockings \u2014 Leg edema can be prevented and treated with the use of compression stockings. Stockings are available in several heights, including knee-high, thigh-high, and pantyhose. Knee-high stockings are sufficient for most patients. Some stockings can cause skin irritation or pain, although proper measurement and fitting of the stockings can reduce the risk of discomfort. More detailed compression stocking tips are available in table 2 (show table 2).Effective compression stockings apply the greatest amount of pressure at the ankle and gradually decrease the pressure up the leg. These stockings are available with varying degrees of compression. Stockings with small amounts of compression can be purchased at pharmacies and surgical supply stores without a prescription. People with moderate to severe edema, those on their feet a lot, and those with ulcers usually require prescription stockings. A healthcare provider may take measurements for stockings, or may write a prescription for stockings and then have a surgical supply or specialty store take the necessary measurements. The white \"antiembolism\" stockings commonly given in the hospital do not apply enough pressure at the ankle and are not adequate treatment for edema.Body positioning \u2014 Leg, ankle, and foot edema can be improved by elevating the legs above heart level for 30 minutes three or four times per day. Elevating the legs may be sufficient to reduce or eliminate edema for people with mild venous disease, but does not usually help in more severe cases. In addition, it may not be practical for those who work to elevate their legs several times per day.",
