            "answer": "Hi, well.\u00a0\u00a0I think I think it is hard at this point.\u00a0\u00a0Here's the thing, the specialty with the MOST lawsuits is obstetrics.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors in obstetrics carry very high malpractice insurance.\u00a0\u00a0There are all sorts of things that can go wrong naturally (and doctors are blamed) and of course mistakes happen from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0But in general, young women are told to go home and labor there until it is closer to the birth and the doctor is giving them instruction that is based on their experience very safe.\u00a0\u00a0Same for labor and delivery nurses.\u00a0\u00a0It's frustrating when you are the patient but in general, they are usually right and giving safe advice.It's hard to wait.\u00a0\u00a0It's uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0Most women feel exactly the same way in the end.\u00a0\u00a0And then they have their baby and it is over.So, I would try to trust the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0She's been in and checked and they gave her their advice.\u00a0\u00a0They know the risks and consequences for a mistake so are probably not as nonchalant as it appears.luck to your sister in law",

            "answer": "She could always get a second opinion. My cousin went to a hospital that sent her home, she decided to get a second opinion at a different hospital and ended up delivering her baby in the car because she didn't make it there in time. If you're sister in law is really worried then I'd say look into it",

            "answer": "High blood pressure is one thing and different than preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I had pregnancy hypertension---\u00a0\u00a0quite high blood pressure but it did not turn into life threatening preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Important to remember that.That this is her third pregnancy, that is telling that something is different.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of first time moms do not understand that they will be very uncomfortable and labor for some time prior actually being admitted to L&D and they just fight it when it is perfectly safe and the norm.But if her gut says something is wrong, she should go back to labor and delivery.\u00a0\u00a010 minute apart contractions is pretty far apart.\u00a0\u00a0She's almost to the end, right?\u00a0\u00a0 So, she wouldn't be given a shot to stop contractions, they have to let her labor it out.\u00a0\u00a0Most doctors do not admit someone that is probably a couple days off from having their child or even one to go through contractions.\u00a0\u00a0They want to admit women in active labor and not in the early phases.\u00a0\u00a0But again, if her gut says something is wrong, she should go back or leave increasingly clear messages to her doctor that she needs help to understand what is going on.luck to her.\u00a0\u00a0It's never an easy time in the end and can be confusing to a mom.\u00a0\u00a0peace",
