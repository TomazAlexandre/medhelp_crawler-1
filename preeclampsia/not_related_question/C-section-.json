            "answer": "It took me about three or four weeks to fully recover from my c-section. I had to have one because my son was a high risk. If you have someone that will be able to help you bath and do the baby laundry for two weeks after your baby is born, I highly recommend a c-section. It is safer for the baby and mother all the way around.",
