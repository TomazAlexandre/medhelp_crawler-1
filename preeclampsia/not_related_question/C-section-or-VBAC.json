Second baby didn't go to nicu, and was much easier to nurse. I didn't even have an epidural. I am expecting my third now, and I am looking forward to another vbac.",

            "answer": "I had a planned c section for my first (footling breech) and had a successful VBAC second. My second pregnancy was horrible and very high stress levels throughout, so I was booked for another c-section. I ended up in labour three days before, and was given then option when I arrived at the hospital. I decided to give it a go. While there was a few restrictions (constant heart monitoring, and only 1 hour of active pushing allowed) it was amazing.I was induced with my third, as he was still born, so I don't know where that leaves me now, 18 weeks with my fourth. If I get the option and all is well, I would definitely be going with the natural birth, and would recommend it to anyone. Good luck. :-)",

However for my second pregnancy i definitely wanted to give birth naturally since my expirience with the csection was traumatizing so i tried for vbac the doctor was wonderful they monitored baby and me closely they explained and answered all my questions and the dr was all for it so it made it more encouraging unfortunately it ended in another emergency csection since i started to get the same infection i stopped dilating at 8cm again baby changed position putting her shoulder first and turned out i had preeclampsia which my dr who i had been seeing for prenatal care hadn't detected.. It was a long process but at least i know i gave it a try",

            "answer": "Ok, your chances for rupture during a vbac are, according to my ob, 1%. I developed HELLP during labor with my first,\u00a0\u00a0I plan to have a vbac with this one. If you aren't up for major surgery, then by all means have a vbac. This is after all your decision. Just learn the facts. If your ob has a good vbac rate, you can typically ask and get good feedback. On the flip side, if your ob has a high section rate, you may end up with one anyway. Again, keep asking questions and make an informative decision.",

    "question": "Hi ladies,I am hoping that some of you have had to face this decision as well and am curious what route you chose to go and why...I had to have an emergency c-section with my first baby due to a complete placenta previa. With baby number 2 my placenta is in its proper place so I am faced with the decision to have a repeat c-section or try a natural birth.I hate surgery and did not have a great experience with my first c-section especially since it was an emergency and my daughter got immediately rushed to the NICU. Due to this I am having anxiety even thinking about another c-section. I am leaning towards trying a natural delivery but I know that can have it's own complications.What were your experiences???",
