    "question": "First let me say I have called my doctors office and I'm waiting on a call back but it's taking awhile so figured I'd try to get some answers here in the meantime. What would cause blood pressure to randomly spike? Was feeling off today so I stayed in bed until 1. I'm lazy I know :p. Any who I finally got up, took the dog to pee, and started seeing spots and feeling like my blood pressure was off. So I immediately went back inside (wasn't even out for 5 minutes) sat down, drank some water then checked my blood pressure. It was 156/110. It freaked me out because I wasn't out in the heat long and wasn't doing anything that could have made it spike. So I laid down for half an hour and took it every 15 minutes and it went down to 124/75. But what the heck caused the spike in the first place?? I'm 37 weeks by the way.",
