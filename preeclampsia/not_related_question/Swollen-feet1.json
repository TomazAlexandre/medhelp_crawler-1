I have read up on it and plenty of rest, drinking plenty of water, and bending and stretching ankles and toes to improve circulation is just a few things you can do. I am not having much success myself. It is much worse to be pregnant in the summer and swelling. Only advice I have is those things I have listed and ask you doctor. If sweeping starts in other places like you face etc, it could be preeclampsia.",

            "answer": "Try to decrease your salt intake so you don't retain as much water. Elevate your feet above the level of your heart as much as you can especially at night. I have the same problem and am only 22 weeks my right leg is twice as bad and I have a very bad varicose vein from my thigh to my calf so I have the same pain as you especially that leg. Compression hose or even an ace bandage wrapped tight can also help return that basically \"stuck\" fluid from your legs back up and into circulation. Good luck",
