I want to feel great and feel my baby moving!! ASAP!Mani-Agree with above post although I would like to add that since it came up neg the first time, I would wait a few days to test again just so you are not wasting your money on multiple tests. But you should defintly test again.Angel4JohnnyB-WHere are you??? HAve you had that baby?? I am a little worried about you? Let us know if you are here and how you are!!All-Well, DH got home last night from NY and as you all know I wasn't feeling particularly perky last night. Iw as worried about the effect my puking and such had on the baby. Well, the first thing DH wanted to do was find the heartbeat with the doppler. He found it right away (that little peanut must be getting bigger every day because his little heart gets easier to find!)and of course that put my mind at ease! You should have seen the look on his face. He just sat there for the longest time listening in awe to his baby's heart beating!",

I usually ovulate later than that but this is my 1st round of clomid, so I don't know if I'll o' earlier or not.Does or can anesthesia and laughing gas have ANY effect on ovulation itself?? I really can't afford to mess this clomid cycle up. I really don't think it will cause problems w/ ovulation per say, but what about the pain killers I'll be on from CD14 thru CD16?",

Also, remember that you could have ovulated really late. Our bodys are a mystery and do not always operate 'by the book'.Kassimom- hey, I just spoke to my nurse at doc's office and am going to reschedule to June. Since I am actively trying, I don't want anything getting in the way and causing any problems. I just hate this \"dragging me along\" ****.

It is kinda hard to see exactly what the certificate looks like because it is all white, but it has pearlized stars and moons on it and in the corner a teddy bear crying. It has a place for all the information and the doctor and one nurse, so make sure it is there favorite, they will only put one nurse on it. Get the one with calligraphy on it.

You said you spoke to your dr. and all so I'm sure what he told you has helped, I just wanted to add my two cents.......Sometimes people end up impacted after a few days of constipation and once impacted the liquid bowel movement will move around the impaction making you think you have diarrah (sp?).......anyway, when you do pass the impaction you may feel ill and even throw up while on the potty.....you may feel light headed and sweat as well.More than likely not your problem since you didn't mention being constipated but just something to be aware of.",

Is it okay to swim in lake water?2. Is sunscreen safe during pregnancy?3.

            "answer": "I also have similar problem lately (I'm 24 weeks tomorrow BTW) because of hypotension or low blood pressure which can also cause those symptoms (extremely common in pregnancy and not preeclampsia related at all thank goodness). My last blood pressure check I measured at 94 over 67 but as long as I stay hydrated they said not to worry until I get down to low eighties. The diziness gets really annoying, expecially when trying to take care of my daughter, do dishes, etc. but if I sit down for a minute and drink a glass of ice cold water I feel much better. Doc says it's not dangerous at all, just a lot of blood flowing too efficiently. Do you ever get like tension headaches too? I do and I guess that's another sign. Either way be glad, it means your heart is working great and oxygen supply to the baby is fabulous with minimum body effort. I hope I explained that right.I'd call your doc to make sure (and don't feel bad because it's they're job) but I'm pretty sure if your pressures are usually low that that's what's going on. Try to stay calm and relaxed until you hear back from them.",

It has been a long pregnancy - bedrest began at 20 weeks (due to contractions), I had steroid injections (for the baby's lungs) every two weeks from 24 to 34 weeks, lots of pain that was so hard to describe to doctors, a couple of stay overs in the hospital BUT our little guy is doing extremely well! (It's just me we're trying to keep sane!). So best of luck to those who are close to giving birth and those who are pregnant or trying to conceive. I know that all this pain and such will be forgotten the moment I finally get to hold our dear baby boy.Shelley",

I told John I wasn't going into L&D unless we saw Tristan's head crowning, he is terrified of that thought as I am pretty dang stubborn myself and he fears I will stick with that threat,lol!Anyway, as far as the posts regarding sunscreen. Most are safe in pregnancy, double check with your OB for specific ingredients to avoid (always avoid topical products with retinol or vitamin A as they have been linked to bone deformities in developing fetuses) Citronella is safe, I lived in Houston when I got pg with Jonathan and was a mosquito magnet, literally. I found an all natural non aerosol spray that was citronella (smelled like lemon pledge) and was given the okay by my doctor to use it. For the existing bites, she gave the okay for benadryl cream, lowest % you can find.Good luck!!Andrea",
