They did blood work and it showed my liver enzymes were elevated so they made me come in to the hospital. My bp today was normal now but my liver enzymes are still abnormal. I got sent home but they are going to draw blood again on monday.",

HELLP syndrome is always one thing that sticks out in my head because when I was in nursing school there was a woman in the hospital who had it (she had all kinds of symptoms but never went to seek medical care) but ended up with a lacerated liver and in a coma for 6 weeks. Baby was perfect and mom eventually recovered but it's just something you never want to see another family go through.",

I just didnt suspect hellp syndrome because ive looked into it and the other parts of it dont match up...its only my elevated liver enzymes that matches.

Drs are pretty good with things like that and won't mess around even if there's a remote chance. There are many other things that can cause elevated liver enzymes too, but they don't want to miss something that may be dangerous.",
