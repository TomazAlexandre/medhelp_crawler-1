            "answer": "I'm 40 and it's really funny actually. My husband and I prayed and prayed about whether to have a 3rd because I had a life-threatening complication in my last pregnancy (I was 33 at the time). After much thought and consideration we decided to, but given that I was 39 at the time we thought for sure it would take a while. I was already on the fence age-wise and not knowing if we were making a stupid decision not just pregnancy and baby-wise, but lifestyle wise. Heck, I'd be \"ancient\" when my kids went to college and who knows if I'd ever meet my great-grandkids...Well, we decided in late June that I'd have my IUD removed and if we decided not to have more kids then he'd get fixed. July wasn't a \"timing\" month and we just planned on being happy if it happened, or didn't happen but I was still very honestly on the fence about it and had my cycle start on 8.13.07.And that was my last menstrual cycle and I am now 29 weeks along. I'm honestly overwhelmed and go through periods of total elation and excitement and period of thinking, \"WHAT IN THE H*** DID WE DO???? I'M 40!!!\" But everyone tells me that the 3rd is so joyous and that I won't feel so \"old\" when the little guy shows up.We moved from Calif. to Atlanta in July (double whammy stress-wise) but my Ca. doctor was SO encouraging. He says they don't start blinking an eye until after ~43. Here it seems different...lots of judgment and skepticism. I have gotten to where I don't even like telling someone my age because I get the \"Oh. You're pregnant?!? How old are you? That must have been a surprise or a mistake.\"Aside from that and with regard to risks, I just decided we all have risks. Period. Having a greater CHANCE of a risk doesn't mean that you will EXPERIENCE that risk...And I had a life-threatening pregnancy risk and a child with developmental delays at 33 (he's fine now). So while age can indeed dicate some things, it can not dictate all things.It's a personal choice and one that you will vascilate on even when you're pregnant!Good luckChristina",

This current child was planned AGAINST.Both pregnancies were considered high risk due to prior surgeries, age, and asthma/allergies. My first was a breech c-section and since we lived in a somewhat rural area, it made my second a c-section as well.We received all the lectures and warnings about conceiving after 35, especially with my second because I was 39.6 when I delivered. The was they treated me and emphasized Currently, I'm at a higher risk for cancer, preterm labor, preeclampsia, placental problems, high blood pressure, low birth weight, (our kids weren't all that big to begin with), stillborn, and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Then there's the risk to the child such as Down's, type -1 diabetes, high blood pressure as well as all the problems that go with premature children, (autoimmune issues, learning disabilities, and a myriad of other endless low-birth weight issues.)Everyone and every pregnancy is different, but I only had 2 problems\u00a0\u00a0and that was with my first, preeclampsia and morning sickness for 9 mo. The latter of which was the reason I didn't gain any weight, there wasn't any meds I could take that didn't have side effects.Although we passed on it the first two times, (mainly because I was afraid of the pain), we will be looking into either Nuchal Translucency or Amniocentesis. Yes, there are risks but I want to be informed with as much notice as possible to any abnormal results.My husband is in the medical field and I'm unemployed. Oh wait, I'm supposed to say I'm a SAHM (stay at home Mom). Yes, I do believe I'm more interested in raising good humans, patient and enjoy the little things, then had I started in my 20's. But I will admit to having less energy and occasionally worry about seeing my children raise a family. For me, the trade off is worth it.Because I don't look my age, I'm fortunate not to have to deal with too much public opinion. On the rare occasion a stranger is aware of my age, I get looks or borderline disparaging comments. For the few that pay attention to my parenting or better yet, my children's behavior, I either get questions about how my age effects how I raise my children or comments about how well behaved they are.Bottomline, there are things in my life that I would gladly change, but the age that I chose to become a Mom is not one of them.",

Dont get me wrong, I am miserable quite often (back pain, breasts very sensitive, nausea and stretch marks).

I am afraid of getting into this now but I had said I agreed to try. Now I am getting afraid again at the thought of something going wrong with the baby...the pregnancy or me. I am not sure if I am emotionally strong enough to go through that as my Dr. explained some of the risks to me and the outcomes.I guess what i am asking is for some more feed back from others regarding this.
