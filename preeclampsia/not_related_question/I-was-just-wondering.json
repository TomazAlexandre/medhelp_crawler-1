            "answer": "From what I understand it's not...good. The smoke inhalation just alone is of course awful, but also the THC is not healthy for a growing fetus.Especially so early on for you, I wouldn't risk it. In the first trimester it's such a crucial time for fetal development. You'll have to try your hardest to just put food in your stomach without smoking for the sake of the baby.Good luck.",

There is ZERO scientific proof that THC is harmful to a developing fetus...but CAN and WILL affect the frontal cortex of the brain in the Third trimester.
