I have been having so many crazy symptoms, light headedness and blurred vision and stuff I called my dr today and he ran some tests for preeclampsia but everything came back normal, I didn't even see the dr just the nurse so I couldn't really ask any questions. I just want to be done! I'm tired of being sooo miserable",

This part is hard, I agree...hang in there, though. The end is in sight...that baby can't cook in there forever :) But I feel ya...I'm 37 weeks, 3 days and it seems like each week I develop some new annoying/painful ailment (i.e. this week, my hips seem to almost pop when I walk at times...very odd...I've almost tripped a few times because it's so random).",

    "question": "Okay I woke up this morning with the worst hip pain and lots of pressure. Later this evening my stomach was really sore, not sure if I was having Braxton hicks or if it's just sore and my tummy has been really hard and just feeling super uncomfortable and tired. I was going to have sex because I was thinking maybe if I'm this uncomfortable it will get something going but during foreplay my vagina was really tender and my husband said it was super tight and he couldnt get me wet. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this or what it might mean? I'm 36 weeks and 6 days",
