            "answer": "I am also a teacher and 36 weeks (due May 24). If I lived elsewhere, I would take off maybe the end of this week, but given the poor FMLA protection provided in the US, I'm going to work as long as possible. I know we have the summer \"off\" but if something healthwise arises with the new baby in the next year, FMLA is all we have. Therefore, my plan is to work until May 21, and have been trying to decrease/break up the amount of time I spend on my feet (I put a wooden box under my desk and raise my feet slightly when I sit). I teach high school so I plan to give quizzes on days I'm lecturing in other classes, etc.I also latched on to wearing support socks a few years ago from some nurse friends of mine. I find wearing them, especially now, is helping a lot. Moving around a lot, and not standing in place, also helps to keep circulation going in your legs. And, as counter-intuitive as it might sound, being well-hydrated helps reduce swelling. I also rely heavily on my husband, who encourages me to rest with my feet up in the evenings. That being said, you might want to check with your doctor about the swelling - it is possible to develop edema associated with preeclampsia.",
