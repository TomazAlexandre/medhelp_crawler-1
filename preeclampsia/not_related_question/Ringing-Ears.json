    "question": "I am not sure if this is posted in the correct area as I am only 7 weeks pregnant. Last Wednesday I noticed my ears ringing at night when I laid down to take a nap or go to sleep at night. Doctors dont seem concerned and have no resolution and it is driving me crazy. It is to the point where I have to sleep with soft music playing which I hate...Is this a normal part of early pregnancy? Help anyone!?!",
