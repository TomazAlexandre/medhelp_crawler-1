I know someone who got it at 13 weeks and was fine, just given bed rest. I know a total of 4 woman that had it and have a had heathy babies. It doesn't mean that they have to take the baby. You will be very closly monitored and if it gets bad enough (and you dont do your bed rest) you might have to be put in the hospital. So make sure you follow the doctors orders and everything should be okay.",

Yes this can be seriouse if you have an extreme case which I am not sure how common that it. I would just make sure to follow your doctors orders and keep in mind that they may induce you if they need to but I think ( I cant remember how far along you are) but you should be fine dont stress.

            "answer": "Yes, preclampsia is very serious but since you are 37 weeks you are fine. As long as they are monitoring you carefully the worst that can happen is for them to take the baby. That should be fine by 37 weeks. Many time it comes on bad around 24-30 weeks which causes a premature baby. My sister in law just had it and had to be induced at 30 weeks with her twins. They are fine but were really tiny when they were born. If they don't take the baby it can be extremely dangerous for the mommy. Delivery is the only cure for it.The pain you are having since being checked is normal too. I get crampy every time I am checked at the end. It irritates your cervix and makes you have more braxton hicks and contractions.",
