            "answer": "I`m so sorry for your lost. I thinks that the problem with placenta and high blood pressure caused the baby to be so small for that week of pregnancy. At 24 weeks is normal to have at least 1 pound. Did they made more specific investigation? I mean despite the high blood pressure maybe you have problem with blood clottings?! Did they made tests for this?I think you should wait for 3 month at least, make some tests and start again. I`m almost 32 old also and in our age things are harder than in women at twenties.Stay close with your doctor and the next time with more prenatal care from his side everything gonna be ok. And remember Preeclampsia is more often during the first pregnancy.Wish you best next time....",
