            "answer": "You definitely don't want to leave a severe headache untreated that long, so I'd say give your OB a call and either ask to be seen today or go to the urgent care, just because you don't want to be stuck through the long weekend without an answer.It could be blood-pressure, blood-sugar, or any number of things..but any headache that is unusual in frequency, length, or intensity during pregnancy should be treated just to make sure it's not something serious. It could well be hormones..I have HORRIBLE migraines that can last days, and when I'm pregnant, they can get worse to where I only have HOURS of relief between headache attacks.But nonetheless, it's very important to get checked out when this is not normal for you.Best of luck..keep us posted, OK?",
