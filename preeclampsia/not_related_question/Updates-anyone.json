            "answer": "yes i was wondering the same thing lol.As for me i am on bed rest have been for the last couple weeks, had to go to the hospital to stop preterm labor i am at 3 cm and 50% effaced. I have horrible SPD and back pain. And all i can do is lay around i haven't done anything to prepare for our baby girl who is still nameless lol. i am 32 weeks and i hate my drs office i get no info, they mentioned a induction to me at my first visit but haven't since.. I dont need one really but they want to control my labor because of how fast it is lol.I have my baby sprinkle planned for April 16th, and not to sure it will go very well since my friend said i am not entitled to one lol, she is a ***** i know..The only things we have gotten this little one is a new swing and pack n play, i have no clothes yet. we have most the stuff from our daughter so its a bummer to not shop. lolBut soon i am going to get a double stroller and hopefully some clothes, and stuff i need. Time is going by slow but i am terrified that in less then 8 weeks this will be my 3rd child, i am scared what this labor will bring..ok enough ranting i hope more ladies check in :)",

            "answer": "Once you are dialated, can you get un-dialted? Does bed rest help with that? Sorry to hear you are laid up already - what a bummer! I do hope you can do some shopping!People do have different thoughts about showering for a second (or third) baby. My sister is having another boy and her first is under 2. It doesn't make much sense to have a huge party just so people can bring you gifts. But I think that every baby deserves to be welcomed. A new outfit or two can't hurt. And every baby uses diapers, wipes, and bath items like they are going out of style. At her shower they are doing a low key party - no big meal, no giant decorations, no renting a hall. Just getting a few ladies together at her work and playing games. I don't think she even intends on opening presents (she's requested only diapers and wipes). I hope the party goes well for her. I did send her a blanket and she needed a new bouncer seat. Besides that, she has pretty much everything she needs.So what are you doing to entertain yourself on bedrest?",

            "answer": "misslollipop - Yeah, I got the GD too about 2 weeks ago. But I havent gotten as far as insulin. Just controlling with diet for now. They have been monitoring me my whole pregnancy for it, suspecting that I might get it at any point. Well, it finally happened and now I am part of the self-stabbing club....horray. But only 9 more weeks of it to go!jillian - I have been documenting this pregnancy pretty well too. It took me years to get this far, so I want to remember every moment! Since this is my first pregnancy, everything is new and exciting to me! I write in a journal every few days - even if it's just about my emotions or what's going on around me.Here was a cute moment we had last night....\u00a0\u00a0After labor class dh and I came home, relaxed for a bit and went to bed. As soon as I laid down, Ava started kicking up a storm. So I reached over and put dh hand on my belly. He has only felt her move a few times as she is a very shy baby! Well, she just kept kicking and kicking. DH started freaking out! He was saying \"nah, uh! that has to be you doing that!\" Of course it wasn't - I can't manipulate my body like that! Then a few minutes later when she settled down a bit, dh looked at me and said \"I can't stop crying! I can't believe she will be here in a few weeks. I can't wait.\" Then I started sobbing and we just cried ourselves to sleep. I'm crying now just thinking about it!",

            "answer": "Hi everyone! It's been months since I've been on - horrible I know! Work and home have both been absolutely insane lately, so it's been near impossible to get time to log on anymore. I am 33 weeks 5 days - due May 15th, so I am excited to be down to the last 6 weeks!!! It's so hard to believe, but I am definitely ready to be un-pregnant again. This time has been so much harder physically than the first, so I'm just tired of being sore and tired! Here's my updates of what has been going on the last couple of months.I lost 8 lbs in 5 weeks mid-2nd trimester, struggled to gain any of it back. Right at the beginning of my 3rd trimester, I acually had finally gained 4 lbs back and maintained it for a couple of weeks, then ended up in the ER because I was having awful belly/back pains and threw up. The pains came in waves, so I thought they were contractions. Thankfully they were not. The OB diagnosed me with dehydration, although it seemed to be a pretty strange diagnosis since I was drinking just fine up through the day before. My midwife actually thinks it was 1 of 2 things - either food poisoning or a gall bladder attack. Apparently both on/offset virtually identically. So... with that even, I lost the 4 lbs again. Since then I have been creaping back up and have FINALLY gained back the full 8 lbs. The baby has seemed to grow without any issues - it was measuring 2 weeks ahead, but this past week it was right on. I will be having an u/s at 36 weeks to double check the size to make sure it's not looking huge! :) My daughter was only 7 lbs 1 oz, but they were convinced she was going to be 9 lbs. This time I'm afraid they'll think it's only 7 lbs, but will actually be 9! hahahaha!I am all belly - carrying right out front. Completely different than my first, so this time it has been much harder physically. I have been very uncomfortable since late December, so I'm definitely ready.That's about it for me. Just anxiouly awaiting the next 6 weeks to pass and to hear how everyone else has gotten along with their deliveries!Best of luck everyone! I will do my best to get on here a couple more times before I deliver and will definitely share the news.",

    "question": "It is getting slower and slower in this room...the excitement of new-ness is wearing off. Or, I think we are all becoming more busy getting things ready!I've had my second baby shower - one more to go! Baby Ava owns 17 pairs of shoes already...is that a little too much?! LOL! I think all I need to get now is feeding items. I hope breast feeding works out for me and I am pretty determined to do it, but I do have to go back to work at 6 weeks and will have to pump - thus needing bottles still.My mom was down here a little over a week ago and got the crib and changing table for us. Her room is really coming together now. Just a few more organization moves and we are all set to go! She has so many new clothes it's unreal - I probably have one of every outfit created for baby girls in the last 6 months! LOL!We had our 3D ultrasound done when mom was in town. Baby Ava is SO cute it's unreal! She wasn't too active or cooperative (as usual), but we got some good pictures of her smiling, one of her counting with her fingers, and another of her singing (or yawning). I had some super cute cards made with the pictures. I can't wait to get them in the next few days and mail them out.My belly is growing SO big. I feel like she is gonna crawl out of my belly button sometimes! But it's not time yet...gotta keep her in! We are taking a labor prep course right now. 4 more weeks to go with that course. At the end of the course I have an appointment set to do maternity pictures...anyone else doing photos with this pregnancy?",
