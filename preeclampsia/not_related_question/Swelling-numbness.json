            "answer": "I hope not. I posted this same post on baby center board and they didn't really say anything. This was like 2-3 days ago, but today my left foot is still more swollen than my right. My left hand has a numb feeling to it. Not bad but I can feel it and my left shoulder just started hurting as well. I went on the pre eclampsia website and most of those symptoms is what I'm feeling. I'm kinda scared now.",

    "question": "So I know that swelling is normal during pregnancy. But I have swelling wayyyyy more in my left foot than my right and my left toes are numb when I move them upwards. My face, mostly my lips and chin area, is numb and they hurt when I talk and I kind of have a lisp. Is this normal to have where it hurts and the numbness as well?Well on Saturday after work, I called the dr on call at the hospital and told her about the swelling and hurting and I've been getting random headaches, which I don't usually get, she told me to go the ER and I did and they set me up at the maternity ward. Checked my blood pressure, protein in my urine, baby's heartbeat. But they said everything was fine. I'm 29 weeks today, so idk. But I heard that swelling on one side and not the other was usually a bad sign, but that was just what someone told me.",
