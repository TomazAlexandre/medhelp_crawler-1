            "answer": "hi girls, i am 31 weeks with my girls.we had our\u00a0\u00a0cagillionth level 3 ultrasound wednesday and they are doing perfectly. baby a(Kai)\u00a0\u00a0is transverse below my\u00a0\u00a0belly button and baby b (Rayen) is transverse above my belly button between my ribs(ooowwww) their heads are on the left and their feet are on the right.kai is up to 4 pounds 6 ounces and rayen is 3 pounds 13 ounces. you can see fingers or toes going across my tummy intermittently. rayen scoots away when daddy tries to feel her wiggle but kai will nuzzle right up to his hand. isn't it amazing that they already have such strong personalities?i, on the other hand...well i am suffering a bit more. still hanging in there, just biding my time.at 10 weeks i lost a triplet and had placenta previa. that cleared well and the next milestone was early preeclampsia.(somewhat stable so far) i did fail my one hour diabetes test and am now awaiting my three hour. i have all the aches and pains you could, but guess what...i would not trade it for the world. every time i see my girls, feel their movements or hear their heartbeats i still tear up.oh and shamada, my girls fight already! you can see it on my myspace. lol.",
