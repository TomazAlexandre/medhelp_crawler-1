            "answer": "I had \"low lying placenta\" at 20 wks. My own OB told me it is nothing to worry about this early and that with uterine expansion, the placenta usually migrates sightly upward, not interfereing with a normal vaginal delivery.However, you're bleeding and I never did> Mine was found during a normal level2 u/s.As long as you take it easy (as I am sure your own Ob told you to) you will be fine and your level 2 will be able to give more info on what's going on in there!Best of luck!",

Did your placenta move up as time went on?\u00a0\u00a0How far along are you now?\u00a0\u00a0I'm just so nervous!\u00a0\u00a0My mother had this with my baby sis, but she lost so much blood that she had to have a blood transfusion and she was in the hospital for weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe that mine will progress that bad...especially since it was only partial.\u00a0\u00a0I guess as far as I know it could already be moving!Again thanks!!!!Carolyn",

I do know that part of the reason my OB isn't too concerned about it is because I have to have a section anyway. But I understand how anxious you must be about it! And it's great that you have the attitude \"whatever it takes\"! With such a great outlook, you'll do just fine! :)",

            "answer": "Hello, I was placenta previa with abruption 10 years ago. I also had the bleeding, but was hospitalized for 9 weeks. They would give me steroid shots to enhance my DS lungs, twice a week, for the whole 9 weeks. He was 6 1/2 weeks early, but very healthy, and came home with me. I did have to have a c- section, but it wasn't that bad. I also had a amnio at 32 weeks, I think that hurt more than anything else.It is funny though, how you have to go through so much to get them here, but you don't really remember a whole lot from it. He will be 10 in February, and my second child is due 4-1-04.Good Luck to you, and keep us posted on how things are going!",

Yes the pain and recovery is worse than with a vaginal delivery, but I would take a bikini cut any day over a 3rd degree tear on my girl parts!Also, I had breast augmentation 2 yrs ago. That is an out-patient surgery. Not like a section, which is considered major abdominal surgery. With my section I was up the next day and off my pain meds by day 3. With my breast surgery I was on pain meds for about 2 wks. I couldn't move for 2 days I was in so much pain.So there ya go. A section is not nearly as bad as a boob job! :) LOL",
