            "answer": "It's pretty neglectful to not see a doctor yet. Although my best friend didn't realize she was pregnant until about five months, so she had not seen a doctor by then. Luckily, she doesn't drink or smoke, and ate pretty healthy at the time, so everything was fine. But, still, your DIL needs to get to a doctor ASAP. My question echos everyone else's - why hasn't she seen a doctor? Even if no insurance or low income is the problem, there are free/low-cost clinics everywhere!",

I'm sure she knows the risks etc. I'm sorry you have to go through this. Hopefully something will click and she will go. If she is 5 mos along that is good is she eating good and taking vitamins etc? I think back to the days where they had no pre-natal care and women had babies at home. I'm grateful for technology and medicine but is there something that happened to her that is making her not want to go. Have you talked to her? Best wishes to you your daughter in law and that baby! Good luck and let me know what happens!AP",
