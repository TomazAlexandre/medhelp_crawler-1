But I try not to eat so late.Today, I was fine going\u00a0\u00a0into work, but after 1hr or so, I got horrible cramps along the side of my belly/abdomen. Like a tightening feeling. I talked to other coworkers and have told me it cramps down there and on your sides of the hip.My belly pain could have been due to the baby is an awkward position. The pain wouldn't go away either which worried me. And the pain made me feel nauseous. I still ate breakfast because I felt hungry regardless haha.Now hours later the pain is still\u00a0\u00a0there but not as sharp.",

            "answer": "This is what I felt Wednesday morning, plus pain in my upper abdomen and my back. Luckily I had my 33 week appointment that afternoon, so I just waited to complain to doc. Got there, they took my sample and bp and sent me straight to the hospital. (High bp and protein in my urine) But Doctor thinks the pains I was feeling were contractions cause I had some while they were monitoring here at the hospital. All that to tell you the pain went away once they hydrated me by IV. So maybe (the magical answer we love to hear all the time) more water? Since that wasn't my only problem I'm still here at the hospital, awaiting results for possible preeclampsia :/",

    "question": "These definitely feel painful of 6-7 . It's not the gradual belly hardening that leaves me out of breath but jut bad indigestion gas pains. I'm burping and I think what ever I had last night is causing bad gas pains. This doesn't feel like contracting but bad abdominal period gas pains. Best way I can put it. When I get my period I get bad gas cramping\u00a0\u00a0especially when having to go potty. But this is painful. It woke me straight up and I can hear so many loud digestive sounds. Babies moving too. I regret eating dinner. But last night my appetite actually came back. I feel for you who have heartburn this s.u.c.k.s!! I'm gonna still keep track of the cramping just in case but I think this is bad digestion.",
