I had morning sickness from 4 weeks to 7 1/2 months with my first son and I'm at 11 weeks with the next one and I'm having a hard time getting them and keeping them down. With my first son I didn't take them and he was fine. I'm attempting with this one, but it has been a struggle. I'm going to ask my doctor next week when I see him if the flinstones could be an option. I urge you to do the same. Good luck!",

When my doctor gave me samples of all the different vitmains, I went right for the smallest ones. My throat does the same thing and I really think it's mental. What I do when I take them is put it in the front of my mouth and then take a big sip of juice. (Like the entire mouth full) then swallow with one big gulp. Most times I don't even feel it.I just told my husband the other night that I don't understand why my gag reflex is so sensitive that I can't take that little pill. I'm sure I swallow morsels of food that are larger than that. LOL!\u00a0\u00a0Also, don't think about what you're doing. Just do it real fast before your mind has time to tell your throat to tighten.I know how hard it is...I'm in the exact same boat, but we have to try to get these pills down for the sake of our baby's well being. I've been really good for the past week and I actually took vitamins and folic acid prior to my getting pregnant, but like you have to struggle to get these down daily. Thank God it's only 1 pill a day. LOL!Good Luck, if you find a miracle cure for us please post it:))",
