            "answer": "I am 18 weeks pregnant and my little girl was diagnosed with a cystic hygroma at 14 weeks. I had an amnio done and it all came back normal, so no chromosome abnormalities. Her hygroma has shrunk since it was first detected at 12 weeks. How big is your baby's hygroma? Where is it located? My doctors have never told me that my baby would not survive. Her hygroma is on the back of her neck and has gone from 6mm to 5mm as of 2 weeks ago. I have been seeing a perinatologist and I will also have to see a pediatric cardiologist in a few weeks to rule out a heart defect. Basically, get the amnio done. If it comes back normal, then you've eliminated that problem. They'll want to monitor the hygroma just to make sure it doesn't grow or extend to other parts of the body. If it's just the cystic hygroma with no other abnormalities, the prognosis is pretty good. I know if fetal hydrops develop, there is a 100% mortality rate. But again, if it's an isolated cystic hygroma there's a good chance of survival. Lots of these cases resolve themselves and the hygromas just diminish completely. I know I'm kind of all over the place, but I've been doing nothing but research for the past 5 weeks and there's so much information. I hope some of this helped....if you were even able to follow my randomness! I know how scary this is. Especially when you start researching online.....there are some really terrible things on the internet. If I can help in any way, please let me know!",

However, I always thought to myself that if it had to be something, I'd want it to be Turners. Before I got my amnio results back, the doctors told me it was most likely Turners, so of course I went in search of support. I found so many women who have wonderful, perfect daughters with Turner Syndrome. There are so many growth hormones and treatments that eliminate so many of the issues Turners babies have. I'm sure you've done your research and if you're anything like me, you're more focused on just getting your baby girl to live to term. I know how scary it can be to just sit and wonder if she will make it. How is her heart?? Have they taken a good look at it yet? The fact that you've already made it to 16 weeks is fantastic! I'll be praying for you and your baby girl! Please keep us updated! Oh, and I don't know if this would help you or not, but I rented a baby doppler. The fact that she was at such high risk for cardiac failure was enough reason for me to rent it. It made me feel so much better to hear her heart beat every day. Good luck!!",

            "answer": "Your story starts out exactly like mine! I was first told of the problem at barely 12 weeks and she was diagnosed at 14 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 22 weeks now and as of 20 weeks, the hygroma was nearly gone. It's still there, but it hardly even noticeable to the untrained eye. I have since gone to a pediatric cardiologist to have a fetal echo done on her heart and that came back perfect. No heart defects! Now, there is no reason to think that I won't give birth to a perfectly healthy little girl. I'm telling you, I thought there was no chance. Everyone told me to stay positive and keep hope, but they didn't know the statistics. I remained optimistic, but realistic through the whole thing......it drove my family crazy! But I know the statistics and I know the odds and I'm telling you that there's a huge possibility that everything will be just fine for you and your baby. I'm glad you're getting the amnio done. Do you have it scheduled yet? Make sure you ask about the FISH test too. I got the results back in 3 days. It doesn't test for everything, but it tests for all the Trisomies like Downs and Edwards and it tests for Turner Syndrome as well. It was just nice to know the big things were out of the way so much faster than the full amnio results. I hope your amnio results come back completely normal and that stupid hygroma goes away all together!! Please keep me updated on your situation!! I'll be thinking of you and your baby!

This is our first. This past week at our 10 week appointment, our doctor noticed an irregular nuchal. He wants us to go for a second opinion with a prenatal screening specialist. That appointment is tomorrow, and I am scared to the bone. I just don't know what is going on and I am praying for my little baby to be healthy. Being a first time potential father it is really hard for me to deal with this. My wife is emotional and well I feel that if god forbid there is something wrong that we should discuss what our next course of action would be. It is really a horrible and somewhat lonely feeling being that it took us time to get pregnant. Really it is in gods hands now, I just hope and pray that all is ok. But being in this situation is just plain horrible being that we have been so looking forward to this. I know the screening is exactly that a screening and sets off alarms...but nothing is definite till you see a specialist. I just ask that if you can pray for our little baby. I thank you all and please keep this site going, you have no idea how mych you have helped.",

Per the physician the normal measure is 2.2 on the high end. So she told us there is a risk, she dubbed it as moderate. However this could also mean some sort of cardiac issues as well. Rather than taking a blood test and try and figure out what screening range we fall in we elected to go for a cvs. We should have the first set of results back by Monday. I've done some research online and well basically it is telling me stuff I already know. We probably have a 10 to 15% chance of something being wrong. We choose the CVS cause it is conclusive, we want a yes or no answer. I know some people will disagree, but not knowing for us is not an option. I just hope my little baby is ok. Again I don't know what normal is but from what I have read, normal on the high end is 2.2, so we know that there is a possibility that something may be wrong.

The blood tests are so inconclusive....my specialist recommended that I avoid even doing the blood test. For us, we wanted an answer....not percentages. If you've read this thread you know that everything has turned out just fine for us. I have one more u/s with my specialist to make sure the hygroma has completely gone, but after that I'm done. A lot of times....especially if it's just a thick nuchal fold.....the connection in the 2 systems is just delayed. Once that connection happens, the fluid drains and goes where it's supposed to go and everything ends up completely normal. Sometimes I've wondered how many unborn babies actually have a thick nuchal fold, but it's never detected because in most cases an u/s isn't done that early on. I hope your results come back completely normal and you can just start crossing the potential problems off your list. If I could be of any help, please just let me know!

The normal FISH results are a very good indication that your baby will be just fine. I hope that the U/S goes well today.....hopefully there will be some regression. They should just check the thickness of the baby's skin. In a lot of these cases, the fluid begins to drain around 15 weeks, so most likely they're looking to see if the fluid has drained to the parts of the body it needs to go. Good luck! I'll be watching for an update! Congratulations again on the normal test results!!",

There are quite a few of us who have gone through or are going through the same thing. I feel like it's been forever since my baby was diagnosed with a cystic hygroma and I just found out on Tuesday that it's completely gone. It's entirely possible for it to just go away on its own, but I know how hard it is to be unsure. Did they tell you how big the hygroma is? Where is it located? Good luck hun and I'll be praying that everything turns out well for you and your little one. Keep us updated!",

The only problem is that 95% of pregnancies with Turner Syndrome to not make it. The strange thing is though that the ones that do survive live a fairly normal life. They just never grow to full height or go through puberty, but in most aspects they are like other children. Only girls can have Turner Syndrome, so this would mean that our baby was a girl.

My OB and genetic counselor felt we should push it up to today Jan 9. During the sono. I was terrified to ask the tech. if the cystic hygroma had grown. The high risk Dr. felt I was too early along ( 14 weeks/2days) for a safe amnio and recommended that we reschedule for next week. I finally summoned up the courage to ask about the hygroma , he said the tech never measured it during this sono, so he did it himself, he felt our baby looked normal and that the hygroma had/has reabsorped, he said if he did'nt know any better and this was a first time US he would have never picked it up as abnormal. He also said that at 14 weeks the US scans/planes are now sagital versus profile so the measuring is different. Of course we are not out of the woods but he gave us such tremendous relief and hope. I'm sure you have felt the despair that I have felt when you think your baby is not healthy so it is really good to feel a little excited about this baby for a change. He also said that it's still a little too early to tell yet, but if he were a betting man he'd say this one' s a girl. Please for all of you out there, keepyour faith, don't loose hope even in your darkest moments, know that we are out here in cyber world and that we are all riding this freakin' nightmare rollercoaster.

I, myself, went in for a CVS test two days ago (Jan 8th) and unfortunately my anteverted uterus was still too tipped back to perform it. They will try again in one week, otherwise I have to wait until February to get an amnio (til I'm 15 weeks). I am only 11w 5d today (Jan 10th). The wait is bordering on intolerable. In the meantime, I would like to have another US to see if the hygroma is growing or decreasing in size. I know that fluid is supposed to drain from behind the neck around 14 weeks when the systems connect. What I don't fully understand is whether a hygroma that drains at that time indciates that there is generally not an underlying problem. Is it only the hygromas that remain that are indicative of problems? Did your doctor give you more information than this? It seems nothing is black and white. Thank you for sharing your good news.

Again, only an amnio can rule that out. Once they rule out all genetic disorders they then monitor the baby's heart, since statistically babies with reabsorption have some form of congenital heart defect, once they are able to rule that out they can tell you that your chances of delivering a healthy baby are very high, most likely to be completely normal without adverse side effects.I wish someone would have told me that the fluid is supposed to drain around 14 weeks that would have given me some hope last week. I had my NT at 12 weeks ( 12/24/07),\u00a0\u00a0was told the hygromawas 4mm at 13 weeks, went in for another sono. at 14 weeks and was told that there was no significant fluid to speak of. Who in the hell really knows whats going on, obviously we are just looking for some good news at this time since the past weeks have been so emotionally draining. So we are hanging on to hope and praying that we will beat all the odds.\u00a0\u00a0Thats why I was so happy to read that your OB said what she said about most reabsorping.What did your baby's hyrgoma measure at and at what week.I know it seems like time is standing still and that 15 weeks is years away, but all you can really do is read only good things and silently wait for the amnio.

Another thing for you to feel hopeful about is that both my OB and the OB who I originally spoke to when she was gone said that they have never encountered a heart problem associated with a reabsorbed cystic hygroma. So you really do have reason to feel relief right now. : ) As for me, I was diagnosed at my NT screening at 10.6 days. The CH was 2.9mm. The doctor was concerned because it was so early on and it was already too big. I guess the idea is that she was afraid it would be all the bigger in a week or two. I'm trying to keep the faith!

I don't know if you read my posts, but I just want to tell you that there most certainly is hope. At 11 weeks 5 days, my baby's nuchal fold was 6mm and she was diagnosed with cystic hygroma a week later. The fluid went from the top of her head, down her back, and all the way to her bottom. I am now 32 weeks pregnant with a healthy little girl. Her hygroma is completely gone and fortunately it caused no other problems. She had no chromosome abnormalities and has a perfect heart. I look back at all of those dreadful appointments with my specialist and it all seems like a bad dream now. I remember him telling me that certain parts of her were small for her age....yet another indication of a problem. And now, she's measuring big! At my last appt. with him he actually laughed and told me that I'm going to have a chubby baby. It was so surreal to look at the same man who talked to me about termination and the bleak chance of survival my baby had, and then to lay there and listen to him crack jokes about my baby girl's chubby cheeks. My point is, there is hope.....especially that early on. If I hadn't had an u/s at 12 weeks....if only they had waited until 18 weeks, they would have never even noticed the hygroma. I'll be thinking of you all and I hope that your nightmare is over soon. Take care.....",

Our baby has Trisomoy 21, no level of severity can be determined at this gestational age. We would be waiting until 20 weeks plus to learn the extent of congenital heart defect. Our baby will most likely have one form of 3 serious heart defects because of her present Cystic Hygroma. Her medical complications will follow her throughout her life..More than likely she will either pass in uterine or not survive the first year, of course no one can ever be certain of this but our chances\u00a0\u00a0are very high for spontaneous abortion. At this point we can opt for medical termination where I would not have to go through heartbreaking hours of labor but simply be put to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0If we decide to go forward with the pregnancy our chance of miscarriage increases daily and if we make it to term her chance of survival is very small.. As my husband put it(god bless his soul) we would decide to go forward, make our peace with Down syndrome, educate ourselves, prepare ourselves, anticipate her birth only to be further devistated with a 3rd. trimester miscarriage. God may think I'm strong for many things, but I can assure him as well as anyone that I would not mentally survive labor and delivery of a still born..

I know how hard it is to feel so helpless, but hang in there. My baby's hygroma has been gone for months and I'm still a nervous wreck. I have an ultrasound on Friday just to check her growth and I'm scared to death that the hygroma will have come back.....as ridiculous as it is.

The wait is nothing less than excruciating. There are good outcomes and there are bad. And there is absolutely no reason to give up hope as your case very well could have a good outcome. Unfortunately no amount of research can really help indicate what they outcome will be, as each case is unpredictable and there is nothing you can do to affect the situation. (A terribly helpless feeling I know!) That said, it made me feel better to be doing \"something\" so I researched non-stop. All I can say is that we humans (and women for sure) are stronger than we know. And in addition to having hope that everything will be fine, dont' forget to have faith that whatever the outcome, with proper love and support, you Will survive it.

The waiting is agony. Fortunately, I have a friend with Turner syndrome so she has been very helpful to talk to. For anyone with that diagnosis, she says she doesn't feel it has hindered her life at all. She didn't even find out she had it until she was 17.

The fact that your baby has normal chromosomes is HUGE! My entire story is posted throughout this thread, but my outcome was good. My baby was born on March 3rd perfectly healthy. I'm starting to think that just maybe cystic hygromas occur far more frequently than anyone realizes. Isolated cystic hygromas have much better outcomes than those associated with hydrops or chromosome abnormalities. So already, your baby is ahead of the game. All you can do...as frustrating as it is.....is wait. Every ultrasound will be just as terrifying as the one before....but hopefully there will be less and less fluid every time you go. Hang in there! We've all been exactly where you are so please....vent....ask questions....do whatever you need to do because we all know what you're going through. Just know that there is a good chance that everything will be just fine and this will all become a distant nightmare. Good luck to you and please keep us posted!!!",

Our cvs was normal and our geneticist says it's now a 40 % chance of a normal outcome since we got through the first hurdle. We have to look at the heart and anatomy at 18 weeks.We have 2 children already that are 3 1/2 and 1. I am 40 so this is our last try for another child. The research out there on the internet is doom and gloom. My goal is to find out how many babies are born alive and what are their outcomes and chances of being normal and healthy. I did find one study with a 20% chance of normal outcome. What do structural problems include? Is it just heart and/or skeletal? Anyway, I will keep all of you updated on our progress so we all get more information on outcomes associated with cystic hygroma. My first son has some special needs with club feet and low muscle tone so we are really praying for a healthy child this time. His therapy schedule is quite intense and he's doing great but parenting a child with any special needs is very challenging at times.We have hundreds of folks praying for us. i will pray for all of you too.Gina",

I know the fear and the torture of the unknown. Personally, I found the internet to be helpful. Not because of all the good things it said about CH (there wasn't much of that) but because I was able to educate myself and somewhat prepare myself for the worst possible end. I found it helpful when talking with the specialist....the things he said weren't so foreign after I had done my research. It also enabled me to ask questions that I knew were important. Just know, there is hope. And just as Jed868 said, isolated hygromas have a far better prognosis. The chance of survival and all around good outcome goes from 9% to 84%. The waiting is so gut wrenching, I know. Hang in there and know you always have a place to scream here on this board. We've all been there. Good luck to you all....you're in my thoughts.",

It's the Malone study(the long one) that gave about a 17% chance of having a healthy baby when initially diagnosed with the cystic hygroma during first trimester. It then goes on to analyze the outcome of normal babies excluding chromosomal and structural malformation issues...95% which is amazing. That's when you get to the end of 2nd trimester and jumped through the other hoops. Who knew? This is a very difficult process to go through. We have 4 more weeks of waiting to analyze the heart and anatomy. I know if I was you, I'd be on my hands and knees thanking God daily for that little girl.

The peri said that my little girl's arms and legs were \"short\" for her age of gestation (yet another sign of a problem). But when I went home and did some research I found that usually the arms and legs catch up with the rest of the body later on in pregnancy so there was no way he should have been able to say with confidence that it was an issue....in my opinion anyway. I was amazed though at everything he was able to see from an ultrasound. He was able to see that her heart and kidneys were normal. He also kept switching to 3d to get a good look at her facial features to look for 'markers' for downs. When I went for the fetal echo, I couldn't believe that they could see anything from that machine! It didn't look nearly as clear as the one at my peri's office. So even though the cardiologist said her heart was fine, I decided to take her in for an echo after she was born...just to be sure. Thankfully, the first cardiologist was right and her heart was perfect. It just goes to show that the worry doesn't stop once they're born, but at least with baby in arms you won't feel so incredibly helpless. And yes, I do thank God everyday for my healthy little girl. It still brings me to tears thinking about all that we went through. I'm constantly touching the back of her neck....she has some excess skin from the hygroma. I actually love it....it's like a little reminder of how lucky I am and how grateful I am.",

It seems that we are club feet free which is great since my son has that. However, she was concerned the hygroma hasn't gone down at all. It hasn't grown either. It is about 7 mm and goes from the back of the nect to the top of the spine. She said it should have reabsorbed by now. I am having an anatomy scan in 3 weeks and the echo early in 3 1/2 weeks. My head is hurting from all of the numbers and stuff they are throwing at me...syndromes, genetic mutation possibilities, etc.I keep reminding myself that God is in control of this and try to refocus when this happens. So a a great report of the anatomy but still praying that the hygroma goes down a bit before the next visit at 18 weeks. Thanks for your feedback. This is one of the toughest things I have ever dealt with besides my dealing with my little boy and his physical challenges. Your feedback is really helping me with my patience in all of this.Megan, glad you told me about the leg anatomy concern. These doctors tend to always look at the negative. I guess they need to prepare us though.Gina",

He spent an entire hour and half with us and explained everything in detail. The Dr. even shared that he and his wife had a child with a ch that didn't make it so he could really understand both as a Dr. and a parent what we were going through. The positive things we have going for us is that the heart beat is very strong and normal. We also found out that the baby is going to be a boy so that eliminates turners syndrome. The Dr. said that our little boy appears to be growing normal except for the cystic hygroma which measures 9mm which has him very concerned.We are scheduled for an amnio on 5/29/2008 when we are at 17 weeks. The Dr. said it takes 3-4 days for the full results but until then try to relax and approach each day one at time. He reassured us when we left that he has seen many miracles happen in the womb and that hope, support and prayer are the best medicines for anyone facing troubles in their life. Thanks to everyone who is sharing we will be praying for all of you.\u00a0\u00a0C___",

When I went for what I thought was the \"anatomy scan\" at 21 weeks, they really didn't look that closely at limbs and so forth. They did say that she is about 11 days big for her age and that is also supposed to be a good sign that things are progressing well. He said that I probably wouldn't have a 6 pounder, more like 8. My husband and I are both very tall, so we expect a long baby. When I went back to my OB for regular monthly visit last week, he said that this is the biggest miracle he has seen. He said a 10 wk ch almost always means miscarraige. He said \" I don't know who you are praying to, but say a prayer for me\". I think he needs to read the messages on this site so he can see that I am not the only one that has had a miracle. I hope all of you who are waiting for tests and results keep faith and realize that there is hope. Just keep praying and try to relax.",

It didn't seem like he could find anything positive to say. They wouldn't do the CVS test for me since I could cause a miscarriage by doing the test. They just told me to wait 2 weeks and see what happens. That was very hard. I had to wait until I was far enough along for the amnio. We even tried the amnio a little early and the placenta tented instead of puncturing. I had to wait another 10 days to try again. The waiting is the hardest part since all you do is worry and read bad things on the internet. Just stay on this site and if you have questions, ask the women here.

I had a friend go through this same experience in November. she is pregnant now with a healthy baby. My direct email is ***@****. I'm 4 days past the D&E and things are looking and feeling better emotionally. I named my little girl Faith. It helps me connect spiritually with God about the whole situation. All of my friends and family refer to her as Faith as well. How can we not? These are little beings who have been a part of our lives and that we love as our children.so send me an email for some more one on one support. I'd be happy to help. I know having a friend go through it helped me alot.It seems as though the cystic hygromas associated with chromosomal abnormalities are pretty severe. It's wonderful to know about the women here delivering healthy babies too. We need to keep the faith for all of them.Gina",

It just depends on what we can handle and you are amazing in what you are doing. I still pray for you and Hannah regularly. Keep us updated.I'm still undecided on getting pregnant again. I know this could happen again and fear going through this again. Besides watching my son in the hospital experience seizures, this was the second most difficult time of my life and I'm sure yours as well.Has anyone out there known anyone to get pregnant again after this and went on to have a healthy pregnancy?

I'm so grateful I didn't have to make any of those decisions and I can only imagine how difficult it must be to have to do. I spent some time yesterday researching both Trisomy 13 and Trisomy 18 and it was heart wrenching. I think the only thing worse than finding out that your baby has something like that is what happened to you.....being told that everything is normal and then finding out that there was a mistake and there is actually something wrong. Your strength is incredible. Have you had genetic testing? I would assume that would be the only way to know for sure the possibilities of having a healthy baby.

I've never heard the 1% for Turner's....when I was researching, it was 5%. I know that doesn't sound like a lot, but my daughter was given a 3-9% chance of survival and here she sits. Also, there are so many different levels of Turners. I'm going to go see if I can find it for you again, but I had found a website in doing my research where there were video interviews of these 2 little girls with Turners.....I couldn't even tell there was anything wrong. Because you know now, and God willing she survives long enough to be born, they've got growth hormones that will help her to be pretty much normal sized. If she were to have a webbed neck, they have surgery to fix that as well. I know I'm all over the place, sometimes I just don't know what to do with all of this information. Talk to people. Get in touch with women through the web who have beautiful daughters with this syndrome. I know the part you're probably most worried about is whether or not she'll make it at all and my heart aches for you for having to feel that feeling. If there's anyone that knows what you're going through right now it's Nassime. I'm sure you could be a lot of comfort to one another. I guess maybe start by going to www.turnersyndrome.org. It has any information you'll need and links to anything else you need. I'm so so so sorry for your news. You and your little girl are in my thoughts. I'm holding so much hope for her.",

This whole experience has completely changed my perspective. I now appreciate all of the little milestones that I took for granted with my son. I wanted to add, after my daughter was born, the one thing I was still really concerned about was her heart. Even though the fetal echo came back normal, I couldn't help but worry that something was missed through all that gunk! So I opted to have her echo done again and after that, I was able to rest easy.

Believe me I know this for a fact. Inititally we were told our baby had a 4.0 mm\u00a0\u00a0cystic hygroma and than we were told of all the possiblities associated with this diagnosis, we had an amnio and a fish test to confirm genetic abnormalities. I belong to a website calledA HEARTBREAKING CHOICE, it exists completely for families who were faced with the God awful, gut wrenching, heartbreaking decision to let their angel babies go, there is not a single woman who made that decision based on an U/S.I understand your point, that sometimes too much information too early on is just too much and that most likely things turn out positively, unfortunately that is not always the case.There are so many moms out there who have survived this journey, they loved their babies enough to set their spirit free and to not suffer in our physical world.Just a word from the outsiders here, nothing more, just here to enlighten the whole spectrum.Thanks for listeningIstherehope",

So while you haven't run into any, I can promise you they're out there. Most of them dealt with this condition upwards of 10 years ago and doctors gave them no hope whatsoever. I'm by no means saying that that's everyone's case.And of course I would never suggest that letting your baby go is an easy choice to make and I'm heartbroken that you would take my comment in that context. I'm simply saying that the OB community FOR THE MOST PART has a no hope kind of outlook when it comes to CH. I just feel that termination shouldn't even be brought up until they know for sure. I was offered termination at my very first peri appt....and I wish I hadn't been.

I had to make a decision to terminate or not to and fortunately in a way, God stepped in and took over that part for us sooner rather than later. It's true that alot of medical professionals do post a doom and gloom view but unfortunately it is accurate for a big percentage of the time.

            "answer": "Megan,Please do not take offense as no accusation was intended, as I said I simply wanted to widen the spectrum and to offer a broader perspective from someone who actually lived through the experience.Most women who terminated at least all that I know of have entered into their decision with much anguish and pain. . All went to the fullest extent of diagnostic and genetic\u00a0\u00a0testing and eventually accepted what they could not change and moved forward with the next step. Living with that grief is truly unbearable.I understand your point in regards to the OB community and their \"doom and Gloom\" approach. But, it is their job to inform patients of all the potential possibilities and outcomes. Our Genetic counselor was very supportive, and only when we asked about every and all options did she bring up termination. I get the fact that much much more information and testing should be performed before termination is discussed, my experience was just that, some other Moms had different experiences.Again, it was not my intention to offend you, I must admitt that I was taken aback\u00a0\u00a0when I responded to your first post because it seemed\u00a0\u00a0such a general statement to me and I guess my experience and pain is still too raw. As I've said, I merely intended to shed some light on a very personal, heartbreaking situation. Its unfortunate that all of us have had to consider this option or have it offered to us at some point in time. I wish every mom had a positive end result, but that is not always so.GinaI'm glad that you looked into the web site, it has been an incredible source of strength and support for me. Sad to have you join, but glad that it has helped you out. Take Care.",

            "answer": "I welcome any and all aspects and points of view where this is concerned. I think the reason I was offended was merely because of the implication that I thought women \"jumped\" to termination too quickly. I won't pretend to understand the pain felt by a woman who chooses to terminate a pregnancy because of this. I do however completely understand why one would. If I had been told that my baby girl had no chance, I might have done the same thing. Of course the grief is unbearable and of course these women make their decision with anguish and pain.....what kind of person would I be to suggest otherwise? I'm glad your genetic counselor was supportive, that just isn't the case for everyone. In no way am I saying every doctor, every specialist, every counselor is always worst case scenario.....but some are and I feel that is worth being addressed. I completely understand what is required of them and that they must provide all of the options.....absolutely. I was actually grateful that my peri was so up front with me. I didn't want false hope, I didn't want the \"what ifs\" However, I do wish that he hadn't come out and ask me if I wanted to terminate before I even knew what in the world was going on. I needed time to process the news and to weigh the options before making such a huge decision. I apologize if my statement seemed \"general\" because that was never my intention and in no way was it meant as a disrespect to anyone who has had to make this decision. I was inches away from having to make that same choice myself. Nothing that I posted was meant to minimalize what you and so many other women have had to go through. The fact that I have my little girl proves to me that doctors can be wrong a small percentage of the time. And just because I've had her and she's healthy doesn't mean I've forgotten the pain and fear and utter desperation I felt while she was inside me. I remember it and I remember it well. I still research daily and I'm trying to do my part to raise awareness and money for research.I want this thread to continue to be a place for women to come to when they feel like they're the only ones in the world going through this. I want it to be a place of hope and information as it has been for quite some time now.Regardless, I have nothing but love and hope for you and your entire family....especially you sweet angel. What you have had to go through is gut wrenching and I hope that you're finding peace. You and every woman on this thread are in my thoughts on a daily basis.",

            "answer": "Hi all. I am SO grateful for finding this site, as so many of the stories are by far more positive than on any of the medical expert sites! Here's my story so far..I'm 13+ weeks preg at the mo, at my booking scan we were told there was an enlarged nuchal fold on the baby at the time measuring 3.2mm and that I needed to come back for a more detailed scan in 2wks time. We were led to what we referred to as the \"bad news room\" and left waiting for an eternity. Eventually a specialist midwife came to us and spelt out that there was a very high chance of our baby having downs syndrome or some other chromosomal disorder. She said also if this were discounted then there was an equally great chance of a major heart defect. She advised that there was only something like a 10-15% chance of a \"good healthy outcome\" and without saying so in as many words, advised us to terminate.We booked our scan for 2wks later and set about searching for as much information as we could on the internet-the hospital could give us virtually none, which didn't help matters at all!I had the nuchal scan at 12wks and was told the fluid had now doubled to 6.4mm and was known as a cystic hygroma. Again we were told with much tutting and shaking of heads that the prognosis was dire. \"we can't tell exactly what causes it, how it will affect your baby or whether it will survive\" is what we were told..some help! Unwilling to give up all hope while some still existed we booked for a CVS test 2 days later (last thurs). The consultant warned us our chances of it being downs were one in 4, and of it being any chromosome ab in general prob nearer 60%.Well, the first cvs results came through this morning..clear! I could barely believe it! I know that doesn't mean we're out of the woods by a long shot, as we were told well something is still causing the fluid to be there, and now it's more likely to be a heart defect instead. But, it's one less thing to worry about as far as we're concerned.I'm due to go for another scan at 16wks, which is still nearly 3wks away, to check how things look, and we're just hoping beyond hope that the fluid has gone down at least a bit, I honestly don't know what we will do if it doesn't go. I don't know about you, but I find the constant waiting to be the hardest part, and never seeming to actually know anything! How did you cope day to day, when every day feels like a week? It's the worst torture imaginable. All we can do is hope for the best. In the meantime though, I'm finding some comfort from stories such as yours, a lot of the medical sites are all doom and gloom, but often the mothers' stories of their own experiences tend to be more positive so I'm clinging to the thought that there could also be a happy outcome for us. It's frightening to think how many mums may have felt there was no alternative to termination when given medical advice, when clearly there are more positive outcomes than certainly I was led to believe.",

            "answer": "I'm so so glad you found this thread! First let me say congratulations on a normal CVS test! That's a HUGE hurdle. Do they have you scheduled for a fetal echo yet? I don't want to give you false hope, but the fact that the CVS test came back normal is a great sign. Once you get the baby's heart checked, you'll know more. It's unfortunate that nobody seems to know what \"causes\" a cystic hygroma. I mean, I know it's a delay in the 2 systems, but it's impossible to pinpoint what exactly causes that delay. The women on this board have experienced all aspects of a cystic hygroma. Some stories are good, others are not. But nonetheless, there is so much knowledge among everyone on this board. I completely agree, waiting is the hardest part. Not knowing from day to day is agonizing. Unfortunately, all you can do is wait. I know how frustrating it is....just wanting to do something, anything for your baby and feeling completely helpless. I also wanted to add....try your best not to focus on the fact that the fluid grew between 10 and 12 weeks. I had my first scan at 12 weeks and my baby's nuchal thickness was at 6mm so who knows what it was 2 weeks before that. My baby's CH didn't resolve until 27 weeks, so keep hope. She was born completely normal, with no indication of her condition other than a little excess skin on the back of her neck. I wish I could give you an easy way to get through your days, but I can't. It just *****, there's no way around that. I found myself researching to pass the time. I wanted to know everything there was to know about this condition. Just know that you can come to this board anytime and vent your frustrations....we've all been through what you're going through. I hope our personal stories can be of some comfort to you. It's true that the doctors are right about the prognosis a pretty large percentage of the time.....but there are exceptions, so don't loose hope. If you have ANY questions at all, please post them here. I can pretty much guarantee that someone on this board can give you the answers you need.

So looks like that's something I will have to ask about, thanks!It's hard to stay strong, but my husband and I have decided that now we know ther's no chromosome abnormality to worry about there's no way we're going to terminate this pregnancy regardless of what they find, I'm just going to let nature take it's course and hope for the best, useless maybe, but what else can you do!?

You're right, you don't know for sure until your baby is born. And even then, at least for me, there was still so much worry. I would analyze every inch of her wondering if \"this\" was normal and if \"that\" was okay. I took her in for things that should have been passed off as normal newborn behavior, but I just didn't know with her. I had an echo done on her when she was a few weeks old, just to be 100% sure that she had a good heart. Since then, my worries have died down tremendously.I honestly think research is a great thing to do while you're \"waiting\" For me, I wanted to know EVERYTHING. I wanted to know all of the terminology so that I would always know what my doctor was saying and it also gave me the knowledge I needed to ask good questions. As long as you can keep a level head and are able to take in the not so good outcomes and stories.I would definitely ask about a fetal echo. I mean, I suppose it is just an ultrasound, but it needs to be detailed of the heart and a pediatric cardiologist needs to look at it. I'll definitely be hoping for a good, strong heart:)You're right, hoping for the best is all you can do. I know how much it hurts to feel utterly helpless. Just take it day by day.
