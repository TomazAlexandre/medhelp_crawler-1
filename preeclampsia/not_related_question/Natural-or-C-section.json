Now someone like me that has had this previous surgery done due to me having Preeclampsia, I had to have an cesarean. So , that gave me a better chance of having one this time if I want to .

I have a Very High pain tolerance, that being said I had a c section. First I'll tell you my experience sucked everything was ripped away from me I couldn't hold the baby because you're strapped to a table, my husband couldn't cut the cord I didn't get that immediate son to son like I wanted. It was very hard I couldn't get in my bed (it was too high) I couldn't sit on my toilet to pee my husband had to help me get on and off showering was hard but needed to be done then when my husband went back to work i felt useless and lived off crackers and granola bars because I couldn't stand long enough to cook a whole meal. Then the first week past and I started pushing myself because there wasn't a lot of pain anymore and I wanted everything to be perfect and my stitches came back open... so my doc put me on bed rest which didn't stay bed rest but it was an awful experience... I am due in dec and I am praying for a vbac I want my \"reward\" after the rough 9 months. Sorry for such a long response but I don't know anyone who would opt for a c section unless its better for the baby. You could get an epidural if you want pain relief.",
