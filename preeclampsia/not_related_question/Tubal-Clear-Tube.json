            "answer": "It happens sometimes.The biggest \"sin\" in ectopic pregnancy management is failing to diagnose them before they rupture, and the woman dies.\u00a0\u00a0So it is inevitable that occasionally someone will be taken to surgery when there is not, in fact, an ectopic.There are some signs on ultrasound that may also be suggestive of ectopic.\u00a0\u00a0These can sometimes be subtle and open to interpretation.There are also physical findings on pelvic examination that could have made the doctor suspicious of an ectopic.I'm not saying he did everything right, and its a shame she had surgery when she didn't have an ectopic....but if she had actually had one, and it was undiagnosed, ruptured, and she lost her tube or even her life (yes, that does happen)...that would be absolutely unforgivable and tragic.He also may not have said \"the baby was ok\".\u00a0\u00a0That's what your SIL told you he said.\u00a0\u00a0I've been present in the room many, many times when a doctor has explained something carefully to a patient, only to hear them give a completely different rendition to someone immediately thereafter, on the phone.\u00a0\u00a0 It happens all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Its just natural for people to condense a doctors long, drawn out explanation into a shorter sentence.\u00a0\u00a0And that sentence may not be at all what the doctor said.Whats important is that she doesn't have an ectopic, and that her HCG levels will be monitored and another ultrasound done, and this is perfectly appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0 If she is not happy with his care, she should find another doctor while continuing to investigate the viability of this pregnancy.I wish her the best, and hope everything works out ok.",

            "answer": "I would agree with you....however, I got more details today. This girl exercises every day and eats very healthy. She has visible abs, and a flat stomach. She sent me a picture of herself that she took on her camera a few hours before surgery. She looks 3 months pregnant! She has a huge pouch out front now. My ex-doctor told her that her abdomen was not expanding due to the baby, and that she needs to watch what she eats and exercises!!! Her abdomen is sore to the touch and she says that it really hurts. Something is CLEARLY not right, so I told her to get a second opinion. She got back wednesday for an HCG check and another ultrasound, and if nothing has changed by then, she is getting a second opinion.I would not be 100% shocked that Dr. Fabulous told her the baby was okay, because he is the same doctor that looked at my mom and I, laughing, and told us if I got preeclampsia he would terminate the pregnancy!Something is CLEARLY wrong here, and I just hope they can figure out what!",

    "question": "If anyone remembers back when I was pregnant with Ashtyn, I had a MORON for a doctor. Who also happened to be Rubyolivia's doctor! Here is the story: My sister is law found out she was pregnant about two weeks ago. She went on Thursday to a women's clinic to get a \"conformation of pregnancy\" and was told that she was 7 weeks pregnant based on her last period. Well, she thought she was only three or four weeks because she has irregular periods. Anyways, Saturday night she was having cramps and went to the hospital. They sent her by ambulance to a different hospital, where she went into the care of my ex-horrible doctor! She was told her pregnancy was a tubal pregnancy after they failed to see any thing on the ultrasound. SO, doctor wonderful took her into surgery to clear the tube. When she wakes up, he tells her that her tubes were clear and that he thinks she is only 2 or 3 weeks pregnant!!!! He told her she is defiantly pregnant and it is not a tubal, although nothing is seen on the ultrasound. Her HCG level is 1800. Has anyone been told they had a tubal, just to find out you didn't? She was told to come back wednesday to have her HCG taken again and have an ultrasound, but the doctor has told her that her baby is \"okay\"....although he can't find a baby at the moment? Anyone gone through anything like this?",
