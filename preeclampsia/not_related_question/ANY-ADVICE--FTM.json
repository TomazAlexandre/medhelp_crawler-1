            "answer": "My girlfriend had really swollen feet/ankels towards the end. We called them 'Fswankle' Fat Swollen Ankels. I think it's quite common so don't panic. My girlfriend used to soak her feet in really icy cold water & it helped but I think you need to see the doc asap if you are that uncomfortable.",
