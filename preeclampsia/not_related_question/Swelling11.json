            "answer": "A lot of swelling, especially in the lower extremeties is due to the increased pressure on the circulatory system. This is one of the reasons why women suffer for carpal tunnel during pregnancy as well.\u00a0\u00a0Being as I am on pregnancy #8 my ligaments don't hold my uterus up as high as most women and therefore I have a ton of pressure on the nerves and veins below my pelvis.Swelling is something that needs to have a watch kept on it.\u00a0\u00a0Combined with other symptoms such as swelling in the face or protien in the urine it could be a sign of preeclampsia or threatened preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Any time you have swelling you should mention it to your OB just so they can keep an eye on it and watch for other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Swelling on it's own however is not usually an indication of something being wrong.",

    "question": "Who is experiencing swelling?\u00a0\u00a0I noticed last Thursday my toes hurt to bend and when I took my flip flops off I noticed that I had marks on my feet from the straps. I soaked my feet in an Epsom salt bath and went to bed. By morning my feet were fine and I noticed that when I put my flip flops back on they were loose but about two hours later they were tight on my feet and my feet were tingling.Every day since I have had tingling in my feet and sometimes I look at them and there purple. My ankles aren't swelling just my feet. I've been doing epsom salt baths every night in my foot spa with massage.I've also had pain in my fingers when I bend them the joints hurt. I think I'm gonna call my Dr tomorrow.I've been keeping my feet elevated any time I am sitting. I'm so glad that Friday was my last shift at the bar I guess I timed that just right.",
