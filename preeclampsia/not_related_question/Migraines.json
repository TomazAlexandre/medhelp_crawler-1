            "answer": "So I've had my 3rd debilitating migraine in 3 days. I went to my chiropractor for an adjustment & afterward, he wrote me a doctors note & insisted I go home & rest. I will be going back tomorrow for a massage & another adjustment.I feel like pure crap & don't understand why all the sudden this is happening. My ob & gp docs never know how to help except for prescribing pills & I don't want pills! I'm not comfortable taking all sorts of things while I'm pregnant. I don't want to look at son in 20 years & see damage from pills prescribed as supposedly \"safe\". Urgh! Soooo frustrated. Just want this to stop so I can try to enjoy the remainder of my pregnancy.",

            "answer": "I recently saw a relatively simple way to relieve bad headaches. I'm not sure if it works but maybe it's worth trying? The way to do it is put your hands & feet in water as warm as you can tolerate & place a bag of frozen peas on the back of your neck. The idea is to draw the pain out of your head & into & out of your extremities.It caught my attention because when my 16yr old gets a headache, otc drugs do nothing for him. I will have him try this next time, figure it can't hurt & it's a drug free option.",

            "answer": "Sadly migraines are really difficult to treat in pregnancy in the same way the contraceptive pill causes them, the pregnancy hormones do too. They slightly affect the way your blood vessels in your brain dilate and I'm sure your docs would love to rid you of your headaches but sadly a lot of meds aren't safe/recommended.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing I can think of apart from trying to avoid triggers, if there are any you know, is to totally avoid getting dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes actually being over hydrated can help break a migraine (although it's very difficult to drink when you are nauseated/vomiting).\u00a0\u00a0I know you don't like drugs but some of the anti nausea ones help break the migraine too and help you be able to stay on top of fluids and although no drug\u00a0\u00a0(apart from water) is proven 100% safe, your doctor will not give you anything that is harmful or untested in pregnant people!If the chiropractor helps you relax /get pain relief then great.\u00a0\u00a0Accupuncture may too?",

    "question": "I'm just about 32 weeks, 35 years old & pregnant with my first baby.I got a migraine yesterday & thought that the iron supplement I started taking was to blame, but I haven't had it in 2 days & I got another migraine again today. I do have a history of migraines, but mine are \"complicated\" & have been this way since I was 10 years old & no, I'm not having a stroke. My symptoms are loss of vision, sometimes have major confusion, numbness in my hands & sometimes face, then typically the pain sets in.Before the past couple days, I hadn't had a migraine in months & months! I even visit my chiropractor weekly.I wonder if 3rd trimester hormones are playing into it, but my doctor didn't really have an answer.....I had a doc appt today.Is there anyone out there that has had trouble with migraines during late pregnancy? Was there anything that helped stop migraines? I'm so open any suggestions because these things are horrible.",
