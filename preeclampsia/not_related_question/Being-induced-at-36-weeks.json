            "answer": "I was 26 when I was pregnant for my daughter and was induced at 37 weeks (Ultrasound Tech made error and caused panic but she was perfect). It was HARD.\u00a0\u00a0I started induction on Friday night 8pm with cytotec insert. Went in Saturday 4pm for second ctyotec dose..labor realky started about 730-8 I walked ALOT finally went to hospital abput 1030 and water broke at 11. I was admitted and started on pitocin sometime early am. I finally delivered at 353pm on Sunday. I've heard that being induced hurts more because pitocin makes contractions worse and \"dry\" labor (long labor after water break) is bad/extra painful, I survived both without an epidural. I'm now 32 and due in November so we'll see how it goes the second time around. I'd love to do natural agian basically because recovery time was minimal but who knows- That's my story hope it helps!",

            "answer": "Due to me having gestational diabetes and high protein in my urine, both the OB and high risk doctors were concerned about me going 40 weeks. They decided to induce me at 38+6 so I wouldn't develop preeclampsia. I went to the hospital that night (38+5) and cervidil was inserted to help my cervix soften. The next morning, they took it out, started me on pitocin and later broke my water. My contractions were as though I was already dilated at 10 so by 3, almost 4 cm, I got the epidural so I would have a little bit of time to rest. My contractions were coming back to back. I pushed for 2.5 hours and that was with the help of the OB using the vacuum on my son. I was in labor for a total of 13 hours and 24 mins, once pitocin was administered. Oh, and the pitocin made me gassy. I am going to be honest. :) Good luck and best wishes!",
