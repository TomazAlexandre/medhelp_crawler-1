            "answer": "It's too early for you to have the baby. Although the baby might be measuring large on the outside, on the inside baby's lungs still aren't fully developed. Being born too early can cause issues such as improper latching with breastfeeding, low birth weight, respiratory illnesses, increased risk of SIDS, to name a few issues that can occur. It's tough\u00a0\u00a0for all of us mama, but you won't be pregnant forever. Hang in there:)",

As frustrated and miserable as I am the new standard for a full-term pregnancy is 39 weeks, and I want my bub to be as healthy as possible. The chance of baby having complications before 39 weeks is very high. Please think of your baby, you've supported this little life this long just a little longer. Its worth all the s**t in the end. Good luck dear.",
