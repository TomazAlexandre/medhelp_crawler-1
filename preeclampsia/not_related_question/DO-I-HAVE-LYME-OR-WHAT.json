    "question": "FINDINGS: There is symmetric focal T2 hyperintensity and restricted diffusioninvolving only the splenium of corpus callosum. The brain is otherwise normalin signal intensity on all pulse sequences. No hemorrhage, mass effect,extra-axial collection. The basilar flow-voids are present. The calvarium,skull base, craniocervical relationships, and visualized extracranialstructures are remarkable for mild mucoperiosteal thickening and polypoidchange in the paranasal sinuses.IMPRESSION: Isolated focal abnormality in the splenium of the corpus callosumis quite unusual in a patient without known history of multiple sclerosis,traumatic diffuse axonal injury, or status epilepticus. Consider drugtoxicity, transient metabolic derangement, encephalitis or ADEM, PML, rareneoplasm, or hypoglycemia. Doubt hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or posteriorreversible encephalopathy in the absence of known preeclampsia/eclampsia.MY SYMPTOMS ARE TINGLING, PRICKLING, ELECTRIC SHOCKS, WEIRD EYE ISSUES LIKE GLARES, A BLACK SPOT.
