            "answer": "I know some women bleed right before the start of labor. It tends to happen when the cervix begins to dilate. Did they check to see how many cm you are? I would rest and take it easy. As far as shaking and your headache, did they check your blood pressure. Preeclampsia may be something to have them look for if they didn't already. Personally I would go back but it's up to you.",

            "answer": "Did they not test the blood? When I had a bleed at 39wks they took some and it was from the placenta as it was shutting down. Not saying thats where its from because I'm not a doctor. Do they think it could be the start of a bloody show? Some women have this before labour starts?x",
