            "answer": "I feel yah! 21 weeks pregnant and not one dr has seen me yet. I have to see a midwife who knows nothing. I say that truthfully. I have suffered from severe nasal congestion for almost 6 months and had to see my regular dr bc I was told by the midwife I basically had to suffer. Thank Goodness I went to my Drs.bc they put me on allergy meds and Im so much better. How many other obgyns do you have around you? I would have to drive an hour to see a new one. Still debating it bc its my fifth pregnancy and I shoot my babies out quickly!",

            "answer": "I agree with alid32. The fact that you have a strong family history of preeclampsia, and you are experiencing high BP with headaches, it would raise some concerns in my thoughts. I would definitely be looking into a different doctor/midwife if you're not satisfied with your current treatment. I would express your concerns to the new doctor and see what their opinion is. It never hurts to get a second or third opinion in cases like yours. From what you're saying, I would be concerned too. I wish you the best of luck mama.",
