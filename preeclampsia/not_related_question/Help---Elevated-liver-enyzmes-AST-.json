            "answer": "Hello - thanks for asking your question.As you know, there are many reasons why your liver enzymes are elevated.There are conditions during pregnancy that can elevated liver enzymes, chiefly preeclampsia or the HELLP (hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Preeclampsia is a form of pregnancy-related hypertension - the HELLP syndrome is seen as a more severe form.\u00a0\u00a0Elevated liver enzymes can be seen in either disorder.However, delivery of the infant should decrease the liver enzymes in these cases.\u00a0\u00a0There are times where it may present after delivery, but in most cases this occurs within 7 days.Another consideration would be acute fatty liver of pregnancy or intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (impairment of bile excretion).\u00a0\u00a0Both of these diseases can present after delivery.Non-pregnancy liver diseases should also be considered.\u00a0\u00a0This includes hepatitis, hemochromatosis, gallbladder disease, any medication, autoimmune disorders or hepatic steatosis and an associated condition, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).A good place to start would be an abdominal ultrasound to image the liver and gallbladder.\u00a0\u00a0Tests for hepatitis, hemochromatosis, and autoimmune disorders should also be performed.\u00a0\u00a0Liver biopsy should also be considered to give a definitive diagnosis.It is unlikely that your liver is failing.\u00a0\u00a0The tests I mentioned above will give further evaluation of the cause.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Thanks,Kevin, M.D.",

            "answer": "I agree with the doc. I had GB stone attacks during pregnancy, and 3 weeks after having the baby, I was rushed to the ER with non-stop vomiting, and pains in my lower chest/upper abdomen. Needless to say it was WAY worse then labor, and I thought I was seriously going to die. I had 4 attacks within the past 4 months. I got the ultrasound in the ER, and it was a stone in the bile duct. My enzymes were also elevated greatly.\u00a0\u00a03 weeks after the surgery, I was rushed back with another attack. Huh? I didn't have a GB, but I had stones floating around that got lodged again. I had an endoscopy and that was that. it's been two months since my GB removal, and I feel pain still, and I can't eat anything. My nausea has dimminished, so there's a plus.",

            "answer": "To the experts\u00a0\u00a0 ;0)I too had a relatively uneventful pregnancy except for severe itching in the last two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I had no rash, no GI pain, no jaundice.\u00a0\u00a0The first set of liver enzymes was WNL, so my midwife attributed the itching to something else.Then on the day of delivery, my Blood Pressure was elevated. (up to 170/104)\u00a0\u00a0the labor and delivery were VERY quick and the BP went back to normal immediately.\u00a0\u00a0But my Liver enzymes were elevated that day.\u00a0\u00a0(AST 53). 6 weeks post delivery it was 48\u00a0\u00a09 weeks post delivery it dropped only to 44.\u00a0\u00a0(ALT is also slightly off).\u00a0\u00a0I have had absolutely no symptoms since delivery, only continually elevated enzyme levels.\u00a0\u00a0I am getting an abd. US. this week.My question is, does this sound like Intrahepatic Cholestasis, or something else...? And is it unusual for enzymes to stay elevated post-delivery for this long?\u00a0\u00a0Do HELLP, ICP, and Acute Fatty Liver ever cause permament damage?\u00a0\u00a0And if they do but I continue to be asymptomatic, what are the long-term effects of these slightly elevated levels?Also, what is the likelihood that these problems will reoccur in subsequent pregnancies?",

    "question": "I am a 40 year old female who gave birth in January.\u00a0\u00a0I just found out that my liver enyzmes are elevated.\u00a0\u00a0My AST is 39 and my ALT is 88.\u00a0\u00a0I am very concerned to say the least, worried about liver disease while caring for a newborn.\u00a0\u00a0My cholestrol was 237 and my LDL is 150.\u00a0\u00a0All other tests were normal.\u00a0\u00a0I waited 2 weeks and re-did the tests and they were in the same range.I have had maybe 10 drinks in the past year. Previous to that I drank once a week (3 beers) I don't take drugs, only sinutab a few times a month and am still taking prenatal vitamins.\u00a0\u00a0About three years ago before being diagnosed with fibromyalgia I had all sorts of tests done including hepatitis B & C which were all negative, and normal liver enzymes. I doubt I could have contracted it since then.\u00a0\u00a0I have no tattoes or piercings either.I am totally stressing since I can't see my doctor until Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0What tests will they do - am I having liver failure?\u00a0\u00a0Is this commom in pregnancy?\u00a0\u00a0Should I stop nursing my baby?\u00a0\u00a0Please help!",
