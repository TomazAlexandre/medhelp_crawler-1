I didn't want it and it did make my back hurt for about 4 to 6 months. I could barely carry my little guy around the house. I'm praying for a natural birth this time.",

            "answer": "I had an epi with my first and her birth was so calm and relaxed. I never had any complications or back pain afterwards. My second i had an epi again and that time they knicked my spine. Just barely so It didn't bother me at time and again i had a pain free labor. However i was very slowly leaking spinal fluid and by the end of the week I couldn't even set up and had to go to the ER and get a blood patch done. (They shoot a little bit of your blood into your spine to stop the leak) after that I was fine and no back pain. My third baby the epi didn't work. I don't think he got it close enough to my spine. They tried another one a few hours later and it didn't work either. Natural child birth was the most painful thing I've ever felt. Nothing calm or relaxing about that birth or labor!",
