            "answer": "Well I am now at risk for preterm labour. It's been a rough 2 weeks but we are still hanging in. Last week I woke up to having contractions and spotting. The contractions were staying a steady 15 minutes apart but the spotting stopped within the first hour of waking. It then began again a few hours later and stopped within a half hour. I saw my doctor the following day. I was still having contractions but they were irregular. He confirmed that they weren't just BH, unfortunately. My water hasn't broken though which is deffinately a plus. I am on watch though and luckily, haven't been put on bed rest as I haven't dialated at all. But we can only pray that baby stays put for another couple months.Other than that though, baby is doing good. She is estimated to be 3 1/2 lbs already which is amazing as I have only gained 12 lbs this pregnancy so far. So my doctor is happy and is hopeful.",

            "answer": "Hello ladies,Im 70 days today!!!!!! Ten weeks, ten weeks, cant wait!!!! This weekend Im going to get her furnitures, Im so happy. Dont know yet when I will have baby shower, oh well.Yesterday I had app with sugar doc and Im doing fine, my sugar is under control, diet works so far and hopefuly will stay this way, the I had app with midwife and everything looks OK. Due to GD and some blood cloth on my placenda I will have another US in few weeks, Im so happy about this. I will be able to see how is she growing. This month will be very busy for me, next weekend is Easter, then I will have one weekend off- probably I will be doing something in my back yard and the following one will be my sons firt communion. Just after this the guy is coming do our floor in living room and kitchen so my house will be a mess for a week or so, my DH will put new cabinets in the kitchen and I will be ready to go to hospital!!!!I was scarred when they told me I have GD because very often they need to do C section and I dont know why Im so scared of this. I had my son with epidural and it was so good, i want have it again. Its puting less stess on mother and a baby. Nsrchofbaby- dont worry, tell them u are thinking about epidural so they will keep this in mind and they will ask u if u need it when the time will come, u always can say no. Midwife will know when they will be able to give it to u, its ussually about 1-3 hours before the delivery when the pain is the worst and when your body is ready to start pushing soon.Lissyloo- u can choose if u want have epidural or not (of course here, in Poland where Im from u can forget, they will not give u unless u will pay- big money). About doc and midwifes its your choice, if u have no problems u can go to midwife, if there will be any medical concern she will be not sure she will contact with doctor otherwise they are able do the whole pregnancy. I have a midwife- for few reasons, they have more flexible hours then doc but my friend she has a doc, she had in-vitro and she has a twins so a doc needs to really care about her. Durning the deliver (of course depends from hospital as well) there is ussually only midwife, doc come if there is any problem. When my son was born there was only midwife, doc came when my water didnt brake, she took care about this and left, she came back few minutes before my son was born, thats it.Good luck to all of u, keep in touch.I cant wait to hold my little girl, smell her and know she is OK.",

            "answer": "Lissyloo - We actually do get to choose whether or not we get an epidural or other form of pain medication unless there's a medical reason why we shouldn't. I think I'm definitely gonna try to tough it out as long as I can and hopefully I'll be able to make it all the way through. If things get to be too much, I'll probably ask for the epidural. I really hope that you aren't diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes, it's a tough road to take. It's worth it, but definitely difficult. I remember crying several times the first week on my new diet because it seemed like everyone was eating cake and cookies and all the good stuff and I couldn't. But now I'm amazed at how easy it is for me to say, \"sorry I can't have that.\" As far as travel goes, only do it if you feel 100% comfortable. Oh and I hope you have a blast on Saturday!!! :)bryanarae - I'm so sorry that you're going through all this during a time that should be happy and stress-free. But you're a strong girl and I'm sure you will do whatever is necessary so that your little one is nice and healthy. I will keep you in my prayers and hope that the little one stays in there as long as possible so that you don't have to deal with any complications at birth. Be strong and take it one day at a time. As far as weight gain goes, I've only gained 4 lbs to date and my dr doesn't seem worried at all. I'd gained 6 but then lost 2, I guess because my GD diet really sped up my metabolism. Anyhow, it sounds like your baby girl is doing really well. Take really good care of yourself to ensure that you're both healthy the day you finally meet. :)Kisstin - Your first delivery sounds like it must've been a nightmare! Awe, I'm so sorry you had to feel all that pain. But I'm sure all that seemed like a distant memory as soon as you met your little girl. It's good that you have a plan ahead of time for this delivery and that you kind of know what to expect. Hope this one runs a lot more smoothly. I think my main fear with the epidural is the needle itself. I hate them!! But for some reason I feel I've been really brave now that I'm pregnant, I've even watched my techs draw blood where before I would start crying and give myself a fever...LOL. Well I hope everything goes well for you through delivery and good luck on June 17th! :)asia4 - Exciting, exciting, exciting! I remember feeling that exact same way when I hit 30 weeks! It's kind of like you're finally on the homestretch. It sounds like you're gonna be extremely busy these next two months so they'll probably go by a lot faster for you. That's awesome. My husband and I have been discussing the possibility of getting the epidural to make labor a more pleasurable experience, I don't think my hubby wants to see me crying and in pain...LOL. But I also want to see what it's like to go all natural. So I guess we wont find out until that day. I'm so glad to hear that your GD is also under control, it actually means that you're less likely to require a c-section due to a large baby. So just keep at it and hopefully everything will go well for you through delivery. Good luck at your ultrasound, can't wait to see the pics!!! I'll be having another one in about 2-3 wks as well just to see how the baby is growing. I hope I get pics this time. I haven't gotten a pic since my first ultrasound! Well, good luck and keep in touch! :)We're almost there ladies, soon we'll be sharing baby pics with each other and hopefully we'll all remain this close and get to witness each other and our children grow. Take care.",

            "answer": "I'm 29 weeks 3 days as of Friday the 3rd April. I haven't had a GTT done on me yet for my risk of gestational diabetes. Strangely enough, it's not compulsory here in Germany, I only get it done if I request it, which I might do, since my little girl is measuring quite big, but they may also be because her father is big (and he was a big baby 9.5 lbs born with a big head auch!!!!).Regarding the birth, I'm really relaxed about it, it's my first child. If I can do a labour birth, will go for as long as possible without painkillers, I do believe your psyche plays a big role in pain. Am considering a water birth, but will definately like to use a tub in between.It's getting even more difficult to sleep as she is also quite active my little gymnast in there and she is fussy, doesn't like it when I lie in certain positions, then she protests a fair bit, which is rather cute I have to admit.I have been seeing a chirotherapist regarding my twisted pelvis, the pain has unfortunately come back so I will go again to see him soon, and hopefully this treatment is reducing my risk of having a c-section.The baby bed will come today or tomorrow, she will be staying with us for the first year, can't imagine leaving here on her own especially when I breastfeed. I will be working until start of 34 weeks and then the German law doesn't allow pregnant women to work, but they can if they want. I get paid full maternity leave from 34 weeks onwards until 8 weeks postpartum.Good luck to everyone ;.)",

In one hand I want that happen tomorrow in the other I have so much stuff to do!!!!I dont know what is going on but all my bad symptoms came back- back pain, stomach problems, yesterday I thought I will end up in the bathroom!!!! Oh well, couldnt bo too good- right? And the worst is that sudenlly my sugar went high yesterday, was over 135 after each meal. Hope this was only one day thing and will not repeat.Idivecch5- u will be a good mom dont worry. I remember when I came back home with my son (8 years ago wow) and sit in my bed, I started crying, I didnt know anything, I had a problem with feeding him, changing, everything. I thought- Oh God what now??? I dont know how to take care about baby, I didnt have anybody there, my mom was in Poland and my ex-husband turned to be a jerk, not helping at all. All the time tired, sleepy, not sure if doing the right thing and guess what? my son is fine and he thinks he has the best mom in the world (well this is TRUTH!!) even with the pink hair (I just color my hair and instead get nice blond color I have something what is between pink, orange and strawberie). Now 8 years later I will have a baby again and what? Im scarred again if I will be a good mom, if I will know what to do and this fear its the same, not smaller.About epidural- I want one too, I had with my son and I want with my girl. Its true what they saying- happy mother happy kids. If u will be happy your baby will be too, baby can feel your paind, happines, everything. If you will be relaxed and happy so and your baby and remebr this. If any time in your life u will need to make any choice, any decision think first about yourself, as long you will be happy your kid will be too. I learend this in hard way but it was worth it.",

I think I would love to have all that personal attention. My dr's not too bad though, I always see him and only him.zazou - First off, I am so sorry you had that horrible fall yesterday! Is everything okay with the baby? And how are you feeling? I can't imagine dealing with all the little pregnancy pains plus a fractured wrist! Also, I think it would be a good idea for you to request the GTT just to make sure that your baby's size isn't attributed to uncontrolled GD. This could later lead to breathing problems with the little one and other medical complications at birth so it's just better to play it safe. Oh, I think I'd like to move to Germany, your maternity laws rule!!! LOL.ldivecch5 - Awe, so your baby will be very blessed at birth having two big sisters already. I think I'd like to have at least one boy and one girl but who knows? I'm hoping for two but I guess we'll see what my husband and I decide on down the road.asia4 - You're getting closer...exciting!

But I do have some updates--I will be 29 weeks tomorrow.I had my Gestational Diabetes test last Tuesday and do NOT have it--thank goodness. My number was 86 and the nurse said that was quite good. My Iron is good, and I was measuring 29 weeks. So a few days bigger, but not much.I also got my RhoGam shot since I have A- blood.I went and got a 4-D ultrasound which was amazing! If you havent done this, you really should! It is SO much neater than the 2-D. It looks just like a real baby! lol I mean I know it is--but it LOOKS like it with the 4-D, instead of looking like a skeleton the way it does on the 2-D. I felt so much more love for it, seeing it as a tiny real looking newborn!I did NOT find out the sex--though it is on the DVD. I turned away while she recorded that part! It yawned and it was SOOOO darling!! It was laying its head on the placenta like it was a pillow. lolI am feeling alright, just very tired. But what can I expect---being pregnant at 38, with an 18 month old toddler, and six other children too! ha ha ha",

I find that if you flex your muscle (point your toes towards your tummy instead of straight out) it passes really quickly or you can avoid it altogether. You can usually feel these cramps coming on so next time just flex your calf muscles right away and hopefully you wont have to wake your partner up for a massage and comforting. LOL.Jenny100 - I'm so glad you don't have Gestational Diabetes, it really is hard. I'm thinking about getting the 4D ultrasound done too, hopefully soon. I can't imagine how great it must be to see what your little one looks like before it arrives. I can't wait. Glad all else is well with you! Take care and keep in touch. :)",

Hope all of you are doing well and preparing for the arrival of your little ones, we're oh so close to the finish line!!! And then comes a new beginning. Hope to hear from you soon. :)My update:I am currently 31wks 1 day along, feeling good, coping with my Gestational Diabetes, and getting anxious for my little one's arrival! I had a dr's appt today where I was informed that because my GD was under control, my risk for a larger baby was greatly reduced and I'll likely make it to full term. What a relief! I am getting a little nervous, I must admit, with the thought of finally becoming a mommy and all the responsibility that comes with it. I guess I just want to do all that I can to give my daughter a better life and raise her the best we can. Another thing I keep thinking about is the actual labor. To have an epidural or not? Will things run smoothly? Will I even know when it's time? All these thoughts can become a little overwhelming but then I think of the big picture which will hopefully be a healthy child, and all my fears subside. We're almost there, we're almost there, we're almost there!!! I'm hoping everything goes well for every single one of you ladies in the weeks to come. Let's stay connected!",
