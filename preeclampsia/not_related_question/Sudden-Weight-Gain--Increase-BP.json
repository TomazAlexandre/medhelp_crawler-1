I've had them since I was 16 but being pregnant made them worse and I can't take the Excederine Migraine that usually gets rid of them. I found on the internet that migraines are normal during pregnancy but there's one thing that worries me about what you say about the swelling. I don't know what would cause swelling. You should go to the doctor and get evaluated. Good luck to you.",

She said it sounds like it is just a result of me being on my feet all day and retaining fluids (when I got to the clinic you could leave finger prints in my legs).I'm normally a small person (weight wise) I'm 5'10...It just bothers me that they're pushing it off as working too much.

This morning I had slight swelling in my hands and around my eyes. I also found some shock when I stepped on the scale and gained 4 pounds since yesterday. Being that I work at a small clinic I did a Urine test on myself which showed 100+ protein and 100 Glucose. I also normally run 107/60 for BP and was at 130/83. Of course the clinic wants me to come in\u2026however, I\u2019m at work until 8pm tonight and 8-8 tomorrow. Anyone go through anything similar? Thanks ladies!",
