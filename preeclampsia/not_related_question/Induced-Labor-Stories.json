            "answer": "I was induced at 39+1 due to gestational diabetes. Went in on a Monday they gave me cervidil (gel inserted to help thin and dilate ) for 12 hours. It did nothing so they tried pitocin and that gave me some contractions but No progression. So they tried the cervidil again for 12 hours and it dilated me a fingertip so they started potion again and that did nothing. Got sent home for a day came back on Friday started potion again gave me small contractions and I was only dilated to a 1 so at 440 they prepped me and I got a c section. To be honest c sections aren't as scary as you think they'll be. The before you go in part is but the actual procedure No. Not trying to scare you just informing you of possibilities",

            "answer": "My induction was horrible. I got induced becuase I was border line preeclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0I was 39 weeks. Anyways I got to the hospital at 7 am on March 14 they started me on cervidal for 12 hours, checked me at 7 pm, then put another one in cuz i was only dilated 1 cm. So after another 12 hours they tried to put this balloon thingy in between my cervix and my sons head to help me dilate more. It did not work, only hurt me cuz the doc couldnt get it right. So they decided to do pitocin. I was on pitocin for a day and a half. They finally decided to break my water and that's when I started getting contractions that hurt really bad so I got the epidural. About 4 hours later they check me and say that I was 9 cm and I can start pushing.. well I did for about 30 mins and the doc said that my son had the cord wrapped around him, so they rushed me into the OR for an emergency c section. I was in labor for 60 Hours... it was the worse exexperience ever.. I went through 12 bags of IV water and by the time I had him my whole body retained all of the water. It was horrible. I was bigger leaving the hospital than coming in. I was in the hospital for 6 days... 3 of them were labor and the other 3 were postpartum. I went through a lot. I think it would have been a lot better if I had better nurses.\u00a0\u00a0I am pregnant with my second boy and my doc said that I will not be getting induced because I had a c section. I am sure yours will not be like mineSo please don't worry too much. I don't know anyone that has ever went through what I did lol. Everyone I know their labor and delivery was easy.",

    "question": "Mommies who had their labor induced and weren't dilated at all, how did it go ?\u00a0\u00a0 And what was the reason why you had to get induced ? I might get induced because my blood pressure was pretty high today 140/100. I have to go back Wednesday and my Dr said even if it's a little high he wants to induce me. I'll be 37 weeks Wednesday and I'm not dilated at all. I wanted to have an unmedicated labor but if I get induced I think I won't be able to handle it. I'm really scared ;( i wanted my baby to come when he was ready.",
