            "answer": "My platelets are ok. They have put me on labetalol which has my BP under control at the moment. I have no major swelling . I had the same thing in my last pregnancy and was induced at 37 weeks because my BP remained high even with the medication but my LFTs just slowly kept creeping up. This time there seems to be a massive difference over the course of a few days. I am just worried as i'm not seeing anyone for another week and i don't know if its dangerous for me or the baby.",

    "question": "Hi i am 35 weeks pregnant and have had problems with my blood pressure. Recently my LFTs have become abnormal. On the 01/09/09 my AST was 28 and ALT 52. It was then retested on 07/09 and AST was 163 and ALT 285 and then again today 12/09 AST 234 and ALT 418. All my blood results were normal and they scanned my liver and said all looked ok. What do these results mean? The hospital said they will retest me again in 1 week and see what is happening.Any help would be greatly appreciated",
