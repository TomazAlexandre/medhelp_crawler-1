            "answer": "I feel like I am reading my own story. I too found out I have a bicornuate uterus when I first got pregnant back in March. I've had multiple ultrasounds previously but it was never noticed. As far as my doctor tells me, it is hard to detect and some women won't know until a doctor is performing surgery or a c-section for a breech baby. I too lost a baby at 19 weeks that had an severe giant omphalocele ( this is so bizarre that both of us have both unrelated things - and that one has no bearing on the other). I am again pregnant (like you) but am 14 weeks along with the baby\u00a0\u00a0up in the right horn. My doctor is considering me high risk but also says that many women with a bicornuate uterus deliver happy healthy babies, we just have a higher rate of early delivery and/or the need for a c-section due to the baby being breech. As far as where the baby is implanted, as long as it is not on the septum, things are generally good (it wouldn't get enough nutrients to support growth). And as far as carrying, only time can tell how big your \"half\" of a uterus where the baby is will stretch before it says, time to have this baby. I'm still in shock to\u00a0\u00a0be reading your post. Please keep in touch and let me know how things go and how your doctor handles your situation. But we do have good chances of carrying healthy babies.Shelley",

Ihad a test called hysterosalphingogram or hsg for short. they run a radiopaque dye into your reproductive system. When I was pregnant with my son, i lost him at 19 weeks. Don't know why, there's was nothing wrong with him. any way i went to the complications clinic at UAB and they told my he was implanted midline, not in a horn. they said that was good. but i still lost. I'ts been very hard to deal with this. i alos have ahd a hard time getting pregnant. ususally taking at least one year to concieve, however this time i haveonly had 2 periods since my last miscarriage in aug. now I'm 5 weeks and praying that God will bring this child forth in spite of my uterus. I'm sorry you having to deal with this. most stories you read on the internet are not good. i stopped reading them. like shelley said though, there are many many women who go on to have healthy babies.

I have made it farther than my doctors ever thought I would make it.

However, my second and current pregnancy is going great. I am 34 weeks pregnant today. My baby is in the right horn which is obvious if you look at my stomach. The right side of my stomach protrudes out much further than the left side. My pregnancy has had some complications(i.e., spotting, contractions, bedrest) but through careful screening and 400mg of prometrium daily since my 5th month of pregnancy things are going better than planned.For all of you who have a bicornuate uterus, do not give up hope. I have made it farther than my doctors ever thought I would make it. My baby's weight has been estimated through ultrasound to be over 5 pounds.From this point on whenever he decides to come he should do great. I will keep you posted on my progress. I just felt compelled to share my good fortune and offer hope to others with this condition.",

I'm almost 24 weeks... ihave had no problems at all with this pregnancy.... so don't give up. lot s of women have healthy babies with normal pregnancies... a bicornate uterus is a birth defect... when you were foeming in your mother you 2 body halves fused so to speak and came together... like your lungs and heart and all that... but your uterus didn't. this what one Doc told me... he seemed to know what he was talking about.. and it's the only answer i have gotten. It can be repaired... with surgery... but it's major major surgery and my current Doc spoke with a specialist and he wouldn't do it... so i jsut beleived God to have this baby and he's the One who creates life anyway... so i jsut bypassed the Doc... yours could be a septum or bicornate... an MRI is the only way to really know for sure...and hsg cannot determine which one it is only that's it's split. if it is just septate... it s very easy to fix and will be outpatient surgery!! Of course mine wasn't... but anyway i don't think youcan tell by the size of the split... but i could be wrong...jsut don' t give up... Hope",

My daughter was 17 years old when she had a miscarriage,had yet another miscarriage and they discovered she had a bicornate uterus. In her case, the babies never developed a heartbeat and her hormone levels continued to drop,so they did a chromosone test which came out okay,they told her it would happen when the time was right. The third time she became pregnant, she had made a Dr. appt to get the Depo shot and they did a sonogram ( she has several fibriod tumors ). The Dr then said to us, \"gee, I don't know how to tell you this, but you're 51/2 weeks pregnant. See, there's the heartbeat. She was so terrified at that point of losing another one that she would not even acknowledge the pregnancy for fear of losing it with no explanation. The result was a breech birth C Section at 34 weeks of a beautiful baby girl. She needed to learn to breathe a little bit on her own, but she was very healthy. That is the only thing she has to worry about is breech birth and prematurity, but medicine is advanced enough today, that although it can be scary, you don't have to worry too much.",

            "answer": "When counting your pregnancy, remember that doctors are likely counting that 5 weeks, 4 days from the beginning of your last period, not the \"event\" that lead to conception.If you have two complete uteruses, the term is generally called \"uterus didelphys\". Here is how the Mayo Clinic describes it:\"In a female fetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes. As the fetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ \u2014 the uterus. Sometimes, however, the tubes don't join completely. Instead, each one develops into a separate cavity. This condition is called double uterus (uterus didelphys). Each cavity in a double uterus often leads to its own cervix. Some women with a double uterus also have a duplicate or divided vagina. Double uterus is rare \u2014 and sometimes not even diagnosed. According to one estimate, double uterus occurs in 2 percent to 4 percent of women who have normal pregnancies.\"It happens very early in the womb. Often, there are some other issues associated with it too, which include kidney or gallbladder (?) issues, so you might want to have the checked out.It's a pretty rare condition (it's more common to have a bicornate uterus -- one uterus divided into two, rather that two seperate ones). It does come with some possible complications -- c-sections are more common 'cause the babies have little room to mover around and are often breech; sometime preterm labor. The uterus has an amazing capacity to stretch, so it's even possible that everything will go completely smoothly. I have the same thing and had one perfect little boy and am expecting another in April.Good prenatal care is essential -- especially if your little one might come into the world a little early -- so make sure you get into your dr asap, tell them of your diagnosis, and start taking the prenatal vitamins.Hope that help.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!\u00a0\u00a0And don't worry, you have a rare condition, but there are a lot of people out there with the same thing!",

I just find out today by an ultrasound that I have a bi-cornuate uterus involved by 3 fibroids. I went to the doctor, because I\u2019m having all the symptoms related to uterus fibroid and that\u2019s how I also find out of my heart uterus. I\u2019m 37 yrs old and it seems having a baby it is not a good choice for us right now.I have learned that under God wills is the best way to live. And even when I\u2019m a little scare I also feel his blessing and that a good purpose He have. I'm confident that everything is going to be fine, so therefore what ever happens I just wish is under God will!!I pray the Lord to provide:all of us with the wisdom, courage and peace we need;our husbands with the strength and patients to encourage us, cause it is also difficult for them;the little angels that are about to come with the health and life they all deserve; andour doctors with the wisdom and kindness to treat us for His Only Glory!!!Most of you in this forum have already given birth to your babies; I wish you are all in peace and good health.We should all embrace life by giving Our Life testimony to others.God Bless You All!!!",

I was complaining of severe back pain in the tail bone area.\u00a0\u00a0I went back to my obgyn and asked for an u/s to check on the baby but he just said it was scheduled for the next week, and sent me home, I could hardly walk b/c my contractions hurt so bad, I went back to the hosp the next day, I was in full labor, actually, I had fully dialated to a 10 at home and by the time I got to the hosp, I was ready to push, my obgyn broke my water, but no baby was coming out and by that time I was about to jump off the table from labor pain, they FINALLY did an u/s and discovered he was breech, so I had to have an emergency c-sec.\u00a0\u00a0I was disappointed but our son was feet first.\u00a0\u00a0He was a 35 weeker and weighed 4 lbs and 1 oz.\u00a0\u00a0No problems exceot jaundice and couldn't regulate body temo to room temo so he was in the hosp for about a month.\u00a0\u00a0No developemental delays.\u00a0\u00a0He did have increased tone (tight muscle tone) so he had occupational therapy for a couple of months and he was fine.\u00a0\u00a0walked and crawled at reular times.\u00a0\u00a0I got pregnant 7 months later w/ our 2nd son and my water broke at 29 weeks, I had to stay in the hosp a week and by the end of the week, my placenta started to tear loose so another emergency c-section, we were already expecting that.\u00a0\u00a0So he was a 30 weeker and weighed 3 lbs 14 oz.\u00a0\u00a0No problems except for jaundice and not being able to keep body temp at room temp, so he had to stay in the hosp for almost a month.\u00a0\u00a0No developemental delays.\u00a0\u00a0That same obgyn recommended we not try for another baby for about 5 years to allow my body to completly heal, well, oops!\u00a0\u00a0we got pregnant again about 2 and 1/2 years later with our 3rd son! and I switched obgyn's b/c I didn't think the last one was doing all he could to check for pre-term labor fluids or enough u/s to make sure of the position of the baby, well our 3rd son was born at 37 weeks and he weighed 5 lbs and 9 oz.\u00a0\u00a0No problems except for a tiny bit of jaundice and he pretty much kept his bodt temp at room temp, so she went home with me.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am pregnant with our 4th baby.\u00a0\u00a0I am only 13 weeks so we don't know the sex yet but we are hoping for a girl.\u00a0\u00a0I am also hoping for a vbac.\u00a0\u00a0I am not able to use my last obgyn but I am hoping my new one will be ok with it.\u00a0\u00a0I hate the epiduar/spinal block so I am really going to try to weigh my options.\u00a0\u00a0I do have lots of scar tissue from the three previous pregnancies and I have not lost the weight from my other three pregnancies, but I am pretty much healthy, so I am going to attempt a vbac.\u00a0\u00a0I just know that I was told I would never get to be a mom and now look, I have three healthy boys and another on the way, I did bleed with this one a little but it stopped and was a lot less than my first pregnany.\u00a0\u00a0 I do know that women with bicoruate uterus' are higher risk then others but only slightly, do your research and weigh your options and talk to your obgyn to do the same, then make sure you are a good candidate for vbac. Sorry for such a long story, just thought some one out there might like to know they are not alone and having healthy babies with this type of uterus is posible.\u00a0\u00a0God bless you!RM136",

The only two times I have gotten pregnant, then at 17, and now at 22, I cast the same fertility spell, and both times only 2 months after I cast them, I found out I was pregnant. Many people don't believe in what I believe in, but from all of the tragic stories, pain, and suffering I have heard from the other beautiful women who have the same issue, I feel this was absolutely some kind of divine intervention. I feel that no matter what faith you carry in your soul, as long as you have faith in something, and you always try to be the best person you can be, things will work out as it should. We must all go through trials and lessons of life, but it is all well worth it when we hold a new born life in our arms, and to feel how amazing it is to know that you created that life.

Long story short... we instead found out that (1) I had suffered \"missed abortion\" (miscarriage w/out knowing); (2) I had been pregnant with identical twins; and (3) I had a bicornuate uterus. We were crushed, and I was scared b/c my sister's friend has a b/c uterus and has miscarried numerous times.

            "answer": "I am 39 and pregnant with my first at 35 weeks and live in the UK.After one m/c 2.5 years ago at 9 weeks they discovered a heart shaped uterus. Had tests (USG, MRI) which confirmed \"no septum\" which was relief for me as I would have been terrified re waiting for surgery on a septum, hence glad it was a \"truly\" b/c u.At 9wks I had some spotting then at 13+4w a threatening of miscarriage, with blot loss of about 500ml, clots, heavy cramps and a 7x4 cm haematoma which looked to me like a sac, light red (not dark like a clot) smooth and round with a small blue vein on the outside - I was in shock! Hospital staff said \"it was just a clot\", but I am still not 100% over this trauma, it could have been a twin or an empty sac. Anyway it came from the \"other\" horn area though it was close to the pregnancy. Baby's heartbeat remained and still nicely embedded in its horn, apparently the left horn (seen from my perspective). After 6 days bleeding was gone to spotting and I was back home with bed rest. 10 days later more bleeding, about another 200ml blood I guess and then everything settled - the embryo survived! I was 16 w by then, and the doctor explained possible scenario quite well to me.Anomaly scan at 20w showed no problem, they also checked the placental blood flow, all fine. NB - my partner and I are generally quite healthy.Then every single week was passing very slow and after 25 weeks I started to believe I might actually have a baby.The pregnancy (on the left/my left) grew oddly with one horn higher than the other but the right horn kept growing too as baby was swinging from one side to the other especially when I was turning over overnight.Now at 35 wks there is only a small dent left on the top, a quite painful area, but other than that it seems the cavity has def developed a large heart shaped uterus - only the small obstruction on top. Baby keeps changing position still and I still have sufficient amniotic fluid (they gave me growth scans). So all seems fine, despite some discomfort re baby's position/pressure during most of the time as it's been lying a lot transverse - head and feet poking against my sides!!!I am glad I had so many scans to re-assure the health and growth of the baby, its enough to worry about knowing you have a b/c u, so everyone keep pressing for scans as they usually do put your worried mind at ease!!I've been scheduled for a CS at 37+6 weeks but may have to attempt labour if baby went head down again and stayed head down.It's been awfully confusing as to birth options (meanwhile I want a CS to save me traumatic labour trials) and I am not happy that there's a high chance I might try labour, labour fails and then emergency CS, BUT I keep going back thinking its more important that the baby made it this far, despite the prognosis of \"early\", 35 weeks is fine already with maybe 2-3 more weeks to come!!!! I feel happy about this achievement also as I was given corticosteroids at 28 weeks, which, again, eased my mind, so ladies, keep asking for steroids for the baby's lung development which are given between 26-28 weeks for women with risk of pre-term birth!!!My partner's and my disbelief is about 90% gone now - it still seems unreal but great we made it this far.But I think having been able to STOP WORKING after the bleeding and having had bedrest and recovery gave the baby the best chance in this pregnancy, so you might have to ask your partners to support you in many ways as you should TAKE IT EASY. Don't rush back into work if you had bleeding etc and put your feet up.I am still a little worried about uterine atony and the possibility the uterine might not contract properly if labour was upon me but I found this and - in my case - there is hope the uterus may still contract 'evenly', who knows... see an article here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&Cmd=ShowDetailView&TermToSearch=1346607&log$=activityHowever now I am more worried about PPH as I lost so much blood at 13-16 weeks trickling on and on and I was anaemic afterwards and left with super low blood pressure of 75/35 at times, I was close to passing out!What a traumatic start, with a quite dark outlook even before the second pregnancy, but with an end which already takes a good shape!!!! The remaining fears... I will distract myself with by looking forward to cuddling a little squirmy monkey in a few weeks to come!!!Head's up to all who suffer from the problems with a uterus malformation - have courage - it might turn out better than you think or than you've been initially told :-)Caroline",

It was the hardest thing i have ever been threw in my life when i went back for my 6 weeks checkup after having him the doc said i have a cavity in my uterus and said all my babies will be breech and i will need to have csections with them all but never mentioned a bicornuate uterus i just found out i had this typeof ueterus a week ago when i went for my first visit im 14 weeks pregnant. I go today for an internal ultrasound to see where the baby is in the uterus and i was told im at high risk of having another baby born permature but so far everything is going good like it was with my son until i was 32 weeks then i had him but hes a happy healthy boy and very smart.\u00a0\u00a0im so lucky keep up with your hopes",

Anyways....I too have a bicoruante uterus and only one ovary...mine was diagnosed at a very early age....b/c i had my one ovary removed at 3 months....so based on the hospital report...my ob knew at 18.....i have a healthy 4 year old boy who i carried to 37 weeks....yes he was footling breech and i had a c-section...but he was 8lbs 2oz....and the pregnancy was great. but prior to that , i did have HSG and a laprascopy to remove my septum so it wouldn't \"get in the way\". I had one very early miscarriage 2 years ago (4 wks) and i just recently had another one at 10 wks...but i had to have a d&c and asked my ob to remove any scar tissue that I might have from either my c-section or my lap. Try not to be scared....i know once you read on the internet...it can scare you to death....but it truly is okay...one think i have learned is that you have to be your bigges advocate or cheerleader w/ every doctor, specialist you see....don't be afraid to ask questions, get second opinions and seek out other options.

After being scared and told to fear the worst, I was being induced because she stopped growing because she ran out of room, luckily I was 38 weeks, she\u00a0\u00a0went breech during labor so we did an emergency c-section. She was 5 lbs and prefect, not a thing wrong.. I got prego again..an oopy when she was 9 months old with my son, the pregnancy had zero complications and he was 7 lbs, he was in the bigger side so it was problem free... well now I am 7 weeks with my 3rd, I will say I have zero problem getting prego, one time without protection and im pregnant, anyway I have never have a miscarrage I am always scared about it, hoping this one is good and baby is on bigger side again...and another thing, my pelvic kidney has 2 uriters..wierd..and it becomes enlarged during pregnancy, they thought it failed but it is still going strong..have yours checked out!",

After 3 weeks I had gotten and ultrasound and had some shocking results. One was my bicornuate uterus but I also learned I had a tumor in my right part. Another thing we found was I was born with only 1 kidney (left) and is double the size of a normal kidney. My doctor says everything is okay but I'm only worried about my bicornuate uterus. I'm young still and I know its a good thing that they found this but just the thought of it makes me worried. I'm glad that I can read all of these posts and to know that many women can have healthy babies and that gives me hope that it is possible. Thank you.",

            "answer": "I know that many of the posts on this thread are rather old, but I thought I'd leave some positive words on here for anyone who has this condition and is concerned.I have a bicornuate uterus, which was discovered in 2007 when I was pregnant with my first child. Naturally I was freaked out at first and when I researched online, everything I read scared me. One thing you should know is that this condition isn't always detected. There are many different variations one can have and it's difficult during pregnancy to tell which one someone has. Thankfully the technician doing my first ultrasound is well trained and noticed it. The main concerns with this condition is pre-term labor, which can occur if the baby runs out of space to grow...this can signal your body to go in to labor earlier than you should. The other issue is you're more likely to have a breech presentation because of the unusual shape. This puts you at a higher chance of getting a C-Section. With my daughter, she was breech so at around 35 weeks my doctor decided to go ahead and schedule the procedure and told me if she somehow turns then we could cancel it. She didn't turn though. She was born very healthy and I didn't have any pre-term labor. My doctor was able to closely examine my uterus during my C-Section and confirmed it is heart-shaped.For those of you who don't know, the cause of this type of uterus is something that happens when you are developing in your mother's womb. The uterus doesn't fuse into one whole piece and therefore you can have a split uterus or other types of variations. It is also common to have kidney anomalies. I was checked for that sometime after my daughter was born but thankfully everything there is normal. I wasn't aware of a connection to gallbladder problems, but I did have my gallbladder removed my last year of college, so I will have to ask my doctor about that one.I became pregnant with a second baby in March of 2011 but miscarried at almost 10 weeks. This was not related to my uterus, but appeared to be more of a developmental thing. When I had my first ultrasound early on, I was measuring only 5 weeks, 5 days and should have been 7 weeks, 7 days. A heartbeat was detected, but it was rather low. I had to come back 2 weeks later to repeat the ultrasound but there was no longer a heartbeat. I lost the baby about a week later.Currently, I am almost 30 weeks pregnant with my second child (third pregnancy) and she is very healthy! She is even head down last time they checked, so I may be able to pursue a VBAC, although I'm having doubts about it, as much as I'd like to avoid another C-Section. She is measuring weight-wise exactly what she should, heartbeat is strong, and everything appears to be perfect.I just wanted other women to know you are not necessarily doomed if you have this condition. I was considered high risk during my first pregnancy because they couldn't tell much while I was pregnant, but this time around I've been treated as a normal pregnancy. I've also read on here where people have asked what happens if the baby is on one side, how will they grow? I asked my doctor that same question the first time I was pregnant. I was told that the side the baby is on will push into the other side and take over. So if your baby is on the right side it will continue to stretch and grow like it should and will just make the left side very small. I think you are more at risk for pre-term labor if you have a large baby, but it really just depends on the person.I have had no trouble getting pregnant, as all 3 times I conceived right away. Each person's situation is different, so it's hard to compare your situation to others. Try to keep a positive attitude and take care of yourself. Good luck to everyone who might be reading this.

I've never been pregnant or tried to have kids (yet) but I was having unrelated pains in the vaginal area and so got myself checked out by my ob/gyn. Well, ultrasound showed the uterus was split. The doctor didn't seem too concerned, she said whenever I'm ready to start having kids I would have a surgery done to remove the septum dividing the uterus. Then, they would put in this balloon type thing that would prevent the septum from growing back but remove it in time for conception. (Who knew this thing could grow back, I guess it thinks it's a fingernail!) Since I'm single and prefer to be married when I have kids, she didn't want me to have the surgery now, again because the septum grows back. So, while I have not gotten pregnant or had kids yet, don't let a bad doctor tell you that you will not have kids, you need a great doctor and sometimes, faith...sorry if I sound preachy:) Good luck to you all, you're all amazing!",

Everything was seamed to be fine and my doctor never said even one single word that something is not normal. I have no idea whether he did it on purpose to not make me panic beforehand or not. I was due mid February and in the middle of December I came to his office with preterm contractions, he gave me IV with some fluids and I went home. I had these contractions every single day from that day on. After I believe 34 weeks he told me that the baby is breech and he might try sending me to the specialists who will take him and turn him with their hands! It didn\u2019t feel like something I would look into doing, I was afraid to hurt my baby, so I refused and he scheduled a c-section on 38 week. Forgot to mention that my stomach looked weird right side was sticking out lot more than left. But it didn\u2019t seam to bother my doctor. During the c-section I was told by doc that I have this bicornuate uterus and my baby had the umbilical cord around his neck 4! times (probably while trying to get to the right position he almost chocked himself poor thing!). Doctor was very surprised I was able to have this healthy (thank G-d) child. What bothers me of course is why the doc didn\u2019t see anything during ultrasound?! And what\u2019s more important for me now is that my son is 18 month old, I am 31 and would like to have at least one more child, but my doctor said that there is a risk if the next baby ends up in the \u201cwrong\u201d side that is obsolescent (underdeveloped) it can burst at some point of baby growth and we both can die. So my question is if anyone at all had or has same situation and what doctors say? As much as I want more children not only I don\u2019t want to die but also I don\u2019t want my son to grow without me!",

    "question": "I am 6 weeks pregnant and just found out I have a bicornuate uterus. This has been confirmed by 2 different physicians after 2 different ultrasounds, one being a level 2 ultrasound. What they didn't tell me is how severe the split of my uterus is. Is there anyway to diagnose whether the split is partial or complete via ultrasound, maybe 3D? Will my chances of having a live birth be lowered if it is a complete split? What I find particularly odd is that I was pregnant before and had several ultrasounds where nobody noticed this. I had to terminate that pregnancy at 14 weeks due to multiple anomilies (omphalocele, neural tube defects, others). I was told that the baby had no chance of survival. How could they miss the fact that my uterus is bicornuate? One last question: does it matter where the fetus plants itself in a bicornuate uterus? Mine is in the right horn, but they did not say how far up.\u00a0\u00a0 I have done tons of reading on this subject but have not found answers to these questions.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much for you help. I just really want to know what to expect!",
