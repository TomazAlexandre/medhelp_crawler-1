You're at your due date so go for it. I have to be induced this time around because my last labor was less than 3 hours start to finish and they are afraid of me having the baby at home or something like that. I was nervous about it too, but I did tons of reading up and now I'm okay with it.Good luck either way and be sure to keep us posted. BTW I can't believe you're at 39 weeks where did the time go??",

            "answer": "Not every induction ends up in c-section but you definitely are at a higher risk. I would try to go in with the hopes of them trying to let you do things as naturally as possible (in the sense that you don't have to use a ton of drugs right off the bat).They can dilate you, then sweep your membranes. Wait a few hours and see if contractions become stronger. Then they can break your water (ask them to hold off on the Pitocin because breaking your water can bring on STRONG contractions). After about 3 hours they may start the Pitocin if you're not progressing.It is proven that laboring while standing (rather than lying in a bed) can shorten your labor and reduce your chances of having a c-section. So even if they break your water you can get up and walk.",

The Dr was debating a c-section (but the or was full for a few more hours) I had such a hard pregnancy she really wanted me to deliver naturally so they stopped the picton and tried again the next day.The next day they started the picton again, I still did not have any contractions so the Dr broke my water. Contraction started IMMEADITLY. I had said i wanted an epidural, after just 1/2hr i started complaining of pressure. So they called for an epideral and were told 45 minutes and they called for the Dr to come (she was in clinic) I watched the clock for 45 mintues and said when it was up....they told me i wouldn't be having an epi...that it was time to push anyways. Had a hard time delivering, he was face up, and I ended up with a seperated pelvis.",

    "question": "Hi ladies!\u00a0\u00a0So, I'm 39w3d and my due date is Monday, the 20th.\u00a0\u00a0I was just checked today and I have not started to dilate.\u00a0\u00a0I am effacing (didn't say how much).\u00a0\u00a0My husband's job was jerky about him taking (unpaid!) time off to be at home with the baby and I for bonding and taking care of us.\u00a0\u00a0They made him give 2w notice and he had to put the due date as the first day off.\u00a0\u00a0SO, whether I have the baby or not on Monday, he'll be here with me...Tuesday, Wednesday ETC.\u00a0\u00a0Last week my doctor and I talked about if I went a week late he would induce me...well today I asked if he would be agreeable to doing it before a whole week was up and he said, yes because the baby was full term and I would be past my due date on Monday.\u00a0\u00a0SO he started to tell me that he would admit me on Tuesday night, give me some cervadil (I think that was the name) to dilate me and then check me in the morning on Wednesday...he said it may or may not work!\u00a0\u00a0If it didn't work, he'd try a few other things and there was still a chance that those may not work and he'd send me home till Monday and then if Monday came he'd try to induce me all over again.\u00a0\u00a0He also said that there was an increased risk that I'd end up needing a c-section with the induction medications.\u00a0\u00a0This scared me as well as the thought that these medications *might* not work!?\u00a0\u00a0He told me it was easier to schedule me for an induction and have me cancel it than to call back later tonight or tomorrow and then ask to be scheduled...he said he had a lot of April Mom's who were near or past their due dates.DH is asleep...I have no one to talk about this to...I'm nervous/scared...I hope I am making the right decision...I know ultimately it is ideal to let the baby come on their own but I feel so torn about the whole work situation with my husband.I'm going to see if my MIL will take me for a walk...I thought I was starting to have contractions maybe last night but I guess not...my lower back was having crampiness so I thought that maybe something was happening =(The doctor did say, not to give up hope because he could come on his due date...what happens today doesn't mean anything for what might happen tomorrow or the next day etc.Any advice or encouragement?!",
