            "answer": "Yeah those bps you listed are in normal range so i wouldn't worry about it normal is around 120/80 I'm a medical assistant doctors will tell you that you are borderline high if your above 140/90 that means your at risk for other serious conditions and they will start treatment to lower it but you'd have to have more than just one or two high blood pressure ratings to pose a concern with your doctor and mrsmartinez is right your bp will get a little higher than normal during pregnancy bcuz your pumping more blood through your body at a faster rate bcuz now its also going in and out of your baby's body too and plus worrying about your bp being high will raise your bp so try not to worry about it too much :)",
