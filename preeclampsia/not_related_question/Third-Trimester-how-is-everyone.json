I still have 13weeks left and it is seeming forever.. but other thann that I am great and my lil man is so very active I love it. he likes kicking me and when i put my hand he will kick again and kick again to cute.. its like he is wanting to play around in there with me haha.. I dont get anymore u/s my ob/gyn said it wont be necessary. so I only got the 10weeks and 12weeks and then the anatomy scan at 17weeks and nothing after and I just wish I could get one to see how big my lil man is and to see head down or what you know. but she said no I will most likely not get a u/s again. so im am really bumbed about that..Bny I am sry you still have the sickness and vomitting. I got very lucky this pg I havent had much of nothing just a belly getting bigger and thats it .. but with dd I was awful hehe but well worth it for what i got a beautfiul baby girl!!! Good Luck",

            "answer": "I'm also unlucky and the sickness has stayed with me. I am fine as long as I take what I call my miracle tablets in the morning. Without them I go straght back to continuous vomiting. I'm not showing very much in comparison to others but the baby is growing well.I have preexisting high BP but so far (fingers crossed) no preeclampsia on top but with this and history of hyper thyroid activity I am getting monthly scans. On one hand I wish they didn't need to monitor me as each month I get ancious that maybe my baby hasn't grown enough but on the other hand I love getting to 'see' the baby each month. I go this week for my checkup at 29weeks and will then most likely go to 2 weekly checks.I'm expecting to have a planned c-section however there has been no talk sofar about actually setting a date. I'm sure that would make it all more real and iminent!We need this a bit, since I am not that big it really feels like we have a lot more time however it is only 10weeks! We only just bought a crib and haven't even started working on the baby's room or bought anything at all!Otherwise the biggest hassle is the lack of sleep (why does the little bub choose to kick so much when I am trying to sleep) and peeing ALL the time (which also doesn't help the sleep either!).",

            "answer": "Sounds like we're all on the same home stretch!I haven't felt this good since before pregnancy. I feel like my hormones have leveled out some and I'm not a lunatic anymore.My baby boy is extremely active. Sometimes he distracts me in class and keeps me from falling asleep at night. But I'm not complaining!Husband is in Afghanistan so I've been working on the baby room by myself little by little. It's painted, crib and bedding done, changing table in place. I bought a glider but haven't had anyone to help me get it upstairs. Also, waiting on help putting of a wallpaper border. Other than that... just waiting for his arrival.7 months sounds really far along but 3 more months feel like forever. I know it will fly though. My dr thinks he will come early because I'm so small and he's measuring right on with dates. I certainly don't have a problem with that.Good luck to everyone!!",
