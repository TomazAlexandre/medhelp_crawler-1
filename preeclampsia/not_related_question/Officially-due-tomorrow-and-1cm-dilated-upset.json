Stress can actually be very counter-effective when trying to induce labor.What things have you done to try to help your body go into labor (such as sex, walking, etc.)? Did your doctor sweep your membranes today?",

            "answer": "Yeah, once baby drops a little, their head will help efface you (by grinding on it- sorry, not the best word to describe it but that's how I envision it). Effacement is really what helps get dilation going.Even if you can't walk much I'd definitely do some walking, especially up and down stairs. You could also try doing squats. It is believed (not sure if this is medical or not; someone can comment on it if they know) that sperm helps soften and dilate/efface the cervix. So it might be worth it to try, especially if you really want baby to come!",

I never went to term with my pregnancies, but I remember how uncomfortable I got just before I delivered my son at only 36 weeks.There are some \"home remidies\" you can try. Its said that eating pineapple can start labor. Walking, squats on an excercise ball, SEX... thats a big one!! JoyRenee is right, sperm can cause cervix softening and contractions, and orgasm causes contractions too. I'm sure you can find even more ways if you google it... a word of advice though... I WOULD NOT try castor oil!! I had a friend that was desperate and drank some... no labor but she was in the bathroom all night with HORRIBLE cramps and well... you know...Best of Luck to you!! Hope that little one comes soon!! Let him/her know that they are being served an eviction notice!! LOL!",

I'm not ready!! LoL I am frantically doing dishes, laundry, cleaning, and packing before I call the doc.\u00a0\u00a0(Of course, I also had to take the time to check in here, hehe.)

I was 1 cm for weeks, I had my son 2 days before I was \"due\" but it turned out his gestational age was 41 weeks, so he was actually 1 week overdue. I wouldn't wish the end on anyone. It is so uncomfortable! =(Hang in there, and I had crazy sex at the end.. I don't \"know\" that it helped, but the sperm does do something, I am not sure what, I can't recall and I dont want to misinform you, but it definitely does something. I could barely walk either, so I did as Joy mentioned, walked up and down my stairs..Again, hang in there.. I think they come when they are damn well ready.. The end of pregnancy is awful and uncomfortable, but just keep your \"eye\" and thoughts on the prize!((hugs!))",
