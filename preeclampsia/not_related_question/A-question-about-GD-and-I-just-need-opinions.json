            "answer": "I am guessing they want to check your a1c levels just to be sure your glucose does not spike when you are not aware of it. Sometimes your body will just do that and its not food related. Did the doctor say it will be a c-delivery, and did he say which week he wanted to do it in? I just got diagnosed with GD,(not officially, i have dr. appt tommorrow) so I am not sure of the course of action, but I know keeping my glucose as close to normal as possible will be what I will have to do.. good luck!!",

            "answer": "my doctor did the Hemoglobin A1C test too. they\u00a0\u00a0did it at my second appointment for the diabetes before we were anywhere near regulated with my insulin. they told me if there was an issue they would call, but nothing, so i guess it was fine. i am so jealous of you. i was told i could have glyburide, then given insulin. :(i'm losing weight now, but the girls are still growing. i have 5 weeks and 2 days to go and have gained 30 pounds. but i look like a house. it's crazy. since i have been on insulin, for whatever reason, my preeclampsia seems to be less of an issue. i saw an ankle bone yesterday, i swear!tomorrow we are going to the maternal fetal medicine doctor to get them weighed in again. they were little \"bruts\" last time according to the doc...so you can imagine the nerves. that was a month ago when they were 4.6 and 3.13. before i got my GD diagnosis...actually the day i took the 3 hour test. lol. ben thinks we'll see 5 and 6 pounders...one last thing before i go on any more....my doctor says they will not let them get too big, they'll do a c-section before i have two 8 pound babies. i hope the GD hasn't made them too big!",

    "question": "Has anyone's doctor, who has GD, ordered a A1C blood test on them? I know they are commonly done if you have regular diabetes, but I never thought that they were really done with Gestational Diabetes. My OB said he wants to know how my blood sugars have been running the past 8wks or so. I don't have a problem with that and find that completely understandable. However he isn't treating me with insulin and I'm just now getting my glyburide regulated so..... I'm just wondering what he's going to really want to do if the test turns out not so good??.... I mean he keeps talking about admitting me for GD and stuff. It's driving me crazy. I don't want to hurt my daughter, but I am soooooooooooo tired of being hospitalized this pregnancy. I feel like just leave me in peace for the remainder of the 2wks I have left and give me time to get things in order. I still have a couple of things to buy and her room to straighten up. I feel so NOT ready! I'm sure you ladies understand that!Plus the one time he admitted me for GD I felt like they fed me hardly nothing. I was always hungry there and my blood sugars stayed low so they let me go after 1 day.Thursday I'm having a u/s to measure her weight. She has always been on track for her length, but her weight has ALWAYS been 2wks above average even before I developed GD. I don't know if I should be worried that the GD has had a significant impact on her weight now.As Sept 14th starts getting closer and closer I'm sure I will have lots more questions!I just needed to talk and vent and get opinions.... since I really don't think I've posted in a bit. Thanks in advance for any response.",
