            "answer": "oh hunny tell ur doctor why she wants to induce you? and if its nit serious do not do it. if she says babys to big or your babys running out of space that's ********. crap. when you get induced they inject pitocin in u. which is oxytocin. oxytocin is something that kick starts labor. you get oxytocin by beibg happy laughing or feeling love. thats y they say have sex because it releases oxytocin which will help kick start labor. The. difference is pitocin is not natural its a drug which cause you to have serious beyond painful contractions. Compared to normal contractions. this their usual induction cycle. pitocin epidural c section. I'll explain the pitocin causes u to have serious pain then you get the epidural because it hurts ten tines worse then normal natural labor once you get the epidural your contractions or dilation slows down. So they inject u again with pitocin. which causes more harder contractions that may or may not put baby in distress. or open (dialate) you at all if you dont dialate or ur babys in distress they will automatically give you a c section to save your childs life after they forced your labor and put u in that situation. Do not get induced your baby wilk come naturally god made your child conform to your body and yoy will go into natural labor in can take uo to 42 weeks but ur baby will come. Only get induced if u have preeclampsia or other super serious health issues. do not let them scare you. Also if you do go and get induced and not listen to my warning then i might as well help you out. Do not let them give you misoprostol( cytotec) they will say its to thin out ur cervix. this is nit fda approved and can kill your baby and you or cause a uterine cervix\u00a0\u00a0hemorrhage. its category x and they do give it to moms even though they should not. Now when you start getting contractions push lil by lil with each or almost each contraction this helps YOU to dialate and labor will be faster also hold off on an epidural until ur at a five or a six in dialated and continue to push lil by lil so they dont give u a c section ok",

            "answer": "^^^ I agree with 99% of what she said. Induction isn't natural and probably more painful. But I dnt agree with it ends with a c section. There's sooo many things that can happen for you to end up having a c section, induction or not. I was induced with my first and it was smooth. I got my epidural at 3cm and it didn't slow anything down. It happened to speed it up! 4 hours later I was ready to push and did it in 26 min without any problems. My cousin who went in labor naturally at 41 weeks ended up with a c section Bc she wasn't dilating and her baby heart rate was dropping. Every woman's body is different. What worked for me, may not work for others and vice versa but dnt let people tell you induction makes you have a c section bc that's just not factual or EVERYONE would end up with one. It can happen anyway. Good luck. Get some sleep the night before",

            "answer": "^^^as for the c section im stating only for the majority of people who get induced i don't mean everyone. but the majority of induction labor do end up in a c section. and as for dialating you must help ur child push out so u dont end up with a c section most woman dont noe thinj that once labor starts automatically they will dialate they do but it takes forever and heart rate dropping etc is not accurate those machines are not always accurate so u stress a freak out for no reason. and get cut open when ur child is fine. push ur baby out at every or almost every contraction and u will dialate fast i swear by that ive told so many woman and all births were natural and super fast but like i said induction in the a majority of cases goes the way i described some people are lucky or farther along. my SIL was only 38 weeks was induced for 17 hours she was barely at a 3 they told her that in seven hours when the doctor came back if she wasn't open they were gunna cut her open. During this time she was ony getting pitocin no epidural. so my mom told her get yr epidural then told her to start pushing at every contraction when she reach an 8 3 1/2 hours later she was crowing and by the time the doctor came after three pushes my niece was born the doctor was in shock",

I wasnt induced for any medical reason, just a personal one. I went to my 37 week appointment, my Dr asked if i wanted an induction, i said yes, she came back into to the room 5 minutes later and said you can go in tonight at 8.",

I was induced 3 days after my due date with my second. It was miserable. I was in the hospital for 2 days before I actually had the baby, via c-section because I couldn't push him out. It was the worst experience ever.",

            "answer": "Oh and I will say that women who induced, especially first time moms, have a higher chance of ending up with a c-section. It doesn't always happen though. I did mention that mine ended up with a c-section but it was not because I was induced. My baby was 10lbs 8oz an not even positioned quit right so even if I had went into labor naturally I still probably would've had a c-section.I just hated that because of the Pitocin they give you they make you stay hooked up to monitors and stuff so I couldn't get out of bed. The contractions were so much more painful than the first time and it' was such a long process.",
