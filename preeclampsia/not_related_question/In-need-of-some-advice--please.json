            "answer": "Possible preeclampsia, I would get into see the doctor to get that ultrasound. You really should have stayed regardless, I know that can be hard sometimes but the doctor wouldn't have wanted you to get one if he didn't feel concerned about something. Call them tomorrow about getting the ultrasound done asap! I hope everything comes out good & you start feeling better!",

    "question": "I went to my doctor today in hopes of asking him to write me off of work early. I work, a lot, and lately it's been just extremely exhausting. I get home after work and I'm having Braxton Hicks, heart palpitations, seeing stars, getting headaches, everything. I went today hoping he'd get me off work. They took my vitals, my blood pressure was 146/94. They asked if I'd been feeling okay. I told him what I had been feeling. He then walked in the hallway and told his nurses to get me a same-day hospital ultrasound for \"excessive fetal growth\". :/ but he didnt tell me much. He asked that I stay a few hours for the ultrasound but I couldnt. My head is still hurting, I know it's my blood pressure. What could any of this mean?",
