            "answer": "I think that Neevo is also given as prenatal during normal healthy pregnancies as well. The only difference between it vs other prenatals, is that it provides folic acid in a different form. I have a condition where my body is completely unable to process folic acid, which causes significant complications during pregnancy. So the Neevo is good for me because it gives my body the folic acid in a way that my body can use. I also like it it because it doesn't upset my stomach the way other prenatals did. 7 weeks, today... so far so good! Congrats and good luck with your pregnancy!",

Apparently neevo skips the 8-10 week period that most vitamins have and go straight to providing your body with the vitamins you are needing.",

I have been taking it since 8 weeks. Everything has gone well and I have had no problems taking it. I did talk to a pharmacist today when I picked it up ( I got it filled at a different pharmacy) She recommended taking it with lots of water, and an empty stomach. She also recommended that I did not lie down until 30 minutes after taking it. I have been taking it when I get up in the morning..so I luckily have been following directions- but I had not been told this before. Good Luck and have a great pregnancy",

            "answer": "Neevo contains the active form of folic acid, what most people's metabolism turns folic acid into prior to use.They test for the problem by measuring the homocysteine levels in a person's blood, because the active form of folic acid changes homocystein into methionine in the folic acid metabolism cycle.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't metabolize folic acid, your homocysteine levels rise and you run out of methionine.In addition to miscarriage, the inability to metabolize folic acid caused by MTHFR (genetic mutations that are hereditary) is associated with spina bifida and other neural tube problems, preeclampsia, neurologic and psychiatric disorders, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel & bladder, Acardiovascular disease, stroke, Parkinson's, Alzheimers, and autism spectum disorders, so it is a big deal to take your Neevo, even after pregnancy, if you have this mutation.",
