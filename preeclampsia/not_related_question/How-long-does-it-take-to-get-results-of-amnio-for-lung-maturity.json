Since you are doing yours the day of I would imagine that they can get the results very quickly the.\u00a0\u00a0This would be a good question to ask your doctor and I would even ask if they plan on making you wait in the hospital.Wow, August 8th you are due after me and I can't have my c/s until August 11th!!!!!",

My dr is giving me steroids at 34 weeks just in case, since I had preeclampsia last time.Also, I would speak to the doctor about doing the c-sec the next morning. My c-section was at 5 PM and it was torture going ALL day without eating or drinking anything. I didn't know I was having the section that day until my dr called me at 8 AM, so I hadn't eaten since the night before.\u00a0\u00a0I know it doesn't sound like a big deal, but it was awful and I was miserable. My lips and gums were bleeding, my mouth was dry, the heartburn from not having any food in my stomach and not being able to take my pepsid. And going without food when you're pregnant... well I was not a happy camper.",

I'm with you- I'd much rather carry the baby til the end than have her come early. My first was delivered via c-section at 36 weeks, and while her lungs were mature, she was tiny and had feeding issues that made the following months a very stressful nightmare for us.i thought my dr was being overcautious by giving me the steroid shot at 34 weeks, but he said that lung development is a very important factor that he can help by administering prophylactic steroids. that way if i develop complications again, it will be one thing he won't have to worry about.",
