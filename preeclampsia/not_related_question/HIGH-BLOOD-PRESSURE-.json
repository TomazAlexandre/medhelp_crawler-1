    "question": "Today I'm 38 weeks. Just these last few weeks I've been starting to have high blood pressure and I'm confused. I would be in normal ranges like around 120 all throughout my pregnancy. But just my last 2 appointments its been around 147 every time. I havent had any complications my pregnancy has been so smooth. I just don't know why... This is my first baby and I'm 20 years old. All my doctor said was to have a low sodium diet. Anyone else that can relate or has an issue with high blood pressure ?",
