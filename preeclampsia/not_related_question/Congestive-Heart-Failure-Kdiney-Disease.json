            "answer": "Those numbers you named are her ejection fraction. It's definition is, the blood present in the ventricle at the end of diastole and expelled during the contraction of the heart. An ejection fraction is determined when you get an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart.Your mom's ejection fraction is not terribly low. It's not in the normal range, but I've heard of a lot lower. I have heard success stories of people who's E.F. was as low as 10% and they brought it back up to a normal level (which is 55%-75%). So, no your mother is not out of hope. However, she can not expect her ejection fraction to just jump up on its own. There are things she needs to do. One of them being, lower her intake of sodium. I try to keep mine as low as possible. Anything under 2,000 MG of sodium a day is low. I try to keep mine even lower, just to be safe. She needs to be eating lots of fruits, veggies, yogurt (if she likes it), and low sodium foods. She definitely needs to toss out the salt shakers! I've accepted seasoning salt as a thing of the past. Also make sure your mom takes her heart/blood pressure meds religiously. Remind your mother to get LOTS of rest.. She can not over-exert herself and must allow her heart time to heal.I am new to this congestive heart failure thing. I was diagnosed with it due to preeclampsia in a recent pregnancy. However, I have been paying a lot of attention to everything I have found out. I hope this info can help you. Take care, and the best of luck with your mother.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your explanation. I appreciate it.Unfortunately, my mother (who is 77) will not follow the diet, though when admitted to the hospital last week told the nurses she is on a very strict diet. - She is strictly not following it! We are at the point of saying \"eat what you want and be happy but realize it will cut a few years off your life.\"Good for you that you are being careful.Thanks again!",

    "question": "My mother is on kidney dialysis and has CHF. We were just told that a normal heart 65 is good, hers was 55 last spring, and now it is 35. Any ideas what these numbers mean? Is it the function? She was put on beta blockers and I believe digitex. (Sorry, I live in another state so my info is second hand.She has fluid around her heart and her dialysis treatments have been increased.Is she spiraling down? What can we expect?She was diagnosed with CHF 7 years ago and has been on dialysis for 18 months after 3-4 years of multiple kidney and bladder infections. (She also has a colostomy.)She does not follow her renal or heart diet at all either.Can you just tell me if she can continue like this for years or months or what?",
