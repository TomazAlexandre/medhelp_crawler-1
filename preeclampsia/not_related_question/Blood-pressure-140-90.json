Also keep a eye on your blood pressure at home if you can.Either get a BP monitor or go to a drug store or somewhere that has them available to the public.\u00a0\u00a0If it gets much higher and is consistently high you need to go to the hospital. It is not healthy for you or the baby.",

However, your blood pressure changes within seconds, so they might have just caught it at a high point. If there is no protein in your urine, you don't have preeclampsia and thats a really good sign! Your doctor is looking for consistently high blod pressure, so if it is high at your next appointment, your doc might express more concern! I advise waiting it out!!! Good Luck!",

    "question": "Hey there ladies! Yesterday when I went to the doctors, the nurse said that my blood pressure was high at 140/90. Yet my doctor didn't mention anything about it, and the nurse forgot to have me leave a urine sample until AFTER I had already seen the doctor. It was just crazy there yesterday, since they had to overbook all her appointments since she was delivering a baby in the morning, so basically I was shoved in and out and had a quick u/s to try to determine the gender. So now I'm confused, isn't my reading high? I'm 21 weeks now. I go back on the 30th, but I was just wondering, shouldn't my doctor be more concerned or am I just concerned for nothing? Thanks!",
