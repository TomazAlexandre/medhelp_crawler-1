            "answer": "ditto on everything peek said.we discovered i had preeclampsia at 35 weeks. By the time they did all the tests and got the results, i was 36 weeks. My doctor had me go straight to the hospital to have a c-sec when he got the results of my blood and 24 hr urine collection.i did have a lot of swelling prior to then, but it was summer so most preggos are swollen. It did get REALLY bad in the last few days. Honestly, i didn't have any other very obvious symptoms. While waiting for the results, i did start to feel sick (tests were done on Fri, so i went all weekend not knowing). By Monday i was feeling really sick. can't say exactly how though... they say \"malaise\" is a symptom, and that's exactly how i'd describe it. But extreme malaise. in addition to the blood tests which showed liver function and the 24 hr urine specimen, my OB did ultrasounds. The u/s showed that the placenta was calcifying, so the baby was not getting the nutrition it needed.for some reason, my doctor didn't consider my BP readings while i was sitting to be accurate. Anytime i had a high BP reading, he had me lay on my left side while they rechecked it. It was always lower on my left side. Try your best to relax and lay on your left side until your appointment tomorrow. Expect them to draw blood and test your urine. If they find protein in your urine, you may be asked to do a 24 hour collection to determine how much protein is spilling in to your urine. By the time i had my c-section, i was +4, (which as far as i understand is as high as it goes??). I would also ask for an ultrasound to check on the baby, if possible.let us know how it goes. How far along are you?",

In the hospital where i staid (in italy, cause i was in vacation) there were hundred of women with precamsia and everything went ok for all of them. the only cure of preeeclam is delivery. Now that my son is 4 month old my bp is back to normal. Goog luck",

If not which ones did you have?Did you always have swelling?My story is I went into L & D yesterday, cause I was told to due to high BP. When I got there my BP was 169/88. They got my BP to go down and apparently I was dehydrated so I got some fluids too. I was told the rest of my pregnancy will be like this and pretty much to rest. Since it was not my doctor they didn't diagnose me with anything. They just told me to make sure I keep my doc apt tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0On a side note all through this pregnancy and my first pregnancy my BP stayed at 100/60.Anyones experiences with either Preeclamsia or just gestational hypertention I'd love to hear. This is new for me as I didn't experience this with my first DD. A little scary.... I've never been on bedrest or anything.... I'm kinda at a loss here.",
