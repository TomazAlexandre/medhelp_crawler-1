            "answer": "I had to be induced at 35 weeks due to preeclampsia and my baby having iugr (inter uterine growth restriction). At that time my doctor told me that when babies are under stress they mature quicker such as their lungs. My little guy was 4lbs 12ozs and 18ins long. He did very well and had few problems which were jaundice and low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I would had known to tell them to delay clamping because the blood from the placenta and umbilical cord have a lot to do with blood sugar hemoglobin. Anyhow he stayed in the hospital 4 days and got to come home.I pray that all goes well for y'all and that you both have a quick recovery.",
