            "answer": "When are you due exactly?? I measured over when I had my first but I also had gestational diabetes. If your having a lot of swelling they probably want to keep an eye on you for preeclampsia and if not that purely because you say you are feeling her move less. It's good that did the NST's and are going to continue to do them, its also very hard to wait I know. Try to hang in there and keep us posted. At my last NST Ethan's heartrate was over 200 most of the time and although it eventually came down it made me nervous (them too as we had to wait another 20 min) and I am looking forward to the next u/s and NST to see if anything might be going on. I will keep my fingers crossed for you that all continues to go well!!",

            "answer": "Hi,I can understand how stressful this is for you.\u00a0\u00a0But if they were really worried, they would have admitted you, not just scheduled you for more monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0So while things are not as good as is wanted, it's probably not that bad.I've noticed my little one moving less.\u00a0\u00a0I keep touching her to feel her moving and start worrying if i don't feel much.\u00a0\u00a0Then tonight she was all over the place moving and I was so relieved.\u00a0\u00a0I think it feel different because she's moved position too.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe that also contributes for you and we do feel them moving less as they grow.Anyway, make sure you know symptoms of preeclampsia and call your doctor if you are concerned about anything.\u00a0\u00a0Monday will come very soon.Take care and try not to stress too much despite it all.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us informed how you go.",

            "answer": "Oh you poor thing! I remember in the beginning of this Pregnancy, they always waited to do Ultrasounds and this and that..and I would FREAK out...(due to the fact I had 2 M/C's in a row before this pregnancy and I was paranoid something would go wrong)...but unfortunately thats just the way doctors do it. I wouldnt freak out too much...dont stress yourself (as hard as that is), if it was something super serious they would have sent you to the hospital. Like you said they will prolly measure her, weigh her and see whats going on. And I bet they will either schedule a C-section or give you an induction date if she is measuring big because they'll want to get her out at a certain time..especially if there's extra fluid in there.But hang in there, you'll both be fine!! The weekend will fly by and Monday will be here before ya know it! Good Luck!Ohh and try taking a few sips of Mountain Dew...that ought to get her moving around! A few sips wont hurt her it will just get her a little active. My friend used to do that whenever she felt like she didnt feel her baby enough she would take a few sips and it worked like a charm!",

I am just going to relax this weekend, take it easy (even though I have to finish xmas shopping!) and hopefully monday morning will go well and I wont have to worry about anything!I am starting to get really crampy which I dont know if thats normal or not..i just want to know that she is in fact okay and that things are going the way they are supposed to.So, I guess the waiting game for now...as long as shes healthy..thats all that matters to me!",

    "question": "Well, I had my OB appt yesterday, which I thought would just be a routine visit like any other. First the doc tells me I am measuring a FEW weeks ahead...lovely! Then she starts asking questions, which I tell her my ankles have been getting swollen and that I have felt her quick drastically less than usual in the last week, which she said she doesnt like to hear. So, they hooked me up to the NST machine...for about 20 minutes. Well, apparently they didnt like what they saw so they sent me up for another one immediately at the hospital (better equip I guess), so that one turned out a little better, but not a ton. So, I have to go for another one Monday morning and a possible ultrasound to see how big she is and how much fluid is in there....But why wait? Why not have done it yesterday so that I can sleep at night knowing there is NOTHING wrong...Im going stir crazy...shes moving less.....these tests arent what they are supposed to..and I feel like I am in a waiting game. Measuring over? Does that mean shes going to come early?I also have a scheduled u/s at the OB office on Jan 8th to see how things are too!Guess its just going to be a waiting game now!",
