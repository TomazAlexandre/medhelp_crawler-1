    "question": "I was diagnosed as bipolar about 8 years ago. Over the years I have taken many different meds. At the beginning of last year I decided that the sedating effects as well as other side effect were hindering my everyday life and relationships. With the help of my doctor, I first went off of my Lithobid. I was amazed at the difference I felt. I felt like I was coming out of a fog! I was very encouraged, and decided to try to go off of my other meds as well. I waited a few months to make sure that going off of the Lithobid did not worsen any of my syptoms, and then started a long process of going off of my Risperdal. I was taking 4mg and over about 5-6 months I slowly got off of that as well. I had been very apprehensive about what problems might arise without the Risperdal. In the past I have had a lot of problems with anxiety and manic phases. I am diagnosed as a rapid cycling bipolar and although I do have some depression problems, I feel that I am much more on the manic side of the spectrum. Luckily, I seem to have no real ill effect for going off of the Risperdal. I am currently still on 400mg of Lamictal. I am hoping to start a family with my husband in the next few years. I do not want to be on any meds while I am pregnant/breastfeeding. Should I go off of the Lamictal (slowly of course) and then stay off of it a while before I get pregnant to make sure I can handle the 9 months? I have heard that the most dangerous time for a bipolar woman is after you give birth. Has anyone had experience with this situation? Is there anything that I can do to make myself as well as my husband more at ease and prepared for my lack of meds as well as the pregnancy?",
