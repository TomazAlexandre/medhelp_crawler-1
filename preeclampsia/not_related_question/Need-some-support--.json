            "answer": "Try not to worry so much about it. Stress is the worst thing while pregnant. I too have difficult pregnancies and can't even work and always get put on bed rest toward the end of my pregnancy because I always go into labor too early and start bleeding. Anyway, I felt the same way when I got pregnant with my third. My second passed away from a heart defect in August and I found out I was pregnant in January and was already about 5 weeks along and there was sooo much going on. I hadn't lost all my weight from my second, then gained more when he died, I was extremely depressed, my son had started acting out really bad and I felt like I couldn't even handle him, we were using condoms too and I was upset that it could've happened when we were using protection but I'm happy now.The point is that no matter what you're going through you will get over it and find happiness that you're having another. No matter what, unless you really don't care about kids or having any, you will always be able to find a way through it and be happy that you are having another. Maybe it will take until you first hear a heartbeat or see it for the first time on a sono or feel it kick, you will eventually start feeling better about it. You need to go ahead and tell your husband or boyfriend, whatever. He will be able to help you feel better about it. The first thing I did when I found I was pregnant again was bawl my eyes out and call my husband freaking out and he calmed me down and helped me through everything I was feeling. You really need support right now so you need to tell him.",

            "answer": "You know what? It will work out! I got pregnant accidentally with #2 when my first was only 5 months!! I was so scared too and wondering how in the world it would ever work. But that child is the LIGHT of my life. She is 17 years old now and pure joy. She has always been easy, kind, angelic. Meant to be. I would NEVER change a thing even if I could! Things always look hard when youre in situations like you are in, but we just DO IT. Women are STRONG. So strong. You have strength you dont even know about, I promise. :)Who cares what other people think? I get that \"look\" too--I am pregnant with my eighth baby. And I couldn't care less! I love my kids, I take care of my kids, I want my kids.Its no one else business.Hold your head high and say \"YES I AM expecting again! Isnt that wonderful!!\"You might have to get some help during the pregnancy. But you CAN do it!!!",

            "answer": "It is much harder to have a pregnancy that is a shock rather than a planned one. However,\u00a0\u00a0I think once you get past the initial shock, the excitement will set in. Your kids won't be that close in age..it is almost like having them two years apart. You could have an easier pregnancy this time too, but in case you don't, get some support in place so that someone can take your DD if you feel sick or need to be in the hospital.And, people say all sorts of things that are unkind or just not appropriate that they would not think of saying to a celebrity with children close in age or with a bunch of kids. Just people figure that if you are young they can say what they want so try and ignore it. Maybe they are jealous anyhow or they have no idea that what they are saying is rude or hurtful.Try and celebrate the pregnancy...it will make it more fun..and if a child is meant to be, they are meant to be..obviously the baby is here for a reason, so don't discount that.Congrats!!",

The next few months you will see huge changes in her.I was very sick this pregnancy in the beginning. I had heart problems and constant sickness. I was still able to get through it with a 1 year old, a fulltime job, and while going to grad school. It was hard, but I am proud of what I have accomplished.I am also concerned about developing preeclampsia again. It's scary to think about. My OB is monitoring me very carefully and I have been seeing him about every other week the entire pregnancy. Discuss your fears and concerns with your doctor. I was told my chances of having it again are less than last time, but slightly higher than for other second time moms. Still, he's being very cautious. Hopefully, your dr can help you feel more comfortable about things.",

I was sick as a dog again with this pregnancy and still get nauseous from time to time even now and I'm 22 weeks. I still break down some days and I finally just told my husband how I am feeling (I have a hard time expressing myself) and he talked to me and really reassured me that I would be able to handle it, even though I am freaking out. He told me I should have gone to him sooner about my feelings, so if I were you I would definitely tell your DF about it, at least you know he will be on your side and there to support you. Even though this baby is unexpected, I'm sure he/she will be loved greatly. I know it's hard, I struggle everyday just to do normal things and chase Jeremiah and he will only be 17 months when this baby arrives. I'm scared but have people to support me especially my husband. I know it's hard to hear it, but congrats. Everything happens for a reason, and God won't give more than you can handle. I'm sure it will all work out!And you know we are always here for you..no matter what! Most of us have gone through the same things already and it's great to have the support of these ladies. Keep your head up and be strong. Things will be okay.",

I can only imagine how stressed out you are right now.\u00a0\u00a0I was doing a bit of on line reading today on pregnancies and such, and was thinking about you while I read some of it.\u00a0\u00a0Basically it said that many women will have difficult first pregnancies, and extra challenges with first baby.\u00a0\u00a0The reason is we worry about every little thing with our first, and the stress gets passed on.\u00a0\u00a0Once we reach our second, we tend to be more relaxed as we know what to expect from a pregnancy, and we tend to be more relaxed with baby in general.\u00a0\u00a0Now, don't misunderstand me at all, I know you are an EXCELLENT mom.\u00a0\u00a0We just don't know anything first hand the first time..lol, ok, so that doesn't make much sense...but you know what I mean.\u00a0\u00a0There is no reason to think this pregnancy will be difficult like it was with Aubree.\u00a0\u00a0It is natural that you would feel overwhelmed right now...a young baby, planning a wedding, going back to school...heck girl, that would be a lot for anyone!!\u00a0\u00a0But you know what, you can do it, and I know you will do it well!!\u00a0\u00a0It might make you feel better to tell df.\u00a0\u00a0From things you have written, he sounds like a great guy, and you could use a little extra pampering right now.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there girlfriend, it's going to be ok!!",

And the good news is the two siblings will be close in age and that will help them to be close growing up. That's a good thing! I wish my two oldest had been closer in age. I meant for them to be 3 years apart and they wound up being 4 years apart so they've never been very close. Now I wish I had them 2 years apart or so.My 2 cousins are only 11 months apart in age and they've always been very close. They even live near each other and do a lot together even though they're all grown up.Don't worry, it will be ok. My third baby was a big surprise too and I think my husband and I walked around in shock for weeks before we told anyone. I didn't plan on any more. My 2 oldest were much older and I worried about me being older and having a higher risk pregnancy. But you know what? It all just kind of fell into place. My little boy is such a joy and I know that even though we didn't plan him, that he was God planned. He's such a blessing to all of us.Take care! And make sure you're getting your prenatal vitamins and getting plenty of rest! God bless you and your little blessing! :)",

I found out i am pregnant with #2 a couple of days ago and honestly it was a shock... We have been using condoms religiously and i try to avoid my ovulation time all together.. i have so many feelings running through my head it honestly feels like my head is gonna pop off.. I haven't told my df yet.. I need some time to process it first before i tell him.\u00a0\u00a0I honestly cried when i saw the bfp .. i am not ready for this at all!\u00a0\u00a0I'm having a hard time with my first daughter and throwing in another child is definatly going to make it alot harder on me and i dont know if im up for it.. i dont know if i have enough strength to go through another pregnancy right now.. my last pregnancy was very rough.. i was constantly sick all the time and at the end i developed toxemia and almost lost aubree.. my bp was 180/110 which is near stroke levels.. so i had to be induced and i didn't have the best birthing experience.i know df will be thrilled because he wanted to start ttc a while ago.. but he just doesn't understand what stress my body is going to be under once again.\u00a0\u00a0i went and got my blood draw this morning and i had to take Aubree with me.. there was this one lady in the drs. office and she asked me how old Aubree was.. i told her she just turned one.. and she said awe how cute and such.. then the nurse came out and i had to fill out paper work and the nurse ask me how far along i was and i said 5 weeks.. and the other lady gave me such a look .. like your pregnant again... i felt so embarrassed and even a little ashamed.. i almost started crying right then... then the nurse took me back and she said man are you gonna have your hands full.. seriously like i didn't know that and i needed her to point that out to me.. argh! its just been a rough day and i dont even ever have the time to just take a moment and sit and process my feelings. i haven't told anyone ( besides you ladies) that i am pregnant.. i just know the responses im gonna get from both my family and his and im just not ready to hear them right now... im such a wreck right now :'(",
