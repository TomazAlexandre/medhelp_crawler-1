(\"everytime you call all I can think of is the negative and it ruins my relaxing day. It's stressful.\")\u00a0\u00a0Or, if there's a way to reverse the contact - you'll call her if things change or \"x\" symptoms appear.\u00a0\u00a0If she can't bend and her personality is bad, all for a new person who will listen to you. Even on government plans you can switch people :)",

But a call once a month, to ask me how I'm doing, from a woman that could care less, and is just doing her job, gets kind of annoying. Maybe I'm just having an off day. But it was good until she called. I think next time, I just won't answer the phone. Maybe there is a way to block her number.",

She keeps calling me asking how i'm feeling, asking if I've shown any symptoms of a stroke(I had one with my daughter) ok, look, my doctor's office is right down the street, and if I can't be seen there, the hospital is closer than the doctor's office.\u00a0\u00a0Im doing what I'm supposed to be doing, taking all the precautions. Why do you insist on calling me and asking me the same question every time I talk to you?! I realize she's just doing her job, but lay off for (insert bad word here) sake!! Ugh, talking to her doesn't make for a good day. I think I may have hurt her feelings, but she lives over 1.5 hours away, how can she get here faster than I can have someone drive me to the hospital?",
