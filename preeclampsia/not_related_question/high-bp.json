            "answer": "have high BP. My doctor was monitoring me for preeclampsia, but my blood work and all the other tests came back fine. So it's, luckily just high BP and I'm on meds for it now.If your high BP is accompanied by swelling in the legs, hands or face, severe headaches, nausea, or changes in your vision tell your doctor right away.And the leg pain you've described sounds like sciatica. The baby's just pinching a nerve near your tailbone. And it's unrelated to the high BP.I hoe you feel better soon!",

I was put on meds at 27-28 weeks and at 36 weeks it got crazy and had a csec at 37+3 because of it getting out of control. It can turn over night into something bad... Not to scare you but look it up and read about it so you know everything. My dr is awesome and was on it and I was going twice a week for it.",

I would talk to your doctor if you notice that you are getting high bp readings. If you are feeling stressed right before you take you bp that can affect your numbers so take some deep breaths and clear your mind before taking it. If you see your doctor ask to test your urine for protein.",
