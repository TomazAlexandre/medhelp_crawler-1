            "answer": "Happens to me if I eat too much salty foods, don't drink enough water, or am standing too much. If I drink a couple glasses of cold water and lay back with my feet up above heart level it usually goes down at least a little bit. If you try the water and elevating your feet and it doesn't go down at all in a couple of hours (and don't expect it to go down completely cuz it's possible it doesn't go down fully until after delivery like mine) then call your labor and delivery office and ask to speak to a nurse about it. It could be a sign of pre eclampsia (extreme high blood pressure during pregnancy).",

            "answer": "My cousin had it with her first baby and it lead to a thing called toxemia poisoning or something. No ones trying to diagnose you here just giving you a heads up. If you sleep more on your left side tonight (it helps blood flow and digestion and all sorts of other things) it might help too so just try not to stress tonight. If its concerning you tomorrow call the office and talk to a nurse just to see if they're concerned and want you in sooner than Tuesday. As a ftm no question is ever too stupid or too much of a duh answer to call and ask. I'm on number two and I still get those weird questions lol",
