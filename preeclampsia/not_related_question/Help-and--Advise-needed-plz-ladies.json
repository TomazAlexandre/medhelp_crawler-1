            "answer": "Protein is NOT a good thing to have in your urine, especially that early on. That can be a sign of preeclampsia which can cause extreme complications during your pregnancy.

You need to get in contact with your doctor about what all of this means and what they'll do to help, but definitely do not let this go unnoticed!",
