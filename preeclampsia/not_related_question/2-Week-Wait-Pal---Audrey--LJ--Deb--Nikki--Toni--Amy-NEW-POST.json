It seems like the planets are out of line or something that so many crazy things happen to us all at once. Take care of yourself. Cysts can happen to anyone, but they are also very painful. I had one after my first IVF cycle. If you get re-occuring urinary tract infections, look into cranberry pills. They are suppose to help. A doc once told me that you would have to drink enough cranberry juice to pee red for it to really help with uti but now they have concentrated cranberry pills available. You can find them at costco.Nicki -\u00a0\u00a0I hope your u/s went well. They grow so fast at this age. Enjoy some sun for me. Have a great trip.Oth- Thanks for the support. I am glad you were able to find us again\u00a0\u00a0Please get lots of rest and take it easy. Remember not everyone gets symptoms this early. I didn't have nausea until 8 weeks. A temp after you ovulate is normal, the progesterone hormone keep you temp up as long as it's not over 103. Try to be positive. PUPO-pregnant until proven otherwise.Deb- How are things going with you?Toni-Happy 25 weeks. Not too much longer, just the summer to get through. lol.",

I am 25 weeks now..I've gained almost 20 lbs.....that's as much as mommy2selena and she has TWINS! Ugh! I don't know if I'm too big too soon. The doc says everything is fine. It's going by pretty slow. UNbelievably, the weight goes everywhere. I was a runner before doing ivf and now even my calves and especially my upper arms seem bigger. It's all worth it. I forget sometimes and then will catch my profile in the shadow of my LCD projector at school and I almost fall over! It's still hard to believe this happening.Stay positive, if this can happy to me...a person who has had zero luck,....then it can happen fo ryou!",

An embryo implants anywhere from day 6 - 11, but usually day 6-7 post ovulation, meaning that u r are currently 8 days post ovulation. Everyone is different with symptoms and the meds play funny tricks on us. Also you have hcg in your body up to 14 days from the hcg injection(usually 2 days prior to retreival/ovulation). Stay positive and busy-mentally, physically take it easy.Don't test until your are at least 11 days post transfer, you don't want to test too early and get a false negative. Hang in there.Amy - the price we have to pay to have babies... I experienced severe weight gain all over when I was pregnant with my dtr - I here that girls usually do that to you. That is why this time I was positive it was a girl, I still look 4-5 months pregnant. I noticed weight gain in my face especially, plus my hair went so oily and I started breaking out - I never break out not even when I was a teenager.\u00a0\u00a0If you were a runner, you will be again. You will lose the weight and have a nice little pink bundle too.As for me, I met with my RE doctor today and got the good news that I can try again as soon as my AF returns. Since I would have an additional AF after starting the suppresent meds and prior to the injections. So hopefully my AF comes sooner than later.",

After the first thread was closed to comments, I tried a number of times to comment on the second thread and could not remember my password nor could access it. Just now I thought I would make another effort and, bingo, I got it right. I now have to note it down for the future.Like you I had my FET (but natural cycle) which failed miserably. I had one frozen embryo which was transferred as the others did not survive the thaw and that one did not take....So I am going to start a fresh cycle but I am not sure whether I will be changing clinics. I want something different, although the staff were nice etc. I hesistate to put so much money down in what could be a drain if the same protocol would be adopted. I have tried to put IVF out of my mind but of course if I would like to start within another two months or so I have to give serious thought of who I should go to to have a comprehensive gynaecological exam to see if that shows up something that was missed the first time.I had read that you were considering adoption and I was wondering whether you did not want to go on this IVF ride one more time in the hope that it would work. If it works, it would truly be worth it, having your own flesh and blood. That is not to say that there is not value in the choice you are considering.LJ, sorry to hear about all that has happened. When we think that it cannot get worse, it surely can. But it can also get better, much better. So we must continue to hope...I read that you are thinking about starting in a couple of months.

It is almost 6 months since my first IVF cycle and I am back to square one, a bit poorer and much fatter :).\u00a0\u00a0Hmmm. I have come off the folic acid and even though we baby dance, I do it now not with the expectation of getting pregnant....which makes the dance not as interesting.Lots of questions enter my mind, did I choose the right clinic, was it my fault, was it theirs, was it simply not meant to be at the moment. Even with this last attempt, I was hopeful even though there was blood on the catheter after the transfer, but nothing, nothing, nothing but disappointment and fat. I have started to modify my diet and do a bit more exercise but I have to do better. I would like to lose a few pounds, let my body adjust and then try again. But I do not want any medication in my system in June or July. If I were younger, let us say, if I were younger than 35 perhaps I would have taken a year off from all of this. But I can only take months.Do I go back to the clinic that I know or do I try a new one where there are fresh eyes? Or am I just wasting money as the REs do not really know what is going on but just try by a process of elimination?I have to do this IVF thing one more time just so that when I am grey I would not be saying \"what if I had tried one more time?\" I have to be stoic about all this otherwise I could not cope. I have not been posting recently, except for tonight, nor have I been discussing it with others. I am not sure what is worse - carrying the burden alone (with God's help) or wasting time confiding in people who simply talk out your business and stress you out more? I have opted for the former, apart from my chatting on this site...Life is truly about choice and decisions. As, to the best of my knowledge, my question is male factor, I could find another man. But then what? I would lose the one who does not mind spending his life with me....Isn't life something else? It is easier to find a sperm donor than it is to find a good husband.

I wonder what long term effects all these meds can have on me, particularly as I am going through this whole process again once I decide on a RE and a date. Apart from concern about the long term effects,\u00a0\u00a0I dread the egg retrieval process. For me that was physically the most painful of all the processes associated with IVF. I had general anaesthetic but I remember feeling something being punctured even though I was supposed to be asleep. That in itself was not painful but later the night when the meds wore off, I was in such great pain. Luckily the pain had disappeared by the next day.Following my failed FET, my RE suggested that I should go on Heparin the next time even though the tests do not show up a problem with the antibodies... more medication. I am willing to try this if it would a difference. I will have to pray, pray, pray that nothing goes wrong or fundamentally wrong.Old Debbi,I hope that you do not have to do a D & C. I had to do one of those some time last year to remove a polyp...The doctor said that this was necessary to facilitate implantation. What implantation? On a different note, I am looking forward to seeing what positive on a pregnancy test looks like. I have seen positive with a LH surge but never the former. I wonder if I do the tests wrong :)) I do hope that you find the new donor soon.LJ, I wish that I could join you in August but I doubt it since the earliest appointment for an initial consultation that I can get is August. I hope to try in September. Hope that you feel better soon...pace yourself.... Take it from me even though I am burning the candles at both ends at present. Tonight though after I am finished this post, I am going to get ready for bed....Oth2007,\u00a0\u00a0I am anxious to hear about your beta as well as whether you are having twins. I am glad to hear about your success. I hope it comes to us all soon. In January after my failed IVF cycle, I came up with this name \"Bemyyear\" in the hope that I would get pregnant in 2007. The months are going fast and I am back to square one. I feel like I have been eaten by a giant snake on a snake and ladders game and I am now at 1.Audream, any plans to try IVF again?",

The doctors are saying that is why they had to do it twice because it's very tilted, but I did remind them right before I went into the OR. I think they just rushed. What sucks is I have been bleeding for almost four weeks now, they say it should only be a couple days. When I went to my family doc last week & told her, she sent me for the u/s that showed I needed to go to the ER for a repeat surgery. It's been almost a week it's better but still there. The only problem is that who knows how long it will be for my AF to return and be able to start my next cycle. Probably will more likely be september now, but I will pray for sooner. I go back to my doc on Friday.Audrey I am glad you are feeling a bit better. IVF does take a toll on the body. For me I put on weight, AF got worse & my kidney function was affected. I know it's really hard to think about going through it again, but you only had one full cycle. It might be worth one more try before giving up altogether, as long as your health is okay.Take care.",

If there are no problems, particularly after what you told me about the hematomas, I would decline to follow that method.Did any of you who are now pregnant use heparin?Audream, good luck with the adoption. I am not leaning in favour of adoption though. I want my own child and if I cannot have my own child, I will give what I have, including lots of love, to my niece and nephew.LJ, so you too have a retroverted uterus. I am now starting to wonder if there is any link between the shape of our uteruses and problems with conception. I plan that if I go to another clinic to tell the RE and remind the RE that my uterus is tilted and that he must factor that in in the transfer. He would probably thinking that I am overstepping my bounds, but it is my body. If he has never done a ET with someone with a retroverted uterus, I will be telling him \"goodbye\".Oth2007, your news about your stomach feeling raw is a bit frightening. I was also bloated. Good luck with your appointment tomorrow...Nickimike926, glad to know that things are progressing well for you. You referred to amnios. Is this the test for downsyndrome?

Due to some test results they said I didn't need it. I'm not sure what it does or what they measured. I too have a retroverted uterus, but I have not had any pain with the procedures..sometimes the transvaginal ultrasounds were uncomfortable but I don't know if it was the tech or if it had something to do with my build. All doctors have told me it shouldn't cause a problem. But I've known several people that have had them and needed fertility treatments. Also, I heard once you are pregnant the uterus \"right\" itself and straightens up. I wonder if it stays that way or goes back to being retroverted?Happy weekend girls! SO glad it's Friday.

These appointments would probably be very preliminary since it would be my first visit. One of them might even coincide with AF. There was little I could do since that is the first available date. I will be using my instincts to see if I feel comfortable with the RE in question. If I am not comfortable, I am out of there....But from there to where? I do not know. Time is going so fast. I just have to surrender all to Jesus. It is just too much to handle, too much to hold. I dread the injection process. The thought of it makes me feel as though I would hyperventilate, although I know that the injections were bad. I am telling you, the longer I wait the harder this gets. It only takes a few challenges to overwhelm me now. I guess this is because at the back of my mind I know that I have to take the plunge into ivf again and I must do it sooner rather than later. I will let prudence prevail and step forward as soon as a reasonable opportunity presents itself. I wish that this was all a dream.Well you do seem to be in very high spirits. Congrats to you.",

I am lucky to have them come out normal..Hooray! I will keep my fingers crossed for you and your two little ones! It took 4 weeks to get those results because they sent it to a state testing facility.Audrey- no summer break for me..I am very jealous. I am so glad to hear abotu the fun you are having. You deserve this time to relax and recooperate from the year. I am year round and today it HAD to be over 110 out here. It was my last day with this group of Kinders today. We had a huge performance and it turned out great ..plus everyone had left by 10:). SO my mom and dad came and helped me paper my boards and stuff. I have meetings next week and get a new group of students the following mOnday. I do have August off. I just have to get to August. About 5 weeks total. Once I go off-track I won't go back probably until January.I'm kind of glad I have work to keep me busy while waiitng for this little one to be ready to make her appearance. Only 11 weeks to go...if she's on time. :)Girls, It's good to hear from so many of you. Enjoy the weekend!!!",

I opted not to have it as I didn't want to be stressed the whole pregnancy. Besides if you get a false postive, then you have to have a amnio to clarify.I hope everyone is planning a great week and summer, it's the 1st of July for us and hope there will be lots of sunshine.Toni, I think you'll make it to at least 34 weeks but hopefully 36. Glad everyone is doing well in there. How's Selena?Three more day of work ahead then a month off. YEAH! I went for my kidney u/s today and good news, there has been no significant change since 2000.

Our ivf was 17000. We have had two donors donate their embies and the cost is for procedure and all 2000. You do not have to sync your cycles with donors or anything invaseive. I will be on meds for three weeks and then do the transfer on 7/27. The wait is less as we will know in 6 days if they stick or not.\u00a0\u00a0Just thought I would pass on the info. Love to all.",

To make you feel a bit better is that my second D & C was easy, I was fine the next day and I had light bleeding for a couple of days that's it. I hope Friday the 13th is good luck for us both.Sweedy I am glad that you were able to do your transfer. As I said waiting is hard, when do you test? 20th?I am glad to hear that you are doing well Nicki. You MUST be showing now. Still using the heart monitor everyday, probably before you go to sleep each night. Any crazy dreams or craving yet?I am doing good. I am on vacation and it beautiful outside. The temp is very warm, in the 80s. Trying to spend my free time in the garden and with my son.Hope everyone is well and looking forward to hearing from you.",

Your time will come too. I hope everything is okay with this fibroid.Audream - Welcome back. You were missed.I have been tired and lazy this week. Feeling a little nervous about trying again. Especially since the clinic is a little dazed and confused - where have all the good nurses gone.

As it was the first time seeing this new RE much of the consultation concerned preliminary discussions and preliminary examinations. My uterus was examined using ultra sound equipment and all appeared to be okay. The RE then suggested that I should have a hysteroscopy to see if all is really well within the uterus given the failure of the blastocysts to implant. That appointment will be towards the end of August. I was very comfortable with the RE although not as comfortable as if I were at the first clinic. It seems as though I will try IVF 2 in October or thereabouts.I have my second post IVF consultation with another RE in about two weeks. As I am quite happy with the one I met yesterday, the other one would have to be really good and persuasive for me to do IVF with his clinic.Sweedy, I am so sorry to hear about your test results. I have been there with a failed fresh cycle and a failed frozen cycle. You are doing the right thing thinking about the next steps and chatting with the ladies on the board.",

Usually they are no big deal but there are risks. Check it out. Especially after only one try, it's very common for it now to work the first time.

After reading your posting, I went on google and there I saw them. Hmmmmm. Thanks so very much. The RE had suggested a hysteroscopy because she cannot understand why on the one hand I had good embryos but poor implantation. I just hope that all these exploratory procedures do not result in my being worst off.How long will you have to wait for another appointment? I hope not too long...Audrey and Nickimike, thanks too for the advice. The appointment with the next RE is the first Monday in August. I was thinking of cancelling it as he might have an expectation of my continuing but DH said no...I guess he has a point in us getting another opinion. But there is only so far we can go if we have no intentions of moving forward. I would not want to pay for exactly the same type of tests. I will see if he suggests a different route that I am more comfortable with but he would have to do really well for this to happen. I am hoping that I get better monitoring this time and that it would work out and so I am tempted to go to the RE that I had the appointment with in July. She does not live too far from me and so if there is a problem, I should have someone who is treating me quite close to hand Today I was in a store looking at flat screen tvs and I saw a couple with a baby. My first thought was, I would prefer to have the baby....Audrey, you do seem to be enjoying life. Congrats!!!! For me being happy seems like an achievement rather than something that is normal :)Mstrex, congrats! I am looking forward to reaching the waiting stage again although it surely is not the best.

I had excellent quality embryos and a very healthy uterus but it took me three fresh cycles of IVF to have my son. And even this last year, second fresh cycle that led to pregnancy.

Thanks for putting me on the alert though, particularly as I have a retroverted uterus and the procedure might be even more difficult.All, I was just reading Sweedy's comment about a laparoscopy reducing one's ovarian reserve. I did not know this. The first RE I went to wanted to do one, but as he was so incompetent doing another procedure, I got scared and then went to the clinic where I did the first IVF. I remember the RE at this clinic told me that it would have been pointless doing a laparoscopy because the scar tissue that would result would make natural conception more difficult if not impossible.I do hope that I would be successful with IVF2. The time is going so fast. It is almost a year since I did the first one and I am hoping that this year would be-my-year, hence my name. If this does not succeed, I will probably change my name to \"AllforJesus\" or something of the sort.Nicki, congrats on your progression. I wish that I could have twins, but I prefer to have twin girls. Of course if I were to have boys like you, I would also be happy. Right now, one child healthy child would be fantastic. Having two stops me from having to have another fresh or frozen cycle.All, I would like to change jobs but I do not want to change and then get pregnant. If I had changed since last year, it would have been okay for me to get pregnant now without the employer disapproving. But I did not know that IVF 1 would have been such a flop.",

I have a couple problems worse than IVF. My greatest problem is my mother's failing health. Sometimes I feel that if she dies, I would too and it would be easier as I do not have kids. I trust that God would give me the strength when the time comes.

I am medicial leave for two months and that will drive me crazy as well. Ugggh. I bought hpt (6 of them) before the transfer as I know I will test probably Sat or Sun as Beta is on Monday.

I guess I never believed it would happen...I'm due September 17th-21st...somewhere in there. Based on my IVF dates it should be the 17th...but my doc came up with the 21st off of one of my early ultrasounds..so who knows. I can't wait. Less than 6 weeks to go if she's full term...such a miracle!!!LJ- how are you doing on those drugs?\u00a0\u00a0am looking forward to hearing about your ultrasound. It's just around the corner.

            "answer": "Hello everyone, the board has been rather busy these last few days..which of course is a good thing. Mstrex, sorry to hear about the BFN. A BFN is truly a BFD- a big fat disappointment. Keep thinking of the next steps. I find that when I think of the next steps, I am happier.Mommy2selena, congrats!!! Well done. I am happy to hear about the birth of Riley and Ryan. For you at least one mission has been accomplished.OldDebbi, Nickimike, thanks for the kind regards regarding my mother.Audream, yippee!!! I am so glad to hear that you are trying again. We have had a similar history regarding BFNs.Audream, LJ, Amy and everyone, I had my consultation with the second RE who works in a different country. Her view was that a hysteroscopy is unnecessary and carries risks. Of course I remembered LJ. She said that she would not interfere with the uterus particularly as the ET would be done weeks after. She noted though that in some countries REs insist on patients having hysteroscopies. Here I am hoping that things go well for me, as they did for Amy. LJ's words are at the back of my mind.\u00a0\u00a0I have decided to go with the RE, who unfortunately has advised a hysteroscopy...only because she lives in the same country as me and I am hoping that my stress levels would be less. Provided that the hysteroscopy does not show up anything untoward or that I do not suffer complications as a result of stupidly doing the hysteroscopy, I will do IVF 2 in September/October 2007 and if it fails, I then plan to have IVF 3 with the second RE who resides in a different country. I guess this would have to be in December/Jan 2008 - a whole year after IVF1.Sweedy, do not give up the fight!!! Hang in there with us. Keep thinking of the next steps. One of these days, God willing, your dream will be fulfilled. Have you considered changing clinics or getting a second opinion as to the likely reason for the failed cycle and FET?",
