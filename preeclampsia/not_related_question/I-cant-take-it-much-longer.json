            "answer": "I had migraines before I got pregnant but when I had a 5 day long one and Tylenol did nothing they gave me some stronger stuff. I don't have to take it much only if its unbearable. Plus they normally get way less frequent at about 20wks for me. Talk to your dr if they start interfering with your daily life. Also pure peppermint oil on your temple or neck helps. A hot shower. Heating pad on back of neck or forehead helps. The best one is magnesium. Magnesium helps relax the brain and you need more magnesium while pregnant so it could just be your not getting enough. I normally take mine before bed and I don't wake up with a headache nearly as much. Goodluck. Headaches are evil.",
