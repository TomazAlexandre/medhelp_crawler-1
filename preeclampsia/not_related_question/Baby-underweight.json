She was 6 lbs 14 oz a week later when i had my csection. Lost down to 5 lbs 15 oz first day (that meconium poop stuff) but was perfectly healthy. Ultrasound machines can be up to 2 lbs off.is what i was told by the tech when she measured my daughter. Said that once they get so big it makes it harder to really measure because everything is so cramped.",
