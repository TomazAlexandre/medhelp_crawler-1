            "answer": "Here's the situation.\u00a0\u00a0Here's why you shouldn't demand an earlier induction date. Sounds scary, but totally true.If your cervix has not started to dilate or at least to efface, no amount of pitocin is going to make for a successful induction. If your body is not ready to dilate, attempting to induce will lead directly to fetal distress. If your body is not progressing and your baby is in distress due to the pitocin, then you'll end up with a really dangerous situation, and you'll get an \"emergency\" c-section that wouldn't have been necessary at all if you and your doctor had waited until your body was ready.Your doctor, I assume, has been doing this for a while. Trust her judgment. If she can see that your body just needs more time, she's not going to want to rush into it knowing the possible (likely) consequences of trying to hurry it up.Trust your body. Your body knows what to do. You are supposed to be uncomfortable right now. It's part of the process. It stinks, I know. It's no fun getting through the last couple weeks. But it will be over soon enough, and all the trouble will be worth it. Promise.",

            "answer": "I am now 40w2d. I had my appointment on Thursday and was in literal tears and asked to be induced early. I have been in pain for a good 4 weeks with an 8-9 lb rapidly growing baby crushing my small torso. They were worried about his size and me not being able to push him out and having my induction end in a c section. Pitocin is really no joke. It makes for a long complicated labor. If you aren't dialated or softened at all they want to try to hold off before induction so as to not distress the baby. My best friend ended up induced and wasn't too far dialated and the baby's heart rate plumeted and she got preeclampsia. Really scary. As much as I want my baby out like yesterday I am trying to hang on. I am scheduled for an induction next week as I will be a week past due. But I am 70% effaced and I am a bit dialated. They said I can dilate very quickly so not to give up hope. I've been having contractions throughout the day so I am hoping that he comes soon. Good luck and hang in there! Trust your doctor but feel free to ask. It's your health. They will be able to tell you what's best. They did a fetal weight ultrasound and sat and discussed early induction before deciding to keep my original date.",

It's extremely difficult and uncomfortable for her to even check my cervix, and she says my pelvis is really narrow with a high arch and it is possible I would not even be able to give birth vaginally at this point..I guess I'm just really confused as to why she is scheduling and induction and not a c section",
