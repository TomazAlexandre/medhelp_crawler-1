            "answer": "Hi,At this point, I suggest that you continue to observe your urine. Urinating very fast may cause bubbles to show. Also, some substances in the toilet bowl may react with the urine and cause bubbles. These are things to consider. At this point, I suggest that you should not be worrying unnecessarily. I understand that you are anxious about this however, it should be a relief that the test results are normal.Continue observing your urine's character. Note any change in color, odor, and amount. Also note for any changes with urinary patterns eg increase in urine frequency.",

If your symptoms continue much longer, you might want to consider setting up a doctor's appointment, especially if you think that an infection is a possiblity. I'll keep you updated and let you know if anything is diagnosed on my end.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that you start feeling better soon. :)Take Care,Kelly",

            "answer": "My docs thought I had a terrible rare disease and if I had protein in my urine, then it would be possitive. No bubbles/fizz of any sort. Then all of a sudden I got BUBBLES...lots of them. I could hear them fizzing. Got so scared. Doc took another urine test and sent it out to the laboratory--no protein. All I had was just bubbles that were popping. My bubbles weren't foamy.My husband came home and had to pee. (this is so embarrising). Anyway, I asked if I can see his urine. He too had lots of bubbles. I still have bubbles for many months and no protein.But do keep an eye out for foaming and see if your bubbles pop and how fast they pop. If it takes a longgg time to pop, then go see your doc. But personally, I wouldn't worry about the bubbles. Make sure you drink 8 cups of water each day and check the color of your urine. If you don't drink water, then your urine might be darker. Even so, if the color is dark, go to the doctor. Relax. I know how you feel. I've been going through tons of scares myself for the past few months. Can hardly sleep or function because my mind is always on it. I'm not a doctor, but do go periodically to check your urine. It doesn't hurt. Oh..about the white color tissue..I had it for a bit and was told that it was most likely dead skin sluffing off.(think sluffing is spelt wrong). I might have had a little infection or whatever. Evenutally, it stopped. Keep an eye on it.",

If so, if the bubbles/foams continue, I suggest that you get a 24 hour urine collection done to detect protein volumn. Urinalysis dipsticks are not good at detecting all proteins. That means negative results doesnt rule out protein in urine completely. The 24 hour urine collection is far more reliable. talk to your doctor.",

What is frustrating is that this compounding pharmacy gets it right one month, where I have no symptoms, then the next prescription I get bubbles in urine with irritation and having to wear a panty liner.

Society has so many people scared up of everything nowadays. Everywhere you look you see ads about cancer, heart disease, diabetes, kidney issues. It's all meant to make you worry. They know that what you think about, you bring about. It is the Law of Attraction. We become what we think about. I would not worry about anything unless you are very very deathly Ill. another thing that can cause bubbles is Candida and dieoff from it. I have plenty of bubbles some days,but when I drink water it goes away. Also when I pee in a cup or something it has no bubbles at all. Everyone needs to chill out or you will cause something bad to manifest in your body temple. Smile and enjoy life, it is an awesome trip.",
