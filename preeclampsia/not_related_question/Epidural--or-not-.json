Its your choice, but from experience, I would strongly suggest you get one. Ppl that have been against the epidural, ended up wantin one and were either lucky enough to still have time to get it or by the time the realized they wanted it, it was too late. I have had pain for a while after, in my back from the epidural, but everything comes with its territory. Good luck! :)",

My son also had to go to special care and I was ready to see him but I had to wait for the epidural to wear off and through pitocin to finish off and then wait for the nurse to take me up. It was a long wait. I didn't want one in the first place, but having preeclampsia I was told I didn't have a choice. My blood pressure would raise really high with every contraction.",

The \"worst\" part of labor is the very end, right before pushing. If you're up and moving, listening to your body and your baby, labor is usually quite manageable. I've had friends that went shopping for a few last minute things while they were in labor. Its all psychological. If you believe something is torture, its going to be torture. With a lifetime of conditioning about how labor is *so painful*, its no wonder many women freak out when it starts and multiply their pain by getting all bent out of shape.",

I am not for, or against it, but I am just curious to see some of the pros/cons about it and get some feedback to help me make a decision on if I really want/need it or not. I was told to sign the consent form to have it just in case, but I want to see if anyone had complications and what the reactions were.",
