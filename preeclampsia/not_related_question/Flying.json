            "answer": "Congrats...we just found out we were having a boy too!I agree with blueeyed- airlines have a policy on how late you can travel during your pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0This is also our first and have had to ask many questions about traveling.\u00a0\u00a0The general concensus is that we probably won't want to be doing too much traveling that late in pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your dr.\u00a0\u00a0Mine told me by law they have to tell you not to travel away from their office within a certain time.No matter what you do talk to your dr. first.\u00a0\u00a0And again, Congrats, I know how excited we are and I am sure you are feeling the same!",

            "answer": "Of course you have to see how your pregnancy is going at that point.\u00a0\u00a0Who knows you could be confined to bed rest or something.\u00a0\u00a0 At 33/34 weeks the airlines should still let you on the plane, but double check...some times they limit the flying to just a 4 hour trip.\u00a0\u00a0And ask for a bigger seat than normal...maybe they will be nice and bump you up to first class!",

            "answer": "i flew at 34 weeks in my last pregnancy. My doctor (who is extremely cautious about everything) said it would be OK. I do admit it was NOT comfortable and it was only a short flight (NY to NC, so only about an hour). I was SOO swollen by the time we got there. I wouldn't plan on a long flight, and definitely consult your OB before booking. I checked on Continental's website. They said they'll let you on up to 7 days before your due date. that's insane, but i guess for legal reasons they have to.Also, check canellation policies. I am looking to fly around the same time this year (although i'll be 32 weeks instead of 34). After all of my complications last time, i am scared to book a flight. I ended up have preeclampsia 2 weeks after that trip and had to have DD at 36 weeks. I'm definitely going to look in to their cancelation policies.",

    "question": "So I am 18 Weeks this week. We found out we are having a BOY!! And we couldnt be happier. everything looks good. But I am having a family reunion at the end of June. So that would put me about 33-34 weeks at that point. Does anybody know if it safe to fly that late in pregnancy? I want to be able to purchase my tickets here soon before they go up any more than they already have. By the way, How is everybody doing??? What is Everybody having?? We are SO EXCITED for our baby. This is our first, so we are clueless..",
