            "answer": "Honestly, right after all my babies I thought I could never go through it again. With my first I had preeclampsia and she ended up passing away. With my second I had gestational diabetes and had to follow a really strict diet and take my blood sugar after every meal. My third was a miscarriage. With my second I had fourth degree tearing, and as I sat in the hospital talking with a friend I said that I could never do it again. She had two beautiful little girls and very wisely told me to wait a few weeks. She said you won't forget, but it won't seem like a big deal because what you have is so worth it. And she was right...by the time my son was 9 months old we were ready to start trying again.",

            "answer": "I had problems with my last pregnancy, between the pain of a fibroid I gave plus coming in just above the cut off for g diabetes, the panic of having to deliver early because of where my fibroid is...I understand the feeling. We are now 19 weeks, still dealing with the fibroid issue, the new hospital/ob I picked for this one though seems much more on top of things and informative as to how we will handle things if the fibroid keeps growing, pre tested for diabetes...I feel more relaxed even with the complications we are facing. Although they are leaning towards c-section (my others were vaginal delivery) has me freaked, but unlike last time, not finding out there could be a problem until I was 34 weeks. It's nice knowing ahead what we may be facing.",
