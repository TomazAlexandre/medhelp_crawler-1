            "answer": "Hi there,The course of disease and prognosis varies in every patient and may depend on the stage of disease and other parameters like creatinine clearance etc.Pregnancy is usually uneventful unless there is poorly controlled blood pressure, a bad histological picture or poor renal function with a creatinine clearance of less than 70 ml a minute. The adverse outcomes in fetus are fetal prematurity, low birth weight, and neonatal deaths while in mother are preeclampsia, eclampsia, or abruptio placenta. The prognosis during pregnancy depends entirely on the pre-pregnancy levels of proteinuria, level of kidney damage and creatinine .Do write to me again with more details.Best luck and take care!",
