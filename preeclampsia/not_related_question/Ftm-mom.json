Then when it comes back I drink more water. Its not like I dont drink water, I do but I guess not enough. Id try that first. If that dosnt work. Try some sugar like kat0598 said. That has helped for me aswell in the past. I dont have blood sugar issues. When your pregnant though your body changes and you can develop problems youve never had before. My first pregnacy I developed anemia. My second, carpel tunnel and hypothirodism. I had been checked a year before my second pregnacy for the thyroid issue and it had been fine then. This is my third pregnacy. Take it from me. Dont panic! Try water then sugar. But do tell your doctor irrigadless if that works or not.",

Tylenol is the only thing safe to take during pregnancy but it doesn't do much for me. Lavender and peppermint essential oils help, just be sure it's pure quality. I use young living. Just put a drop on the back of your neck and/or temples. (careful to avoid eyes with peppermint,\u00a0\u00a0you can use a carry oil if you are sensitive to the peppermint)",

There's so many things that can cause headaches, so it's hard to say what to try. I've heard they can be caused by various vitamin deficiencies, and with the baby taking all your nutrients, it's easy for that to happen, even if you're taking a prenatal vitamin. Especially if your diet isn't that balanced. Ask your doctor, maybe they can check your nutrient levels, or suggest something else.",
