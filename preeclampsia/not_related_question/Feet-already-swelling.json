            "answer": "My ankles have been swelling for almost a month now. It's not everyday, usually when I spend more time on my feet or when I'm hot (summer is slowly creeping in here in NH). Yesterday was actually the first day in a month my ankles looked completely normal. Also I seem to have developed an extra crease around my ankles because of the constant swelling. My dr said to make sure I'm drinking plenty of water, elevate my feet when possible but also to stay active.",

            "answer": "It's probably nothing, and just normal swelling from being on your feet a lot or hot weather, but a warning sign for pre eclampsia is swelling on one side... I'd get that checked out sooner rather than later at your doctor or hospital if it were me (I'm usually not one to recommend medical intervention but in this case better to be safe than sorry as with pre eclampsia your body just kinda starts shutting down).",
