            "answer": "hey hi. I too underwent my first IVF embryo transfer on dec 20th 2007. But yes I know what the 2ww is like. its like going through hell everytime you think of what will happen in the test. Bbut you have to wait for atleast 12days before you get ur upt done. that is because since u were on hcg shots prolly the hcg levels remain until 8-10days of the shots . That is why your preg test will show positive in all cases. inshort let me make things easier for you to understand that if a man is given hcg shots he too willl be shw positive if he gets pregnancy test done . so please wait > lots and lots of baby dust to u and best of luck :) hugs",

The more you think about it and stress yourself the more it has negative effects unfortunately. i tried to keep my mind off it\u00a0\u00a0everytime i was tempted to get the upt done before the scheduled date :) if ur test shows negative go in for a beta hcg test that will confirm ur doubts .",

My hcg was 64 and E2 was 1080. Both doctor and nurse were so happy because my case was kinda tough. I'm very thankful to get this great news before Easter day! Although this is my first cycle, I've been struggling to give up because of the pain from average of 4 injections per day since March 2nd. My cycle is pretty long. The spent about three weeks, maybe more than that, for stimulation to produce eggs. Basically, I don't produce any hormones on my own. I always depend on medication to get regular period. I've been told by my ed dr long time ago that I would need to see an infertility doctor when I'm ready to have a baby.Cindy, yeah I guess my time table might be similar to yours now.

My dr said this could be a so called \"chemical pregnancy\" and it's probably because this is my first few eggs released in my life, and they were not very healthy. ..Yesterday I had my another blood test done. Result has not come yet. I'm so nervous. I think if HCG continues to show low, then I will probably have to start another cycle......",

I asked my doctor when to have ultrasound, she said at least hcg climbs up to a few thousand, hopefully next or next next week.

I have an endometriosis and I only have one ovary. My one ovary produced 10 eggs and my 10 eggs produced 7 embryos. My doctor transfered 2 and later found out only 1 embryo survived from the 5 that were left. I was dissapointed. I didn't know what I will do if my blood test was negative. I do not have another 15,000 dollars to spend on this procedure. Well, I am pregnant. I just found out, I am pregnant. So, both home pregnancy tests were inaccurate. I hope this helps.

I had a blastosyst transfer and my trigger injection was 12 days ago. I know I should have waited, but I was too worried. Could I be pregnant or is it better to wait for another 10 days?",

It is 12 days after the transfer now and tomorrow I will have my first blood test and then I will have a second one on Wednesday to check if my hormonal levels are rising. I have been pregnant before, but had a miscarriage, so I am really really scared and anxious about this pregnancy. I hope things will work out and I hope I will stop worrying and ask 1000 questions with no answers.How are you coping?Take careMary",

Monday (after a fight with the gynae) I had them implanted and had no symtoms for a week then pain from Hell. My ovaries were over stimulated and they scanned and casually mentioned there was ... an implant!Well the month I turned 42, I gave birth to Hannah, healthy happy and although an eight month baby, nearly 7lb in weightI just wanted to say, I take my hat off to those who go through\u00a0\u00a0than one cycle and to their husbands too and I had no symptoms until the implant was found and the pregnancy test on 12th day. Age wasnt a factor it seems and neither was the number of eggsBaby dust to all of you :-)",

    "question": "Hi, my name is Ana, 32 (in may 16), Brazilian. I have PCOS.I went through my 4 IVF cycle . My embryo transfer was made on saturday morning. We transfer 2 , Looking good blastocyst, everything was ok. I just felt same cramping but nothing bad. Then I though this time Things will be different.The Dr. said not to take the pharmacy test , it will be positive because of the HCG injection I did Last saturday(04-26) at 8:00pm, But I couldn't wait. I took this morning and it was negative. Is that possible? It was only 9 days after the HCG injection I suppose it will be positive. Does that same thing happen with anybody here before. Should I call the Dr.?Hope everybody can understand what I wrote.Thank you!",
