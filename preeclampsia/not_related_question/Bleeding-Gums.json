            "answer": "Swollen, red, tender gums that bleed when you floss or brush are a sign of pregnancy gingivitis, and they're a common complaint during pregnancy. (About half of moms-to-be have these symptoms.) The inflammation is caused by higher progesterone levels that make your gums more sensitive to the bacteria in plaque and by increased blood supply to your mouth.hope that helps a bit more. i have never heard of bleeding gums being a sign of preeclampsia.",
