            "answer": "The drip to speed up contractions isnt nice, but it really depends on the method they use on you. There is a gel that they can use to encourage the cervix to open, as far as I am aware it doesnt cause a labour any more painful than a spontaneous one. If it were me I would ask to try that before letting them use the drip. Be very aware of all your pain relief options, you may need them (but you might not!!)",
