(he laso had a blood blister from all the trauma) But other than that, he was perfect!! I pushed for 1 hour and 20 min. The pain was only really intense the last 5 hours or so. I would have had him sooner if he was coming down the birth canal correctly, so I wonder how this experience will be. Birth is amazing and once you see your little baby, all that pain from pushing and the contractions just disappear! It truly is a miracle!",

Spinal was a breeze- a little weird but quick and easy with no lasting effects. I had a reaction on the table, but the anesthesiologist injected something into my IV and the rest is a foggy daze. In recovery, i didn't really care that I had a baby and that makes me sad. The first night was rough because I had them very carefully monitoring me, checking my urine, levels, BP, etc... every hour. I think this is not typical but rather due to the preeclampsia. I had to have magnesium sulfate for my BP and that has its own side effects too.But... it couldn't have been THAT bad since I'm doing it again...",
