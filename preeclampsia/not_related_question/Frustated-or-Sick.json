            "answer": "People don't tell you that after the cute little baby phase comes the overwhelming, tough, and stressful phase. I was a young mom and had very little patience when I had my oldest daughter. She wasn't a bad kid now that I look back at it, she was a normal and curious little girl. I found myself yelling at her all the time. I am not proud of it at all. I remember telling myself to be easier on her and not yell at her, yet I still continued to do so. I have deep regret for how I treated her as a child. I never hit her but I was constantly yelling at her which is just as bad. She would yell back at me and how could I blame her. She was learning from me. I finally got it but I always worry it was too late. I hate to think that I damaged her emotionally but I'm sure I did. She is an amazing, smart and loving\u00a0\u00a0little 8 year old girl now and I am so proud to be her mom. My point is, it's not too late to change. How we treat and raise our kids in their younger years really effect who they are later in life. If we respect them they will learn to respect us. Parenting is very hard but you can do it :-)",

It's a great way to make friends for you and your kid, but you also get to share some of those frustrations with them as your kids get to blow off some steam together. Wish you the best, I know how it is to live in one room... I too did so for first 2 years of my marriage and it was really something! Cudos to you for making it with a baby plus hubby!.

We moved from overseas while i was 7 mo pregnant. I had preeclampsia and went into seizures,\u00a0\u00a0Almost died.\u00a0\u00a0Had horrible post partum. When the boys were toddler aged i found myself miserable with life.\u00a0\u00a0I yelled at them constantly. I was so mean to them.\u00a0\u00a0We lived above his parents store in a run down loft like thing.\u00a0\u00a0Was dirty, so cold... i know how you're feeling. You're heading down a path where regret and guilt will follow.\u00a0\u00a0I am remarried now and the twins are almost teens.\u00a0\u00a0We have a 6 yr old and a baby girl on the way. We own a home, I am truly happy.\u00a0\u00a0But i have regret. My 6 year old is wonderful.\u00a0\u00a0However i didn't yell at him for the same things i yelled at the twins for.\u00a0\u00a0It makes me feel less than a good mother.\u00a0\u00a0I sucked as a mommy to my twins.\u00a0\u00a0No amount of loving them now will make up for it. Their\u00a0\u00a0behavior, attitudes, choices they make,\u00a0\u00a0I will forever wonder if that's my fault. I guess my point is this.\u00a0\u00a0I know it's hard and impossible right now.\u00a0\u00a0You have to put yourself on hold for your kid. But please try to find help. Find a playdate partner or something.\u00a0\u00a0You need space to breathe. It's hard enough trying to be a good mother with help around. Let your kid get dirty, play with your pots and spoons. Let him play with the clean laundry before you fold it.\u00a0\u00a0Then show him how to help you do it and tell him what a great helper he is! You have to make it ok for you to be unorganized sometimes with him kicking things over and such. That is totally normal.\u00a0\u00a0You have to find something else for him to do.\u00a0\u00a0Have art time with him,\u00a0\u00a0do stuff to keep him occupied. You'll be ok.\u00a0\u00a0:) Hang in there. Just keep telling yourself that you're doing the best you can. That's all any of us do.",

Google your area and see where the meetings are.\u00a0\u00a0They are usually at churches but you don't have to belong to that church or be religious to join.I worry a little about your anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0That is something to talk to your doctor about.\u00a0\u00a0They can help you hon.\u00a0\u00a0Medication can be a god send.anyway, sorry it is hard.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate your honest and hope it gets better for you.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, head start could be a good thing too.\u00a0\u00a0Some super active kids have a bit going on that a professional can spot and begin early intervention with (which is so wonderful for helping a child get on track).\u00a0\u00a0good luck",

It is not safe for children, one minute a child is playing and the nxt he's missing and nobody saw anything. Guess thats why i keep him indoors.Your stories realy lifted some weight off of me.

    "question": "Firstly, all of you who have negative comment that dont help please dont reply.I am 23 year old mom to a 10month old baby boy. We are a less fortunate family so we live in a 1 room (rented) with my hubby. We practically cook, bath, sleep, play in the same room, moslty at the same time. From 6am to 7:30pm am alone. No family nearby, no friends cos am not a socialiser. At least i chat to u guys here so ur my friends. Am shy, i dnt talk much, i cant get a job either cos am afraid of going to interviews. I do apply and they called, but then i tremble, sweat and start stattering.As my son moves around a lot he touches and plays with things he shouln't, like electric plugs and stoves, he breaks mugs and plates and cupboard doors, he hits his head against the wall. I try to control myself but i do get mad, so mad that even hit his hands\u00a0\u00a0a little three times so far.Like when i fold clothes he waits for me to finish and then go inside and unpack them all, he even kicks the dustbin so it fells and he emptys it right after i finished cleaning. Sometimes he cries in the middle of the night like 3hours. He wont play with any toy i bought him. Am afraid am going crazy and my baby hates me. I dont know whats going on. Am afraid i will lose it one day and hit him like a grown up. What should i do?Sorry for the long passage. Please advice.",
