    "question": "Ok, since I have been pg, I have been tracking my weight gain weekly at home.\u00a0\u00a0I started out overweight, so I wanted to make sure I kept within the recommended guidelines for my pre-pregancy weight group.\u00a0\u00a0As of this week, I have gained a total of 14 pounds and Im approx. 26 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Now, that's right in line with where I should/can be.After my visit to the OB last night at 7:15pm for my routine checkup, their scale said I had gained 10pds in the last month!\u00a0\u00a0I was upset and basically freaking out.\u00a0\u00a0The midwife explained to me how to cut back on calories that were empty, you know, the whole talk about watching weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0I listened carefully and fully understood that I would have to watch.\u00a0\u00a0I was still a little taken back since my scale at home showed 4 pounds gained this past month.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, I had lost 2pds when I had my kidney infection, so I had been happy when I gained those 2 pounds back and then another 2.After I got home and talked to DH, he suggested that I get on our scale to see if it matched the office's scale. Sure enough, it did.\u00a0\u00a0My scale was working just fine. Well, then I took off my two sweaters and cords and low and beyond, I was 3 pounds less.\u00a0\u00a0(I had on a thin sweater with a heavy sweater over it b/c I was cold and Im not quite ready to wear my winter coat.)\u00a0\u00a0I always take off my shoes to be weighed at the OB since my shoes are a tad heavy - they are Dansko clogs.\u00a0\u00a0Btw, these are the most comfortable shoes ever..atleast for me!Anyway, went I got up this am, before eating breakfast, I weighed myself like I do every week and voila...I was back to the weight I thougth I was.\u00a0\u00a0What a relief!I think it was a combo of my heavier winter clothes and that I had just eaten whole can of tomato soup for dinner before heading over to the office.\u00a0\u00a0I plan on discussing this with my OB at my next appointment.Just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else has run into this problem. The only thing now is that my chart is flagged for weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Oh well....can't win them all.",
