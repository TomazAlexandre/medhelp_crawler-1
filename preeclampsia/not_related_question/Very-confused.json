    "question": "So my blood pressure before I got pregnant was always 90/60.. since I've been pregnant it has stayed at a steady 116/66 almost every time I go into the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0The past few days I have had headaches, felt like my blood was pumping ten times harder, and recently had blurry/twinkly vision. Went to a local store to check my blood pressure on a machine and it's 124/77. So my concerns are since I'm normally low is this considered high blood pressure for me? I talked to the doctor on call and she said my blood pressure is normal but I could come get checked just in case. .. but I don't understand how it's normal since its usually low and I have all these symptoms... I hope this makes sense. I'm just so confused on what to do. Anyone else have this problem?",
