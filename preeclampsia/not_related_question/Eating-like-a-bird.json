I'm a first time mom and everyone I asked said it was the opposite, but I barely gained 10lbs during my whole pregnancy and whenever I ate I felt a ton on pressure and bloating, especially on my ribs. But then after about 35 weeks my baby dropped and it was like the cravings took over. Now I can't stop eating and have gained another four lbs in just a week. I thought it was preeclampsia and got worried, but my doctor said there's no protein in my urine and my blood pressure is normal, so he was just in the way and sitting too high. Now that he's dropped and I can eat I feel a lot better. Before I had to force myself to eat when I wasn't full because I thought he wasn't getting enough to eat, but it turns out he was just sitting too high.",
