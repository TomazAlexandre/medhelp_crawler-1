I went to my checkup 2 days ago and mentioned it to my docter, he looked at my legs and and told me it is a very common problem. If you put more weight on one side of your body or if you sleep more on one side this can happen. You could mention it to your docter just to be sure but I'm sure there is nothing to worry about, I'm 33 weeks btw.",

My baby is always on the right, the side that swells. He told me to get in a pool at the end of the day or to elevate my feet above my heart. He also said as long as your skin color stays the same, not to worry. But if it turns purple or red, that is a cause for concern.",
