Especially if you've been trying to stay off of them. Have you noticed if your face is swelling any? Is one foot/ankle swollen more than the other? That's usually a dead giveaway for preeclampsia.It could be something totally normal for you, but I'd still err on the cautious side and get it checked out.In the meantime try laying on your left side.",

Then you can call your ob tomorrow, but if your face starts to swell call your ob ASAP.I just went through a crazy swelling scare this week so the info was fresh in my mind. Hope this helps. Oh and it seems silly, but the more water you drink the more it will go down.",

I have NEVER had any of that.\u00a0\u00a0I just swell. It's always my feet/legs and hands.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with NicMom...lay down and relax. Prop your feet up, lay on your left side and take it easy. Drink a lot of water.\u00a0\u00a0Lack of water can cause swelling to get out of hand during pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Stay AWAY from salt and caffiene.\u00a0\u00a0I know caffiene is a diuretic but too much can have the opposite affect.\u00a0\u00a0If you notice any facial swelling or numbness, don't call, just go straight to L & D.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, call your ob in the morning and ask if you can have them look at it just for peace of mind.Btw, I've had swelling WORSE than yours.\u00a0\u00a0To the point where I almost couldn't walk because my legs were so heavy and fat. After my 2nd full term pregnancy I was put on diuretics and I literally lost almost 30 lbs of water weight my first two weeks postpartum.",
