    "question": "Just wondering how many were told by their Dr. that they would probably deliver early and then actually DID?I know that some get very anxious and excited about delivering early and then they end up going OVER their due date. So I just want to keep a good perspective about whether or not to take it too seriously.My Dr. said I have 4 things that could suggest an early delivery---my age, number of previous children, placenta problem early in this pregnancy, and I am also measuring 2 weeks bigger than I should be.What have your experiences been?",
