    "question": "So long story short, the other day I was outside with my boyfriend and his father, not for long, maybe 45 minutes but all of a sudden I got really dizzy and couldn't see anything and passed out. Luckily, I was standing right next to his Dad and he caught me so I didn't fall or anything. I called the doctor and he said that it must've been the heat, or could be my blood pressure. He didn't seem too worried which put my mind at ease. But when I got home later, I still didn't feel right and was throwing up in the middle of the night and also realized it looked like my feet were even more swollen then they already were. The next day, was my baby shower and at first I was okay then all of a sudden that feeling hit me again. I didn't faint or anything but my body felt really weak and my head was pounding. Has this happened to anyone else?",
