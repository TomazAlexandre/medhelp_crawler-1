My son was premature 7 weeks (born @ 33 weeks), which is a precaution with us PCOSers. But I was able to breastfeed no problem! I nursed for 18 months. In fact I made enough milk I sometimes pumped after he nursed. My milk came in with avengeance the morning after he was born. When I got too hot & was full if near full is start leaking, in the shower I'd start leaking. Probably tmi but I made milk & I have PCOS.",

I read that some were else too that you have a higher chance to give birth early and have Preeclampsia\u00a0\u00a0I had HELLP thats worst then Preeclampsia. I was already on my death bed when I went in to labor with DD I lost so much blood and had to have a emergency c sec and was sent to the ICU after I had her. I was in a coma for two days, doc didnt think I was going to make it but you know god he is more prowerful then you think. and both baby and I did just fine. but now that I look back and see what all happend to me I blame it all on having PCOS.I hope this time around its not like that. and I really want to breastfeed this time too, I tried so hard the last time to that my boobs were black and blue. and I had to stop.thanks girls for giving me some hope.",
