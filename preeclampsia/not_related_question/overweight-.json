It's all in your pelvic and hips to see how wide they are. So i wouldn't worry. I'm only 20wks and have gained 15 pounds already,\u00a0\u00a0and my dr hasn't said anything yet about my weight.\u00a0\u00a0And with my first pregnancy i gained 30 pounds and had a natural birth.... Also your baby is only part of your weight, then you have the amniotic fluid and the placenta that makes up for the rest.",

So your doc is full of crap. It's different for everyone regardless of size. Small women who don't gain much end up with gestational diabetes too. It's something ALL pregnant women have a chance to get, not just us \"over weight\" pregnant ladies. I surely didn't have it with my first. How far along are you?",

I actually gained an extreme amount with my first and didn't have diabetes or high blood pressure or anything. It's up to your body to give birth. Back in the old days they didn't have inductions or weight limits or c sections because of fear. If your doctor can't handle a little challenge that's her problem.she shouldn't be making you feel bad for gaining weight. Besides if you're worried about the weight loss afterwards all you need to do is exercise and breastfeed<- it brings off weight like crazy. Don't let them talk you into anything you don't want.",

(Not to say that you would or even try...But it can happen when you can't think of anything healthy you want to eat and you're craving junk food..you just decide it's better to just skip eating all together instead of eating bad) Eat some fruit, veggies as snacks. Lean beef, chicken, turkey, and white fish with veggies and whole grains. Try to stay away from sugar and artificial sweeteners. These can be addictive, and added to much of the fast foods that are out there which makes it harder to resist. If doctor thinks that your baby is already big try eating simple proteins like beans at lunch instead of meat at lunch and dinner. Just passing on what my nutritionist told me to help with my eating habits. I actually don't eat enough, and when I do, it's not the most healthy foods. Then I start to feel bad that I'm not eating right so I'll skip meals so I don't eat wrong thing.",

    "question": "Went to the doc's yesterday and she said i was overweight. Before being pregnant i weighed 112 now im 150 i gained 37 pounds. Im past the average by 15 pounds. She said I will have a hard time during labor because im making a big baby, also I wont be able to have natural birth because baby's to big and will get c section and labor is harder for overweight mothers.Also said Im prone to give my baby gestational diabetes and get high blood pressure, and mentioned pregnancy fat is hard to lose after. I want to have a natural birth. How and what can i do to lose this excess weight. :( I feel so bad now. I ate too much.",
