If it wasn't for the surgery and having the stitches put in, I would only have .5 cm let of my cervix left. The doctors will do everything in their power to help you and your baby.

They do not see anything wrong and I have no pregnancy related medical issues. The Mfm doctor told me he isn't worried but then said he is recommending bed rest to my OB and I am now coming in for weekly monitoring. I am confused on how to feel but am glad I see my OB in an hour!",
