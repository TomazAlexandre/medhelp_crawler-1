            "answer": "No reason to be scared... I've read a lot of responses against induction on here... if your doctor feels it's best and your body is starting the preparation for labor...somewhat dilated/effaced... there is a chance you'll breeze through it!I've been induced twice... third induction will be 11/18...I've never had any issues. It is different for each women. Trust your doctor and ask them to explain it to u next week! Good luck!!! :-)",

    "question": "I'm 37 weeks and 1 day. Today I went into the Drs to be checked and they couldn't read the stress test. So they ended up telling me I had to go to the Hospital. Well I was there all day. Good results thank the Lord above. I'm now scheduled to be induced on 11/17 early in the morning. Last week he weighed in @ 6 pounds 14 ounces. Gaining a half pound a week. I'm happy because we have it scheduled but at the same tone hoping I go in the natural way before that date. I'm scared because I have never been induced.I had my son 7 years ago natural!!!What does being induced mean and should I be scared????",
