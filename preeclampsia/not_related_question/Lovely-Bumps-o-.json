            "answer": "Is this your first? I thought you had a child but maybe I'm confusing you with someone else. Well I think around 39 weeks I feel more comfortable with using natural induction techniques (lots of sex, lots of walking, etc.). Before then I feel baby might not be done \"cooking\". I also believe pregnancy can last up to 42 weeks. The only reason doctors consider pregnancy to be 40 weeks was because a German doctor centuries ago stated that as fact and no one refuted it. But evidence has shown that pregnancy is safe up to 42 weeks and even up to 44 weeks. I think getting monitored after 40 weeks, if it makes a mom feel more comfortable, is a great idea as well to make sure the placenta is not deteriorating. However if a mom has risk factors she should be induced as soon as safe for everyone.Okay I'm super rambly and not sure what I just wrote has anything to do with what you're asking, ha ha!It was more like the last month that dragged on for me. I tried to stay busy and do a lot of nesting. When I got bored I'd read, read, read because I knew reading wouldn't come easy with a newborn and I'm a bookworm.",

I got preeclamptic and doctor sent me to labor and delivery, It was all of the sudden, and a shock to me.With this one I pray I wont get preeclampsia at term again. And im going to try to labor naturally. In a way its like being pregnant for the first time again, because my first labor was medically induced.I think so far my pregnancy has flown by, and I cant believe Im 28 wks. I still remember ttc, and wonder who our next bub will be... and here i am 28 wks w a little boy.. Still very unreal and in my mind it seems may is so far away.",

I was induced with my first so my second I wanted to go into labor by myself. Its a different world waiting for contractions to start and then wondering if you are in labor and rushing to the hospital. I almost missed my epidural (infact because I progressed so fast I wasn't even supposed to have gotten it). I think ill be induced next time. It was a lot less stressful.",

I remember peeing on a stick and just bawling my eyes out (a good cry), I remember hearing a heartbeat for the first time (still have it on my phone), and watching my little one say hi to mom on the ultrasound for the first time. Now that I am feeling good movements all the time, I don't want to be done being pregnant!Tuesday I will be 29 weeks and it makes me sad that I am nearing the end. I do feel rushed to have everything in place. I still don't have a crib (next weekend we are getting one) or a carseat/stoller (waiting on mail delivery) and it makes me nervous. I can already feel nesting occuring. When I hit week 30 I am sure I will be in full panic mode!My sister is 5 weeks ahead of me, so when she goes into labor I am sure I will be so terrified that I might go early myself! lol",
