As far as if you join the 2-3 month community, you can look ahead and see what the 5-6 month ladies are dealing with.

To have just communities for the MONTHS (like 4th Month of Pregnancy, etc.) would mean people would have to move to a different community every month and not \"stay put\".",

    "question": "Hi,We wanted to ask each of you what you thought of an idea we were looking into. We are considering setting up a community for pregnant women, but centered around the month of your pregnancy. So, either '2 months pregnant' or \"February babies\", something like that. The thinking being, that each month of pregnancy poses different challenges, steps, and experiences so being able to connect with other pregnant women in the same month would be beneficial.These would not replace the existing communities, but will just be additional ones. Let us know what you think and thanks for being part of MedHelp!MedHelp",
