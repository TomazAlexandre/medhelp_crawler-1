I was already 5 days overdue but it wasn't bad at all, the scariest thing was knowing so I got no sleep the night before, and my epidural was amazing ! I could actually enjoy giving birth it was a very calm sentimental experience, some people have bad experiences some dont, don't base you getting one or not getting one on our experiences because everyone is very different ... You will make the official decision when your in labor :)",

            "answer": "My labor was actually pretty easy..(at the time i didnt think so) but trust me as soon as you see your baby its like the pain just dissapears :) i was induced friday the 6th at 5pm they put a cervidlil, i wasn't dialated at all. They took the cervidil out around 1am saturday the 7th and let me sleep until 6am, i was dialated 2cm, she gave me a little pain meds in the IV and went and stretched my cervix(i only felt some presure didnt hurt much). She got me to 3cm and broke my water i was 6cm at 5pm and thats when everything kinda slowed down and contractions got 2min apart and were lasting about 45 min each, i got the epidural and went to sleep they checked me at 8pm and i was still at 6cm again at 11pm and i was at 7cm then i went to sleep again and at 1am they checked me and i was at 10cm :) took a hour and a half of pushing and i had my baby 9pounds 1 ounce i tore a little(4stiches) and really thats the only thing that hurt afterwards, the epidural felt like it was stillin my back for a few days but didnt hurt. Dont worry have a good support person there and stay positive.",

The Doc wanted to break my water to speed up the process but I said no, and not even a hour later it broke.As far as the epidural, I will never get one again. It was a terrible experience for me. Hurt like heck and it didn't even work. Like at all. And I still have back pain from it. I am terrified of natural child birth again, but I never want anything in my spine again. But everyone I know who got the epidural swear by it. Some complain of back pain,though.",

            "answer": "I didn't feel the epidural being put in cause they numb around the area before putting it in, you kind of just feel like ice is being pumped in you lol. Its so cold everytime it releases medicine. I did however feel like i was being stuck with a needle when i put pressure on my back for 2 days, but they stuck me 3 times before they could get it between my spine. But it felt much better than sitting there in so much pain. They do make the localized ansthesics they just put a needle in the iv and inject medicine that numbs you too, but unlike the epidural the baby gets effected with the localized(i got it twice before the epidural, it lasts about 2/3 hours). I know some people say dont get the drugs cause it has effects on baby, but the baby goes threw more pain then we do during a vaginal birth so i had no problem getting the localized it just gave the baby some pain medicine too. She stayed in the birth canal for 21 hours, her poor head was all banged up from it she would scream when the nurses touched it i felt so bad for her and she got shoulder distocia(when a babys shoulder gets a pinched nerve, fractured or broken during birth) so i was happy i got some meds for her. They are really strong though cause now shes perfectly fine and happy.",

I hated the epidural because of the back pain afterwards and plus I had to lay there for an extra hour and let the epidural wear off and the pitocin to finish. I wanted to see my son so bad. He had to go to special care because his sugar was low.My water did break on it's own and I got to feel the first contractions before I they made me get the epidural. I didn't think the contractions hurt they were more surprising and uncomfortable. And they made me think I had to pee.",

            "answer": "I really don't want to be induced either. There is a higher risk the baby will produce meconium when they're being born but aside from that there isn't any reason to do it in my opinion. You're also more likely to need stronger pain relief as the drugs they give you to boost contractions make them hurt more. Lots of pain relief in turn can then slow down your labour, meaning a higher chance you'll need a c section.I'm not sure what the medical system is like where you are (I'm in the UK) but here we are always given the option for induction (unless there's a medical reason) so don't feel pressured :)",

I feel like drs everywhere now without the mom or baby having a problem and I heard that being induced like some of you said makes it hurt worse and could casue further problems unless im overdue or have a problem im going to hope to do it naturally.",
