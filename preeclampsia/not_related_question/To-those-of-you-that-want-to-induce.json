            "answer": "tshock,\u00a0\u00a0I'm really sorry for the difficulties you and your sons have had.Having been a birthing class instructor,\u00a0\u00a0and a labor and delivery companion in a high risk hospital,\u00a0\u00a0I think you need to go back and look again at your son's medical records to set your mind at ease - I sense you feel some remorse about your inductions.With your first baby,\u00a0\u00a0induced at 44 weeks of gestation weighing 7 pounds 13 ounces,\u00a0\u00a0I think the pediatrician was making a wry joke when he/she said your baby should have been in the oven a little longer.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't sound at all like a preemie - but rather,\u00a0\u00a0a baby carried so long that the placenta deteriorated and he was no longer getting enough oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0At the end of a pregnancy,\u00a0\u00a0the placenta kind of gets \"old\" and begins to degrade,\u00a0\u00a0and that triggers labor to begin.\u00a0\u00a0In some mothers,\u00a0\u00a0the placenta degrades but doesn't cause labor to begin,\u00a0\u00a0and the baby is left in the uterus without enough oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0Heart monitoring is done at that time and it if it appears the baby is getting too little oxygen,\u00a0\u00a0they are diagnosed with \"placental insufficiency\" and labor is induced.\u00a0\u00a0It's likely if your OB didn't induce your son a month after he was due,\u00a0\u00a0he would have died in utero.I'm not sure what the details of your second son's birth and health are,\u00a0\u00a0but babies born at 5 pounds 4 ounces (and about a month premature) usually do quite well unless there's an underlying health issue.\u00a0\u00a0Your baby was full term,\u00a0\u00a0very small for full term,\u00a0\u00a0and has had lifelong health problems.The reason I say all this,\u00a0\u00a0is I think you've carried a lifetime of self-doubt believing you should have carried your babies longer.I think the evidence points to exactly the opposite - in both cases,\u00a0\u00a0it sounds like there was an underlying health cause or lack of a healthy placenta that caused your baby's problems,\u00a0\u00a0not the fact that they weren't carried extreme lengths of time.God bless.",

But I know what you mean it drives me nuts when I see someone getting induced for small or no reason. Most of them lead to more interventions and alot end in c section because the uterus and such isn't ready. We know how to give birth but no we would rather give that right to a doctor.",

            "answer": "As much as I know this post has good intentions I don't think anyone on here has a right to lecture anyone else. As you said every pregnancy, and person is different. Not everyone has a high tolerance for the aches of pregnancy. Some women ache and hurt more than others, and some women are comfortable most of their pregnancy. I am sincerely sorry you've had such difficulties, but I honestly don't truly believe any trained ob/gyn, or midwife would ever induce a baby without cause, or without regard to the healthrisks or benefits. What about gestational diabetics, or preeclampsia patients? Most of them get induced, and yes sometimes it isn't best for baby, but neither is extreme stress on mom. I appreciate you sharing your story and experience, and I get what you're saying, but being pregnant gives me and every other woman entitlement to moan. It is not a cake walk: physically, mentally, or emotionally. I just feel like thos post rubbed me kind of wrong, because it seems almost like a guilt trip to anyone on here who is full term and trying.to speed things up with walking, sex etc.I am sure being pregnant has made you have to experience everything we all have. People lecturing.us, criticisms, and undue judgement. I just feel like this is a safe place for us to come and get sympathy, advice, or even understanding when no one else can, or will. I just think maybe you should think about those things and just embrace everyone whether theyre a bunch of whiners or not.",

            "answer": "I was induced with my son on his due date due to my small frame and not being able to handle a big baby and I ended up having a c section because I could not dilate past a five even after my water breaking. Yes I feel guilty in knowing that if I was not induced I may have beeb able to have a vaginal birth. Also I am having a repeat c section with my little girl due to complications and because of my frame. I will have her once I hit 37 weeks. As long as I do not go into labor before. Often times women donr have a choice and it is best to have baby out. Doctors would not let you have baby sooner if they thought it was a bad idea",

            "answer": "To All concerned:I'm sorry if my words sounded like I was bashing every single woman out there\u00a0\u00a0for wanting to be induced early.I know that there are times when inducement is a medical necessity.I also wasn't trying to \"complain\" about my previous pregnancies.I wrote this because I had read\u00a0\u00a0too many posts written by young women who wanted to be induced in their early third trimester simply because they could no longer wait to see the baby they are ( were ) carrying.Some wanted their baby to be born on a certain day ( even if it meant it was a month early ), some were just impatient.I am NOT talking about women who are a week or so away...nor am I talking about women with diabetes, complications, or who just want to vent their frustrations.I AM talking about those that want their baby born early for \" other \" reasons...those that will go to any means to have their baby early...even if it means doing something that may cause death to the themselves or their baby.One young lady who PM'ed me two years ago thought that if the baby came early that she would get more attention from her boyfriend...those kind of women are the ones this was meant for.I have been sent way too many PM's by young women asking me how to bring their baby on early. They want to know which teas, douches, medications etc would bring the baby on early.One young lady even asked if ( something I won't mention here because doing so would be unethical and deadly ) would help to break the water...THOSE are the young women I was focusing on when I wrote the above statement.As most of you agree, my statement that \" every woman is different, as is each pregnancy \" is correct.The being pregnant for \"9 months\" thing is just an average.\u00a0\u00a0So is \"your baby should be able to do this, that, and the other thing by _ months of age\"...it is an average.We don't ALL get our first set or final set of teeth at the same age...the dentist just tells you that by age 6-7 you should start to lose your first set. Some start earlier...some never do lose the first set.Anyway...I wasn't frowning upon inducement...I was trying to explain to \" certain women \" that inducing themselves could end tragically...for both mom and baby.And as for the quote from the pediatrician...it should have been added below the remarks about my second oldest, not my eldest.I had been copying and pasting consistently while writing my final draft. :(Sorry to all who took that post the wrong way...",

    "question": "I'm willing to bet that 99% of you have no idea that ALL women and ALL pregnancies are different.In my family baby boys die or are born very unhealthy if we do not carry them for 10 months.My eldest son was due on Feb 7, 1988. They induced me on Mar 7...he was a \"blue baby\" weighing only 7lbs 13 oz. They were able to revive him, but he is sickly all the time.The pediatrician said that he should have stayed in the \" oven \" for a while longer.My second oldest ( now 20 years old ) is a very sick young man. He cannot live on his own.I was induced a few days before my due date. He was 5lbs 4 oz.Perhaps I should post pictures on this forum of my little guy...then you could see how \"ugly\" it is to have a transparent baby who needs to live in an incubator for the first two weeks of his life. As a result I never got to bond with him properly. The only way I could touch him was with gloves on and by sticking my hand through a small hole...I never got to cuddle and hold my newborn...and of course breast feeding was out of the question.I KNOW how uncomfortable you all are. I am a very tiny woman...100 lbs soaking wet...I have long legs but not much length in body...I am 5'4\"...3 feet of that is legs, about 6\" for the head, etc...so believe me when I say that I do not have much room to carry a baby. I would literally squish my babies when I would sit...if I could sit. It always felt like they would come out at any second. I could hardly breathe because of the pressure against my lungs. I walked with my legs spread very far apart...looking like a drunk penguin...so you don't need to tell me how uncomfortable you are...I know first hand.However...these are some of the things that you have to put up with if you want a healthy baby.The choice is your's...happy, healthy baby...or your own comfort.Do you want to be able to bond with your baby, or do you want to see your baby in an incubator? Do you want that splendid moment when you hold your precious angel for the first time? Or do you want him/her to be whisked away into another area of the hospital before you have a chance to see what he/she looks like?Would you like to go home with your baby, or would you like to spend the next several months going back and forth between the hospital and home?I only ever got to hold one of my four sons as soon as he was born. The other three were whisked away...of those three I \"only \" had to wait several hours to see them...the other...as said above...I had to wait two weeks to hold him. I cried the whole time. It was the worst thing in the world.And as a side note...if you try to induce yourself, there is the chance that you could cause an infection, damage, etc to your baby...and to yourself.Just some things to think about.",
