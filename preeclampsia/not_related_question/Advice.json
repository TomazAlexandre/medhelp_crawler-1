            "answer": "Hi - It sounds like you have a lot on your plate!Can I assume the the doc you mention is your Primary Care Physician? If so I would go see a neurologist, rather than relying on your PCP to relay information. Before I was diagnosed I saw my PCP, mid major relapse. She didn't think it was MS, but rather dehydration :-) Thankfully she also told me I needed to see a neurologist.We need to be our own healthcare advocates. Don't just accept things your PCP tells you. Your symptoms seem pretty specific to me; facial pain, tinnitus, burning sensations...What diagnostics has she used?I would go see a neurologist :-)Kyle",

            "answer": "Hi Kyle,Thank you for your reply. Im in the UK, my doctor is my GP - General Practitioner, when I first went with symptoms she passed it off as saying her guess was it will go as quickly as it came and also said it was probably dehyration and told me to drink soda water as i could have a salt inbalance.\u00a0\u00a0Oddly also the pains started when i was already on Lyrica/Pregabalin which they prescribed for burning arm pain/neuralgia which seems to have ceased over 4 months, but they advised me to keep taking the lyrica for General anxiety as they thought thats what could have been causing my burning arm.\u00a0\u00a0i accept i have been through alot health wise, but I really dont think my burning arm or even these facial zaps are due to anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0 She asked me to go back if it continued.\u00a0\u00a0I have done and she really has no specific answers, she said if I was suffering from MS id get weakness of the limbs down one side, all I have had is burning arm which has now gone.\u00a0\u00a0i had this for about 5 months after i had recovered from heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0I now have these facial zaps and burning scalp, the facial shocks/zaps i have been having every day for a month, they last seconds.\u00a0\u00a0But because I am not rolling along the floor in agonsising pain, she said its not Trigeminal neuralgia and Trigeminal Neuralgia is almost always on one side, rarely bilateral, mine is bilateral but not at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0She said she will write to the neurologist and explain my symtoms and he can decide if its worth seeing me!\u00a0\u00a0This could take ages.Today I have enquired privately about paying for a consultation to see a Neurologist, but I will still need a referral from my doctor.I know googling symtoms is the worse thing, but all it points to is Trigeminal Neuralgia, which concerns me because I am only 36 and it says likely to be Brain Tumour or MS causing the TN. But I dont have any weak limbs/muscles.\u00a0\u00a0So due to the tinnitus, electric shocks, i also have stiff neck that cracks and sounds like gristle, a few headaches I am thinking its a Brain tumour, I also noticed my Jaw seems displaced and cracks or pops when I eat. This has only happened recently.\u00a0\u00a0I have heavy proteinuria,\u00a0\u00a0very stiff joints sore spine bones, and tested for all autoimmune, all negative. So i dont really know what all my symptoms point to and doctors seem to put it down to anxiety, apart from the protein in my urine which they are referring me to a kidney specialist for.Really appreciate your response, I will source a consultation with a neurologist.Best WishesYvonne",

            "answer": "Hi Yvonne and welcome to our community.\u00a0\u00a0I hope we can help some by walking by your side on your journey to find out what is going on in your body.\u00a0\u00a0Many here would warn you (from their personal experience) that diagnosis can be a long, rough road - especially since you live in the UK.\u00a0\u00a0(Nothing personal, it just seems the decision makers there drag their feet or have little desire to run expensive testing to diagnosis a life-long disease with expensive treatment options.)Multiple Sclerosis - if fact, most inflammatory autoimmune diseases - can be extremely difficult to diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Some people with specific symptoms, MRI findings or spinal fluid analysis results have an easier time.\u00a0\u00a0But even those folks often end up looking back and realizing they actually had symptoms years before being diagnosed.I haven't had a lot of trouble with TN but others here have.\u00a0\u00a0Although most have had symptoms on one side only, a few expanded to bilateral presentations with time.\u00a0\u00a0I think I remember reading somewhere on our forum that bilateral TN is unusual.... except in PwMS (people with MS).\u00a0\u00a0BUT, I believe the initial symptoms of TN on the second side would be expected to appear a significant period of time following the first.There are two trigeminal nerves - left and right (oddly enough!).\u00a0\u00a0They are a matched pair of cranial nerves of twelve sets that carry signals conveying important sensory and/or motor information.\u00a0\u00a0The trigeminals branch into smaller segments only after they move away from the body\u2019s midline.\u00a0\u00a0 To have similar symptoms appear on both sides simultaneously (even if not identically) would require a strategically placed MS brain lesion.Now, how long after your pregnancy did all this start?Pregnancy has a tendency to make the immune system a little less sensitive (so your system doesn\u2019t over-react and harm that only half-familiar baby inside).\u00a0\u00a0When a pregnancy ends a woman\u2019s immune system begins to ramp back to full strength.\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s a vulnerable time for ANY of the autoimmune diseases to show up full(er) force.Most of the additional symptoms you have added don\u2019t sound much like MS - and certainly not brain tumorish.\u00a0\u00a0They could be associated with lots of other rheumatic type inflammatory autoimmune diseases though - and it does NOT matter that initial testing was negative!\u00a0\u00a0As I started before.... these types of problems can be extremely difficult to diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Many have no SPECIFIC diagnostic test (even if some docs claim they do).Hopefully some of our other UK members will be along to help you navigate the health system.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I had a better idea about who would help you more - a neurologist versus a rheumatologist.I do hope you are able to enjoy more of the blessing of your life and your child\u2019s soon.Mary",

            "answer": "Since your doc is having trouble figuring out what you have, you might ask to be tested for Borreliosis.\u00a0\u00a0The European presentation is usually different from North American Lyme, and is usually more concentrated in the nervous system.\u00a0\u00a0Lyme especially likes certain cranial nerves, connective tissue, and joint fluid. As a result, it mimics many neurological and immunological disorders.Ask your doc for a Western Blot, as the screening test is quite unreliable, especially in patients with primarily neuro symptoms.You might find www.lymeneteurope.org helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Most doctors all over the world are sadly unaware of Borrelia and coinfections (other tick borne diseases) that can make it worse.",

            "answer": "Mary & Ricobord,Thank you very much for your replies, for logical and constructive feedback Mary.My baba is10 months old, Mary i know you are right about the what pregnancy does to your immune system, before my pregnancy I had a positive ANA titre of 1;160 Necleolar pattern raynalds and telangesticas on my lips (sp), possible scleroderma, i was tested again while pregnant and my ANA was negative (obviously because my immune system was supressed) i developed pre-eclampsia and then 3 days after birth went into congestive heart failure (Postpartum cardiomyopathy) and severe pulmonary edema, trying not to sound dramatic i nearly died and woke up in intensive care, and very grateful to be here with my baba (she had her own problems!) they dont know the cause of PPCM (1/15000 births) but think its autoimmune when the mothers immune system kicks back in, some antibodies kick off and tackle the heart.\u00a0\u00a0Some mothers pass, some mothers stay in heart failure but on meds for the rest of their lives, and some mothers like myself heal quickly and recover full heart function.\u00a0\u00a0So i am so very lucky.\u00a0\u00a0They dont know why some mothers heal and others dont but it is to do with the immune system but how they are not sureI continued to have high levels of protein in my urine after pregnancy, and still do now 10 months later, which isnt normal, which is why they did the whole auto immune panel tests again, all of which are negative still.\u00a0\u00a0You are also right about the UK dragging their heels with diagnosis for chronic illness's, but at the same time the NHS system saved my daughters life that cost thousands, plus my own in an acute situation, without the worry of insurance.\u00a0\u00a0So it does work sometimes! ;)I have also had a word with myself about if it was a brain tumour would i really have TN start on boths sides although not at the same time (literally the same day!) and yes it would have to be strategically placed, but my mind goes further and illogically plays out scenarios of it could be placed on the left causing compression, but growing and pushing on arteries to the right, causing compression on the right hand side too.\u00a0\u00a0Again I know this is totally irrational thoughts, but i guess with everything that has happened I am a sucker for rarity.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe i should play the lottery )Maybe just the nerves in my face are irratated, but i sure wish it would go away, its getting more frequent each day, and affecting my ears deep inside too.\u00a0\u00a0Doc has checked and no infection.\u00a0\u00a0My scalp burns for periods at a time and the electric shocks have been deliberating tonight.Thank you so much for your support, Its really appreciated.Yvonne",

            "answer": "Hi again Yvonne.\u00a0\u00a0Your answer has triggered several more thoughts but I'm pressed for time at the moment.\u00a0\u00a0Here are a few basic points until later.Have you been tested for B12 deficiency?\u00a0\u00a0Or tried a sub-lingual supplement even if testing showed 'normal range'?\u00a0\u00a0B12 deficiency causes neuro symptoms and is easily treatable unless you wait too long and the damage becomes permanent.\u00a0\u00a0Blood loss, drugs that decrease stomach acid, diet changes and loss of appetite are things that could spark B12 level decline.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe not the whole answer.\u00a0\u00a0Could contribute.Has anyone considered Celiac disease or gluten intolerance without Celiac?\u00a0\u00a0Celiac can cause neuro symptoms even with few or no digestive symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0PwMS sometimes report great improvement when they eliminate gluten from their diet.\u00a0\u00a0(If you are going to be tested for it, do NOT reduce gluten containing products until testing is complete.\u00a0\u00a0Diet change beforehand can invalidate results.)Things like this might be of great value to help you feel better regardless of other diagnostic outcomes.All health care systems have flaws galore.\u00a0\u00a0Ask any citizen, any country.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry I forgot to acknowledge how well your national system worked during your delivery/post-partum/neonatal difficulties.\u00a0\u00a0I remember thinking it must have been a comfort to know you both received the care you needed without additional worry over mounting bills.\u00a0\u00a0Despite my long answer, it's one of the things I forgot to actually say.Please remind me here or by private message if I fail to get back to you.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I lose track of time and promises (as well as answers).\u00a0\u00a0Sad.\u00a0\u00a0But true.Mary",

            "answer": "Hi, Just throwing ideas around, so feel free to ignore :o)These jaw issues didn't by any chance start after having an opp? The reason for the question is that when i had my tonsils out when i was 29, I woke with my jaw screaming 10+ pain, bilateral pain but the left side was the killer shot.I already had an iffy jaw, dentist discovered a couple of yrs prior that my jaw was twisted out of the left socket, so i thought the opp had put it out again but the surgen said the ?? (sorry lost the word again) was probably irretated and it would eventually settle down, a dentist told my mum the same thing last week. I suspect that its a common enough problem for either and it 'usually' does settle, how much time it takes may depend on an individual. hmmm thinking of dental, wisdom teeth can rumble and cause this type of bilateral pain too.The other thing is about mental health, apart from suspecting health anxiety is what your doc is thinking, have you ever had your mental health assessed? If you haven't since the birth and medical issues, then i highly recommend you do, even if its just to discredit that idea, and if you do need some help in that area, then thats got to be a good thing, right?Anyhoo, just thinking out loud so as i said, feel free to ignore :o)Cheers..........JJ",

    "question": "Hello everyone, Ive not been diagnosed with MS and also not having much luck with my doctors.\u00a0\u00a0I've been experiencing what I think is bilateral trigeminal neuralgia &\u00a0\u00a0burning left arm for months (which has now ceased), my doctor doesn't think it's trigeminal neuralgia because it's bilateral and rare! But the pains are electric shocks lasting seconds (pain being a 6 out of 10) and follow the path of the trigeminal nerves, I get them both sides of my face but not at the same time. I get burning scalp sensations lasting minutes or hours. I also get pain in my ears both sides deep inside, constant tinnitus but this can only be heard in a quiet room when I go to bed, and sounds like its in my actual head not ears if thAt doesnt sound odd! Ive occasionally had numbness and tingling in my legs but only once or twice. I've been worried its a brain tumour, or MS. My doc has said all she can do is write to the neurologist and ask what he thinks and whether he wants to see me or not, as my symptoms are too vague. Also I think they think it's all anxiety related as I've been through a lot this last year health wise, mainly heart failure caused by pregnancy and my daughter being born with diaghramatic hernia, we've both recovered and I'm very lucky and blessed. But I don't want them to put everything down to some health anxiety these symptoms are real to me and I'm scared I have a brain tumour, or maybe this could be early onset of MS?Does anyone have advice?
