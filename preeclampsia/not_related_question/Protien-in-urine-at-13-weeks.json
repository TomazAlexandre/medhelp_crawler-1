            "answer": "I had the same thing happen at around twelve weeks and my dr wasn't worried about it. Just drink lots of water! I was scared because I know protein in your urine is a sign of preeclampsia (which my mom had while pregnant) but my ob said that it was normal and can be caused by various things. I wouldn't stress about it too much!",

Her response was, \"oops.\" The bloodwork that was taken in the hospital confirmed it and my bp had been steadily risinguntil it was 159/100 when I delivered.It could just be from ketones being present in your urine if you've been sick. I would just err on the cautious side an keep an eye on it. but generally you don't need to worry til after 20 weeks.",

    "question": "I went to my ob yesterday and when they tested my urine I had +30 protien in my urine. I have not had this happen in either of my pregnancies so I don't know excally what that means. I ended up going to the hospital because of dehydration and they did a urine culture and a bunch of blood work but I was released 2 hours later. The diagnosis was hypermises and a metabolic disturbance. What does all this mean? I'm so confused.",
