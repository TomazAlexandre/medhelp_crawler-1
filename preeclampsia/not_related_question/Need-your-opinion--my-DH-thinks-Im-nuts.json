            "answer": "My OB happened to be a high risk OB. Turns out most of his deliveries are c-sections. Worked out well for me because I actually needed one, but after speaking to a nurse who works in that hospital, I learned that he does mostly c-sections. Wonder if I would've had a chance to labor if I hadn't had complications (HELLP and preeclampsia). I am getting the impression that some high risk docs are like this.My only thoughts are, that if they KNOW in advance that you have this condition, can't they let you labor and be prepared to handle an emergency? I know it's not as convenient for the high-risk doctor, but I would ask both doctors about that. If it's not medically necessary, I would recommend trying to avoid the c-section. Of course, if you need it to your health and safety, it is a blessing. But the recovery is rough and you need help caring for your newborn.",

            "answer": "If you have a problem with your blood clotting I would think a surgery (and a cesarean is MAJOR abdominal surgery and has many risks including perforating other organs) would be the more dangerous route?Since they know you're high risk they'll be prepared either way. I'd at least TRY to do a vaginal delivery, but that is just me. Ultimately you need to do what makes you feel more safe. If you feel a cesarean would be quicker, safer and calmer then by all means do it. It isn't as though you're electing a cesarean for a non-medical reason.However if you want to try for the vaginal delivery experience I don't see, pending other issues, why you couldn't try. Still plenty of time to research, talk to other high risk mommas with blood clotting disorders, get second opinions from medical professionals, etc.",

    "question": "Okay, so to make a long story short I'm 18wks pregnant and have lupus and a blood clotting problem that goes along with lupus so I'm considered high risk. I had to consult with a high risk dr just as a precaution in case there were problems and he had to deliver me. I gues it was more to ease my regular OB's mind. I haven't had any problems or issues with my pregnancy (out of the norm...vomiting, tired, etc), I have to give myself injections of Lovenox daily to help thin out my blood because of the extra estrogen/progesterone my body is producing. The high risk dr said because of this (the blood thinner) I would probably have to have a c-section because it's a more controlled environment and they will have blood ready if I need it and if I were to start bleeding we would already in surgery so there wouldn't be the chaos of rushing, etc. I'm perfectly okay with that, but when I talked to my regular OB (I've only been seeing him because I've had no problems) he said that they want me to go vaginally and that a c-section would be too much of a risk!! What the heck?? When I told him about the high risk dr saying I should have a c-section, he just looked at me like I was crazy!! DH thinks I'm nuts because I'm worried about it and want to bring it up again at my appt tomorrow. He thinks it will just work itself out and everything will be fine. I want to have my baby and be able to see him/her, not have to be rushed away to surgery. I just don't want the extra stress on everyone IF something happens! This is probably the only baby I will have and call me selfish, but I WANT to see the baby, hold the baby (if possible) and just have that moment with my husband. Not chaos and worry! So what do you ladies think? Bring it up or let it work itself out since I'm only 18wks??? Thanks guys! :)",
