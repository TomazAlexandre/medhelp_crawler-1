Just curious were you also putting on a lot of weight and could that just have been fluid? Because I have gained a lot of weight in two weeks which Monday was last appointment I was 218 and previous app I was 207. A lot right. So my final thing is could I just need bedrest? Going in today for NSTs will see what pressure is stayed in bed all day yesterday.",

I will go back Thursday to check my bp and swelling and if it is still high I will have to be induced early according to my OB.How was your bp at the appt.?",

    "question": "Hi all December mummies. Hope everyone is doing well and hanging in there with the time slowly approaching. Was wondering if anyone else is going through this. For may last couple of visits I have had my BP be as high as 167/85 and 140s/87. The lowest it has gone down is in the 130s. but no matter how much blood work and 24 urine test I do it comes out okay. What else could be going on if no preeclamsia. Oh I also have swollen ankles. Apart from that I feel great.",
