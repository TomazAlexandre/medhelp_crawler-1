They took me to a room to monitor me for a while then after about an hour they moved me back to the room I originally started in...I was in the bed for a day straight...the nurses eventually helped me out of bed so that I could get back on my feet...I felt better once I could walk around and hold my baby without falling asleep from the meds. At home you will be prescribed meds to use as needed but you will still experience some discomfort...not pain. Take it easy...walk slow, move slow, get up and sit down slowly. You will figure out the pace that is best for you. It took me about a good 2 months to start to feel GREAT! Not long at all...but it all depends on how well you heal. The absolute worst part of recovery was the first bowel movement...OMG! I thought I gave birth again. However, everything should go smoothly just make sure you take care of yourself and be wise in what you do to.ensure a speedy, healthy recovery. Good Luck! Get in contact with me if you need any support. :)",
