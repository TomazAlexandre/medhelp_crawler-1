If it gets serious, you can have awful headaches, kidneys shut down, liver gets engorged (very painful), lose reflexes, have seizures, and your placenta may separate from your uterine wall (abruptio placentae). Its a scary thing!",

            "answer": "O.O.. I've been having all these symtoms of preclamsia, im 36 weeks. My doctor said he doesn't know what it could be I meantioned preclamsia and he just looked at me. I've been having horrible migraines/headaches, and when I cough I cant catch my breath and I start seeing spots, my lower back keeps getting cramps and my stomach(but I think its normal for my stomach to have some cramps), and my hands are swollen. My mom told me to pee in a cup and see if I had any protein in it(she said if its not clear yellow it means I have protein in my pee) and I do and it says that's another symptom. My doctors office has me pee in a cup every time I come in would they have noticed I had it already or could it have just started or do you think its something else?? I've had a pretty good pregnancy, before this and this only started last week any opinions what it might be?",

            "answer": "Im not sure if its something that starts this late, but im sure its possible. Like I said, it can become very serious and put not only your baby at risk, but definitely you too. If your next appt isnt very soon id consider going to a walk in clinic or er n have them check your urine and blood pressure. As far as your doctor goes, ask specifically about your urine test results. That way you know hes acknowledging them.",

Where every single time you peed it would go into a container for 24 hours. Also with your blood pressure being normal, it shouldn't be preeclampsia as it causes high BP. I'm sure you're fine. :)",
