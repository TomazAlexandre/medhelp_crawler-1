If you are sexually active you should really see your Dr, get put on b/c and use protection to prevent STD's. There is plenty of time to become a mommy later. Enjoy being young now...I really don't mean to offend you, just trying to share with you some of the things that I wish someone would have shared with me.

And what about your school? Who will watch the baby? Or are you going to drop out? Then what? Are you planning on working? have you taken in account the cost of daycare? and if not where will the money come from then? Are you just going to stay living at home with your mother?

Whatever choices you make in life are the choices you have to live with for the rest of your life. Just remember that a baby isn't going to make your life any better or any easier. And if it is unconditional love you are looking for, there is plenty of time to wait for a baby when you're married, settled, have a house, have a job/career/education.I just don't get why teens today think having a baby is \"cool\" or the right thing to do. You want freedom, you want to make your own choices... but you also want to put another human being into the mix. Be mindful that you should want to provide the best for them. Not want them right now, right this minute, when you're still a child yourself.And a 15-yr-old's body is not meant to handle pregnancy just yet. Be kind to yourself and remember that it's not just your own life you could be potentially messing up. It could be your baby's life as well.",

But when they get responsibility (a baby) they intend to run especially at that age.Life seems perfect right now and don't spoil it for yourself or for your bf. Enjoy life everything will come at the right time. I wasn't your age long ago so I know what it means to be a teen or a young women. I am not judging you nor am I here to judge you I am just asking you and I even don't know you to think it thru. At age 22 I was diagnosed with HPT.(A Sexual Transmitted disease) and I even didn't sleep around my Husband was my first. Guys will tell you anything you wanna hear but what they did before you and maybe while they are with you that is a different story. I was lucky it was caught on time and I am fine. As for my husband by all means I am not mad at him at all because he is a guy and guy unfortunately intend to sleep around. Be careful because diseases can kill you!!!!Best of luck and I hope all your plans are well planned out!!!!Tina",
