            "answer": "At aroumd 28 weeks we found out My little guy had iugr (inter uterine growth restriction) his arms and legs were 3 weeks behind and his belly was 2 weeks behind. His head was fine. My amniotic fluid was on the low side of normal. He finally caught up on his growth near the 35 week mark I started drinking lots of water to get the fluid back up. At 35 weeks I had to be induced due to preeclampsia. What I would suggest to you is get a blood pressure monitor, drink lots of water, and do not eat fast food. Eat at home healthy foods. Oh and don't stress. They also thought my little guy had clubbed hands and feet but that turned out he didn't have it at all. He was born 4lbs 12ozs healthy and came home in 4 days. The only reason he stayed 2 days longer was jaundice (I didn't know not to clamp the umbilical cord until the blood finished pumping. I know to wait this time). His blood sugar was a little low too. I breast fed him but when we came home he had latch issues because the nurses wouldn't leave me alone about the bottle and passi. This time I know to stick to my instincts and tell them to leave us be. He finally latched again at 3 months and has been a healthy happy little boy. He's still small but I figure there are all different sizes and shapes of all people. I'll pray all is well and your baby comes out happy and healthy.",

    "question": "I am 27 weeks 1 day along, my baby's extremities are measured short, they are at 22w4d. Head looks normal for 27w. Also, VSD were found. I am 25 yo my husband is the same age. We are both around 5.5 and all his mom and dad are even smaller. My parents are about the same 5.5-5.8. We did the amnio and it got back normal, so its not a Down's syndrome.doctor said that it can be a skeletal displasia, or some kind of syndrome they can not deter yet(if we look at this 2 issues together).i I am devastated and don't know what to do. Please share if you have a similar story!",
