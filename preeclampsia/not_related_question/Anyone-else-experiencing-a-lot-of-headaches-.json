I said yes and they asked me if I saw like sparkles and I did in the shower and my BP was through the roof. They rushed me to the hospital in an ambulance and I had to deliver the next day a month early because I had very dangerous preeclampsia. This may not be what you're experiencing at all but I didn't know what to look for in a situation like that for my first pregnancy.",
