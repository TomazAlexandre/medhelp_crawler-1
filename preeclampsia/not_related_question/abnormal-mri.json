            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, isolated focal abnormality in the splenium of the corpus callosum isindeed unusual and first other causes should be looked at. Though a rare disorder, pancreatic insulinomas should also be thought of in your case and have someone check your blood sugar while you have an anxiety *** tingling attack. The hypoglycemia in this is transient and there is a quick increase in blood glucose once you eat. Generalized feeling of a burning sensation can be due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Generalized tingling can be due to peripheral neuropathies, hypoglycemia, nerve compression in cervical spine or due to Vit B12 deficiency. It can also be fibromyalgia. This is associated with fatigue and a heightened and painful response to gentle touch (allodynia). Other symptoms include needle-like tingling of the skin, nerve pain, muscle aches and spasms, weakness in the limbs, functional bowel disturbances, and chronic sleep disturbances.The cause of fibromyalgia is often hereditary or due to a physical or emotional trauma or due to lingering infection in the body such as due to mono. The treatment is a mix and match of analgesics, anti depressants, anti seizure medications, physical therapy and counseling. This would need a comprehensive investigation. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you. Can all this be related to lyme as well? Because i had a test for lyme that came back positive. I believe that i was told by many people that all this is actually associated with lyme as well. All these symptoms. My blood sugar was low. When i was having an anxiety attack i believe it was low because it was 57 when i went to the hospital. Hypoglycemia is a definite question in the matter. I am pretty sure from what others said who have hypoglycemia that all the tingling and burnin can come with that too. But can this be lyme?",

            "answer": "I also get pains in my head sometimes. I had head trauma to the right side of my forehead just above my right eye about two years ago...but i didnt go to the hospital after that. I would assume if there were complications from that..that it wouldve started much sooner then this. IF it related to that am i right? I also sometimes when i lay down and i start falling asleep my head twitches a little. like not fast repeated twitches but like a quick jolt of my head when im falling into a deep sleep. or sometimes just when i lay down and im awake. i have trembling in hands and head too. What should i do if i feel like my blood glucose level is low? and how can they decide if hypoglycemia is what all this is...and would hypoglycemia cause that abnormality in the brain in that area",

            "answer": "I also wanted to state the fact that i just had a baby three months ago. The eye issues started in like april or beginning of may. Where my one eye would kinda go a little blurry from the sun. I also felt tingling then but not severe. I wasnt really having anxiety attacks at that time either I was pretty good with that. I wanted to mention the fact that at that time when i was pregnant and even a few months before i had this horrible nerve pain in my back which even made it hard to get in and out of bed or even turn from side to side in bed and sometimes walking hurt. So i was wondering if maybe i had a pinched nerve and it did some damage to make me have these tingling and burning sensations.,,I had a blood sugar level of 57 does that mean i have hypoglycemia since i have never had\u00a0\u00a0a low sugar like that",

    "question": "PROCEDURE: Sagittal T1. Axial T1, T2, FLAIR, diffusionCOMPARISON: CT from 2008FINDINGS: There is symmetric focal T2 hyperintensity and restricted diffusioninvolving only the splenium of corpus callosum. The brain is otherwise normalin signal intensity on all pulse sequences. No hemorrhage, mass effect,extra-axial collection. The basilar flow-voids are present. The calvarium,skull base, craniocervical relationships, and visualized extracranialstructures are remarkable for mild mucoperiosteal thickening and polypoidchange in the paranasal sinuses.IMPRESSION: Isolated focal abnormality in the splenium of the corpus callosumis quite unusual in a patient without known history of multiple sclerosis,traumatic diffuse axonal injury, or status epilepticus. Consider drugtoxicity, transient metabolic derangement, encephalitis or ADEM, PML, rareneoplasm, or hypoglycemia. Doubt hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or posteriorreversible encephalopathy in the absence of known preeclampsia/eclampsia.MY SYMPTOMS ARE TINGLING, PRICKLING, ELECTRIC SHOCKS, WEIRD EYE ISSUES LIKE GLARES, A BLACK SPOT. GOT MY EYES CHECKED AT EYELAND SHE SAID IT WASNT ANYTHING THAT SHE COULD FIND...I GET BURNING SENSATIONS AND COLD SENSATIONS IN MY BODY. MY SKIN IS SENSITIVE TO TOUCH. THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH AND I JUMP OR MY MIND RUSHES WITH THOUGHT THINKING SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH ME..WHICH I KNOW THERE IS. IM THINKING IT HAS TO DO WITH A NERVE. I HAD HEAD TRAUMA TWO YEARS AGO..TO THE RIGHT FOREHEAD ABOUT MY RIGHT EYE. SOMETIMES WHEN I WALK..AND THEN I SIT DOWN I FEEL ALL THESE TINGLY FEELINGS ALL THROUGH MY LEGS. ALSO I WENT TO THE ER THE OTHER DAY AND MY BLOOD SUGAR WENT DOWN TO 57 THAT HAS NEVVER HAPPENED BEFORE. THEN A COUPLE DAYS AGO I WENT TO THE ER AND THEY PUT ME ON ANTIBIOTICS FOR LYMES DISEASE CUZ THE ONE TEST CAME BACK POSITIVE FOR IT BUT THE WESTERN BLOT TEST DIDNT IT WAS NEGATIVE..DOC SAID IT COULD BE A FALSE POSITIVE BUT WANTS ME TO KEEP TAKING THE ANTIBIOTICS FOR A MONTH THEN GET MORE BLOOD WORK DONE AGAIN I SEE THE NEUROLOGIST SEPTEMBER 21ST. IM SO SCARED AND ANNOYED I WANNA KNOW WHAT IS WRONG...THIS MRI THEY SAID THEY WERENT SURE EXACTLY WHAT IS WRONG...HELP PLEASE...",
