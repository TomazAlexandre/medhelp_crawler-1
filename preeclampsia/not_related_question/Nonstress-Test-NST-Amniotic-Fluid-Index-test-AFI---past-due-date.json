I'm thankful because I didn't want to go the induction route either. Luckily for me, the striping helped to put me into labor (or maybe it was just lucky timing) within 24 hours. It was painful, but compared to labor, it wasn't that bad.",

I now have them twice a week, and they are no big deal, i just lay there and relax!\u00a0\u00a0Its my 30 minutes of relaxation a week ! All they do is strap a fetal heart monitor to you to get the babies heart beat and one to catch contractions, and everytime you feel the baby move you press a button!\u00a0\u00a0And the AFI test is the same you just lay there and they do an ultrasound that takes about 3 minutes they measure the pockets of fluid and your done! I have a very low AFI as i have this entire pregnancy due to preeclampsia .......",

    "question": "Anyone ever have these tests? I reached 40 weeks/ my due date last Wed so not that overdue but my OB is having me do these tests on Monday to make sure the baby and amniotic fluid level are OK. I opted not to have them strip the membranes last week b/c I thought it hurts a lot and not necessarily helpful and I was in no rush for labor, but now worried they'll induce me and rush me into emergency c section on Monday. I'm also changing my mind thinking to get induced by the end of the week if labor doesn't happen on its own b/c 4th of July the following week and I don't want to be in the hospital or have my baby's bday fall on a holiday if a chance of it! Anyway, any info about the NST and AFI tests is appreciated.",
