I'm 30 weeks and it's happened for quite awhile now, my doc says it's normal as well..and recently as baby has gotten bigger I can totally feel that it's him kicking or punching or just moving around in that area. I Thought Something Was Wrong Too,\u00a0\u00a0But IT'S Just An Awkward Position To have Movement in.\u00a0\u00a0It felt tingly to me at first that's how I best described it,\u00a0\u00a0kind of a warm sensation as well. It could be a nerve baby is coming in contact with. But don't sweat it you'll be alright. Now I can clearly feel that it's him moving and kicking right under my right breast in my rib area. Lol.",

    "question": "so I keep getting this horrible pain in my top right rib.It even makes my skin feel like a burn. I get that my ribs are sore from him constantly kicking but this feels a lot weirder and it's only the top right. It's a burning feeling. Plus I know it can't be that sore because he kicks my left ribs more than my right and they are fine. His head is near my right hip and his feet are in my left ribs. Ugh",
