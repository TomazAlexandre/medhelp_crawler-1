            "answer": "Wow! 4 babies! That is very exciting! I am almost 38 weeks with my first baby and the buying and planning for 1 has been sooo exciting and fun! But it's very eye opening to how expensive things can get! Like KellyTexas said, start buying diapers asap! I have stocked up on quite a few since around 13 weeks so we shouldn't have to buy any for quite awhile! Hit up as many garage sales as possible, also! It's getting kind of late for them...but you should still be able to find some good things for cheap! :) I also go to www.freecycle.org alot. If you sign up for your area's group, you'll be surprised how many things are offered that you'll be able to use! The site is free and the stuff is free....it's a program to try and keep the landfills from filling up.Anyhow......congratulations! :) Keep us posted!!",

I tried keeping it a secret, but everyone knew by 12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0News like that travels amazingly fast.\u00a0\u00a0I'm known as the \"triplet lady\" around town.\u00a0\u00a0I'm famous!How do you budget for 6 instead of 2? - I have NO idea.\u00a0\u00a0We don't know how to budget for ours, we're just trying to save, coupon shop, and pray and have faith it will work out.How much formula and dipers do you go through a month with just 1 baby? - Other triplet moms I've met said they went through about 1 can per day for a while.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure what state you live in, but in CA there are programs that help with this.What formula is best? - Can't tell until babies are born, unfortunately.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could start stocking up now!What dipers do I use? - Again, you never can tell.\u00a0\u00a0My mom works in NICU and they use Pampers, so we've been buying those,\u00a0\u00a0but I'm also stockpiling a small arsenal of other brands, and I'm having a diaper shower and asked for any and every kind and size.Do I buy 4 cribs or have them share for the first little while? - We will probably start by having all 3 babies in one crib, but we went ahead and got 3 and just set them up today, actually. :)\u00a0\u00a0Other moms of multiples I've talked to have mixed opinions - most say they kept the babies together for a few months, but a few have said the babies did much better separated, so I figured we're prepared either way.Hope that helps a little.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in touch, and I'm happy to answer any other questions you have as well as I can!",

We will eventually need 4 cribs so I think we are going to just get all 4 now.\u00a0\u00a0The thing I'm kind of nervous about it my doctor said that with several babies there is a chance that there could be another one that was missed in the ultrasound, so he said he was going to make sure we have only 4 the whole time. lol.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what to buy and not to buy, like gear wise because unfortunatly I wont be able to hold all of them all the time.",

I think that is about the best you are going to get.\u00a0\u00a0At least it fits 7!\u00a0\u00a0I'll trade you my beat up VW for your SUV, it seats... *counts*\u00a0\u00a05... and well not a baby seat and 2 kids well.When do you tell people?\u00a0\u00a0Personally because of how high risk you are, I'd wait till you are on bedrest, unless you are already obviously showing, then perhaps just the closest friends and family as well of course as your boss.How do you budget for 6 instead of 2?\u00a0\u00a0Hmmm well a lot of coupons!\u00a0\u00a0I budget for 5 but they've been slow editions to the family.\u00a0\u00a0Visit a lot of Mom 2 Mom salesAs far as diapers.. I was told to plan on a large pack of diapers per week per child... I think that was about the average for my daughters when they were younger.\u00a0\u00a0It was far too long ago, about to get a crash course with Lilith.What formula is best?\u00a0\u00a0I love organic formula, but plan on breastfeeding as long as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Remember that with your little ones, it might be better to stock up on gift certificates for the formula more than anything else, because you might run into a situation where they need soy formula or something like that.What diapers... Get a Costco or a Sams Club membership!\u00a0\u00a0I think that is going to save you a lot of money in the long run.\u00a0\u00a0For the most part, all diapers are created equal, and sometimes the biggest difference is between a boy or a girl can depend on the diaper brand you get.",
