I was going to do it just to see my name at the top of the BFP list but never had a chance to get on the computer...always on my phone :( I am 23 weeks today and i am having a BOY!!! Just completed my 2 hour gloucose tolerence test (failed the gestational diabetes test) and we will see how that goes, and my BP has been normal everyday so not sure what was going on with my DR. I am going to have to talk to her about stressing me out for no reason!!",

            "answer": "Thanks for the welcome all.dnikki, hope the recovery from your surgery heals fast! It's hard not to pick up your little ones when they want you so bad, but speaking from experiance try and resist, it can really cause you to heal badly on the inside and it can make your outside scars really big and nasty if you are streatching, bending and lifting heavy things.krichar, does your dr have you taking your BP because it was high when you went in? If so it might have just been a one time thing, but being abel to check it at home everyday should help easy yours and your dr's minds. Congrats on the little Boy! Have you picked out a name yet? Dh and I have the hardest time with boy names, maybe that's why we had girls lol.rachjas, does the zofran help when you take it? I get horrible ms when I'm preggers and have never taken anything for it :( Hope the you and your family get over being sick very fast! It's the hardest thing when your baby is sick. Does it usally take so long to get the finalization?AFM, just now 7dpo and not really feeling much. I had a horrible headache last night that wouldn't go away. Usally when I fall asleep my headache's go away by the time I wake up, but not last night. Very weird, but it has never been one of my pregnancy symptoms before. The only symptom I can say I have is extream fatigue right AF is due but with two children I have that symptom all the time lol. Just a little stressed out right now because there's a chace we might not get paid next month, so saving up now.Hopeing all is going well with everyone with ttc, pregnancy and raising your babies!",

That's great you got a positive opk though! That's definately a good thing! You know, my cycles were irregular after having Addy too. My very first AF after stopping nursing her, I got pregnant but as you know m/c'd but what's crazy is I didn't ovulate until CD 42! I had a regular AF after my m/c, and then we decided to start trying again. I started taking fertility blend for women, which regulates your cycles and I took it for one month, and I ovulated on CD 24, which was a huge improvement! And ta-dah... we got pregnant with our baby boy! :) We know clomid definately does the trick for you, but the fertility blend is all natural. Maybe you could look into it! :)Krichar- Hoping that no news is good news on your test! :) Wow girl, you're good! You have his nursery done already??!! I've just now started buying stuff for little Sean! I can't wait to see pics!! :)trh- Aww! Annabelle sounds like she's just doing perfect!!! :)Rachjas- Yay, almost 17 weeks!! Congrats!! :)Not much new going on here. We have our next u/s next Friday at 9am, and it'll be an hour long so I can't wait! :) I feel little Sean move all the time and I love it! He's doing wonderful! :) Addy was sick last week, but thankfully she's doing much better!!! It's no fun seeing your baby sick! :( She's getting so big and doing so much, she's such a blast!

It's always hard when they're sick, especially when they're this young and your so limited on what you can give them. :( Hope she gets better soon!Krichar- Yay girl, you are moving right along! :) Not too much longer to go! Are you ready to share those nursery pics yet? Hehe! :)Rachjas- Oh awesome, that's so exciting you finally got your date! The 20th will be here before you know it! How are you feeling?ad_06- Happy 15 weeks! Are you finding out what you're having?AFM: Sorry I've been mia! We moved last week and this house finally looks like home! :) We had my 20 week apmt, and baby looks great! He's still a HE, lol! :) He was so cute, moving all over and kept showing off his like winky, haha!! The tech kept saying how proud he was of it, lol! We are set to be induced on August 12th, which will be 39 weeks (only b/c it'll be easier if it's set to get Addy taken care of since my mom will have her while we're in the hospital and she's so busy at work in August). Addy came at 37.5 weeks, so he may decide to come early too, but at least I know he'll be here by the 12th! :) I've been doing lots of shopping for him, getting more and more into \"boy mode!\" It's hard to transition after having a girl, :)! But I get more and more excited every day! I can't wait till he's here, our family will be complete! :) Well, hope everyone's been doing good!! TTYL!! :)",

Monday night we thought she was doing better, but when she got into a deep sleep her O2 stats dropped into the low 80's again and she required oxygen all night. At her 12a.m albuterol treatment early Tuesday morning I noticed she sounded like everything was breaking up and she had a productive cough. She was on no oxygen all day yesterday (even naps!!) and while napping kept it at 94%. They did 4hr checks on her last night instead of constant monitoring and she was in the high 90's each time which is great! So, hopefully we'll see the docs in a few hours and we'll be on our way home :-) Thanks for all your thought and prayers :-)",

At first I wish it\u2019s a girl, but now I say I love the baby whether it is a boy or a girl.\u00a0\u00a0I have an u/s on May 10th, I hope to know, because we need to buy things for the baby. Its really hard to find a unisex things, everything either for a boy or a girl (few things that can be for both).rachjas0623: congrates on your baby girl :)krichar: Me too.

I'm still in contact with a handful of you via text & Facebook, it's just hard for me to log on here with my phone. It's not quite as easy as Facebook for some reason.Ricky & Ava are 14 months old & doing awesome! They are a lot of work, but so much fun =] They grow so darn fast & their personalities are just too cute! Ava is a spitfire, but such a sweetie. She's always on the move &\u00a0\u00a0loves to dance! Ricky is always happy & loves to smile at himself in the mirror ;) He says hi & bye, but with a southern accent! (We're in California) One of their teachers at daycare actually asked if either of us was from the south :) Anyway, they get along great & are usually very happy little one's :)Luvkayln: I can't believe you're so far along!!! Addy will be an awesome big sis! =]Rachjas: Huge Congrats on your finalization process & that Baby C will soon be a big sis! It's just such great news =]Ad_06: You & Rachjas are so similar, close in your pregnancy with babies about the same age! May 10 is so soon =] Looking forward to reading your update...Krichar: I had gestational diabetes with insulin shots, so hopefully you are in the clear; but if not, let me know. Geez, it's hard to believe that was so long ago... Do you have names in mind?Sbumblebeeo: I'm excited for you TTC again :) And I love names with meaning, like Lee :) Garrett is very masculine, yet cute. If someone knows a \"bad\" Garrett that changes the feeling of the name for them, Thryll just have to meet yours & change the feelings back ;-) Good luck!!!

I am only 5'7\" and dh is 5\"10 but has a short inseam...LOL!!! So excited to meet him but scared to push his fat head out, hahahaha!!!",

I have never stopped\u00a0\u00a0my zofran, but I have definately had to increased the amount I am taking again! I am trying to drink more fluids. I found out a couple of days after I went in to the office from the cramping that I had a UTI, so I went on a round of antibiotics. When I went in for my 28 week check up... I asked about it since I had never had one before. They also told me I tested + for Strep B in my urine which is the same thing they will test me for around week 36. So, most likely I will need to get antibiotics during delivery. I also tested + for ecoli!!! agh! but, if I wasn't pregnant they said they would have even treated me..my number for the was barely over the 'limit.'luvkayln- 32 weeks!!! Are you being induced this time? When?Krichar- Congrats! I saw the pics! ADORABLE!AFM- I am 30 weeks today! We have our elective 3/4d u/s this Wednesday!",

But at least you found out and can get it treated! I tested + for strep B too when I was pregnant with Addy and had to get antibiotics when I was in labor. So yes, the plan for us is to be induced at 39w, 1d (Aug 12th). The only reason being is to try to \"plan\" it a little because of Addy. She came at 37w,3d so we'll see if little Sean makes it that far. In a way, I'm kind of hoping he comes sooner just so I can be suprised and see what it feels like to actually do the whole \"I think i'm in labor!\" thing. :) I was induced with both babies, so it'd be cool to be suprised this time. :) But it's all up to him! lol. Happy 30 weeks to you! We're almost near the end, it's crazy!! It's just gone by so quick, sometimes I feel like it's unreal that I'll have another baby soon! Addy's starting to somewhat understand I think. We'll point at my belly and say \"baby\", but she's obsessed with babies. Earlier today at the store though she pointed at her daddy's belly and said \"baby\", lol, so maybe we're just confusing her! Ha! :)AFM: Will be 33 weeks on Thurs, and if little Sean waits till our induction, he'll be here in just 6 weeks! :) We have another appointment next Thursday, going every 2 weeks now. Starting July 21st we'll start going every week till he comes! Gettin' close!!! :)",

All week since then I've been having constant pressure and cramping/lower back pain which is something i never experienced constantly with addy. In fact, I hardly ever felt it! This time is just completely different. :) We go back in the morning for my 36 week check up to see if i've made any more progress, which I'm crossing my fingers that I have! :)Hope everyone is doing good!!",

He weighs 7lb, 12 oz already!! BIG BOY!! :) My dr was concerned that he would be too big for me, and the 2 possible worst scenerios could be either his head would come out but his shoulders would be too big so they would have to break one to get him out, or his head would be too big to come down the birth canal and they would have to do an emergency c-section, and obviously i don't want ANY of those options! So next Wednesday we go in for an amnio to see if his lungs are ready, and if he passes we're getting induced that day! I've gotten 2 rounds of steroids the past 2 days to help mature his lungs, so we will see! :) I'm super excited and so ready to meet our baby boy!!!",

He is very happy and so are we! I can't post photos or personal info in public, but if you send me your email via message here, I can share with you some pics. I am white, Dh is in between, you can say, light dark (we are mix here), our son is white like me! We have our court date on the 22nd of this month!",

Even though he's 11 weeks and he's weighing in at 14 lbs. 5 oz. yikes and on top of it he has to go see a birthmark specialist because he has a birthmark under his right eye and it's grown bigger and it's too close to his eye, so we have to look into removing it. He also has umbilical hernia and if that doesn't heal by the time he is 2 or gets worse we have to go see a surgeon. Other than that he is all good and we don't have to go to the doctor again until he is six months instead of the normal four months because he's doing so well in fact the doctor didn't even believe that I was nursing him exclusively and was shocked to hear that there is no formula at all involved and then he started joking and asking if I was taking steroids or feeding my baby steroids, lol!! His exact words were \" you have milk to make Olympic champions...hahaha!!",
