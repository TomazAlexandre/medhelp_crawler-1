            "answer": "All of those symptoms sound pretty normal for how fat along you are. I remember I used to get dizzy and have a hot flash feel like I was going to pass out and throw up all at the same time. Isn't pregnancy fun! I would also get pain in my shins. I'm assuming because all that weight from baby is pushing down and causing stress on our legs. But because you have high blood pressure I'd call and let them know. Its always better safe than sorry.",
