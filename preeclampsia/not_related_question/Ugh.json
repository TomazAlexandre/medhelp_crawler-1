Moody like crazy always hungry but shocking heartburn I can barely bend and I can't sleep at night and I find just walking around for 20 mins is a challenge. Can't wait for these last few weeks to fly by...... I'm sure our bodies make the last week's of the last trimester torture just to get us to freak less about the pain of labor ha ha. That's my theory anyway",

            "answer": "I am 40 weeks tomorrow and my baby boy is still not here. Let me sum up for you my 3rd trimester: preeclampsia scare and 4 weeks of bedrest, backache, pelvic bone pain and popping, elephant hands and feet (really, my hands are extremely swollen in the morning, my feet in the evening), carpal tunnel syndrome with numbness in my fingers in both my right and left hands. Constant sugar level testing because I started my pregnancy with insulin resistance, constant BP and protein checks because of my high risk for preeclampsia. Bathroom trips every 30 minutes including during the night, pain when getting up or shifting positions, dry skin on my legs and hands, dizziness if I forget to take my prenatal vitamins (especially calcium, magnesium and iron), fatigued although I sleep overall 12 hours but not all at once because of the permanent peeing. Feeling like I've ran the marathon every time I pull on my socks, put on my shoes, shave or go for a walk with my dog. Completely not having any clue what else I should eat to provide the baby the nutrients and make it easy enough for me to cook (although my hobby is cooking!) because my back is killing me if I stand a lot and you can't cook sitting. Moody and crying for almost no reasons. Almost forgot, c-section scare last week because my baby wouldn't drop and I didn't dilate, luckily at my pre-surgery check up my cervix dilated to 2 cm and babt dropped so the surgery got cancelled for now. Scheduled induction for next week if baby doesn't come on his own until then and just found out that the only person I want and need with me at delivery (my husband) couldn't get a day off for that day!So, I am more than over with this pregnancy and just want to have my baby already!Oh yeah, I'm a first time mom, 32 years old and this is my first successful pregnancy after over 3 years of trying because I also have PCOS.And we have no family nearby to help us out (they all live 4 hours away), not that we\u00a0\u00a0would want them here because we don't really get along with them.",

And my abdomen is so full of stretch marks that there not 1 inch that got away from the nasty deep purple cracks although I used tons of special creams to prevent this.And the last thing, oh yeah!, the heartburn everytime after I eat no matter what or the quantity.And I used to love my pregnancy up until the last week, it was really great and easy :)Still, I would do it again :)",
