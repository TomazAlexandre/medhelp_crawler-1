He had it this time last year though and I know how terrible it is to go through. That is really rude of your family. It's not your fault and they shouldn't be bringing you down like that when it's already a difficult thing. My husband couldn't drive much because his eye would get dry from not being able to blink all the way and he had trouble sleeping as well as using mouthwash. Hopefully it doesn't last that long for you. He got his on thanksgiving morning last year and it went away around christmas. Hang in there.",

I just laugh with them because as time passes and it goes away it became just a funny memory. I know it wasnt MY face they were laughing at, it was the condition. We even joke that my brother caused it because he farted near my face around the time I got it. Lol!It lasted a few weeks and I was prescribed a steroid pill to helps speed up the healing process. I don't remember having any pain at all. Unfortunately,\u00a0\u00a0all you can take is tylenol if you are preggers.",

            "answer": "See a sleep center. Recurrent \"Bells Palsy\" is actually very characteristic of narcolepsy with cataplexy. In fact, often times, it's not \"Bells Palsy,\" but cataplexy. Viruses and some vaccines (namely the H1N1) can actually precipitate this, but it can happen seemingly in random fashion, too.It doesn't look the way you think it looks. Common misdiagnoses are depression, epilepsy, and migraines. I struggled for years to find an answer, and was misdiagnosed several times. I had it with just sleepiness during the day and what looked like insomnia at night for probably about 15-20 years before I ended up with more serious symptoms of narcolepsy that actually included cataplexy (random muscle weakness that can either be isolated, or widespread).The cataplexy manifested first in my face, as what looked like episodes of Bells Palsy that came and went when I was tired, stressed, or even when I was happy and smiling.\u00a0\u00a0But when I paid closer attention I realized I got weakness and twitching (not uncommon) in my other muscles sometimes too, though I chalked it up to clumsiness until I paid attention. I also had issues with my vision randomly and sleepiness.I went undiagnosed for about 15-20 years, until I finally saw a sleep specialist and she nailed the diagnosis right away. The vast majority of doctors have absolutely no idea what it is or what it looks like, and no routine lab tests, MRI, CT scan, x-ray or anything of that nature will detect it. 75% of people with narcolepsy never get diagnosed in their lifetime.I was tested for epilepsy, migraines, MS, all kinds of things. But nope, it turned out to be narcolepsy!!Get seen by a sleep center!",
