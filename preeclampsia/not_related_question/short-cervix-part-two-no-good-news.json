Jus know that you will always need a cerclage for any pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I personally wouldnt terminate though it is likely you wont make it to full term it is rare but you could possible have her and chances are slim but miracles do happen. It is heartbreaking I read your previous posts and was hoping for good news for you. I would contact another dr they could possibly do a cerclage. My dr was very good I was very lucky tho im now 26 weeks so far everything is good they told me without the cerclage I would've\u00a0\u00a0lost him at 20 weeks. So sorry to hear and hope a miracle comes your way.",

I got one at my first dr appointment at 10 weeks to make sure my baby was there and had a heartbeat. I'm glad to hear though that you and your little girl are doing good. I'm 33+5 with a healthy baby girl and I can't imagine going through what you are. I'm 19 and this is my first baby and I'm nervous about labor and whether I'll be a good mom. You said you wanted to know more about all of us so here's me. Before I got pregnant I was had enlisted in the Marines at 17, got both my parents to sign the release forms and was just waiting till graduation from high school to go to boot camp. Well 3 days before I was suppose to leave I got discharged because I told the truth about smoking weed once and the CO didn't want to sign the waiver. I was heartbroken, that was in July of 2013 my ship date was July 8th. In August I started the enlistment paperwork for the air force and was waiting to go get medically checked so I could leave for basic. Over labor day weekend I got pregnant and found out a week before my 19th birthday in September. I was so scared cuz her father and I hadn't even really been together very long and I had been on birth control. Now i can't imagine my life any other way. No her father and I aren't together anymore and haven't been since October but he's still going to be a part of her life and we get along so there's no fighting. I can't wait to meet my baby girl Ciara Janise and hold her. I hope you and your husband get the same chance and that you guys get to have your amazing family together without sadness. Your baby girls a miracle and you both deserve to grow together. You've made it this far I have no doubt in my mind you and your baby girl will continue to fight through this and come out on top.",

Wow i was so nervous about joining the army and i heard marines were very tough so i decided to just go to college lol. Thank you fod sharing your story.I just spoke with my doctors and as protocol he let me know what can happen if i deliver this week. He recommends vaginal because a c-section is more danger to my health. He did mention steroids but i am only 22 weeks and a few days however if i can make it to 23 i can get the steroids which will help with ths development of my baby.

I hadn't been with my babys daddy before finding out I was pregnant so he left when I was pregnant with my son and haven't heard from him since.This baby, my husband and I never prevented nor planned, we weren't married at the time I found out but soon after. I took a pregnancy test february 13th 2014 because I was 4 days late and I figured maybe it was stress. I had 5 positive pregnancy tests because I kept taking them because I was shocked. I had had 3 miscarriages last year and was starting to wonder if I would ever have a healthy pregnancy. I went to the doctor a week later and I was 6 weeks 5 days. Great heartbeat. I was so happy!I am now 12 weeks 2 days and I am on full bedrest due to being hit in the stomach by someone. It caused a placental bleed small but could be very bad if the placenta quits working. I had an ultrasound last Monday at 11 weeks 4 days at the er. Baby was great but was placed on bedrest due to the bleed. I am not bleeding vaginally but I'm worried cause tommorow I go to find out if my baby is alive. I am praying for you but in turn please pray for my baby who I hope is okay.I am still having morning sickness so much I have lost 9 lbs in a week but I hop my babys okay. Much love ladyedmunds.",

I am having liver issues that at any point can kill our baby boy. I have been struggling with that but I can honestly say I do not even think that compares to the struggle you both are going through. I really hope she stays in there ATLEAST 2-4 more weeks. Preferably,\u00a0\u00a06 to 10. I really hope they can start the steroids soon and by the time she arrives, she will be ready to face the world. Much love goes out to you! I wish I lived close, I would drive to see you.

I try and get on here and read what's going on everyday but I haven't gotten to it feels like for a couple days. I'm happy to hear that they told you that you could sit up and go to the bathroom and it's completely understandable why you wanna stay on strict bed rest. Your little girl is a fighter just like her mama. You are an inspiration to so many women on here and honestly I think more people should hear about what you've gone through because we need more strong women like you in our world I believe. Everyone these days give up way to easily or are just negative about everything after the first sign of bad news. I haven't had any complications with my pregnancy but my cousin before she had her daughter a little over a year ago miscarried 6 times and had to have an abortion at 3 months because the baby stopped growing. Now she's pregnant with her second baby and is due almost a month exactly after me. I'd love to know what your naming you beautiful angel because she truly is going to be a miracle. You both are already. Keep us updated still, we all want to know that everything is going ok.",

Im starting to feel my baby girl's kicks in my vagina because she's breach, but its not constant. At the stroke of midnight i will be getting a steroid shot.I meant to ask her where do they stick the steroid shot? Lol. And then she mention something about magnesium? Or magnesia?? Ill have to ask her again. But it helps the brain development. But im holding on drinking my fluids, using the bathroom on my own fine.I cant thank each and everyone enough! I love you all and i will keep you updated and please keep me updated on how everything is going in your life. Praying daily for all of you kind ladies and i thank you so much for being there for me!!",

She looked like she wasnt really worried at all then again she was filling in for MY nurse but she notified my nurse of it and she hasnt came back yet. But im not worried. No pain, no contractions, and still no bleeding because when i wiped myself there was no blood at all!I am having some yellow discharge which is common. And i am taking that fagile pill? (Misspelled). Other than that my blood pressure is normal, normal temp. No fever, chills, etc.I should be receiving another steroid shot tomorrow.Thank you for all of your prayers, thoughts, checking in on me i really cant stop thanking you and thinking of each and every one of you ladies. I read all comments out loud to my mother, husband, grandma, nurses, father etc! Lol! They couldnt believe the support that we are getting! Its amazing! You ladies are amazing!!!! I love each and every one of you!!!!!!Oh the nurse just came in and listen to the heartbeat and she saw the pad and she said nothing to worry about!!!!!!!",

Since my baby is breach and she's kicking my vagina, my nurse said my uterus is probably getting irritable which can cause some spotting.An obg came in to do a check-up just in case. Just an ultrasound she did. Get this she says it looks like im 2 cm! Remember i went from 1 cm to 4 cm dilated? Well now it looks like im just 2!!! Your prayers, love, and support is working so good!!! When she said that i repeated what i just told you ladies just in case i heard wrong and she said it looks like 2! I was so happy! She said to monitor the blood spotting and just said relax!Thank ALL of you ladies for the kind words, advice, sharing stories, the beautiful inbox messages, and i love how you ladies have been such a support system since day one.I love when you update me on whats going on in your life pregnancy related or non pregnancy related. You all are my family and i love to hear whats been up with you.Im here for you as well and i pray every day for YOU.I cant thank you enough!!! <3",

Ive been getting so great sleep these last couple of days.Yesterday, i had an ultrasound. Everything looked normal. My Aminiotic Fluid level was normal. The only thing the doctor was concerned about was her position. She's currently breach and she was sticking her foot out of ths cervix however she pulled it back. So they were happy that she pulled her foot back in.Other than that things have been great! Omg so i also been PIGGING OUT! my father brought me a polish from the famous Hoagey shop here in Chicago....omg my baby was soooo excited!!!!!!! I grew up eating their food and just seeing that my baby enjoyed it!!!! I love her so much. And i can really start seeing her facial structure in the ultrasound! She looks like my mom! Lol.Before all this i never knew about an incompetent cervix. I never knew how common this was with women. My doctor never mentioned anything about it. This is a serious issue that needs to be discussed in doctor's offices. Or maybe just in mine. But i had NO clue that this can happen and how often it does happen!!Im currently 23 weeks and 5 days! It seems so long since my birthday April 3rd. I was only 22 weeks then and i felt like my world was ending. With the help of God, Family, friends, and the love and support here from all of you, i was able to make it this far. I am so happy and thankful for all your love and support. I love each and every one of you. I love hearing from you all and seeing how things are going in your life. I pray all the time for you ladies and wish you all the best.",

Have an ultrasound scheduled for next Friday to do a growth check. I'll be anxiously waiting to see why I'm measuring so big! 1.5 weeks until baby shower and 3.5 weeks until I defend my masters thesis. As long as my boy. hangs in there for 4 more weeks everything should work out. Fingers crossed!",

Ive been on baby monitors since yesterday and the doctor told me today how impress he is with how everything is looking. I am soooo happy. Still no contractions, pain, no leaking, and i have very little bleeding which they are not worried about.I had an ultrasound which showed my adorable baby girl with her feet in the air and her foot in her mouth! Omg i laughed out loud when i saw that. She was then opening and closing her lil hand and it looked like a flower blossoming! She then had one hand behind her hand and it looked like she was giving herself bunny ears! It was so amazing seeing her just being her, learning, listening, and being the active child i know she'll be.Thank you everyone for the continue support and saying just the kindest words that brightens up my day. I feel so close to you all and i pray all the time for each and every one of you ladies. I pray for your babies, families, and pray that He continues to bless these wonderful people.I am truly thankful and love you all!Please keep me updated with your stories!I hope i can be there just as much as you ladies are there for me!Love you All!! <3",

    "question": "Yesterday April 3rd i woke up feeling great. It was my birthday and i was going to celebrate with my family. I got a call from my doctor that i have a short cervix and i need to go to the hospital right away. Long story short i found out that i have an incompetent cervix. The only choice i had was to terminate my healthy baby girl. Im 22 weeks and at this time an emergency cerclage wasnt going to solve my problems.Still at the hospital and im pondering how come my doctor did not catch this sooner like around 12-13 weeka of my pregnancy?? My husband and i are so upset and just left with why....our first pregnancy, our first child .....everything was perfect and still is because she's healthy ...i see her on the u/s and shes great it just feels so wrong to let her go. Why didnt my doctor catch this. I always said my visits were short and not very informative. She always seemed in a rush.I just cant go thru with this",
