            "answer": "Yes, I did.\u00a0\u00a0I did that in the summer of 2004.\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, my blood pressure was running regularly at about 190/150, bloating, pain, bleeding, and other assorted aches and pains, including the constipation runs alternation.\u00a0\u00a0I also found diverticulitis and had a foot of my colon removed in June, but I think this is ALL interconnected.\u00a0\u00a0I think if they would have looked for cysts prior to this last December, they would have found them.\u00a0\u00a0I also had an endometrial ablation in 2004 which I believe was a total failure.Anyhow, there are too many women coming up with the same laundry list of complaints, some in menopause range, some younger, older, all over the age spectrum.\u00a0\u00a0I'm really beginning to think there is some unidentified bacteria or virus or other agent that is getting into our bodies and wreaking havoc with our immune systems.\u00a0\u00a0All of these things could be considered autoimmune in nature, in my opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Something is tripping our autoimmune systems so they are going berserk and creating cysts, tumors fibromas, whatever.\u00a0\u00a0This is just a theory of mine.\u00a0\u00a0I've had just about every system in my body give me some kind of heck in the last two years and prior to that, I had been healthy as a horse.\u00a0\u00a0To me, there has to be something to this and I'm hoping, if there is, there's some kind of resolution figured out before I lose anymore body parts.Take care, love, hugs and God bless, Barb",

            "answer": "I hear you Barb. I think there is definitely something going on - there are just so many more autoimmune and neurological problems even in children.\u00a0\u00a0I had thought it was the more aggressive childhood vaccination program that was pushing young children's immune system over the edge; my child was in the ER after 4 of his vaccinations.\u00a0\u00a0But it seems like adults are getting more autoimmune diseases too.I think the immune system and endocrine and adrenal systems are much more tied together than is generally recognized.\u00a0\u00a0I have wondered if there isn't some tie-in w/ environmental endocrine disrupters that mimic hormones causing some of this?Certainly herpes class viruses like EBV, CMV, HSV can cause major problems in some people.\u00a0\u00a0In the past, I have mostly gone after my son's medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Through people I met doing this, I found 3 children who made a major turnaround when their HSV or EBV or VZV were controlled when they flared up (they use zovirax).\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could find something that straight-forward for my son and me.\u00a0\u00a0Have you done serial titers of these to see if they are going up again when you flare up?\u00a0\u00a0This may give you a clue.\u00a0\u00a0One friend would test her kid's EBV early antigen and do serial titers when she started going south.\u00a0\u00a0She also would get frequent yeast infections when the EBV was re-flaring. This is in a young child.\u00a0\u00a0But zovirax and diflucan or nystatin really turned her around.That's awful that you were exposed to the risks your ex took on w/ his IV drug use.\u00a0\u00a0I never used IV drugs and don't have any risk factors for HIV or Hep thankfully.\u00a0\u00a0My ex brought a lot of misery, but at least he spared me on this front.Atenelol is the first BP med I tried and I had so much trouble w/ it. It dropped my HR down into the 40s and I kept fainting and it didn't control my BP well enough.\u00a0\u00a0Do you feel OK on it beyond worrying about the BP control issue?I am getting pretty good control w/ minimal side effects using Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide.\u00a0\u00a0THe BP meds are awful in genral - aren't they?!\u00a0\u00a0I had to try 7 different meds before I found 2 that worked decently and didn't make me a basket case.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what's doing what any more - is it the meds, my high BP, whatever is causing the high BP or that ovarian nightmare or my fear factor?The only reason I had to hold off getitng the ovary removed was that they were looking for an adrenal tumor - which turned out to be a go-nowhere wild goose chase.\u00a0\u00a0I can't wait to just get it over with even though I'm scared.\u00a0\u00a0I will have had it hanging over me for 4 mos by the time they finally remove it.\u00a0\u00a0Arghh!I will certainly let you know whatever I find out that may be helpful in your case.\u00a0\u00a0I sympathize w/ going from being perfectly healthy to having one thing roll into another suddenly.\u00a0\u00a0I've seen more Drs and had more tests in the past 4 mos than I did the whole rest of my life.

It was a large serous cystadenoma.\u00a0\u00a0I was told very unlikely to return.\u00a0\u00a0Thought it was all done with.Until... I hurt my back doing a very minimal bending activity over 2 weeks ago (Similar thing ocurred a couple of weeks prior to discovery of the cyst).\u00a0\u00a0Only yesterday did I start to feel like I could walk, stand and lay correctly again.\u00a0\u00a0When I had gone to the doc 2 weeks ago he noted I have hypertension (never been a problem before.. I'm thinking possibly due to the back pain!?) and also discovered a UTI which I had no idea or symptoms of.\u00a0\u00a0Well, he put me on antibiotics and HCTZ and the blood pressure has been moderate but still high mostly.\u00a0\u00a0I dipped my urine the day after completing the antibiotic and it was negative.\u00a0\u00a0However, has been positive since then for trace protein and leukocytes (I dipped it at work).\u00a0\u00a0Of course, this indicates a recurrent infection.I convinced my wonderful ARNP-gyn to order some tests (for some reason my doc did not find it necessary), one of which was a serum aldosterone/renin ratio. The renin came back high.\u00a0\u00a0In my mind this could explain the HTN. So, I went back to the doc today to tell him my back is just now (17 days later) feeling better; my period is (for the first time EVER- even when the cyst was happening) 10 days late, pregnancy test done tonight negative; my blood pressure is not better; I am gaining weight; cannot wear my wedding ring due to bloated fingers; and just feel tired a lot.\u00a0\u00a0He chalks it up to poor diet.\u00a0\u00a0\"No further tests necessary, I doubt there is a correlation to another cyst growing, lets see you again in May.\u00a0\u00a0I don'tknow wht is wrong with you\".\u00a0\u00a0Well, his nurse could have told me that on the phone!\u00a0\u00a0I do it all day long!I feel like a hypochondriac!!\u00a0\u00a0Am I simply getting fat for no reason?\u00a0\u00a0Well, my husband has some \"unknown and undiagnosed arthritic condition\" for the last 2 years and I too, cannot help but think this stuff is virus related.\u00a0\u00a0No way to tell of course, without blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0I'm getting really discouraged.",

            "answer": "Just a tip to anyone in their forties that suddenly has cysts appearing on one or both ovaries, please suggest to your ob/gyn to look for adenomyosis.Quick info from Mayo Clinic about it:\u00a0\u00a0Adenomyosis: The tissue that lines the uterus (endometrium) grows within the uterus' muscular outer walls. This is most likely to happen late in your childbearing years and after you've had children.\u00a0\u00a0Although the cause of adenomyosis remains unknown, the disease typically disappears after menopause. For women who experience severe discomfort from adenomyosis, there are treatments that can help, but hysterectomy is the only cure.So in other words, the uterine lining tissue gets into the uterine muscle and there is no way out.My first hint that I had adenomyosis was in my early forties with the appearance of a small (very painful) cyst that only one ovary.\u00a0\u00a0After three or four years, it progressed to a cyst every two or three months and the pain (ovary and low back) was terrible by that time.\u00a0\u00a0 I was not in menopause but was probably perimenopausal.The ob/gyn will look for an enlarged and/or boggy uterus but I did not have those symptoms at all.\u00a0\u00a0Ever.\u00a0\u00a0 I have been told that quite a bit of the time they can find adenomyosis with an MRI but not always.\u00a0\u00a0For me, anemia and breakthrough bleeding were my only other symptoms and those appeared three months before my hysterectomy.\u00a0\u00a0But I still did not get the diagnosis of adenomyosis until after the pathology report came back after the uterus was removed (and I had that pesky ovary removed but kept the normal ovary).\u00a0\u00a0I think my doctor did the hysterectomy because he didn't know what else to do to stop the pain I was in.\u00a0\u00a0He admitted later that he was completely shocked that I had adenomyosis.In talking with other women who had it, I discovered that many women with adenomyosis have similar ob/gyn histories: tubal ligations, pelvic inflammatory disease, large babies, pain in the mid to lower back, chronic pelvic pain and cysts.\u00a0\u00a0But not all of them.\u00a0\u00a0Some had no symptoms at all.Anyway, anytime I run into a forum where a woman mentions the sudden appearance of cysts, I like to jump in and mention this so that it is not overlooked in their ob/gyn appointments.Just in case you are wondering, no problems with hysterectomy, recovered nicely, no new cysts on remaining ovary, no more pain - especially in the back, no hormone therapy because I kept one ovary and I kept my cervix too (personal choice).\u00a0\u00a0Felt like a new woman after healing up. The only thing I would change is that I wish I'd done it ten years earlier.Alaina",
