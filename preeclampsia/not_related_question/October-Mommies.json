Saw all sorts of gruesome videos on c sections and breech births, ect. Here we go.....Its hard to believe I am going to get bigger than I am now. The u/s said she is in the 85th percentile and weighs 2lbs. Is that big or normal? My DH and I are both six feet tall so I assume she will be carrying along the basketball torch :)",

My doctors and nurses guess that at 36wks when they deliver her she will already be over 7lbs. and if I went full term well over 9lbs!! Thankfully I'm not going full term.

I am not sure what body part it is but when I stand for more than 30 mins he moves to the right side under my ribs and he pushes so hard! It feels like my stomach is on fire and no matter how much I rub I can't seem to move him unless I lay down for awhile! I'm not sure why this is?? I also have an extremely active baby. He moves so much it wakes me up! Besides the fact I feel like I should just move my bed into the bathroom ;) I've been on and off bed rest since around 14 weeks for placenta Previa and preterm labor so I am just hoping these are all good signs.. I have to admit though since my last child is almost 8 it feels like I can't remember anything about pregnancy! I am not even sure what contractions are supposed to feel like. I am hoping it will all come back to me when the time is right.. lol! I hope all is well with all of you and your babies! BTW anyone else have yet to gain any weight? I am hungry all the time! I finally stop losing weight but I can't seem to put any one? Maybe it is because I am a bigger girl to start with??",
