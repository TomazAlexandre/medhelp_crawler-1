Here are just a few quotes from a medical journal about this topic to give you and idea:\"Fertility experts have carried out an analysis of nearly25,000 pregnancies that has clearly demonstrated that babies who arepart of a multiple pregnancy face major risks to their life andhealth.\"\"Deaths in the period around birth were five times as frequent fortriplets as for single babies (a rate of nearly 40 per 1,000 comparedwith under 8 per 1,000 for single babies).\"\"Over 57% of the babies who were small for their gestational age weretriplets.\"\"More than half of triplet pregnancies are complicated bypreeclampsia.\"The medical risks for the babies in triplet + pregnancies are:* being born prematurely and needing intensive care* dying before birth or in the first year of life* physical disability and learning difficulties e.g. cerebral palsySheri",

Little did I know how much I myself would benefit from it.Sheri--Thank you soooooo much for posting those statitics and facts. They are but a mere few I had to consider when making this decision. I honestly had no clue that having triplets was THAT big of a \"deal\"--to either myself or the babies. I did my research and also heard firsthand stories from specialists in the field of perinatology as well as parents of multiples (more than twins), and understand that the chances of carrying a healthy triplet pregnancy to term was low. You are so right about those shows on TV where they show the minority: healthy families of multiple births. It puts a lot of pressure on people to think that if they cannot do it they have failed somehow. I so appreciate you helping enlighten people. I just couldn't bring myself to post that stuff myself or to share the stories I have heard.wannabenana--First, my point in posting this was not to generate more personal questions about my situation, but just to share that this is an issue for people. Second, please don't start a personal war with anyone here--at least not on my thread. It distracts from the issue. If you have any comments or questions about this post I would just prefer if you would keep them to yourself. I shared what I felt like sharing, and that seemed to be good enough for the other 15 ladies who responded. I'm sorry if it wasn't for you.",

At 15 weeks her cervix started to open and they stitched her closed and with medication and bed rest she carried on. Unfortunately\u00a0\u00a0at 22 weeks\u00a0\u00a0she went into labour as one of the babies had no amniotic fluid and had died. None of them survived and the little angels are in heaven right now.All I am trying to convey is that this is a very difficult decision that you have made and no one has a crystal ball to see what is going to happen in the future. To end on a happy note 6 months later my friend was pregnant with a singleton and now has a beautiful healthy daughter who is almost 1yrs old. She does not regret her decision as she did what she thought was best, and you should feel the same about your decision. Good luck and god bless.",

I can understand totally her deciding to go ahead with the pregnancy and not undergo selective reduction. I had to carry all 3 for 7 weeks knowing that one would be gone, and every sonogram and hearing the heartbeats was so bittersweet. I had follow up appointments today, and seeing the oe very still little body with a flat line is indescribably hard. It will be another week or two before the third baby is totally gone, and knowing I am carrying this little body around is also very hard.I am so happy your friend has a healthy daughter. I am sure the joy she takes in raising her is healing, just as it is to see my two very healthy twins doing backflips on the sono screen.Thanks again for sharing this story, as it is similar to the very many I have heard from bother doctors and patients about their experiences carrying triplets. While it may seem to some that selective reduction is an easy way to prevent the possibility of a problem, the truth is it is a very difficult way to save other babies' lives. That is why I went through with it, to save my twins and my own life, as we were all in danger. Thank God we are all doing well now.God Bless,Heather",

I have received so many pm's and notes from people about their experiences with friends who were pg with triplets, or people who work in pediatric health care, or who know someone who has reduced. It has helped open up the discussion, and I am glad about that so that no one ever feels like they can't talk about it here. I know I made the right decision for us, but it's nice to feel reassured. If circumstances were different I'd love to have had 3 at once. . .",

    "question": "Please don't judge me ladies. It is difficult for me to post this, but I am doing so in the hopes that if anyone else has to face this dilemma they won't feel as alone as I have.I was carrying triplets, and due to numerous health reasons concerning my babies and myself, took 3 doctors' advice and reduced my pregnancy to twins yesterday. I could write forever on why this was the best decision for me and my babies, but suffice it to say this was not done frivolously.I just want to be very honest on this forum and feel I have the freedom to do so without being judged. I struggled with infertility, so doing this was especially difficult and a pretty ghastly process.If anyone else has or does face this, you are welcome to pm me. If anyone thinks I am a horrible person for doing this, please don't pm me or rag on me here--it's truly the last thing I need right now. 99.9% of the ladies I have encountered here are wonderfully understanding and sweet, so I am not trying to insult anyone by saying this.Again, I am just being forthright b/c apparantly this issue is WAY more common than I knew, and not an issue people discuss. I am the type of person who will come forward and bring issues to the forefront in the hopes that someone else can be helped, and in the name of honesty.Thank you all in advance for allowing me to put this issue out there, and I pray none of you have to ever make this decision.",
