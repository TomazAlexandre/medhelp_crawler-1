            "answer": "Since she's in the hospital and gets kinda cruddy internet...I'll answer your questions so maybe someone can answer hers! lolShe is 30 weeks, 2 days. Is high risk for LOTS of things. Her blood pressure has been consistantly elevated and keeps going up. She has been on bedrest for a couple weeks now (the last week spent in the hospital). She has gone into PTL twice now and is dialated to a minimum of 3cm and is 90% effaced. Last she knew there was no protien in her urine (and she's been checked consistantly for it).Sooo I think that's all......I'm sure she'd appreciate any answers and/or advice. She's a little stressed out right now because she is stuck in the hospital til delivery! And her stressing out stresses me out.....I guess that's what friends are for! :) lol",
