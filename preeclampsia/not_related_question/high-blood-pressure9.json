            "answer": "I'm almost 39 weeks now. But at my 37 week checkup my doctor told me that my blood pressure was too high and that I was starting to develop preeclampsia. He wrote me off work and I've been on bed rest since. I'm still not dilated or open. I've gone to having two appointments a week so he can keep an eye on me. He says that my body isn't ready to even be induced, and this is my second child. I'm terrified I've done something wrong. I hope things work out for you though, good luck!",
