But, although I was a teen mom at 16 years of age , they still made me SUFFER through the pain before they found out I had SEVERE preeclampsia & then made me have an Emergency Cesarean. If there's nothing wrong with you, you'll have to have a vaginal birth . I know many stories that people bring to you may scare you into thinking a vaginal birth is horrible & scary . But, if there's little girls pushing out babies then I know any mother can do it!(: gl sweety.",

            "answer": "Most likely your doctor won't do a c section only because you request it. Honestly, the risks with a c section are much greater than vaginal birth in my opinion(major abdominal surgery vs what nature intended for our bodies to do). Yes, bad things can happen, but that stuff can happen either way, and giving birth is what us ladies are built for. It's scary to think about, but when the time comes, your body knows what to do, and a c section should definitely be a last resort. I would definitely read up on both, and gather as much information as possible before so that you can make the best decision possible for you. Good luck (:",

I would much rather have the experience of having my baby naturally then having it taken away BC there's a problem.

If your concern is breathing then a vaginal birth is better because the birth canal squeezes the mucus out of the baby's lung and that doesn't happen in a c section...I have had two c sections... Will be having my third in 9 weeks... The best thing to do is to let nature take its course and try not to worry... Don't let another labor scare you... All are different...

It takes them longer to recover! & about the air most baby's do struggle to breath not because of how they were delivered but because it's the first time they breath! They have to learn. I'm gona be a teen mom to and even though I'm scared out of my mind about giving birth I'm choosing to go all natural! I honestly don't think a doctor would give you a c-section just because you don't want to have it normal but you could ask after all your gona pay for it.Good Luck",

I agree with these women that everyone is different and each person goes through it differently but that doesnt mean you will go through what they did. Just because your small that doesn't mean anything. The birthing canal will dilate enough for the baby to go through. Many women give birth naturally with no problems. Don't be scared.
