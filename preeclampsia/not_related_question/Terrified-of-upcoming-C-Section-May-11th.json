            "answer": "Any surgery can be scary, but please remember that these doctors do C-sections everyday and they know what they are doing.\u00a0\u00a0Having your legs numb is an interesting sensation, but it isn't scary.\u00a0\u00a0They will put in a catheter, so you don't have to worry about getting up to go to the bathroom, and the numbness will wear off after a few hours.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had C-section, but my epidural worked so well, that I couldn't feel a thing, so it shouldn't be much different.I wouldn't hesitate to ask for pain medication when the numbness starts to wear off and as long as you have someone to stay with you (husband, mother, etc), then you should be fine.\u00a0\u00a0You will be so excited about your new babies that much of this won't matter.As you prepare for the upcoming surgery, take your mind off things by getting the baby's room ready, washing clothes, taking time for YOU, so you are fully rested and try as hard as possible to NOT think of the surgery until the time comes.\u00a0\u00a0It's easy to say, but try to distract yourself as much as possible.Congratulations to you and I know you will do fine.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, it's the waiting that is hardest part (as the song goes).\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

I would express your concerns to you OB, so they can reassure you that everything should be ok! Also dont be afraid toask questions.... God Bless and keep us posted on everything,",

            "answer": "I didn't think the epidural hurt that bad. I've had a few spinal taps before and so I guess I knew what to expect. The worst part is when they numb you up, it's a tiny little needle and the meds sting a little. Think bee sting. After that it's a breeze!I didn't have a csection, but I tore like crazy and so after delivery they topped me off and my legs were total dead weight for quite awhile. I didn't mind it wasn't like it hurt or anything.I've had surgery 6 times in my life and the worst part is sitting there waiting for them to get started so just think about those babies! The nurses are going to be great about talking to you and keeping your mind off how nervous your are. They do this dozens of times every day! I've watched so many csections on those pregnancy shows like baby story and it's always the same thing. Nervous mom, nervous dad, then crying babies, crying mom and dad and smiles all around. You're going to be fine!Oh congrats on having two Mother's day babies! May 11th is my birthday also and every few years it lands right on Mother's day.",

            "answer": "I had to have a scheduled c-section with my daughter at the age of 19 and I was scared also.\u00a0\u00a0Just like you never had any other surgery before that.\u00a0\u00a0They wanted to get her out early because they thought she was not eating enough.\u00a0\u00a0However she came out completely fine and screaming. lol....The recovery wasn't that bad either.\u00a0\u00a0I was in the hospital for 3 days and by day 3 I was cleaning the room.\u00a0\u00a0The biggest thing is to get moving afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0Of course don't over-do it or you could injure yourself, but don't sit on the couch for 6 weeks because you had it done.Good Luck I know things will be fine!Sarah",

            "answer": "I had a c section with my first that wasn't scheduled and with this one we have it scheduled already for July 28th. I was totally scared, but they do it all the time. It was a little weird not being able to feel or move my legs, but after an hour or so they start to tingle like they are asleep and you are slowly able to start moving. They will leave your IV in until the next day, giving you pain meds and then they will give you percocet( more then likely) by mouth after. I would recommend taking your meds on a schedule so you have the pain under control, other wise it can be extremly hard to get on top of it. You will be fine. Don't worry. You will have lots of help in the hospital for the 3 days they keep you there. Do you have someone to stay with you at least for a week? Is you dh going to be off work? That was the best thing for me. I had dh's grandma stay with me for a week, and I couldn't have done it without her, and I only had one baby lol. Surgery is always scarey, but the result is worth it and before you know it it will all be a blur. Good luck to you hun!",

            "answer": "the spinal wasn't bad. And I have a diagnosed phobia of needles- a genuine phobia. I have overcome the phobia for the most part, but obviously some anxiety lingers. Honestly, I thought getting an IV was worse than the spinal. I also had never even been in a hospital for anything other than visiting people.I will be honest and say that I hated my c-section. I suspect it was partly because I was so sick at that point and could barely stay awake. I also had many complications going on (preeclampsia). The pain is actually not bad right after because the morphine they give you lasts 24 hours. after that, you have to stay on top of the pain meds. Don't expect them to bring it to you when you're due- you do need to keep track and ask for them. I had DH stay on top of that for me. Don't be scared of the cathetor- i didn't want them to take it out! You don't feel a thing when they put it in, and despite my fears, removal was a breeze too. i didn't want it out because it is very hard to get up and using the bathroom is painful and scary. This time my OB is writing orders for post-op binding and i think that will help give me the confidence to move more. You are so afraid/sore to move right after. I asked if it would be worth me buying a postpartum support belt, and he said he'll just put it in my orders.I will have my husband spend at least the 1st 2 nights with me. You need help with EVERYTHING, and I didn't want to bother the nurses with every little thing. For the last night or 2, i may send him home to be with my toddler, and have my mom stay with me. I do not want to be alone in the hospital. He is also taking a few weeks off to help out at home, as it is very difficult to move, and you are limited in what you are allowed to do.As scary as it is, I am doing it again so it couldn't have been that bad!! I also don't have anxiety going in to it. Not feeling my legs didn't bother me, but like I said I was really sick.oh yea- i used to think it was unfair that moms that deliver vaginally get to hold their babies right away and i had to wait until i was in recovery. I guess it evens out, since our procedure is quick and there is no 24 hours of labor beforehand.",

            "answer": "Oh honey, I'm so sorry you're scared! The spinal may not hurt, especially if you're already having contractions. Just keep reminding yourself, \"This is the best way for Baby B to make it into the world! I want to keep them safe!\" Honestly this way of giving birth will probably save their little life as a vaginal birth may be too traumatic for their little heart.The feeling will come back in your legs gradually. If you've ever been to the dentist, it feels like novicaine as you get feeling back. You'll still be able to hold babies, pending all is well, and breastfeed.Don't you worry- those doctors and nurses are going to take great care of you and your babies!",
