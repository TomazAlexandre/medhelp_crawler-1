            "answer": "I dont think doctors are legally allowed to induce you till 37 wks. unless you have a life treatening condition. I had preeclampsia... i was so ready at 7 and a half months. But i didnt get induced til 38 wks. So basically, comfort level is pretty bad for everyone after 30 wks.",

            "answer": "Maybe my story will help you...near the end of my pregnancy with my son, I was having serious heart and neurological complications..I was passing out, I was going blind, having tingling and numbness through my arms, neck, and face, I was having nauseating pain and I could barely eat....they kept estimating my son was going to be closer to 10-11lbs at 40wks...well, I managed to hold on even though the blindness and the falling unconscious was terrifying, and they finally induced me at about 39w3d after a 2-week-long battle with hospital politics and I'm SO glad I held on that long, because my body was completely ready and my labor was ridiuclously short (2 hours, and I only pushed for about 6 minutes) and my recovery time was like...hours, instead of weeks.I know you're miserable and sick, but just imagine..you could be going blind and passing out and suffering from agonizing pain ..my blood pressure also kept dropping dangerously low (76/37) and then spiking (144/108)....it was dangerous, but because there was no acute threat to my life I was able to hold out and deliver an incredibly healthy boy who only weighed 7lbs10oz...so they were WAY off on weight. I had sooo many ultraounds that kept saying he would be more than 10lbs and he would've barely been 8 had he gone to 40.Hang in there...even another 3wks makes a huge difference. My little boy had jaundice because of a blood problem and had to stay in the hospital for 5 days, but it could've been so much worse. I can't imagine if he had been born too early and had to stay longer!!!I'm sorry you feel so awful...you can do it, sweetie...just take it one day at a time.",

            "answer": "Also ultrasounds to determine weight can be off by a couple lbs and its not uncommon for babys to still be breech at this point. If you are still breech at 37-38 weeks that is usually when they will schedule a c-section or try an external version. My daughter was in the breech position at 38 weeks and I ended up just doing the version which was successful and then delivered 3 days later.",

I have tested positive for preterm labor and im 33 weeks and they put me on steroids to make sure if she comes early her lungs are more developed. They also arent going to let me go into labor and if I do they wilk stop it since she is just too young.",
