I had preeclampsia with my first and gestational diabetes with my second and i was absolutely terrified to see what would happen with the next pregnancy. Both my boys were in the NICU after birth. Plus I felt 2 kids was enough for me. I grew up with just me and my sister and to me that has already been the perfect number. Plus kids are just so expensive. I love my two boys. They are my world.",

The doctor (who no longer has a license to practice) had my mom on morphine during her labor with my sister and let her sign papers while drugged up and didn't even explain what was happening. However, once she got remarried to my step dad and decided to have another child but couldn't get pregnant she found out that her tubes had been tied.\u00a0\u00a0She had a reversal and my little brother was born 8 years after her tubes were tied. I believe it was somewhere late 5 years after the reversal. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that\u00a0\u00a0you will get pregnant after a reversal, but it is an option that could give you the chance to have another if you end up wanting to later on. Good luck with whatever you chose in the future!",
