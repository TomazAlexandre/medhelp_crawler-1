    "question": "So my current job is super highly stressful with meeting high demands and daily physical activity. I work as a door to door sales person and my question is more towards the h.r. route of can I apply or ask to be transferred into another position because of the stress I'm under be use of my current position. My bf and I both do the same job he wants me to stick it out but I don't want to risk losing the baby I'm at 10 wks. I just got back from carpal tunnel work injury and I'm just trying to focus on having enough energy to last the day and ease my mind to sleep. By the way all symptoms are full blown and some days making it impossible to work.",
