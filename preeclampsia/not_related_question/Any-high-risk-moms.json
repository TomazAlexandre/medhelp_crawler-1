    "question": "So I'm 23 weeks pregnant now and this pregnancy has been high risk since the beginning because I lost my first daughter hours after birth at 21 weeks and I have gd with my current pregnancy. I appreciate the precautions my doctors are taking this time around but man all the testing, appointments, blood work, etc. starts to take its toll, you know? I think the only positive of my high risk experience has been all of the sonograms. I have so many of my little girl already (we're having another girl) I bought a photo album for them today because I know I'll have more. I just keep telling myself 16 more weeks (they plan to induce me at 39 weeks if I make it that long)",
