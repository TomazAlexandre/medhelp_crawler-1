I am booking private scans too, i'd go every single week, but i fight that urge and keep it to one a month. Hope it all goes well and you get some good news :)",

            "answer": "Not showing as much does not mean the baby is not growing. It just means ur not showing as much. Which is better for u. U won't have to lose much after wards and ur back won't hurt as much since u don't have to carry a big belly. But sometimes ur belly doesn't grow till ur 8th or 9th month. Mine didn't start growing til 25 plus and just a small bump. (I ate healthy n exercised) and baby has been bigger 2 weeks and a half since my 1st US At 10 weeks. I'm now abt to be 47 and my belly just came out abt a month ago. Now it's big. Ppl keep saying How it just grew from one day to the next. But it's just my belly. I haven't gained weight anywhere else. I'm still wearing size small n extra small. Yet baby is big",

            "answer": "Make sure you check!!! I had a similar problem, my belly and baby wasnt growing for 2 weeks. At my doc's appointment I got high blood pressure and high protein levels in urine in addition to slow growth. Got diagnosed with preeclampsia and had to have emergency csection 2 days after.Hopefully, everything is fine with you baby. But if something doesnt seem right, make sure you sound the alarm right away. Better seem paranoid than be sorry later. Good luck, mommie!! You doing a good job ))",

            "answer": "Just wanted to say I felt the same way. Early on, like 17-26 weeks I felt huge and then everything seemed to slow down and stall out. Baby was still growing but my belly wasn't growing. I think it really all had to do with his position. Since 34 weeks I now feel like the belly is growing every day because he's too big to \"hide\" anywhere. Glad to hear everything went well at your scan!",
