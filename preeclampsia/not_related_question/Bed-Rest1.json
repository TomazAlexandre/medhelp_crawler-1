Spotted the whole first trimester and my bp started going out of control.\u00a0\u00a0Started showing signs of preeclampsia at 4 1/2 months. I work a stressful job so as much as i tried it kept getting worse till i broke out n rashes and my baby went into distress around 22 weeks. Was measuring small at my echo scan which was at 23 weeks. They pulled me from there n i havent had a problem since. Now she has caught up n weight and not shown any signs of distress. My bp has been amazing...they said it bought me time but they now think imma go around 34 weeks if i continue to take it easy n rest. Sorry its so long :)",
