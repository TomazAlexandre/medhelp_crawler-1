If her blood sugar has been out of whack as well, they could be trying to stabilize that as well.at 35 weeks, if the preeclampsia is bad enough, they sometimes induce labor as its the only way to get rid of it.",

I learned alot about things I was going through with all my pregnancys. I've been watching it for about 8 years.

If it's preeclampsia and it doesn't get any better within the day they'll deliver her.Delivery is the ONLY cure for preeclampsia/eclampsia.They look for Protein in the urine, as well as high blood pressure and swelling. It can cause strokes, heart attacks, and somtimes clots. not good... She's luckily far enough along the baby should be fine.GoingOnFiveKids~ I think you were right to suggest it. because it's so dangerous. it can get deadly within a matter of hours.
