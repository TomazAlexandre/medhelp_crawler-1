            "answer": "I am almost 37 weeks and my\u00a0\u00a0BH are the worst! I've been getting them more frequently over the past couple of weeks, and they just wear me out. I've found a hot bath helps alot. I've had some bad heartburn and indigestion lately, but I can't really say I'm helping matters with all the spicy foods I've been eating lol.\u00a0\u00a0I'm measuring a little big, for the past 2 visits I've measured a week and a half ahead, so I'm thinking this LO won't make it another month lol. I've been dealing with some higher blood pressure and some swelling, so my midwife wants me to take it easy in the evenings. So far rest keeps the BP down, and a good foot massage from DH helps reduce my \"Flintstone Feet\" :0). Since I'm not showing any protein in my urine, and everything is being managed, we're not thinking preeclampsia yet, thank God! She is however, telling me that I should brace myself for the fact that I could be induced within the next few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I'm ready to not be pregnant anymore but I'm soo not ready to have my little girl yet lol. I still have so much nesting in me, gotta pack my hospital bag....\u00a0\u00a0:0). Have any of\u00a0\u00a0you gotten your GBS test done? I had it done at my last appt, and I should get the results back at my appt tomorrow.I am so close, and yet so far away... lol",

Yesterday i lost my mucus plug and have been having contractions ever since but nothing serious unfortunately.I went in for an NST yesterday and was having small regular contractions. My doc said she'll be amazed if i make it to my next appt and if i do she wants to schedule an induction for 39 1/2 weeks ish. I'm so ready for this baby to come, the back pain since she dropped has been horrible.\u00a0\u00a0I think she wants to induce because since i want a vaginal birth and i have a small frame she's afraid that the baby will get to big the birth canal to handle. i really dont want a csec. So we'll just have to see! i really want her to come on her own! but knowing DH's stubborn italian side she'll wait just cause we want her to come so bad lol",

We did go in to the hospital onThursday and they kept me overnight, but eventually sent me home with an induction scheduled for 3am Sunday (essentially tonight!).
