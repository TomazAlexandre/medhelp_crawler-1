            "answer": "well, the spinal went very well- quick and easy for me. and i had a student do it. my section wasn't exactly a pleasant experience, but that was mostly because it wasn't planned in advance. my dr told me that morning that we had to do it that day, and they didn't get me in until 5. that's a very long time for a pregnant lady to go without eating or drinking (none since the night before). so i felt very sick from the heartburn and low blood sugar, on top of the worst thirst i ever experienced. on top of that i felt so sick from the preeclampsia. i can honestly say i have never in my life felt so sick. but that probably won't be your case- it was due to my circumstances. the procedure is remarkably quick. i didn't even know when they started cutting- i just thought they were gently pushing on my abdomen feeling the baby. baby was out quickly, but not until they practically jump on your chest to push her down. again, that didn't hurt at all- it was just kinda weird. while they were closing me, i did start to experience very very intense chest pain. it felt like it shot straight through to my back. i mentioned it as it started to build. the anesthesiologist said it's a normal reaction and it was just intense heart burn. it got really bad, and he must've seen i was starting to panic so he very quickly put something in my IV. i felt better instantly, but became even more groggy and don't remember much of the rest of the procedure. this carried over into recovery. i remember them putting the baby on my lap, but i didn't care at that point.honestly, i don't think the procedure is much to be nervous about. and i have never in my life had any surgical procedure done. heck, i had never even had an IV before. i am not nervous about having to have another c-section- i'm more concerned about having to go through the recovery again. now that was a b!tch.",
