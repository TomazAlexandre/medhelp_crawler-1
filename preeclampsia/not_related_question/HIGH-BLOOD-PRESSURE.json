            "answer": "Believe me, just try to relax. Same thing is happening to me. Every doctors appointment my blood pressure is high at first because I'm nervous/anxious. They tested me for preeclampsia and I didn't have it. But after I talk to the doctor and everything is done they check my blood pressure again and it's gone down. A lot of it is just anxiety. Then Saturday night my feet swelled up HUGE! Went to the hospital to get checked out for preeclampsia yet again, checked my blood pressure, urine for protein, and had a cuff on my arm that would check my blood pressure every ten mins and everything was just fine. We work ourselves up, I know I definitely do. Your feet can swell up from so many different things. They pretty much told me to just take it easy and stop being on my feet so much. Good luck!",
