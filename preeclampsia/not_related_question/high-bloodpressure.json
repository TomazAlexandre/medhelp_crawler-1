            "answer": "Sounds like your doctor is looking our for pre eclampsia. Your doctor will monitor you and your baby very closely. You'll only have to be induced if your docotor sees a change that is bad. Like your blood pressure getting higher or your baby's showing signs of distress. You probably will want to stay away from high of sodium foods. That might help with your blood pressure. Drink lots of water and if you start seeing spots or feeling dizzy, getting really bad headaches, or swelling excessively, then let your doctor know right away.",
