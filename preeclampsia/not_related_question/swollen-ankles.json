            "answer": "Have someone massage your feet going from toes up to your ankles and calfs going upwards so you push the fluid away from your ankle and not into your ankle. Avoid salt, drink lots of water and keep your feet up as much as you can. When you sleep see if you can put a foot on a pillow. If it is not getting better you can get special socks called tent hoes that help circulation, your dr. might have some of check out online or a store.",

As the others suggested though, keep your legs elevated, keep hydrated, and definitely speak to your doctor about it.",

            "answer": "Drink a lot of water! Water thins the salts in your body and makes the swelling go down a bit. I found putting my feet in cold water didn't really make the swelling go down, but it felt AWESOME. Elevate your feet above your heart like diamondintherough79 said and keep an eye out for swelling in other body parts; if fingers swell up more than a little or your face gets puffy and you suffer from severe/persistant headaches or nausea you need to contact your doctor right away (as it is a sign of preeclampsia)Unfortunately it's something we pregnant ladies have to deal with. It's nasty and very uncomfortable, but can't be helped much!",
