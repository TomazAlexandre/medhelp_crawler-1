            "answer": "I had similar pains when I was pregnant, but later in the second trimester. My right shoulder and neck and down my arm. How is your blood pressure?? I ahd soemthing called HELLP syndrome and the pain was coming from my liver. I REALLY think it is too early in your pregnancy to have this condition. Its a form of preeclampsia and normal onset is after 20 weeks, but the pain in the right shoulder and arm makes me think of what happened to me. I would go online and check the symptoms of HELLP and see if you are experiencing any other symptoms. All I had was the neck and shoulder pain, I did not have high blood pressure at the onest. Also high levels of protein in the urine which your OB should be checking anyway. I really, really think it is too early for this, but I would check just to be safe b/c they can manage HELLP if cauht timely.Good luck, and I hope you feel better.",

    "question": "I'm 15 weeks pregnant and am limited on what I can take when it comes to pain in my right elbow area. The pain is excruciating in the elbow, shoulder and neck area and there is numbness in my right hand and some soreness in my right forearm. I just saw my OBGYN on Monday, but I didnt have this much pain until tuesday afternoon. I FEEL LIKE CUTTING OFF MY ARM TO MAKE THE PAIN GO AWAY! I have used an ice pack and that only made me vomit when the blood rushed back into my elbow. I really don't know what else to do. My husband rubbed my shoulder blade and right below my armpit and this gave me a brief spite of relief, but when he stops the pain comes back immediately.",
