My csection was only due to placenta previa, so the doctor is very confident that I will be successful. (Since I never had issues with the labor not progressing in time.) I never even had a contraction with my last pregnancy because (I was told) I would have bled out from the placent ripping.My csection was scheduled & it was the most terrifying & disappointing experiences of my life... Not to mention the 6 month recovery & pain in my back for the past almost 2 years) that is from possible nerve damage due to the spinal block. I really want this VBAC because I just don't think I can deal with a toddler and another csection recovery like that.",
