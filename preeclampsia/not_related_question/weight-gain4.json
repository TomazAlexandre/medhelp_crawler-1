Underweight 20-40.Baby/Placenta/Amniotic Fluid etc. are between 20-25 lbs. To gain 20-25 is great and will probably come off in first 6 weeks especially if breast feeding.They say if you gain more than 30, you will struggle to take the excess off.Eat whole natural foods....meat, fish, vegies, fruit, grains. Keep clear of processed fast food and sugar! No sugary drinks, fruit juices, ice cream, cake, cookies etc. Processed junk food causes sugar/insulin spikes which your body and the baby can use so they it gets stored as fat",
