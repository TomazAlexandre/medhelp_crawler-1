I don't know, but I wish you well on Monday, let us know how it goes. It may also depend on how your uterus is sitting, that can have an affect on the measurement as well.",

            "answer": "I had the same prob. I looked like I was carrying twins. I was always a few weeks ahead of what I should have measured. I gained about 60lbs my entire pregnancy. I was without health care most of my pregnancy, but the hospitals helped me out when they could because no docs would accept me cuz I was too far along when I finally moved back to Texas from Massachusetts. My daughter ended up coming out 10lbs 13oz. I was suspected GD. I sweated most of my weight off within the first month PP.You'll be having your gluecose test probably next month. But if you notice any abnormal swelling, particularly in your hands, feet and legs, don't be surprised if the doc wants to do some tests. You could also just end up having a really big baby and that's why you're gaining weight. Big babies run in my family so I never expected anything less than the 2 porkers I got. hehe.",

He then told me he wants me to come in on Monday next avalable apointment for an ultrasound I'm measuring to big and I gained 9lbs in 4wks.He didn't mention what could be the reason for the large weight gain and large uterus. I'm freaking out.I have had a very normal easy pregnancy so far. Been measuring just a day or two ahead on all the early ultrasounds. I had one a week from 6-12wks.Please reasure me there isn't anything to stress out about.",
