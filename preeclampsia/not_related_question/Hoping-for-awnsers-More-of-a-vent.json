    "question": "Approx. 3 weeks ago i started having strange symptoms.. As these symptoms progressed i started having body tremors and seizures. I've never had these before now, i am currently 26 weeks pregnant and i have been having tremors all day, along with body aches that are indescribable. Last night during dinner i started having a seizure and\u00a0\u00a0felt as though i was a ball of tension that was going to explode. I went on to have 3 seizures last night, and afterward i got extremely upset and my body seemed to be falling apart. These symptoms make me feel terrible, i went for an E.E.G and should receive the answers tomorrow, however i can't help but to feel as though my body is giving up on me. Along with these seizures i started having more migraines and floaters. These symptoms have worsened and as i was sitting in a college orientation today i started having tremors and they turned off one set of lights and i felt as though i was gonna have a seizure. Thank god i didn't, i thought of my little guy and started to feel a bit better. These tremors upset me and make me wanna cry if i am in front of other people, i can't help but worry about my little guy who is growing inside of me. I try to relax but sometimes it seems to be the farthest thing from me. Thanks to all that took the time to read this, it's hard to talk to my family about this because they seem to be extremely worried about me and little Hayden.",
