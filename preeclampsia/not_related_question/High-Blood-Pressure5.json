            "answer": "I have cronic hypertention, not preclasmia. I am on meds and my normal is 137/ 87. Last week i was in the hospital because it was 180/ 100. I had a bunch of tests done and they were all normal. They would test u for preclapsmia( pregnancy hbp) which can be bad. However my Dr said anything over 160/ 100 is not a good thing and thats when to worry, i would take your drs advice (probably told u to cut out salt) and go by what he thinks is abnormal vs normal bp readings.",

            "answer": "Sometimes just being nervous about the testing will raise yourbp\u00a0\u00a0you did say it went back down!I think they are more concerned with the difference between the numbers, one number represents the beating and the other relaxing if the numbers are too high and close together that indicates your heart isnt getting enough time to relax before the next beat which results in high bp.I really didnt think it sounded too high but I am no doctor I remember one time while pregnant I had 140/80 and my doctor never seemed concerned, the other times it was 120/80 usually",

            "answer": "they must have a different normal vs. high range depending on your age or something. I'm 31 and mine consistently runs 130/80 and they always tell me that is good. (course when i was 20 it was 110/65 most of the time) they don't tend to worry too much about you unless your bottom # goes over 100 and stays there... that can cause all sorts of problems including seizures which can be fatal for your baby so if you get there expect them to start freaking out.i can tell you from experience (i had pregnancy induced hypertension with both my previous pregnancies starting at about 28 weeks and fully expect to get it with this one too) that if it stays up they will either put you on bedrest of blood pressure medicine. The blood pressure medicine was enough to keep mine under control.try not to worry- there is a big difference between preeclampsia and pregnancy induced hypertension. the high blood pressure is just a warning sign of preeclampsia so they will probably just moniter you closer.it'll be ok. just try to take it as easy as you can, limit your physical activity (including walking) and let us know how it goes. :o)",

Of course I am no doctor and they are all different but mine told me if it gets into the upper 130's then they start to get a little concerned. Just relax I am sure you are fine and it did go down. I have to start those non stress tests when I turn 36 weeks due to gestational diabetes. I am curious to see what they are like. I only have a 2 1/2 weeks until then. Good luck! Danielle",
