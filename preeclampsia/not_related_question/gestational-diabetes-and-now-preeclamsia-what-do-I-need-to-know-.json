            "answer": "I'm preg with #2. I've not had it, but helped many women through it.\u00a0\u00a0Preeclampsia is primarily caused from not enough expansion in blood volume. Eating a very high protein diet and getting plenty of water and salt can reverse this. One client I took care of had to eat 10 grams of protein every hour, but carried to term and went into labor herself having a healthy baby. Most won't have to eat that much, but you do have to get a lot more protein than normal to make up (200 grams per day is normally a good goal if preeclampsia is already starting). Hope things get better for you.",

            "answer": "This is my 2nd pregnancy with preeclamplsia. I get preeclamplsia because I don't grow very good placentas so my ob manages it with aspirin, calcium, blood pressure meds and a low fat diet. I developed it at 28wks with my first and delivered at 35wks vis csection and this time developed it at 15wks and am delivering in 6days time when I will be 36wks. Try to avoid the things that typically increase your blood pressure such as salt, grapefruit, stress and overdoing it and remember the proteins being leaked by your kidneys into your urine is not the same protein found in food. Talk to your dr because their plan for you will really dependon how your body is coping (how high your bp and how much protein in urine) and how baby is developing (whether they would be better off developing in or out of the womb). Wishing you and baby all the best!",

    "question": "Hello ladies, I will start off by saying am so happy I have made it to 31 weeks and 3 days. I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes weeks ago. Now my blood pressure has been going up for weeks now. I did all the blood test they were normal, then the 24 hours urine collection which showed protein in my urine. I was told the perinatal doctors will come talk to me about when to deliver. What can I expect? Has anyone else been through this? Am worried is my baby going to be ok?",
