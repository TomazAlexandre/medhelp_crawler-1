            "answer": "Hi I too am pregnant 22 weeks with twins. A boy and a girl :D! I have had high b/p since the first part of August. My doctor had placed me on b/p medication for b/p reading at 163/98. We have all done well on the medication called Labetalol. I take 100mg twice a day and my b/p has stabilized around the 120/70's. I wish you well through your pregnancy!! So far so good on mine :D!! Don't recall if they did a check on protein levels in the urine but all tests that they have done at this point have returned awesome! Hope this sheds some light for you. Try not to worry!! It's hard I know!!",

            "answer": "I want to tell you first that lack of sleep and stress will definitely affect your blood pressure, but it may affect people in different ways. I was working thirds during this pregnancy for a while and pulled over 24 with no sleep and my blood pressure was low when I went to the doctors. However this could be different for everyone. It seems as though yours isnt quite too high yet. Another thing to watch for is how much sodium you are taking in. I got preeclampsia with my first pregnancy and after that I watch what I eat. No canned veggies or fruit and definately nothing like spaghettios. Also, frozen entreees of any kind also contain a lot of sodium which can cause water retention and high blood presssure. Definitely check with your doc, but catching this problem at such an early stage may actually be a benefit as the doctor can keep an eye on it instead of it just springing up out of nowhere and catching everyone off guard. Good luck with all!\u00a0\u00a0Congrats on the twins!",

            "answer": "Thanks! I forgot to mention the sodium I think for me also. They have cut the sodium down to no more then 2400mg per day and the sugars to as light as possible. I can have the natural sugars like the fruits but have to be careful on how much I take in. Good luck to you and your pregnancy :D!
