            "answer": "Hi, Quix--Quicky interpretation is that having MS means likelihood of other autoimmune comorbidities (are there any ORs given? because that would speak to risk) for having some of these other things, which I knew, but I can't recall reading any studies--and I just edited an ENORMOUS thyroid review--finding a greater risk of MS with these other things.Now, prevalence means how many you find at a given snapshot in time when you do a count. So, that could be people who had it two years ago, last year, and this year, all counted. Incidence means the ones who turn up with it at repeats of those moments in time, i.e., every year (or person-year), you check how many new cases of something there are, and that's the incidence rate over that period of years. Cumulative incidence are the new cases that arise during one increment of your time period, i.e., in a single year. If you just count the number of cases that exist that year, whether new or not, that's the prevalence. I'm closely involved with autism, and people consistently mis-cite the prevalence rate as the incidence.So, if you look at a population of 100 people and 10 of them have MS, the period prevalence in that population is 10%. But if \"only\" five of these are new cases for that time period, then the cumulative incidence for that year is 5%. If last year, the cumulative incidence was 3%, the incidence rate over two years has gone up 2%. But the period prevalence might have stayed the same, depending on whether or not some members of the population died or something.For the things in your table:Hyper-androgenism - Significantly more common in MS patients than in controls###--among an MS population vs a non-MS population, there is more hyperandrogenism. I could see why that would be, given possibly pituitary/adrenal involvements. The chicken (MS) precedes the egg (hyperandrogenism) here.Inflammatory Bowel Disease - Increased Expression in MS patients (?) (small studies)###--first, the little studies are always troublesome, but again, this means in a snapshot of an MS population vs a non-MS population, a larger percentage of the MS pop will have IBD compared to the non-MS pop. Again, given neurosignaling issues to the gut, I could see why this would be. Again, chicken precedes egg.Type I Diabetes - Prevalence (?) in MS subjects 3 X that in their healthy siblings(P=0.001)and 5 X the rate in the gneral population (P=0.0001)###--these P values are highly significant, meaning the probability that this is just an accidental random-act-of-nature finding is very small. This refers to prevalence, so that means just looking at diabetes in a population--not new cases, just overall--the MS pop has far more than the healthy-sibs pop, three times more; and it has 5 times more than the general pop, overall. Chicken/egg? I think these are probably both chickens--i.e., a tendency to severe autoimmune problems.Note: the following are all different studies on co-occurence of MS and thyroid disease:Thyroid disorders (type not specified) - 3 X more common in MS (females only studied)###--comparing an MS to a non-MS pop, there's more thyroid disorder among the MS pop. I'm seeing two chickens here, but this only means that when you look at MSers, you see more thyroid issues, NOT that thyroid issues are a risk factor for MS. Any studies on what happens when you look at a population of people with thyroid autoimmunity? What are MS rates?Autoimmune Thyroid Disease (Grave's) - Excess risk in first-degree relatives of probandswith MS###--here you seem to be looking at heritable autoimmune problems. A \"proband\" is the person being examined/investigated. So, a person who has a first-degree relative (mom, dad, sib) with MS is at a higher risk for Graves (the hyper- one, protruding eyes, etc., that the senior Bush family has). Again, this is a co-morbidity association, not a chicken-egg finding. I wonder what \"excess\" is. This one's kind of interesting to me because I have a *second-degree* relative with MS and no longer have my own thyroid because of autoimmune issues (Grave's).Autoimmune Thyroid Disease ATT (unpsecified) - Higher prevalence of ATT in male MSpatients (9.4%) than in controls (1.9%); P=0.03\u00a0\u00a0no significant difference in females###--this is interesting because it differs in terms of women from the findings described above--i.e., in this second study, among women with MS, there's no more thyroid disease than among women without. And the study as found a significantly (any P value less than 0.05, which means a 5% chance it could just be random and not meaningful, is \"significant\" unless the stats are more complex)--found a significantly higher percentage of ATT in the male MS group compared to the male non-MS group, ~10% vs. ~2%, or about five times higher, which is similar to that 5X rate in the Type-1 diabetes group above. A co-morbidity finding, not a chicken-egg. I know that with autoimmunity, there can be comorbid manifestations of it.Presence of +ANA and Antithyroid autoantibodies (ATAbs) - Frequency of ATAbs inopticospinal (OSMS, neuromyelitis optica, Devic's) MS higher than that in non-OSMS(P=0.007), but that of +ANA similar in each group.###--again, some significant (or nearly so with p = 0.07) findings, and again, MS is the risk factor, rather than the other way around. Does anyone know of any studies of people with thyroid autoimmunity and incidence or prevalence of MS that develops later, or comparisons of the timing?Sjogren's Syndrome (SS) - 3 - 16 X (!!!) more common in subjects with MS.\u00a0\u00a0SS canmimic MS (diagnoses may have been confused)###--again, MS is a co-morbidity with SS, much like the thyroid findings above.Psoriasis - Subfroup of MS patients with a first- or second-degree relative had early (<16)MS onset.###--I wonder what the subgroup was. Must have been age, given the \"early onset\" criterion. No further data?Bio",

The only causal ones I see (where MS would be the chicken and the disorder would be the result of it, or the egg) might be the IBD or the hormone disruptions, given the neurological contribution to both systems. I mean, I could see disrupted signaling to the bowel becoming a problem in that regard, for example. Doesn't mean it would have to be that way, but if it were, then MS would really be a \"risk factor\" for those things. Right?This is just an anecdote, but it fits with what the literature (and you) say: I at least have (had) a thyroid autoimmune problem that came suddenly to a crisis a year ago. I've also had two episodes of preeclampsia/toxemia, which is AI related (they seem to think). I also have IBD (in addition to a nasty large adenoma that is now gone). I have RSD/CRPS1, which is certainly related to cytokine expression and immune response and thus next door to AI, at least. My paternal grandmother has MS (PPMS). My mother has asthma and thyroid issues; my maternal grandmother and great-grandmother have/had thyroid issues. Looks like I don't stand a chance, eh? Luckily, I have three boys and their sex makes AI troubles generally less likely. Obviously (or it seems so to me), we've got a bit o' the AI in the family gene pool.I do know, thanks to the GI problems, that I do not have celiac disease.Bio",

    "question": "I know that people with one autoimmune disorder are more likely than the general population to get another, but I'm wondering if there are any recent studies on this. Specifically, of course, about MS, and also just about MS and thyroid diseases.I have been hypothyroid for many years, and back in the day, no one said diddly about Hashimoto's or autoimmune diseases. However, that may well have been before these labels were even devised. I know it's not possible now to find out whether my kind is Hashimoto's, because ultimately the antibodies stop producing.. 'Ultimately' occurred long ago for me.However, subsequent to my diagnosis by a lot of years, a surprising number of relatives have also been diagnosed with thyroid disease, in generations both above and below me. There are 3 with definite Hashimoto's, and one with definite Grave's disease. Two others are also suspect for Grave's. This clearly comes through my mother's line of descent.What I'm wondering is whether these family members, given this strong gene thing, are at a significantly greater risk than most for MS. As far as I know, no one else has or has had any other autoimmune disorder.This is just a question and I'm not alarmed or anything, merely curious. I know others here have family members with thyroid problems, and also, of course, they do too.ess",
