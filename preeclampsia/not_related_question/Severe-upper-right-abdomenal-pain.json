If you do some research on it you will find that most diseased gallbladder tests are negative only to find out during surgery that it was in fact diseased. Are you feeling bloated and full and burping a lot? If so, it is very likely your gallbladder. You can look up some foods that should help. My pain went away after about 2 weeks. You can also try a 3 day clear liquid diet.",

The hospital made me see a dietitian and put me on a low-fat diet but my ob was a bit dismissive of that just saying he guessed it would help my preeclamplsia.It just seems to be getting worse, to the point I couldn't lie on my right side at all during the night so kept waking up. Don't want to have to go back to my ob if he really feels its nothing to worry about :-(",
