            "answer": "It's awful when it happens. If im taking a little walk when it happens, I automatically need to stop and rest for a minute. I also had a csection so that's still painful. And not walking around isn't an option. Apparently, I'm high risk for PPD because of my family history and walking a little bit outside when one of the orders I got from the doctor. He doesn't want me staying inside for any length of time. Like I said though, the guy did a great.job (and was super nice. Visited my bf and I multiple times during our stay just to talk about things..mainly football haha) I hope the cramping goes away..I hate when. It happens when I'm carrying my son. :/",

            "answer": "Yes mine hurt so bad that I couldn't enjoy carrying my little boy around. It hurt for a while too. My cousins wife complained of back pain as well. I don't want to be induced again and I don't want an epidural. I didn't want it in the first place but preeclampsia raised my blood pressure too high. I'm hoping for a water birth this time around. I heard it is so much easier and has a higher chance of no pain relievers because it is so relaxing. I hope your pain passes quickly and if it continues to bother you speak with your doctor.",

    "question": "I know this is a pregnant forum but I don't have anyone else to ask, and you ladies have wetr helpful throughout my whole pregnancy. When you had the epidural, did your back cramp up after? I had my son just over a week ago and I ended up getting an epidural. The pitocin made me dilate to fast so my body wasn't taking kindly to the contractions. Now that it's a week later Im getting a really bad cramp off and on in my lower back. I was wondering if anyone else had this happen? The guy who did the epidural did a great job, I didn't even feel the needle or anything. And the cramp just started a few days ago..any one have this experience?",
