He should have 10 in an hour but most likely it'll be too many movements to count. ANY movement counts- push, roll, kick, jab, flutter.Baby can be engaged and you can be dilated for weeks before going into labor. It sounds to me like you're having Braxton Hicks. Definitely put your feet up because you want baby to \"cook\" a little bit longer before he makes a debut!",

            "answer": "I had a back labor with my first and was just back pain, no contractions that I could feel. It's possible you are having contractions but that would have to be up to your doctor to decide if you should be seen or not. I would at least call. I feel the same.......I have high risk pregnancies and call about every little thing and don't want my doctor to get sick of me calling but everyone always tells me to just call when I'm worried about something because you never know what could be going on. Don't just assume it's nothing because although you are real close it's too early for baby to come, he/she could still have many problems if this early so my advice is to at least call your doctor.",

The only thing I'm worried about is, the last contractions I was having were \"real\" contractions not BH because they were every 10 minutes, and they gave me a shot because it was changing my cervix, and I don't want it to happen again.",

            "answer": "Yea. This is def something that you should go see L&D about. When i was 33w4d I had to go to the hospital for preterm labor and I didnt even know I was in labor. I went into the doc office for my visit and they checked me because I was having some pressure. She sent me straight to the hospital because I was in preterm labor.....I would have never guessed it bc I wasnt feeling them! I also got shots to stop the contractions, as well as shots to help the babies lungs develop just incase she did come early. I was pulled out of work, which you should be too..and I had to go to the hospital 2x a week for NST tests after that (i also had higher blood pressure which lead to preeclampsia).Listen to your body hun......and if you think you need to go to L&D, just go. Dont worry about what they will think!",

    "question": "Last week I went to L&D because I had a ton of pressure around my cervix area, and when I got there I found out I was having contractions, he's \"settled into my pelvis\" (still not too sure what that means, if he's lightened or not) and I'm 1cm dilated. They gave me a shot to stop the contractions. Lately I've been having really bad back pain, lower back, sometimes it's in my upper back too, and period like cramping. Also he hasn't been moving much at all lately. Should I call L&D? I don't want to annoy them and go if it's nothing, and usually when they hook me up to the NST he starts kickin up a storm! The only thing is I don't know if what I'm having is contractions because I didn't even feel the contractions at the hospital, so I'm still uncertain how real contractions feel. Any advice?? I'm 35W1D pregnant.",
