Don't worry about weight gain so much if you're eating healthy. Comparing yourself to others you will always be a little more or a little less. Everyone is different. Your weight gain sounds within range. You're almost there!!",

Anyway, I did eat healthy things and not so healthy things.I think that if you are eating healthy, then you shouldnt be so concerned about how much you gain.\u00a0\u00a0As long as you dont induldge in bad foods like I did.\u00a0\u00a0There is a reason why your gaining more and it could be lots of reasons.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of times, swelling holds alot of weight. Maybe this baby will be bigger than your last.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I've always heard that when your smaller, you should gain more than 30.\u00a0\u00a0That's just my take on the situation.",

Weight gain in general is a struggle for me, I was an overweight child,(My brother and I were indulged in weekly weekend trips to Mcdonald's, Burger King, etc. by my Aunt who thought she was spoiling us) and struggled with weight gain in my early teens. I adopted a healthier life style by age 15, and cut out red meat, soda, fast food, margarine, sugary snacks and bumped up the healthy food, and was able to get to a healthy figure in about 2 years.(the right way!)..Because I was teased so badly, weight is a sensitive thing for me, even in pregnancy. But as long as I am eating healthy and doing everything right, I guess I have nothing to worry about. 2nd baby-it is so tough to see those numbers creep, even if it is for a good reason...thanks to all for sharing their experience!",

    "question": "I know this is a pretty frequently talked about topic, but I was wondering how much weight everyone gained w/ their pregnancies. I am at the point now where I am rapidly gaining weight (1-1 1/2 lbs a week) and it is taking a toll. I am only 5'2'', normally 115 lbs. (at most) and all the weight gain is killing my back and hurting my knees(worse than my first). I am 32 1/2 weeks and have already gained over 20 lbs., and will probably hit 30 lbs. by the end (gained 28 lbs. with Maddy)..does that sound about right? I feel like 30 lbs. is a lot for my petit frame, and when I talk to some women who are about my size, they say they only gained 20 lbs. in the whole pregnancy...I've got 7 1/2 weeks left and have already gained that. I am eating really healthy, and have tried to cut down a lot on the sweets and sugar in general (eating more fruit and salads, helping w/ the constipation at least, sorry,tmi) How should I be eating at this point? I feel like I should be eating really healthy and not giving into to all the junk food cravings, as I don't want to get in the habit of eating whatever I feel like. Thanks for your thoughts!~bops",
