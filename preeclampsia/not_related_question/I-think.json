I have been extremely uncomfortable. Its hard for me to roll over.....stand up from the couch.....etc.There are days where I feel pressure down so far I feel like shes right there....close enough to come out.When I was put on bedrest, I was told no sex...but the last 2 nights I said screw it because I figured....why not...36 weeks now...pretty much...well, today I am atleast.Im just done being pregnant. I go to the hospital tomorrow morning for ANOTHER NST test and then to the doc office for my OB appt where I am hoping they will check to see if\u00a0\u00a0I am more dilated or anything of that nature. I have only been checked once which was a couple weeks ago...They are watching me for preeclampsia/hypertension....high blood pressure..because it has been high every appt i have been too. They told me to watch for spots in my vision, cramping in my right side below my ribs..etc..i have bad a bit of blurred vision here and there and have been a bit dizzy if I bend over and stand up.......which hasnt been happening prior...so I am hoping those arent signs of this hypertension thing...we will see tomorrow..hang in there! I am as anxious as you are to meet my little girl!!",

            "answer": "I am right there with you too. I have been to L&D 3 times now and still no baby. Twice they stopped my labor and now that they aren't going to stop it anymore, it stops on it's own. The pressure on my hips is crazy and downstairs as well. I lost my mucus plug a wek ago and I am 3cm 90% effaced. So comeon already... I don't think my body knows what to do now after they stopped my labor a few times.I will be 38 weeks Tuesday and I am miserable. I am going to press to be induced\u00a0\u00a0if I make it to my dr appt Wed. They don't want to induce till 39 weeks, but I can not go another week. This is my 4th, but i was never this uncomfortable with the other three. I think the bed rest for the whole pregnancy has taken its toll on the whole house. Now we are alljustin a waiting pattern and my huby hasn't been to work in almost 2 weeks cause I can go at anytime. I'm so ready to be done being pregnant andmove on to the baby part. I am going to try to enjoy these last few kicks, twists and turns before he comes out though as I will miss them very much when he finally does come!Good luck Brandi and everyone!!",

            "answer": "Hi Brandi, Lance,Me too! ME TOO!The last time I was so uncomfortable was just after the laparotomy for appendicitis I had 6 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0It hurts to move and to stand up straight.\u00a0\u00a0My pubic bone feels like it's splitting.When I went to the hospital I was 35 1/2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0So they confined me and I've been on IV to stop contractions (still having mild ones despite) for the last 10 days, with strict bed rest.\u00a0\u00a0Given the gestational diabetes they wanted me to get to 37 weeks, preferably 37 1/2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Well I was at 37 weeks last Friday.\u00a0\u00a0I am so done with being on bedrest and stuck in this hospital, and having a tummy that's turning into a basketball. I have gained next to nothing in the past 9 weeks (maybe 1 - 2 lbs)\u00a0\u00a0- that's another reason they put me on bedrest - suspected failure to thrive of baby girl.\u00a0\u00a0But they've been doing biophysical every 4 days and looks like baby girl is catching up.\u00a0\u00a0She has gained about 1 lb in the past 2 weeks. She's about 6 1/2 lbs now as of yesterday and reckon that's big enough for now.Not even allowed to get up to the toilet.\u00a0\u00a0Stuff it though,\u00a0\u00a0the nurse just did her rounds and I'm going to have a shower and a shave etc.... they don't check on me again 'til morning after their night time check.Been working all day on a tender that's due for work tomorrow. A very big and important one.\u00a0\u00a0Just about done, one more document to check. And a few bits and pieces that can wait til the morning.\u00a0\u00a0The tender will be submitted tomorrow about lunch time.\u00a0\u00a0Then baby can come!\u00a0\u00a0Was begging docs to stop the IV today.\u00a0\u00a0But no, tomorrow!\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0\u00a0plan is still to welcome baby girl on Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0Hope she does come after all this fuss and bother....Hang in there you guys too!",
