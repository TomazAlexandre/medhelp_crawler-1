    "question": "Aside from being very thankful for a healthy, active baby, nothing has gone right. I'm 28 weeks and am on my 4th round of kidney stones. One round required surgery to remove a stone too large to pass after 2 months of unbearable pain. The last 2 I have been able to pass. Found out I had plecenta previa at my 20 week U/S, spent 10 hours in the ER the other night due to heart issues related to pregnancy only for them to come up empty handed and lacking answers. They did find that I had an elevated lipase level while I was there. They said that the most common reason would be excessive drinking, gallstones or pancreatitis. None of which applied to me, so no answers there. I've ssuffered from severe restless leg syndrome for weeks now but my DR didn't seem to be interested in helping me figure out a possible reason. Turns out I'm anemic and in need of iron which helped clear up the restless legs. I just learned today that I failed my 3 hour glucose test so I'm also now on board with the diabetes bandwagon. And of course all the other normal pregnancy aches and pains. I'm just really wanting this to be over with :( anyone else?",
