            "answer": "It varies from woman to woman. I was pregnant at 21 lost the baby to miscarriage and didn't get pregnant again until 25 lost that one to miscarriage and a year later I was pregnant again and carried him up to 35 weeks and had to be induced during to preeclampsia.Honestly I got pregnant when I stopped thinking about it and just went on with my life. We weren't trying but wasn't preventing and our sex life was great when we stopped trying. We would at least try to have sex every 2 days or 4. Sorry If this is tmi.\u00a0\u00a0I never quit taking prenatals. Take your prenatal everyday. Eat healthy and exercise.I do wish you luck and I pray that your womb is healed the same as Sarah's Rebecca's and all of the other women that were baron. I prayed the same for myself.

            "answer": "It took my husband and i 3.5yrs to conceive our second child. Even went on infertility drugs and everything and nothing worked. Sometimes it takes awhile. Maybe you have scarring from the previous abortion when you were younger. I have endometriosis so i have alot of scar tissue and i only have half my cervix from a previous leep procedure. Good luck. Don't give up or lose hope. :)",

    "question": "I am almost 28, my husband and I have been trying to conceive for a few months now. But nothing seems to be working in our favor. I think we've tried everything known to man to try and help us along. What could I possibly be doing wrong? I'm starting to feel ashamed, discouraged , and worthless that I'm not conceiving. I had an abortion back when I was 16 due to a rare cancer complication, could that affect my fertility (the abortion)? I was never on chemotherapy or radiation just a surgical procedure for the cancer so I am pretty sure that has nothing to do with it. please if anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them. thank you for your time, it is very much appreciated.",
