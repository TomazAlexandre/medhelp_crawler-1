So if I go natural this time they need all the bells and whistles hooked to me. Talk to your doctor and make your wants and needs known and really discuss it in depth. Good luck!",

If you can do it , go for it!!!! But if you have to get another csection look up the gentle c , and discuss it with your doctor :) I'm having my 3rd in September and just started reading about the gentle c and will hopefully be incorporating some of the stuff into the delivery",
