Before i was pregnant i only drank like a cup of coffee like every four months or so because im not a big fan of caffeine/coffee anyways. I was just craving it today so i figured i would ask. I drink it with alot of creamer and barely any coffee because i cant stand the taste of strong coffee anyways. So thank you for that i appreciate it i know not to drink alot of caffeine that will be the only cup of coffee i have during my pregnancy thats for sure.",

She said that caffeine can restrict the blood flow in the umbilical cord to the baby, and that's why they prefer you to not drink it. I'm not a big water drinker, so it was very hard for me to give up my coffee, haha. I just use MiO's or water flavorings to help force it down, and then drink fruit\u00a0\u00a0juices. (:",

Believe it or not though, if you do stay away from it and maybe try to get even an extra half hour's worth of sleep at night it does make a world of difference. I was used to drinking at least four or more cups a day so when I had to cut back it was one of the hardest adjustments that I had to make. I was tired all of the time and had no energy until the caffeine left my system and my body got used to not having it. I know it's hard, but it's definitely possible. And definitely worth it when it comes to the health of your LO :)",
