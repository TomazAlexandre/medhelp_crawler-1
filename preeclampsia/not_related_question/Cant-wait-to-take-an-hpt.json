It shouldn't affect your testing :)CLeigh, you could very well be pregnant - nausea, frequent urination, and sometimes slight cramping CAN all be symptoms. It might have just been too early for the test you took to read anything. Since you're currently 4 days late, have you tried another test? If you don't start your period in a few days and your HPT are still coming out negative, the best thing is to go to the doctor - they'll send you for blood tests. If it isn't the result you had hoped, don't worry. It's only your first try and if often takes a few attempts :)momof3 - I hope this is our month too!!!Good luck everyone!!!",

It worked the first time, why not now? And I thought you were supposed be more fertile after a MC? I am so PO'ed right now.It's funny, cause I'm still saying to myself, maybe it's just spotting, and it's not really AF (cause it is just light spotting as of right now) - but that would just be too good to be true.Oh well.....looks we'll be trying again in a little while. My husband is going away on a business trip, but he arranged his schedule to make sure he was home in time for the fertile days. He did it just in case we didn't get pregnant this month. Good thing he had the sense to do that!I hope the rest of you have better luck :)",

This will be my first, whenever it happens.My hubby and I went on long awaited trip to Australia and New Zealand last April, and we had decided to TTC after that. It was kind of like our last big hurrah. We got pregnant the first time we actually tried to time it and everything, but that unfortunately ended in a MC at 12 weeks, which was mid-late August.I was told to wait at least one cycle before TTC again, which we did, but it was agonizing, plus the cycle was about a week longer. So as soon as AF arrived, we tried that month, but it didn't work. So here I am again, on my second cycle since the MC. So really we've only tried once since the MC so it hasn't been that long at all.The worst part about it was that I have 3 friends and we were all due within a few days or weeks of one another. Now they're all getting big and round and I feel left out. (luckily 2 of the 3 live in different provinces so it makes it a LITTLE easier).Anyway, I haven't given up hope yet, although some days I feel like it and wonder is it really worth this roller coaster ride. The other days I get really excited and think, ok this is going to be the month!!Maybe giving it a break will work for me too....but I'll wait until the cycle after this one to try that! ha ha!!!",

My breasts are alittle tender and I feel bloated.. all PMS symptoms but also all symptoms I had 7-8 weeks ago when I was pregnant. I took 3 tests- all negative. I feel like I am losing my mind.\u00a0\u00a0My fiance and I both have 1 eleven year old daughter each from previous marriages and 7 years ago I gave a baby up for adoption because I could not take care of two children on my own and I did not want to have an aboortion .... Now I feel like I am incompetent and unworthy- like I can't or don't deserve to have another kid.... I know I have no right to say this after only one miscarriage and some of you have had several and maybe never had one successful pregnancy... if I offend you I'm sorry I'm just an emotional wreck and I feel like I am apologizing to everyone... my fiance - his family.....I just wish I knew.. the waiting game...\u00a0\u00a0 the anticipation... the absolute fear.\u00a0\u00a0Even if we are successful every week will be scary ... I used to think all\u00a0\u00a0I have to do is get to the 12th week and I see so many people lose the pregnancy even then--- So for right now I am taking prenatals, no caffiene, trying to maintain a good diet and I wish I could fast forward to the day that I either get my period or a BFP so that I can figure out where to go from there.....So back to where I started.... is it true that you can be more fertile after a MC?BTW\u00a0\u00a0some of you amaze me with how strong and positive you are.....if you can't spread the baby dust maybe you can help me there too.",

But today the line was pretty much as dark as the test line,but not darker. I still think that's a good sign, and I considered that a positive. If I go by the later date, I'm only CD14 today, which would seem like things are right on track. So we're very hopeful for this month!!\u00a0\u00a0And yes, hubby got home last Saturday night so we've been BD-ing every other day since then. Yay! And thanks for the fertilityfriend link - it's been quite helpful!! Looking back now, I think last month we were just off on which CD it was, and I'm hoping that's why nothing happened.

(my poor baby.) anyway. i stop bleeding that next day 11/02. when leaving the dr he sent me to go do blood work to check my levels to see if they were at 0 yet. well the dr called the next day and said they were at 0 and i could start trying again in about 3 months and to keep taking my vitamins. well screw that. me and my boo did the due yesterday morning. i don't know if i'm ovulating or not. i just want to have another baby b/c i also heard you r more fertile after a m/c. well i know they say wait after your first cylce to see when you conceive and when your due date is but i'm not worried about that. i just want to have a baby again. i have a 4 year old and that pregnancy went great even considering i broke my knee and had to have surgery at 3 months. it was excellent. i figure i just want to get pregnant again and have a healthy baby and we can wait to get an u/s and it will tell me when i due. but now i see i'm not crazy. there are other people who want a baby just as bad as me probably a little more. that's y i'm so glad i found this link. well good luck to everyone. skies the limit. but know one thing, all this we are going through we are going to get a big bleesing. some will have twins and triplets. i'm telling yall don't give up the victory will be ours. good luck and everyone is in my prayers and i hope im n yalls.",

We did, we tried, it didn't work, so now we're on attempt #2 and currently on the TWW. LIke momof3 said, you definitely might want to try OPK and temping. It will surely help you pinpoint when you O. It most likely won't always be on day 14. I've also noticed that my O date changed since my MC - it's now a little later.Mandy, you might want to try some OPK to help narrow down when you ovulate. After I stopped BC in March earlier this year, it took me 5 weeks for AF to arrive, but went back to 4 weeks after that. As soon as it did, I got pregnant.abraham&sarah - welcome back. Glad you're still here :) How is everything?momof32b - yes I know what you mean!!! Next Friday will seem like an eternity!! Ugh!Good luck everyone!BTW, my hubby is also ready for a break after this go around! I mis-read my AF date, so we started the BD on CD8 and went every other day or so until the CD15, with a few double ups. If it doesn't work this month, he says he wants to take a breather! I never thought I'd hear him say that. I like the idea of him taking a break in the 6 weeks after a baby arrives though....until then I'll milk him for all he's worth! LOL!",

            "answer": "They had no idea what caused me to MC, and that early stage it's hard to find out. In most cases they don't know for sure, but they say it is most likely caused by chromosomal obnormalities. I MC at 12 weeks, although the US revealed that the baby had actually stopped growning at 6 weeks, so it was a missed MC. I was given 3 choices - a D&C, to wait to see if it happened naturally, or a prescription, called misoprostol. I took the misoprostol because it's less invasive but faster than if I has just waited. It took me 5 weeks after that for AF to come, so yes, you're cycle is probably off because of that as well. It's hard I know, but be patient!!! That's what I keep telling myself.BBT stands for Basal Body Temperature. It's a way to track when you've ovulated. Basically you have to take your temperature (get a thermometer especially for that) every morning at the same time. It has to be your resting temperature, so before you get out of bed or anything. You'll get a peak in your temperature AFTER you've ovulated. It'll help you understand your cycle. BUT you might want to use OPK as well, since they'll give you an indication BEFORE you ovulate, so you can time the BD better :) Then the BBT will let you know when you've finished ovulation, and you can just wait.momof32b told me about a great site which has lots of good information on how to do all this, and you can input your info and it helps you track and tells you when your best chances are to conceive etc. It's called fertilityfriend.comGood luck!!",

We decided to wait one cycle, just because our doc recommended it - to give the uterus a chance to heal. That being said, we didn't get pregnant after the first cycle even though we tried.Lots of people take a long time for their body to get back to normal and get pregnant again after a mc.

It was my own insecurity.At this stage, I'll accept whatever God allows.\u00a0\u00a0It takes a lot of energy to be depressed and worried.\u00a0\u00a0I'm casting all of my cares on God and accepting whatever He has for us at this point.My estradiol level wasn't high enough to do the transfer with this cycle. And, my doctor's office shuts down the last two weeks of December.\u00a0\u00a0So if 12 days into the next cycle doesn't come before they shut down, we'll be looking at doing the transfer next year.\u00a0\u00a0We'll see what happens.",

Maybe it was implantation, cause that can happen usually around 7-10 days past conception, and I would probably be about 10 days if it happened. And since you can't get a +ve test before implantation (no hcg yet), maybe that's the reason???See I'm just grasping at straws here now....I want to badly to believe I am pregnant.I mean between the fatigue, and the morning nausea, and the extreme irritability, it's just like the last time I was pregnant. I mean yesterday evening my husband was tesaing me, in a loving sort of way, and I almost ate his head off, and about 5 seconds after that I almost broke into tears. Although it could just be PMS too, I guess, but it's not usually this bad.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm still praying though!!!!",

I thought most women are about 97 - 97.5 prior to ovulation, but with a rise after ovulation, but then dropping again. Since I'm on CD27, shouldn't mine be dropping again? Could this be a sign that I might be pregnant if my temp is still high? Or maybe it's just a wonky temp. (I know it's just one day so far right?)

It doesn't match with my OPK.....but then again, you can have a positive OPK and no ovulate right? Can an infection make your CM not very fertile? Maybe that's what happened.Too many questions, I know! Sorry. I'm just looking for answers, anything, as to why it didn't work this time. At least now I am temping so I should be able to tell if I O this month. AND I'm going to try taking Robitussin to thin out what CM I do have. I\"m just willing to try anything at this point!!! Anyone know how early I should start taking that?Everything just seems to have changed so much since my MC. It's like it's someone elses body.The GOOD thing about all this (look for the silver lining, right?).....my predicted fertile days will be right around DH's birthday - he's happy to hear that :) LOL!Good luck Mandy and unborn on getting your BFP!!momof32b - looking forward to hearing how your kids react at Christmas :)",

It was 97.13. My alarm goes off at 6:15 (that's when I had planned to do all my temping). I slept well from 5:30 until my alarm went off. I took temp again and it was 97.47. Now, which should I use?Similary the following night I woke up at 5:45am, and hadn't slept TOO badly up to that point. My temp was 97.27. Checked again at 6:45 before I got out of bed and it was 97.54.Now this morning I slept pretty well right until my alarm went off at 6:15, and my temp was 97.61 (I did feel really warm this morning.)See, my temps are all over the place. I know it says you should get a good 3 hours of sleep before temping, but good sleep for me is hard to come by. So should I take my temp when I wake up after sleeping restlessly, or take it after the one good hour (almost) I usually get between 5:30 adn 6:15???Too much info I know, but just wondering what your opinion is.

In fact it has been 5 days now that I have had light spotting.\u00a0\u00a0I am not giving up until she knocks on my door...so you don't either ok?\u00a0\u00a0 Tonight my spotting was heavier (meaning I seen a few drops on my panties) and I was crapping for about an hour, but then it went away again.Hubby and I bd'ed tonight so I could kick start AF if that is the case.\u00a0\u00a0If AF doesn't show then I will take it as a good sign.\u00a0\u00a0Bd'ing around the time of AF usually puts her into action.\u00a0\u00a0If she doesn't show, then hubby suggests we retest on Saturday....\u00a0\u00a0I never thought the day would come where I would want to start my period on purpose. I figure if she is going to come, then the sooner the better.\u00a0\u00a0If she isn't then I will be on cloud 9.",
