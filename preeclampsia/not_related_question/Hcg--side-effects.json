They must be confusing it with HGH, which is completely different. Acutally, people who use HGH will often result to taking HCG to restore their male parts to normal and reverse the effects of HGH shrinking them. HCG is used to help establish normalcy to underdeveloped male parts. It does not make you bigger unless it is underdeveloped and by no means should ever make it smaller.It also is confusing that someone posted it would cause men to grow breasts? I have never heard of that before but know that my husband had \"man-boobs\" his whole life even though he was not overweight. With HCG, they are gone....",

I lost 4 inches in 2 weeks and overall two pant sizes. Very noticable.I'm looking forward to a second cycle of it. Plus, there are so many women around here that now want to take it, I'm planning a seminar. So, the side effects will be helpful in discussion. My doctor has been injecting it for 2 years as a maintenance program and so has his wife. Plus, he says in some of his fibromyalgia patients, the hcg has really helped their pain lesson (not in all but in some).Everybody should investigate it for themselves and need to feel good about, wholly, before taking it.One other thing, it was great having a friend take it at the same time. We talked every morning after we weighed. Helped tremendously to have the support.",

I'm a male and this seems typical.\u00a0\u00a0Women may lose a little less. I haven't been doing much in the way of exercise as I fractured my leg just after starting the diet.When you come off the diet, you have flush your body of the HCG.\u00a0\u00a0You do this by eating the same drinking & 500 cal diet for 3 more days while not getting the HCG.\u00a0\u00a0Then you can eat anything you want as long as it doesn't have fats or carbs in it for 3 weeks AND you don't gain or lose more than 2 pounds going above your last lowest weight while on the drops.\u00a0\u00a0Then for the next 3 weeks, you can slowly introduce fats and even more gradually carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Inches and Pounds tells you what to do if you gain too much.\u00a0\u00a0 Follow it it works.It sounds to me like people haven't read the info and are gaining their weight back by going back to normal food right away.\u00a0\u00a0Get the story straight and follow the plan -- read Inches and Pounds.\u00a0\u00a0It does work.After I normalize my weight (after the six weeks) I'll decide if I want to do it once more (you have to wait between series) or if I'll go back to weight loss the more conventional way.Keep in mind that the reason you're doing this is to get rid of the fat cells not just make them smaller as in normal dieting.\u00a0\u00a0 And to reset your metabolism.\u00a0\u00a0 Afterwards, you have to adjust eating habits not to a diet but to a way of life.\u00a0\u00a0Meaning that you give up eating more than you use, get away from fast food, restaurants and processed food, augment it with healthy liquid input (1/2 gallon a day is good) and exercise.IMHO - it works if you work the plan.\u00a0\u00a0This is what I've found.Craig.",

You need to take your body weight, divide it in half and thats the number of ounces of water you need to drink a day. I had been drinking half that, probably, but because I was probably eating 2000-3000 calories a day my body was able to pull enough water from the food that I didn't have such severe dehydration.

And I never experienced headaches, but I drank lots of water. When I was hungry, I drank a cup of water with a few tablespoons of lemon juice (I add a splenda) and ate melba toast and felt fine.Oh yeah and my husband continued doing the diet and lost 50 lbs and had man boobs before he started and ended up with regular pecks.Also, HCG has to be fresh. It has to be stored in a moisture free environment in its powder form, and after its mixed it needs to stay refridgerated and is only good for 30 days.Hope this helps and good luck.",

            "answer": "Concerning your entry on Jan. 26, I can tell you what might be happening. You probably figured it out, but I'll give it anyway. (I am an RN, by the way.) HCG is a hormone that is normally produced by women just after a fertilized egg has implanted in the lining of the uterus. Its job is to keep the endometrial lining intact until the placenta can produce enough estrogen to take over, then hCG production tapers off. In your case, I suspect that hCG is simply keeping the endometrial lining intact beyond when it would have normally disintegrated and discharged (menstruation). In this case it doesn't mean you are pregnant, but is giving you a \"false positive\" by preventing menstruation. Stopping the hCG treatments should result in resumption of your normal cycle. Timing your hCG diet plan to coordinate with your cycle would be better for your peace of mind but otherwise should not be a problem.Side note: Early detection pregnancy kits look for the presence of hCG in the blood or urine as a reliable indication of pregnancy, so obvioiusly if you are on the hCG diet that test will be void. It will give you a positive even if you are not pregnant.",

            "answer": "There are a lot of comments on this particular thread that need clarification. SIde effects can be both negative (headaches) and positive (safe weight loss or hunger suppression). Many 'side effects' reported attributed to hCG during the protocol can be due to the low calorie intake, dehydration, the change to improved food choices, the body 'detoxifying' (the term is used loosely) because of the change to all organic foods, or a combination of the above. Of the many years hCG has been around there have been very few true long lasting negative side effects reported. And actually, none have been reported in decades that have been attributed specifically to the low dose hCG used in the protocol. Some of the things reported in this thread can be alleviated with increased water intake. Side note: drinking a few ozs of pure aloe vera juice/gel with each meal helps with bowel movements better than colace or other medications perscribed. Organic senna tea helps as well. A common side effect to this protocol is dry skin. This is usually temporary and improves on its own towards the end of the protocol. Again, using aloe vera gel helps and is a good skin conditioner but not the best moisturizer. Those of you who get headaches can use tylenol but if the headaches concern you or are unbearable or worse than you have ever experienced, stop the protocol and see your physician. You must be guided by a physician if you are going to utilize the hCG protocol. This is not for everybody.\u00a0\u00a0--DrG",

No loss day 2, but significant loss from days 3 & 4.I consumed huge amounts of caffeine prior to starting HCG (24-40 oz a day of coffee and then soda in the afternoon/evening) so I\u2019m surprised that I don\u2019t have the caffeine with-drawl headaches. I\u2019m drinking 1 cup water upon waking and then 1 cup of black coffee for breakfast, and throughout the day 1 or 2 cups of Oolong tea and LOTS & LOTS of water. The main drawback is spending so much time in the bathroom!Late afternoon/evening have always been the time of day I feel the most hungry, so smelling the dinner the rest of the family is eating is the hardest thing right now. They have all said they want eat the same foods as me (just in larger portions) so that should help\u2026we\u2019ll see how that goes.Day 3 - I was not so sure how I was going to do on this, but seeing the 8.3 lb loss is VERY encouraging.

As far as the hCG protocol being a direct cause for kidney problems I have not heard of any cases. However, if someone dehydrates themselves significantly or eliminates the fruits/veggies and just takes in high protein foods, the potential for kidney problems increase.To All: Hunger is a very subjective and complex issue. The hCG protocol does not \"cure\" hunger but allows for it's suppression in the normal setting. hunger can be triggered by so many things not related to your body requiring nutrition. It can be triggered by smell, sight, and emotional desires. Finding your individual triggers for hunger and minimizing those triggers is helpful. Also, some people are hungry only because they have trained their body to eat for the sake of eating at certain times of the day (or night) and for the sake of eatign certain things. Part of the learning with the protocol is the 'retraining' of your body to eat when it acutually needs the nutrition and to help your body to process foods more efficiently.",

After that vist I sat in my car and cried! But then I made the call to the Dr. that he recommended to help me lose the weight.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor he recommended had also been on the HCG diet and has been successful at losing his weight and has decided to offer the program to his patients.\u00a0\u00a0 That is my goal and after the knee surgery I plan on exercising even more and staying healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I've been on other diets, Jenny Craig (lost 74#) Well 4 Life (lost 54# and then after gaining it again lost it again) along with other diets that I don't need to mention because they may work for others.\u00a0\u00a0I was never able to keep it off.\u00a0\u00a0Remember, it's not a diet, you need to change your life style and the way you eat if you have a weight problem.\u00a0\u00a0Which I never had until I had two kids, got a divorced and remarried but now work in an office WAY too much and way too many late hours! lol....But now with the help of a wonderful DR, getting my thyroid in check, taking off the weight (with the help of HCG, B12 shots, adipex) and the support of my husband and friends and doctor I am losing this weight and feel like I can finally keep it off for good again....\u00a0\u00a0I FEEL GREAT!!!!Do what works for you, but for the right reasons, and under a Doctor's care to be safe.\u00a0\u00a0Be safe and God Bless you all!!CM in AZ",

I am in the military and have a PT test coming up next month. I have to do 2 minutes of pushups, 2 mins situps, and run 2 miles in less than 19 mins. I'm a little worried about how the 500 calorie diet is going to affect my performance. If I don't pass I get in trouble and I don't want that.

Just be smart about it. And move your body. People take all this stuff and pump it into there body thinking it will help. Being smart will help. Telling your self you can control what you do and what how much you eat.. Fact of matter is.. People do not move like we use to ..I have been over weight since kids. No body's fault but my own. Being young and never worried about what my eating habits were.So I have been trying this way that way.. Never got into pumping pills or anything like that to help .. But thought it.Long story short.. My body has changed its shape so my much in the past year it is incredible.. I have always worked out but decided to try something different. Started doing a program extreme hour, hour and 15 every day with on day off,,, started writing down what I eat and guess what... Went from wearing a 16 reg to a 11 jr. in jeans! Gained muscle and now the weight is coming off.... And tons of energy. Hello no pills.. No Hcg.. I wish you all luck with whatever it is you think you need to try. Just be safe and smart about it..

Thus the reason for the low calorie diet.\u00a0\u00a0If you body is burning stored fat for energy you do not need to consume large numbers of calories.Simple as that.\u00a0\u00a0When your body is burning stored fat you are not hungry.There should be no side effects any different than the ones you got when you were pregnant.The bottom line is do your own research.",

            "answer": "Hi. I started my HCG plan 4 days ago counting today (almost midnight).\u00a0\u00a0I had not really thought about the side effects of HCG so I started looking online and stumbled upon this blog and have read almost every post.\u00a0\u00a0What I can tell you is that I have lost about 1.8 kg in those 4 days (about 4 pounds) and I feel pretty good.\u00a0\u00a0If everything works out, I will probably go with only one round, then do the maintenance period (another 21 days) and probably CHANGE my old eating habits to a healthier life style.I'm 27 years old, male, 5'11'', and I have decided to lose weight and get back to \"my old self.\"\u00a0\u00a0I used to weigh 185 lbs about 3 years ago but before I started the program I was 215-217 lbs, size 38 pants.\u00a0\u00a0I have had absolutely NO side effects myself as of yet, and I plan to stick it out.\u00a0\u00a0I do feel pretty hungry throughout the day but I drink as much water as I can.\u00a0\u00a0I am close to drinking one gallon of water a day and during weekdays I drink two 24 oz cups of decaf coffee to try to suppress the hunger (I've never drank any type of coffee before that, but decaf is working fine).\u00a0\u00a0In fact, my hunger has gone down considerably from the first day I started to today (right now I am king of hungry though, but that's probably because it's midnight and my last meal was at 7:45 PM).My mom purchased the HCG product in powder form and she started taking it before me.\u00a0\u00a0I take 22 mL orally every morning 30 minutes prior to my first meal, and at night after my last meal (as directed).\u00a0\u00a0My mom started cheating a few days into the diet and now she pretty much quit.\u00a0\u00a0She did so because she couldn't handle her hunger/cravings and that's pretty unfortunate.\u00a0\u00a0But for the 30 days or so that she was in the plan (1st round + half) she did lose quite a lot of weight and several size inches.\u00a0\u00a0Her skin did not hang and her face looked very good (unlike other 500 k diets that stretch your skin to your bones).\u00a0\u00a0I don't plan to drop the diet in any case because I think of it as only a 6 week thing and 6 weeks go faster than anything else.\u00a0\u00a0I also take a multivitamin supplement every day to make sure that I'm OK on that end.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I do feel slightly more energized every day and that has been an added plus, but I'm sure it's the HCG (from what other people have posted).The last thing I would mention is that while my mom did her 30 day course, she did not have any side effects.\u00a0\u00a0And the one thing that convinced me to start on the HCG diet was the fact that I saw her with my own eyes lose all the weight that she did.\u00a0\u00a0As I mentioned earlier, it's a pitty that she gave up on it so soon (two days ago, actually), and I am still trying to convince her to at least enter a maintenance period before she dwells back into 'old habits.'\u00a0\u00a0I plan to exercise at least 30 minutes a day in the upcoming days (today I did 35 mins. of bicycle), but first I wanted to see how I felt with just consuming 500 k/day.Many thanks to everyone for all the posts, some have added insight, others confidence, others 'things to watch out for', good recommendations, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I will keep posting soon.--e.",

In other words, it's not the hCG, it's the diet. Further, there was no comparable difference in fat loss between hCG and placebo, and no comparable difference in feeling hungry between hCG and placebo. Listen, I value the idea of finding a great method that works, and understand and even agree with the idea that there may be some conspiracy or something preventing real weight loss drugs or methods being approved by the government, but it only takes a little bit to do the research yourself. Stop wasting money on the hCG and just go on the caloric restriction diet (taking vitamin supplements along with, of course).

            "answer": "While I do appreciate the post about the scientific research, I did educated myself and my 100+ friends, family and acquaintances did too. We are not a bunch of uninformed beanheads who ignored the studies. I myself found numerous problems with many of those clinical trials, as would anyone in the medical community with experience in clinical trials.Unfortunately, I have been on many diets that did not \"work\", that is...if I could have stuck with them, I may have had some weight loss, but I was either faint, irritable or had too many cravings to fight it. I have been on Releana for 10 days with a very low calorie diet. I have not been hungry, had any cravings, my mood is excellent, and as of this morning, I have lost 10.1 pounds.In those clinical trials, I cannot vouch for the type of hCG they used, where they procured it, the efficacy of their particular hCG, etc. I can only use my experience to describe my results.Yup, a VLCD will produce great results, if you can live through it, but that in itself is not an answer the the lifestyle change that goes along with taking hCG in the Simeons Pounds and Inches protocol, and most of the research has little to nothing to do with sublingual Releana. The VLCD is only one part of the success of Releana. It requires a lifestyle change, and give the blueprint to do it, while suppressing appetite and lifting mood. Everyone is different and must make their own choice. Personally, I don't see how anyone could have a viable opinion about Releana unless they tried it themselves. Of course, we can have opinions about things we don't try...it just makes them less credible. I didn't think it would work either. I was wrong. It does. I do not care if anyone thinks otherwise; now that I am doing it, I can tell you, it works for me. When I read posts from naysayers on this discussion board and others, I remember, I used to be one too. And I wouldn't take the opinion of anyone but myself now. I don't want to try to convince anyone of anything. I am only talking about my experience, and not theoretical or hypothetical or anything else data. I am constantly amazed at the negativity of people who haven't tried it and at the same time am amazed at the success of the 100+ people I know who it has worked for. Again...I am talking about Releana only, not homeopathic, not injectable, not the stuff from China or India available online. Appreciate the comments, but I know what I know, and do not see why anyone cares what I or anyone else is doing. I mean, it's my money, and my time, right? If I am a fool, then it isn't affecting anyone else, and at least I am speaking from personal experience. Why on earth would anyone else care what I wear, what I drive, what I watch on TV, or my method of dieting? I certainly am not affected by your choice of diet, and you aren't affected by mine. I am not wishing to sound angry here, and email is not effective at expressing mood, but just from a common sense viewpoint...if what I or anyone else does isn't affecting you, then why bother to post your negative and uninformed by personal experience view? It's pretty arrogant. But I do appreciate your passion, and if you do find an alternative that works this well, I hope you try it and report back, cos Releana is darned expensive! Thanks!",

You can order from the internet and its coming from Bombay or China; you can get Releana, which is patented and FDA approved for sublinguals, you can use homeopathic hCG. They are all different, they all have their risks and side effects, and you need to post what exactly you are doing before you condemn ALL hCG. That is like saying if you get nauseous on aspirin, that everyone should avoid all painkillers. I am on day 14 on Releana, under a doctors care, I have lost 12 lbs with NO hunger and NO negative side effects. There is nothing wrong whatsoever with stating your opinion, regarding your own experience, but to give a blanket yea or nay to 6 billion people on the earth strictly due to your experience is arrogant and inappropriate. The subject here is side effects and I do thank you for mentioning you had nausea. That is the first indication to me that you were taking either the wrong dose, injecting incorrectly and certainly not under a doctors care, or it would have been corrected. I am going to suppose you were taking a wrong dose or had a bad batch of hCG. By the way, I do not sell or profit in any way from hCG. It is just common sense that if millions of people are using it successfully that your experience is unique and you apparently did little to solve it. You should not have lost muscle at all. That is what would happen if you were NOT taking hCG. This leads me to believe that your hCG was fake, as are many on the internet.",

My metabolism is set at a number on the scale and if I gain 2 pounds I follow the directions to get it back down. This is something that does take determination -knowing that in 30 days you will be 25-30 pounds lighter. I do not feel like eating as much. I did not exercise while on the diet, but know that I need to do some walking or exercises to firm up- this does not magically happen by itself.\u00a0\u00a0Drops to me are better than getting shots everyday....",

Howver, this does not mean there is not one becuase of other reasons not related to the hCG shots. See your doctor asap to discuss your concerns.ALL: Common reasons for headaches on the protocol include dehydration, hCG purchsed on line that is questionable, a stavation state that exists because of improper dosing of hCG or antibodies in your system to the hCG. Those are a few of the many reasons for headahces that can persist on the protocol.

My friends and I started a support/networking group in our town so we can talk about our experiences. This diet will be slightly different for everyone. My friends and I are approaching the diet as a lifestyle change. We are taking vitamins, adrenal support, mastergland support and collotrim. These all support the diet in a positive manner. It is important to get all the vitamins and nutrients while on the diet in order to keep up energy. My only suggestion about being tempted to cheat is to keep busy. Find something to take your mind off food. This has been a challenge for me but has also given me the opportunity to get my house organized. Focusing on the main goal is very important. I lost 35 pounds my first 40 day round and 15 my second 40- day round. THe second round, I was not as focused and felt like a failure, but I soon realized that I am only human and waited four weeks in order to get my commitment back to the diet. It works and if you are experiencing headaches, it is only normal and it is becuase your body is detoxifying from all the bad stuff you put in your body. Psyllium hulls are a huge asset to pull out toxins from your body. I take some every morning. I only had a headache one day and have not experienced it with the second or third rounds. I wish you luck and remember to follow the protocol. This diet works, but you must follow the guidelines and not deviate. Lastly, drink water and when you think you drank enough water, drink two more glasses. Best of luck.",

All that should be evaluated. The hCG protocol is safe but is not for everyone. It is simple but strict. Most traditionally trained doctors will disregard the protocol because they do not know the protocol and only see it as a \"500 calorie diet.\" It goes way beyond being a very low calorie diet. Find a physician who is either willing to learn about the protocol or already knows it. Do the things you already know are smart: wathc your portions, exercise (even if it is a little), eat whole foods, and ensure you get a full metabolic and nutritional evaluation!",

It enables the body to eat the right kind of fat.\u00a0\u00a0That's the third kind of fat, the \"locked fat\" which it burns first.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Simeon explains that there is three kinds of fat.\u00a0\u00a0The fat around your vital organs, joints, etc. The stored fat which your body uses or burns for energy and third the locked fat.\u00a0\u00a0This locked fat is normally the last to be burned and it's this fat that makes you obese.\u00a0\u00a0This is the main reason why on other diets you can quickly gain the weight back. We noticed that we didn't gain any of the weight back between treatments or after.\u00a0\u00a0Sure, you can gain the weight back if you go back to your old ways of eating, but what the diet does is helps you change your eating habits as well.\u00a0\u00a0Go on a 500 calorie diet and see if you can last more than 7 days.\u00a0\u00a0It's pretty difficult.\u00a0\u00a0With HCG, we never felt hungry and even had trouble eating the 500 calories during the diet.So, is this true or fiction?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you'll never know unless you try it yourself.\u00a0\u00a0But, I would say that everyone is different and has different health issues.\u00a0\u00a0I would highly recommend you do this through a knowledgable doctor who can monitor your progress and your vitals. The other reason is that you need to be careful where you get the HCG.\u00a0\u00a0It has to be kept dry and cold.\u00a0\u00a0The Doctor we use get's it in powder form and we mix it and put it in the frig during use.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, I use to take blood pressure medicine and now I don't.

            "answer": "Hi, I heard about hcg from my friend who let the cat out of the bag, because she lost a lot of wt in like three months about 34lbs. She told me all the logistics and I read the ebook. I am 32 and wt 140. I had a surgery in june 08(was 124lbs), I had abdominoplasty(to fix a hernia and spacing of 1+\"), breast lift(since I was already there), and a small amount of lipo (Dr insisted). Right after the surgery I had an panic attack because my body was going into shock. The docs said my heart was fine even though I felt tightness and SOB. Sometimes if I do too much my heart feels strained. I gained twenty pounds because I coundn't exercise for two years. I have started an routine (BFL) every day now for 15-20 mins for a month now, and have tol well (lost 9lbs). Although for mothers day my hub helped me have three orgasms (bless his soul!) and I have been having some feelings of a strained heart again, today I felt tingling in my left arm and heat in my chest, which lasted 20mins, and went away after I drank H2O. The surgeon says my symptoms are unrelated to surgery, even though I have never had this prob before. Anyway I have no Insur so I can't even check. I wanted to start the hcg, within the next three weeks, given my history should I not? I heard it could strenghten my heart and help with healing, I have had five children and remember how good I felt dur preg.",

It is not clear if you had an allergic reaction to hCG or a filler/impurity compound in your online purchase.I am not a fan of the oral hCG drops. They just are not as effective as the injection form.\u00a0\u00a0It is well known that the bioavailability (blood levels AND medication affect on cells) of the oral drops are not as consistent as the injection. There is a dissolvable tablet that is being developed that shows promise as an alternative to the injection. It has been shown to have a similar bioavailable profile as the hCG injection. Whatever the case, NEVER get a medicaiton online without a physician's direction and ALWAYS be under a physician's care when doing the hCG protocol.",

But now there is like a puberty boom at 5th and 6th, and correct me if I am wrong but doesnt this have to be linked to all the growth hormones injected in to our foods. What can you do to prevent from your kids hitting puberty so early so they can have a proper childhood and the stages afterword?",
