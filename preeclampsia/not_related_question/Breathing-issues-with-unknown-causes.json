            "answer": "Wow. That sounds suspicious of something else being wrong. I'm not a doctor so I wouldn't know what exactly. But some of the breathing issues,hyperventilation,sweating.. etc.. can be caused from a growing baby. I've experienced that (also a severe asthmatic) at the end of my first pregnancy. It was horrible and scary. Almost felt like I was suffocating but I was 35 wks by then and they agreed to finally induce me a week later. I hope everything gets resolved as quickly and safely for you though. Although delivery probably won't be an option at 28 wks. Ill keep you in my prayers.",

Also a nurse told me the dizziness and vertigo feeling were due to your center of gravity changing as baby gets bigger. If you are really concerned you can call your dr to be safe! Good luck!",

            "answer": "Thanks guys!I don't know if it's preeclampsia but that might be something to check out. My blood pressure has been great but I see some of the other symptoms and it's worth checking out, thanks! So far everyone has said the baby is doing great. And yes I'm staying well hydrated, can't stand not having ice water nearby all the time.. I've got another Dr's appt Tuesday and I'm hoping for some answers. I'm seriously wondering if it's something with my spine. There are so many nerve endings there that help to regulate the body and it's been in severe pain lately. Even locking up. I just don't know and my Dr's seem to just want to push it off. The breathlessness is at least every 2 hours a day. It will get worse with caffeine... I'm in morning over my daily coffee.",

            "answer": "Thanks again everyone... The doctor on Tuesday said that with all my test coming in normal she truly suspected that the breathlessness and dizziness was just because of the pregnancy. She also prescribed an anti-depressant saying \"I don't think you\u2019re depressed but sometimes the pregnancy can cause certain chemical changes in the body\"... You know what??!! I'm on the 2nd day of this anti-depressant (Citalopram) and I've only had the breathlessness ONCE!! Normally it would be about every 2 hours. So all I can figure is that I was physically almost in a panic state even though mentally I felt fine. Also, my sleeping seems to be more sound... I feel more like \"me\" again!! The doctor did say there's a good chance that I might be having this baby early, so I\u2019m hoping the less stress my body is in, the better. (Although, I hate being on drugs, chances might even be better on this medication for a healthy child, then for a baby in a \u201chostile\u201d womb... at least that's what I'm praying!) Baby is fine, kicking around as I type.",

    "question": "I\u2019m a \u201chealthy\u201d 28 year old woman. I\u2019m currently 28 weeks along in my second pregnancy and I\u2019ve never had any complications. I\u2019ve had a history of asthma and panic attacks but have been symptom and medication free for about 7 years now. For the past 2.5 months of this pregnancy I\u2019ve been having breathing issues with hyperventilation, dizziness, lightheadedness and vertigo. I work full time at a call center and I\u2019m required to be on the phones answering calls and speaking with customers 8 hours a day. My job is at stake with these issues because I can\u2019t speak if I can\u2019t breathe. The issues can start when lying down (more often on my side) or after a period of aerobic activity (like house cleaning). I\u2019ve had PFT, chest x-rays, ultrasounds on my legs (for clots) and an ultrasound on my heart. All perfectly normal. They prescribed me with hydroxyzine to help me distress but it\u2019s not fixing the breathing issues. I even had a test to check my thyroid and it\u2019s functioning fine. Other symptoms: sleeping issues (even b4 pregnancy), sweating and intolerance to heat, swelling of legs, pains in back/neck/legs (up to 6 of 10), and fatigue. Could this be something neurological?? Could the baby be putting major strain on my spine?? I\u2019m carrying this baby very low and more on the right side of my body. Any ideas can help and I know to expect some of this as normal pregnancy but not to the degree where I can\u2019t stand or talk! Thanks in advance!",
